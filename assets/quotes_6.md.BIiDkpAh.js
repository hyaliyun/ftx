New York City: RoutledgeCurzon, 2005. p. 26. The split in the Sudanese Communist Party was provoked by the Sino-Soviet split. Whilst the Sudanese Communist Party leadership supported participating in Central Council election under the regime of Ibrahim Abboud in 1963, the faction that created the Revolutionary Leadership rejected electoral politics and called for armed struggle. Some of the founders of the new party had been expelled from the Sudanese Communist Party after accusing the party general secretary for misappropriation of funds provided by the Soviet embassy. Others had left voluntarily.Communists in Government - Party Leader under Arrest The Revolutionary Leadership was led by Yusuf Abd' al-Majid. On November 12, 1965 the Sudanese Communist Party denounced the Revolutionary Leadership as an 'agent organization', citing Chinese interference. The Revolutionary Leadership sent a delegation to the 1966 5th Party Congress of the Party of Labour of Albania. The Communist Party - Revolutionary Leadership failed to gain a mass following. By 1966 the party had split into three factions, \\"A\\", \\"B\\" and \\"C\\". The party called for boycott of the 1968 elections. After the May 25, 1969 coup, state repression virtually paralyzed the workings of all the remnants of the party. Commenting on the post-coup repression the Chinese news agency Hsinhua stated that \\"[j]ust as the Soviet Social-Imperialists abandoned the heroic Greek freedom fighters to the Hitlerite dictatorial rule of the royalist-fascist runnings dogs of U.S. imperialism, so they have now delivered the militant elements of the Revolutionary Leaders factions of the Sudan Communist Party into the hands of the depraved Nimeiry\\".

It is restricted to a small area of Central Africa. It was formerly classified as a subspecies of Jameson's firefinch (L. rhodopareia) but is now often treated as a separate species. Its alternative name commemorates Anton Reichenow, the German ornithologist who described this species. Description It is 10‚Äì11 centimetres long. The male is mostly bright pinkish-red, darker on the upperparts. The crown and nape are grey and the vent is dark. The thick, conical bill is grey and the legs and feet are also grey. Females are similar to males but are slightly duller, paler and browner. Juveniles are brown above and buff below with a pinkish-red rump. The birds have dry, trilling calls. Jameson's firefinch is similar but lacks the grey crown and nape and does not overlap in range. The rock firefinch (L. sanguinodorsalis) is also similar but has grey only on the crown and its bill has a pale grey patch at the base of the lower mandible. Distribution and habitat The bird is endemic to the East Sudanian Savanna ecoregion. It occurs in south-west Chad where it is fairly common and north- east Cameroon where it is rare. It inhabits on grasslands, and rocky hillsides in areas of arid savannah with tall grass. Little is known about the behaviour of this species. They breed during the wet season.

The Standard Commands for Programmable Instruments (SCPI; often pronounced \\"skippy\\") defines a standard for syntax and commands to use in controlling programmable test and measurement devices, such as automatic test equipment and electronic test equipment.SCPI-1999 Specification; SCPI Consortium.  Overview  SCPI was defined as an additional layer on top of the specification \\"Standard Codes, Formats, Protocols, and Common Commands\\".ni.com - History of GPIB - Developer Zone The standard specifies a common syntax, command structure, and data formats, to be used with all instruments. It introduced generic commands (such as \`CONFigure\` and \`MEASure\`) that could be used with any instrument. These commands are grouped into subsystems. SCPI also defines several classes of instruments. For example, any controllable power supply would implement the same \`DCPSUPPLY\` base functionality class. Instrument classes specify which subsystems they implement, as well as any instrument-specific features. The physical hardware communications link is not defined by SCPI. While it was originally created for the IEEE-488.1 (GPIB) bus, SCPI can also be used with RS-232, RS-422, Ethernet, USB, VXIbus, HiSLIP, etc. SCPI commands are ASCII textual strings, which are sent to the instrument over the physical layer (e.g., IEEE-488.1). Commands are a series of one or more keywords, many of which take parameters. In the specification, keywords are written \`CONFigure\`: The entire keyword can be used, or it can be abbreviated to just the uppercase portion. Responses to query commands are typically ASCII strings. However, for bulk data, binary formats can be used. The SCPI specification consists of four volumes: Volume 1: \\"Syntax and Style\\", Volume 2: \\"Command Reference\\", Volume 3: \\"Data Interchange Format\\", Volume 4: \\"Instrument Classes\\". The specification was originally released as non-free printed manuals, then later as a free PDF file. =SCPI history= First released in 1990, SCPI originated as an additional layer for IEEE-488. IEEE-488.1 specified the physical and electrical bus, and IEEE-488.2 specified protocol and data format, but neither specified instrument commands. Different manufacturers, and even different models, of the same type of instrument would use different command sets. SCPI created a standard which could be common across all manufacturers and models. It requires use of the IEEE-488.2 data formats, but does not mandate the IEEE-488.1 bus. In 2002-2003, the SCPI Consortium voted to become part of the IVI Foundation (Interchangeable Virtual Instruments). =IEEE 488.2 history= In 1987, IEEE introduced IEEE 488.2-1987 specification \\"Standard Codes, Formats, Protocols, and Common Commands\\", it was later revised in 1992 as IEEE 488.2-1992. While IEEE 488.2 provided a device-independent syntax, there was still no standard for instrument-specific commands. Commands to control the same class of instrument, e.g., multimeters, would vary between manufacturers and even models. The United States Air Force,Project Mate in 1985 and later Hewlett-Packard, recognized this problem. In 1989, HP developed their TML language which was the forerunner to SCPI. The IEC developed their own standards in parallel with the IEEE, with IEC 60625-2-1993 (IEC 625). In 2004, the IEEE and IEC combined their respective standards into a \\"dual logo\\" IEEE/IEC standard IEC 60488-2-2004, Part 2: Codes, Formats, Protocols and Common Commands, replaces IEEE 488.2-1992 and IEC 60625-2-1993.  Command syntax  SCPI commands to an instrument may either perform a set operation (e.g. switching a power supply on) or a query operation (e.g. reading a voltage). Queries are issued to an instrument by appending a question-mark to the end of a command. Some commands can be used for both setting and querying an instrument. For example, the data-acquisition mode of an instrument could be set by using the \`ACQuire:MODe\` command or it could be queried by using the \`ACQuire:MODe?\` command. Some commands can both set and query an instrument at once. For example, the \`*CAL?\` command runs a self-calibration routine on some equipment, and then returns the results of the calibration. Similar commands are grouped into a hierarchy or \\"tree\\" structure. For example, any instruction to read a measurement from an instrument will begin with \\"\`MEASure\`\\". Specific sub-commands within the hierarchy are nested with a colon (\`:\`) character. For example, the command to \\"Measure a DC voltage\\" would take the form \`MEASure:VOLTage:DC?\`, and the command to \\"Measure an AC current\\" would take the form \`MEASure:CURRent:AC?\`. :MEASure :VOLTage :DC? :AC? :CURRent :DC? :AC? ... =Abbreviating commands= The command syntax shows some characters in a mixture of upper and lower case. Abbreviating the command to only sending the upper case has the same meaning as sending the upper and lower case command. For example, the command ‚Äú\`SYSTem:COMMunicate:SERial:BAUD 2400\`‚Äù would set an RS-232 serial communications interface to 2400 bit/s. This could also alternatively be abbreviated ‚Äú\`SYST:COMM:SER:BAUD 2400\`‚Äù. The query command ‚Äú\`SYSTem:COMMunicate:SERial:BAUD?\`‚Äù or ‚Äú\`SYST:COMM:SER:BAUD?\`‚Äù would instruct the instrument to report its current baud rate. = Concatenating commands = Multiple commands can be issued to an instrument in a single string. They are made of simple commands separated by a semicolon character (\`;\`). For example, the command to \\"Measure a DC voltage then measure an AC current\\" would be issued as \`MEASure:VOLTage:DC?;:MEASure:CURRent:AC?\`. Simple commands which start with a colon (\`:\`) are interpreted with respect to the root of the command tree. Otherwise, they refer implicitly to the last node of the previous command (unless they already begin with an asterisk). For example, :SOURce:FREQuency:STARt 100;STOP 200 is a shorthand for the message :SOURce:FREQuency:STARt 100;:SOURce:FREQuency:STOP 200 =Arguments= Some commands require an additional argument. Arguments are given after the command, and are separated by a space. For example, the command to set the trigger mode of an instrument to \\"normal\\" may be given as \\"\`TRIGger:MODe NORMal\`\\". Here, the word \\"\`NORMal\`\\" is used as the argument to the \\"\`TRIGger:MODe\`\\" command. =Integers arguments= For commands that accept integer arguments, values may be specified in multiple computer number formats: decimal, hexadecimal, octal, binary. The last three formats are defined by IEEE 488.2, which SCPI is based upon. Decimal numbers (radix 10) aren't prefixed, hexadecimal numbers (radix 16) are prefixed with \`#H\` or \`#h\`, octal numbers (radix 8) with \`#Q\` or \`#q\`, and binary numbers (radix 2) with \`#B\` or \`#b\`. Hexadecimal digits may use either uppercase letters (ABCDEF), or lowercase letters (abcdef), or mixed case letters (aBcDeF). For octal, the letter \\"Q\\" was chosen instead of the letter \\"O\\" to minimize the visual confusion with the number \\"0\\" (zero). The following argument examples are numerically equivalent: * Decimal: \`26\` * Hexadecimal: \`#H1A\` or \`#h1a\` * Octal: \`#Q32\` or \`#q32\` * Binary: \`#B11010\` or \`#b11010\`  See also  * IEEE-488 (GPIB) * Virtual Instrument Software Architecture (VISA) * Instrument Driver * List of TCP and UDP port numbers - scpi-raw on TCP port 5025 and UDP port 5025 References External links * , official website ;Specifications * SCPI-1999 Specification, Volume 1-4, free, 819 page PDF file. * IEEE 488.2-1992 Specification, USD$44 cost, available as PDF file. * IEEE/IEC 60488-2-2004 Specification, USD$332 cost, available as PDF file. ;Test Equipment SCPI Examples * Keysight InfiniiVision 2000 X-Series Oscilloscopes Programmer's Guide, 938 page PDF file.

It was founded following a meeting in Newcastle upon Tyne in 1876 featuring American temperance activist \\"Mother\\" Eliza Stewart. Margaret Eleanor Parker, a founding member, served as its first president. The next president was Clara Lucas Balfour. Margaret Bright Lucas, who toured with Stewart during these meetings, succeeded as BWTA president in 1878. The BWTA achieved greater success under her successor, Lady Henry Somerset, but ultimately British temperance was destined to achieve less than its American counterpart. Lady Henry was succeeded by Rosalind Howard, Countess of Carlisle, known as \\"The Radical Countess\\" for her opposition to alcohol consumption. Lucas was however, an important link in the Anglo- American women's reform networks as well as being a pioneer in British women's temperance. Early years The BWTA was organized at Newcastle-on-Tyne in 1876, under the lead of Parker, of Dundee, Scotland, as the result of interest in the Woman's Temperance Crusade in the United States. Parker was chosen president, and in 1877, Balfour, succeeded by Lucas. In 1885, the association was affiliated to the World Woman's Christian Temperance Union (WWCTU), of which body Lucas was the first president. The pledge of the BWTA was, \\"I promise by God's help to abstain from all intoxicating drinks, and to try to induce others to do the same.\\" In the year 1893-94, 1,500 meetings were held by members of the National Executive Committee, and 2,000 in all were reported to headquarters; 300 new societies were formed; 8,500,000 pages of literature were issued, including the organ, The Women's Signal, which had a circulation of 16,271 per week.

A. ; Temperance Legions; Evangelistic; Bible Lessons and Study : Unfermented Wine at the Sacrament; Preventive; Social Purity; Social; Drawing-Room Meetings; Facts: Educational; Health and Hygiene; Adult Schools; High Schools and Private Schools; Legal; Brewster Sessions; Police Matrons; Women as Poor Law Guardians; Members of School Boards, etc.; Work Among Women Municipal Voters; Political; Literature and Press; Inebriate Women; Native Races; Traveling. The Association supports a whiteribbon (publishing) company, an industrial farm home, a retreat for inebriate women, St. Mary's Training Home for Girls Alpha House, a preventive and rescue home. A Scotch Christian Union of the British Women's Temperance Association was organized in 1876. History The Temperance Fountain was erected by members and friends of the BWTA. The BWTA ran many successful and lively girls' groups, known as Y-branches (for youth). These were often associated with Methodist and other non-conformist churches, and organised all kinds of activities as well as weekly meetings. One of their most successful was a \\"Masque of Noble Women\\", which was performed by dozens of branches all over Britain from 1915. A box of costumes was bought and lent out to branches along with copies of the script. Probably modelled on the suffragette \\"Pageant of Great Women\\", it featured popular heroines including Florence Nightingale, Queen Victoria, Boadicea and Elizabeth Barrett Browning. BWTA women often wore white ribbons as a symbol of the Temperance cause, and thus their organ was named the White Ribbon. In 2004, the organisation was re-named the White Ribbon Association.

Career Chris Tyle (at microphone with trumpet) leading a combo in the French Quarter, 1993 Tyle grew up in a musical family. His father, Axel Tyle (1912‚Äì1981), was a jazz drummer and member of the Portland, Oregon-based Castle Jazz Band. Tyle's first musical job was with Don Kinch's Conductors Ragtime (1976‚Äì1979). Kinch (1917‚Äì2011), played with Axel Tyle in the Castle Jazz Band in the late 1940s, and went on to work with the Turk Murphy Jazz Band and the Firehouse Five Plus Two. In 1979 Tyle played and recorded with the Turk Murphy Jazz Band in San Francisco, then returned to Portland to form a swing music band named Wholly Cats (named after a number written and recorded by Benny Goodman and Count Basie). The band was a popular fixture on the Portland scene from 1979‚Äì1984, releasing an album in 1982. After disbanding the group's vocalist and guitarist, Rebecca \\"Becky\\" Kilgore, went on to become a popular freelance artist and has made many recordings and festival appearances. Tyle moved to New Orleans in 1989, immediately becoming an in-demand performer with a number of groups, including Steve Pistorius's Mahogany Hall Stompers, Jacques Gauthe's Creole Rice Jazz Band, and John Gill's Dixieland Serenaders . He also worked with jazz greats Danny Barker (guitar) and Albert \\"Pud\\" Brown (clarinet/sax). In 1992 Tyle formed the Silver Leaf Jazz Band working six nights-a-week at the Royal Sonesta Hotel on Bourbon Street. In 2002 Tyle returned to the Pacific Northwest to pursue a freelance career. He currently performs regularly with the Titanic Jazz Band of Los Angeles, Combo DeLuxe of Seattle/Tacoma, and regularly \\"subs\\" with Bob Schulz' Frisco Jazz Band of San Francisco. He also frequently performs in Europe, most notably with the Gambit Jazzmen of England. In 2006 he became a member of the orchestra for the musical A la Recherche de Jos√©phine (Looking for Josephine), directed and written by J√©r√¥me Savary, and starring Nicolle Rochelle. The show ran for six months in 2006-2007 at the Op√©ra-Comique in Paris, France, and has subsequently toured in France, and performed in Vienna, the United States, and Lebanon. Tyle has made over 50 recordings with a variety of groups, including eight with his Silver Leaf Jazz Band. A song from his Silver Leaf Jazz Band album The Smiler (Stomp Off) was used in the PBS documentary Jazz. Another Silver Leaf Jazz Band album, New Orleans Wiggle (Jazzology), received the highest rating in the Penguin Guide to Jazz on CD 2003, one of only ten recordings in the book to receive this rating. In addition to musical performance, Tyle is a writer and educator. He has written many articles and is a contributor to Jazz Standards. He is a member of the International Association of Jazz Educators and the Jazz Journalists Association. Tyle moved to France in October 2015 and retired from full-time performance, due in part to a medical condition known as essential tremor which is exacerbated in performance situations. He continues to play cornet at home.

He played First-Class cricket for four counties as a right- arm fast-medium bowler and lower-order right-handed batsman, and later served as chief executive of Lancashire; while he also had a substantial career as a professional footballer, where he played in goal. He was born in East Didsbury, Manchester. Cricket Much of Jim Cumbes's early cricket career was limited by his full-time involvement in League football. He made his Lancashire debut against Worcestershire in late August 1963. In a game ruined by bad weather, only 55 overs were possible, although in this time Cumbes did manage to take his maiden First-Class wicket, that of Worcestershire captain Don Kenyon. However, it was to be almost three years before he played another First-Class match, and when that came (against Kent) his 4‚Äì42 was rather overshadowed by Derek Underwood's outstanding return of 6‚Äì9 for Lancashire's opponents. Moving to Surrey for the 1968 season, Cumbes at last managed a long run in the side, and took 54 wickets at 17.68 including 6‚Äì35 against Oxford University and 6‚Äì47 against Hampshire. He was rather less successful the following year, and did not play First-Class cricket at all in 1970, although he did appear in two John Player League games. For 1971 Cumbes returned to Lancashire, but played only for two months between mid-May and mid-July due to football commitments. Partially due to business interests he moved to Worcestershire. Here he stayed for the best part of a decade with reasonable success, especially in 1977 when he claimed 51 wickets and produced his best innings bowling of 6‚Äì24 against Yorkshire to help his side to an innings victory. He was capped by the county the following year, an award heralded by Wisden 1978, who commented on the player's great popularity. By now playing a great deal of one-day cricket, Cumbes's final year as a player, 1982, was spent with his fourth county, Warwickshire, for whom he took 21 wickets, the last of these being Middlesex and England wicket-keeper Paul Downton. During the season, he suffered a punctured lung during the Sunday League match at Grace Road from which he rapidly recovered. He was a long serving Chief Executive of Lancashire County Cricket Club, having held the post from 1998 to 2012. On the pitch, during his tenure the team flattered to deceive until, forced by financial austerity to depend on local players, in 2011 they won the County Championship outright for the first time since 1934. Off the pitch, Old Trafford had become run down and an anachronism in the world of 21st century stadia. Cumbes led the fight against billionaire Albert Gubay and his commercial interests that tried to derail the ‚Äì now well advanced ‚Äì redevelopment of the ground. Cumbes said of his time as Chief Executive: \\"In terms of achievement and satisfaction, I think sowing the seeds of the redevelopment in 2003, and then seeing it through with everyone else associated at the club, has given me the most satisfaction. At no stage was the process easy, and at times the difficulties almost overwhelmed us. But everyone stuck at it. We had no alternative, no Plan B.\\"Lancashire chief executive Jim Cumbes retires after 50-year career in professional sport Retrieved 26 December 2012 Football Cumbes enjoyed a varied professional football career as a goalkeeper with Tranmere Rovers, West Bromwich Albion, Aston Villa and Southport. All in all, he appeared in 376 Football League appearances in a 13-year career. He also played football in the North American Soccer League for the Portland Timbers, where he played against Pel√©. During the 1970s, the eloquent Cumbes cemented his popularity as Aston Villa's goalkeeper by presenting a series of shows on BBC Local Radio in the West Midlands.

Life and career  After graduating from Chulalongkorn University in 1959, he worked for the Thai government, preparing English translations of official manuals. His skill in English and his familiarity with the Thai governmental structure gained him employment with the United States Information Service in Bangkok as a writer and researcher. In 1962, he won a Fulbright-Hayes Scholarship to study for the master's degree in sociology at the University of Kansas. At that point, one would not have predicted that he would one day lead student demonstrators to rip the brazen eagle from the gate of the U.S. Embassy on Wireless Road, as he did following the Mayaguez incident. After receiving the M.A., Boonsanong returned to Thailand where he joined the staff of Thammasat University as a lecturer in sociology. In 1967 he returned to the U.S. and spent five extremely productive years there. He completed a Ph.D. in sociology at Cornell University, published several articles, spent a year at Harvard University and another year as Visiting Professor at the University of Hawai'i. By the time of his return to Thailand in 1972, he had established himself as an internationally recognized scholar in his field. It was a record that few of his colleagues in Thailand could equal, including those who were many years his senior. Back at Thammasat University in June 1972, he immediately became one of the university's leading activists. This was a time of general intellectual ferment. Boonsanong was in his element, writing papers, attending meetings, carrying out research, organizing and lecturing to hundreds of rapt and enthusiastic young people. The student movement which was to overthrow the military dictatorship in the 1973 uprising was beginning and Thammasat was its epicenter. Assassination Dr. Boonsanong Punyodyana was assassinated by gunshot at about 1:30 a.m. on 28 February 1976. At the time of his death, he was the Secretary-General of the Socialist Party of Thailand. There is little doubt that his death was politically motivated. Since few among Thailand's ruling elite regretted his passing, not many expected his murderers to be apprehended. He was survived by his wife and two daughters.

Career Senter was born in Plato, Missouri, and his first Hollywood ambition was to become a Disney animator. After he sent his portfolio of drawings to Disney at the age of seventeen, the company called to tell him they were impressed but were not currently hiring, and he should resubmit in another six months. During those six months, he decided to pursue film directing, his other passion, and sent a collection of homemade films to Art Center College of Design in Pasadena, California. He was one of fifteen film students selected that year, and one of the only students to have not already graduated from college. Senter redirected his pursuit of directing to writing, working on spec scripts, both feature length and for television. He soon landed his first job on the iconic lesbian drama The L Word. He followed up that incredible experience with a position as a writer on the ABC drama series Desperate Housewives. He wrote six episodes spanning the series' first, second and third seasons, debuting with the episode \\"Goodbye for Now\\". He wrote many of Bree, Lynette and Mary Alice's storylines, for which he drew much inspiration from his own mother. In 2006 Senter was nominated for a Writers Guild of America Award for the episode \\"Don't Look at Me\\". In 2014 Joshua helped write and produce a new series for ABC Family called Chasing Life. Joshua's debut novel Daisies, about the evolution of love in America over the last 70 years, was released by Diversion Books on July 22, 2014. And in 2015 he began work as a writer and producer for the critically acclaimed MTV series Finding Carter. In 2015 Joshua was placed on the Tracking Board‚Äôs Young and Hungry List as one of the top 100 writer‚Äôs working in Hollywood. In 2016, 2017, and 2018 Josh wrote pilots for ABC, FOX, and NBC respectively. He recently completed work on his sophomore novel The Tightrope of Desire. And a Valentine‚Äôs Day movie he co- wrote for Freeform, called The Thing About Harry, will air in February 2020. Personal life Senter grew up on a farm in Fort Leonard Wood near Plato, Missouri and was homeschooled with his four sisters by his mother Brenda. Before the age of thirteen, his parents' fundamental Christian beliefs did not allow him to watch or their family to own a television, so instead he spent his time alone drawing, painting, throwing pottery and sewing: \\"Being alone so much probably helped me become a better writer since it‚Äôs just you and the computer when you write,\\" he says of his childhood. He recalls in particular his first viewing of Jurassic Park, which he says inspired him to become a filmmaker. Before heading for Hollywood, he and his youngest sister used his father's home video camera to make short films and music videos.

However the young state, which has been held down with economical difficulties and political fights, could not give sufficient attention to learning its own history. The majority of usual citizens of Ukraine even today know almost nothing about greatness and tragedy of the Ukrainian national-liberation movement, and so any discussion about this theme remains at a level of stereotypes of the Soviet epoch. The series \\"Sobor on the Blood\\" for the first time comprehensively and fairly will tell viewer about the struggle for unity and independence of our country for the period from 1919 to 1949.

Work His 1939 work on \\"The Structure of Wholes\\" was seen as a precedent to systems theory in books in the 1960s‚Äì1980s edited by Fred Emery. Angyal's biospheric model of personality was found to have greater generality beyond the domain of personality, to a broader range of systems. > Angyal ... coined the word biosphere. The word refers to both the individual > and the environment, \\"not as interacting parts, not as constituents which > have independent existence, but as aspects of a single reality which can be > separated only by abstraction\\". [...] The biosphere is seen as a system of > interlocking systems so arranged that any given sub-system of the biosphere > is both the container of lesser systems and the contained of a greater > system or systems. The interplay of the interlocking systems creates a > tension which gives rise to the energy, which is available to the > personality. Moreover, the biosphere as a whole is characterized by a > fundamental polarity which gives rise to its most fundamental energy. This > polarity arises from the fact that the environment pulls in one direction > and the organism in the other. To these fundamental yet opposed pulls of the > biosphere, Angyal has given the names of autonomy and homonomy, > respectively. Autonomy is the relatively egoistic pole of the biosphere: it > represents the tendency to advance one's interests by mastering the > environment, by asserting oneself, so to speak, as a separate being. > Homonomy is the relatively 'selfless' pole of the biosphpere: it is the > tendency to fit oneself to the environment by willingly subordinating > oneself to something that one perceives as larger than the individual self. > In place of the words autonomy and homonomy, Angyal has also used the terms > self-determination and self-surrender to describe these opposing yet co- > operating directional trends of the biosphere, and he has felicitously > summed up the individual's relationship to them with the remark that, \\"the > human being comports himself as if he were a whole of an intermediate > order\\". Angyal was born in rural Transylvania (then Hungary), Angyal received his Ph.D. from the University of Vienna in 1927 and his M.D. from the University of Turin in 1932. He emigrated to the United States in 1932 and became a Rockefeller Fellow in the Department of Anthropology at Yale University. He moved to Worcester State Hospital in Massachusetts as a psychiatrist in the research unit, becoming Director of Research from 1937-1945. From 1945 until his death in 1960 he was in private practice in Boston, MA. Angyal was known for his holistic view of psychology.

It was originally developed by the British biopharmaceutical company Celltech plc. (now UCB S.A.) and was a putative new drug for oral treatment of multiple sclerosis. In October 2006, UCB and Biogen Idec announced a collaboration to jointly develop and commercialize zaurategrast for the treatment of multiple sclerosis and other potential indications.Press Release UCB S.A. 2-Oct-2006; accessed 11-Sep-2007 In June 2009, development of zaurategrast was discontinued due to discouraging results of a Phase II clinical trial.UCB: discontinuation of research concerning CDP323.  Mechanism of action  The mechanism of action of zaurategrast were believed to rely on preventing immune cells to migrate from blood vessels through the vessel walls to reach various inflamed tissues, including the brain. This mechanism is thought to prevent overshooting immune reactions and subsequent tissue damage as seen during uncontrolled immune cell migration as in multiple sclerosis. Zaurategrast has the same mechanism of action as the monoclonal antibody natalizumab.  Results in animal models  Zaurategrast was investigated in chronic experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE) in mice. The drug was effective when given prophylactically (i.e., before the disease was induced in mice) and when given therapeutically (i.e., after outbreak of the disease) and reduced the disease severity significantly.Watt G, Gauden V, McNeil K et al.

It is sponsored by the Sisters of Charity of Leavenworth, who established it as Saint Mary College. Though it was originally a school for women, the school is now coeducational. The mother house of the order is also on the premises. At one time the nuns' property had its own post office, Xavier, Kansas, the name honoring St. Francis Xavier. The university offers 26 bachelor's degree programs and six master's degree programs. Traditional, evening, degree completion, and online classes are available.USM Programs History The Sisters of Charity of Saint Vincent de Paul came to Leavenworth, Kansas, in 1858 and began teaching boys and girls. One year later, they created St. Mary's Institute, a small educational institute for women, in downtown Leavenworth. In 1870, Saint Mary's was moved to its current location south of the City, and was renamed St. Mary's Academy. In 1923, the Sisters established Saint Mary College. In 1932, the college became a four- year institute and started accepting a few men in certain areas of study. Arthur Morton Murphy, PhD, who was born in Electric Peak, Montana and earned his doctorate at the Catholic University of America in Washington, DC, was chosen as the school's first president, and served in that capacity for 25 years. He was the first layman to preside over a Catholic college for women in the United States. Murphy was succeeded as president by poet and educator Sister Mary Janet McGilley, PhD, SCL. In 1974, Saint Mary College became the first four-year institution to offer a degree completion in Kansas City. The school became residentially coeducational in 1988. In 2000, a campus was opened in Overland Park, Kansas. The institution expanded again in July 2003, changing its name to the University of Saint Mary.

The rebellion lasted from 1862 to about 1865. The incident was caused by the suppression of the Tiandihui by the government, and affected Central Taiwan, spreading as far north as Dajia and as far south as Chiayi. Although the rebellion was led by Tai Chao-chuen (; Taiwanese Hokkien: T√® Ti√¥-tshun), many rich and powerful people from all over Taiwan, like Lin Ri-cheng and Hung Tsung, were also involved. At this time, the Qing Dynasty was facing the Taiping Rebellion and therefore had little military force to spare to put down rebellion in Taiwan. In addition, many powerful local leaders participated in the rebellion, causing the Qing to initially rely on the militia of the Wufeng Lin and other clans. The rebellion was not brought under control until after the Qing had dispatched Ding Yuejian and Lin Wencha to suppress it in 1863, and did not end until 1865. Once the Qing had succeeded, the Wufeng Lin clan emerged as the most powerful in central Taiwan. This would eventually lead to conflicts between the clan and the KMT government after the end of Japanese rule. Origin Tai Chao-chuen was originally a landowner in Sichangli (ÂõõÂºµÁäÅ; ), Changhua (present-day Beitun District, Taichung). At one point he was an assistant to the military governor of central and northern Taiwan, though he lost it after being blackmailed by a high-ranking official. He succeeded his elder brother Tai Wan-guei as the head of his clan, and its associated Lord of the Land Society and Eight Trigram Society. He expanded these societies and converted them into branches of the Tiandihui while winning official approval by helping the government capture bandits, thereby expanding the power of the Tai clan. Because of the rapid expansion of Tai Chao-chuen's power and rumors of his follower's lawlessness, the government decided to act against Tai Chao-chuen. On 3 April 1862, the Taiwan Military Director Kong Zhaoci arrived in Changhua, executed Hong Shi, the leader of the Eight Trigram Society, and then summoned former Changhua County magistrate and then-Tamsui Prefecture magistrate Qiu Yuejing to discuss mopping up anti-government forces. Consequently, Qiu Yuejin led 600 soldiers, in addition to supporting forces of 400 each led by Lin Dianguo and Lin Richeng, to destroy the Tiandihui. However, on April 15, just as the government forces were going to battle with several thousand members of Tiandihui at Dadun, Lin Richeng defected and killed Qiu Yuejian. Lin Dianguo, seeing that the situation was not favorable, retreated to Azhaowu Village (present-day Wufeng District, Taichung City).

The location of meetings rotates from country to country. The Carnegie Group of Science Advisers to Presidents and Prime Ministers was established in 1991 by William T. Golden, businessman, chairman of the Board of the American Museum of Natural History and long-time adviser on national science policy issues in the US, and D. Allan Bromley, a Canadian-born physicist who was the national science adviser to President George H.W.Bush. It has met twice yearly since its creation, but since 2009 meets annually. Members of the Group alternate in hosting the meetings. The Carnegie Group, an informal group designed to bring together the science ministers and advisors of the G8 countries and the EU to discuss issues of mutual concern and interest, has been faithful to the original design envisioned by its founders. But it is also a group that has adapted to changing circumstances and to the growing importance of the emerging economies of China, India, Brazil, Mexico and South Africa. Recent meetings of the Carnegie Group have been adjusted in order to engage these countries and address key regional and global questions and challenges of shared concern. The format of the Carnegie Group meetings has also had to be flexible. In meeting on weekends, rotating locales and hosts, it still functions as an informal gathering, with no official record kept of the proceedings. However it has also been cognizant of the need to respond to emerging issues while continuing to focus on major global problems where science can provide sustainable solutions. Members of the Group have also articulated a desire to exert more influence in raising the profile of science and science issues at the G-8 summit level. The growing importance of the G-8 (and now G-20) summits along with the close links between those agendas and the topics discussed by Carnegie certainly underlines the value of the Group. Indeed, the continued need to address major subjects such as capacity building in Africa, climate change and energy futures, global health and pandemics, and large scale research infrastructure have all required the collective knowledge and wisdom of its members. South Africa has offered to host the 38th Carnegie Group meeting in 2011, the first time the Group will be meeting outside of the G8. Five short history volumes describe the agenda, issues and origins of the Carnegie meetings written by members of the Carnegie Group, with the latest volume published in December 2010.

The Inspector General for the Department of Transportation, like the Inspectors General of other federal departments and agencies, is charged with monitoring and auditing department programs to combat waste, fraud, and abuse. The Inspector General is part of the U.S. Department of Transportation and assists Congress, the Secretary of Transportation, and senior department officials in achieving a safe, efficient, and effective transportation system that meets the national interests and enhances the quality of life. Under the Inspector General Act of 1978, the Office of Inspector General is given autonomy to do its work without political interference. Although chosen by the President, Inspectors General are required to be selected based on integrity and ability, not political affiliation. The Inspector General Act of 1978 prevents officials in the scrutinized agency from interfering with audits or investigations and requires the IG to keep the Secretary of Transportation and Congress informed of findings, although much of OIG's work is accomplished with the cooperation of officials whose programs are being reviewed. The OIG carries out its mission by issuing audit reports, evaluations, and management advisories with findings and recommendations to improve program delivery and performance. In fiscal year 2006, OIG issued 76 audit reports, which identified more than $893 million in financial recommendations.  Audit  The Office of Auditing and Evaluation supervises and conducts independent and objective audits and other reviews of DOT programs and activities to ensure they operate economically, efficiently, and effectively.

It stood behind thin buildings fronting both streets, in Langbourn Ward,'Book 2, Ch. 23: Langbourn Ward', A New History of London: Including Westminster and Southwark (1773), pp. 656-661 accessed: 11 January 2009 The west and south sides faced into Ball Alley. Of medieval origin, it was rebuilt following the Great Fire of London. It was demolished in 1937; its tower was reconstructed at Twickenham as part of the new church of All Hallows, which also received its bells and complete interior fittings. Medieval church All Hallows is first recorded in 1054, when a citizen of London called Brihtmerus gave its patronage to the prior and chapter of Canterbury Cathedral. John Stow (d.1605), recording all of London, calls it \\"All Hallows Grasse Church\\" because \\"the grass market went down that way, when that street was far broader than now it is\\". The church was rebuilt around the beginning of the 16th century. The south aisle is recorded as having been completed in 1516. A north aisle and other works were paid for by the Pewterer's Company. A bell tower was completed in 1544 and the stone porch from the dissolved priory/monastery of St John of Jerusalem, (Clerkenwell Priory) was used. The monastery's bells also were purchased, but, due to the death of a benefactor, never installed, leaving the tower with only one bell.. Seymour takes his information from Stow's Survey. Following the Dissolution of the Monasteries the patronage was transferred to the Dean and Chapter of Canterbury. Rebuilding after the Great Fire All Hallows was badly damaged in the Great Fire of 1666. The parishioners attempted to patch it up, and had the walls rendered with straw and lime in an attempt to stop any further decay. A bell was hung in the steeple, despite its perilous condition, as late as 1679. Ultimately, however, restoration proved impractical and the old building was replaced with a new one designed by the office of Sir Christopher Wren. It was completed in 1694\\"The City Churches\\" Tabor, M. p61:London; The Swarthmore Press Ltd; 1917 at a cost of ¬£8,058 15s. 6d (). The exterior was plain. In the 1830s George Godwin noted that the church was so hemmed in by other buildings, that \\"it is with difficulty discovered, even when looked for; it has in consequence been called 'the invisible church'.\\" The stone tower stood at the west end of the south wall. As seen in the faithful rebuilding in Twickenham today, the tower has three storeys. The lowest storey has with a small porch formed by Corinthian columns with entablature and pediment, giving access to the body of the church through a vestibule; the second storey: round-headed windows; the third: square openings with louvres, each surmounted by a plain cornice (ledge). A cornice and parapet complete. It reaches, as then, about in height. The church was long and wide. The interior was a simple undivided space, without aisles; a gallery at the west end was supported on a single column. The ceiling was coved at the sides. There were five windows on the north side, and four on the south, but the only illumination at the east end was through two small windows in the side walls of the recess housing the reredos. In 1880 additional lighting was provided by inserting a rectangular skylight in the ceiling. The walls were panelled with oak to the height of . Above the northern doorcase stood a wooden figure of Death, about four feet high, and over the southern one was a similar figure of Time. The upper parts of each of these doorcases were carved with openwork decoration \\"the view whereof is intercepted by an artificial white curtain, likewise carved, but so natural that many have attempted to draw it on one side\\". The Corporation pew, in the south-east corner, had two sword-rests. There were high-backed seats for the churchwardens, their ends ornamented with the Lion and Unicorn. Attached to the wall in the vestibule was a frame containing shelves for loaves for distribution to the poor. There was an oak reredos, ornamented with a carved pelican and seven candlesticks. Parish marks in Lombard Street An organ built by Renatus Harris was installed in 1695, only being replaced in 1902 by one commissioned from Noble & Sons. During the Napoleonic wars, the roof space was used as a storeroom for ammunition by a volunteer corps. John Wesley An entry in the Parish record Book for 28 December 1789 states that John Wesley preached at Evensong.\\"City of London Parish Registers Guide 4\\" Hallows,A.(Ed) - M0023878CL( Parish Record Book,1782-1789): London, Guildhall Library Research, 1974 He recalled an earlier incident where, just as he was about to preach, he realised he had forgotten his sermon, and confided this to the attendant verger. > The reply came ‚ÄùWhat cannot you trust God for a sermon?‚Äù and upon this > rebuke I went into the pulpit and preached with much freedom and acceptance; > and from that time I have never taken a manuscript with me. Demolition Wren's tower, porch and fittings were moved to form part of All Hallows Church, in the Church of England, in the mid-north of Twickenham today by a radial, arterial road. In 1879 ten bells from St Dionis Backchurch were hung at the church, but such optimism could not disguise the fact that the residential population of the City was falling, year on year. After the First World War the church was earmarked for demolition, despite fierce opposition. In 1937 the church, which had been found to be unsafe, was demolished and Wren's tower, porch and the furnishings were reused in the construction of All Hallows Twickenham.All Hallows Twickenham web site The small parish was united with St Edmund the King and Martyr which lies the same length of the former church to the west. The site now forms part of the tall, multi-unit building including 2 George Yard and 20 Gracechurch Street. These remain partly fronted by small retail units: Itsu, Gap and New Look. Ball Alley, which connected the church with Lombard Street and George Yard is part of the replacement building today. In its final decades it was accessed only by narrow pedestrian entrances and the west limb by the west end of the church was very narrow. A similar void was by the north side of the church, seemingly with few doors. The east side of the church directly attached to shops on Gracechurch Street and the south side of the church fronted the wider part of Ball Alley. A parish boundary mark survives in Lombard Street. Present day The parish now forms part of the combined parish of St Edmund the King and Martyr, and St Mary Woolnoth Lombard Street with St Nicholas Acons, All Hallows Lombard Street, St Benet Gracechurch, St Leonard Eastcheap, St Dionis Backchurch and St Mary Woolchurch Haw - usually shortened to \\"St Edmund & St Mary Woolnoth\\".

His case was controversial since Myhre had only political objection to serve national service due to Norwegian participation in NATO's out of area involvement and his refusal to classify himself as having objections to serve military national service. His objections were neither religious, moral nor ethical, which are the legal requirements for being granted civilian national service under Norwegian National Service laws.

History The radio station in the early 1960s was located at 900 Gum Street right in the middle of a swamp. The station was part of the largest chain of black radio stations in the country called The OK Group. All of the stations in the OK Group had an OK at the end of their call letters. There was WGOK in Mobile, KYOK in Houston, and WBOK in New Orleans for example. There were other OK stations in the cities of Memphis, Tennessee and Baton Rouge, Louisiana among others. There was one White station in Alice, Texas with the OK reversed. It was called KOPY. Starting around 1959, the station WGOK was managed by Robert Irwin Grimes, Jr. He had been a radioman in the Navy, had served at Pearl Harbor on the and was there in Hawaii on the day Pearl Harbor was attacked. In the early 1960s disc jockeys had names like Topsy Turvey, Miss Mandy, and the Reverend A. J. Crawford. The station was very popular and played rhythm and blues records as well as gospel records. Currently, it plays Gospel music. Ownership In 1999, the station was acquired by Citadel Communications Corp. (Lawrence R. Wilson, chairman) from Fuller-Jeffrey Broadcasting Co. Inc. (Robert Fuller, president) along with sister station WYOK for a reported sale price of $6 million.

Windows versions TurboCAD Pro Basic and Platinum editions contain general drafting tools, as well as tools for 3D architectural and mechanical design. Both editions can create ACIS Solids or TC Surface objects, as well as Surface Meshes. The Basic edition contains a limited set of architectural and mechanical tools, whereas Platinum contains all the tools. For less demanding users, a less expensive TurboCAD Deluxe 2D / 3D version is available. Its 3D tools are TC Surface tools, and it has a limited amount of architectural and mechanical tools. For users needing only 2D functionality, there is the much less expensive TurboCAD Designer. With the exception of TurboCAD Designer, the other TurboCAD releases support both 2D drafting and 3D modeling tools. Mac versions The Mac versions of the software are built on a separate codebase and are not directly comparable with the Windows versions. TurboCAD Mac Pro contains both 2D and 3D tools, while the standard version is for 2D drafting only. IMSI Design released a High Sierra-compatible version of TurboCAD v10 in February 2018  TurboCAD History  =Early days= TurboCAD was originally developed in South Africa by Hendrik Vermooten and Hein Oosthuizen. Initial hardware support was for a specific device configuration: Hercules monochrome graphics cards, HP7475 plotters with keyboard for data entry. The first version of TurboCAD fit on a single 360kb floppy disk so that it could run on the original IBM PC. The source code also fit on a single floppy disk along with the 30kb required by the \\"development environment\\": Turbo Pascal 2.0. TurboCAD was released around the same time as Generic CADD in the United States. Both TurboCAD and Generic CADD's marketing objectives were the same ‚Äì create a viable, low-cost competitor to AutoCAD. But because Generic CADD launched in the U.S. before TurboCAD, it received much more positive press about its low price, (approximately $600 originally), and quickly achieved a large and loyal customer base. The release of Generic CADD in the PC market was, at that time, the biggest ‚ÄòCAD event‚Äô since Autodesk had reinvented CAD pricing with its initial release in 1981. South Africans Philip Copeman and Michael Cartwright worked on redesigning the product. Roy Abrams and Philip Copeman introduced it to the United Kingdom markets as TurboCAD in late 1986. This release was made under the brand Pink Software, with other stake holders; John Glennie, Digby Prior, and Janine Copeman. Support was added for more video cards (EGA, Olivetti, etc.), input devices (Summagraphics digitizer, and later, the first Microsoft Mouse). The cost was ¬£99. TurboCAD was a DOS product with limited device support, whereas Generic CADD was strong in this area. The turning point for the product came after Martin Sacks, the first US distributor, was able to get Digby Prior, a ton of plotters and printers, and a driver writing utility in the same room in Los Angeles. Sacks also created the first CAD symbols included with the product. Initially, in order to be able to support dot matrix printers, FPlot was sold as an add-on to TurboCAD. Later, TurboCAD included native printer drivers for a variety of dot matrix, bubble jet, and laser printers. During this period, Rob Berry began working on the product as a Technical Writer. =Moving to the US= TurboCAD was first sold in the United States by Milan Systems of America in late 1986, marketed as a stand- alone title for $99 and a bundle with the IMSI (International Microcomputer Software, IncCan TurboCAD Get Respect?) mouse for $149. Both companies shared distribution responsibilities for the bundle. In 1990, IMSI released its self- developed version of TurboCAD, version 2 for DOS. IMSI had licensed the source code from the original developers, Pink Software, and programmer Kurt Diesch fixed bugs and added output support, as well as increased functionality to compete with other CAD programs under $500 ‚Äì Generic CADD, Drafix and Design CAD 2D. Later Diesch ported code from the original Turbo Pascal to the later object oriented version that would eventually morph into Borland Delphi. This resulted in a major improvement to the DOS user interface. In the United States, TurboCAD was initially marketed through high-tech, direct sales publications such as Computer Shopper and InfoWorld magazines. Computer Shopper proved to be the consistently profitable publication in which to advertise and monthly full-page ads were run in this publication for the first two and a half years from TurboCAD's introduction in the U.S. Computer Shopper ads not only established a strong and loyal end user base, but they also helped establish a loyal distribution network. =Windows history and sales distribution= With the release of TurboCAD v2 DOS and v1 Windows in 1993, IMSI decided to begin using direct mail campaigns as a means of cost effectively increasing its user base and over the next two years became the primary advertising technique. Revenues for direct mail sales of TurboCAD grew to over $20 million annually in 1993, with successful prospect direct mail campaigns being sent out on a nearly monthly basis in the U.S., Canada, UK and Australia. In 1993, IMSI released the first Macintosh versions of TurboCAD ‚Äì Standard retailed for $195, while Professional retailed for $495 and offered 3D, wireframe functionality. This technology was purchased from Santiago Montufar's company, Pegasus Software. In 1993, IMSI began to outsource the development of TurboCAD. After a trip to Russia by Martin Sacks, IMSI hired 3 Russian programmers who began work on TurboCAD Windows v2. Included in these 3 original hires were Victor Bazarov, who later came to work in San Rafael for IMSI and Alex Presniak who went on to start SoftDev on behalf of IMSI. In 1994, Michael Cartwright moved from South Africa to join IMSI in California and, along with Peter Zingg, led the TurboCAD for Windows v3 rewrite, a major architectural shift for the product. Together those two were instrumental in IMSI's early offshore development success. During the v3 rewrite, the code was ported from Delphi to C++ and the UI was reformed to be \\"Office Standard\\" compliant. IMSI made the strategic decision to release v3 in both 16 and 32 bit versions giving users the best of both worlds during the rocky transition of the market from Windows 3.1 to Windows 95. Since then, Alex Presniak and many of the same Russian developers (Sergey Nazarov, TurboCAD team leader; Leonid Robin, SDK development) continued to work on the TurboCAD code. By late 1994, the success of the direct mailings peaked with an established user base of over a quarter of a million of TurboCAD owners. From that point on response rates and ROIs (returns on investment) for direct mail began to decline due to over-saturation and increasing printing and postage costs. As such, IMSI decided to reestablish its presence in the reseller market. TurboCAD quickly became a favorite of the reseller channel, successfully distributed through key software distributors like Ingram, TechData and Merisel, and sold in retail locations like MicroCenter, Fry's Electronics, CompUSA and Software Etc. In addition to strong reseller distribution channels, an educational reseller and direct to school marketing possibilities also became available. From 2009 on, there has been a shift out of traditional 'brick and mortar' resellers of TurboCAD, to more online resellers such as Amazon, Apple, CAD & Graphics, and Purch, as well as educational and corporate resellers such as JourneyEd, Lifeboat, SHI and Softmart. TurboCAD however continues to be sold in traditional resllers such as Fry's Electronics, Micro Center, Office Depot, and Office Max. =More Recent History= In 2006, IMSI/Design, LLC was spun out of IMSI, which had just been renamed 'Broadcaster, Inc', as part of a management buy-out of the TurboCAD product line, several other IMSI products and the IMSI name. The spin-out was led by Royal Farros, Bob Mayer and Greyhawk Capital Management The same Russian development team however continued to work of the TurboCAD code. In 2016, IMSIDesign, LLC established another team in Lahore, Pakistan to help/support development team in SPB, Russia and now development, Quality Assurance and Support departments are playing productive roles in TurboCAD releases. =International sales and localization= TurboCAD was first sold internationally by IMSI in the United Kingdom in late 1986. In 1992, IMSI took over Pink Software's London office and successfully re-launched the product in the UK marketplace. Localization into a variety of languages has occurred since then: 1993: first localized version of TurboCAD in both Windows and DOS in German 1994: French version was created 1995: Japanese was launched in partnership with Sumitomo Metal Industries 2001: first Chinese version was created for the Taiwanese market by Noah International in 2001 2001‚Äì2002: TurboCAD has been localized into Spanish, Czech, Polish and Italian 2010: TurboCAD 17 has been localized into Russian. =3D CAD product history= TurboCAD gained 3D functionality in at least 1990 and a fuller implementation with v5 when ‚ÄòModel Space‚Äô, ‚ÄòWork Plane‚Äô, ‚ÄòCamera‚Äô, and 3D Draggers appeared. Version 6 saw the integration of the ACIS solid modeling kernel and the LightWorks photorealistic rendering engine. In 1999, SoftDev created a VBA-based plug-in known as AnimationLab, which is now up to version 4. This plug-in module allows users to create scenarios using the Key Frames Editor, assign a soundtrack for each actor, calculate the sound scene taking into account distance to the actors, speed, and overall environment. In collaboration with SoftDev, a Beam Analysis tool (2001) and 2¬ΩD CAM plug-in (2002) were developed. 3rd party plug-ins have also been created including a surface modeling and civil engineering tools developed by Jerry Simington (2003, 2016), a Google Maps plug-in developed by SoftDev (2015), and a parametric furniture (cabinets, tables, chairs) generator developed by Spinar Software (2005). From 2003 through 2005 significant enhancements were made to the TurboCAD Professional product. Specifically, Spatial's Deformable Modeling engine was enabled in version 9.5, while D-Cubed's 2D Constraint Manager was added in version 10.5. In June 2005, IMSI re-entered the Macintosh market with the launch of TurboCAD and TurboCAD 3D. These products were private-label licenses from CADSoft Solutions. In 2006, the ability to unlock additional functionality through special serial number and activation key pairs was introduced with TurboCAD v12. Collections of architectural and mechanical features were ‚Äòpackaged‚Äô together and sold successfully to TurboCAD Professional owners. Architectural features included architectural object types (windows, doors, stairs and rails) based on Autodesk's ADT product, meaning that while TurboCAD could now read an ADT (DWG) file with these architectural object types, AutoCAD itself could not. TurboCAD 14 was released in 2007 including Terrain Modeling functionality. TurboCAD 15 was released in March 2008. TurboCAD 16 was released in July 2009. TurboCAD 17 was released in March 2010. TurboCAD 18 was released in March 2011 and included a partial implementation of the Redway RedSDK drawing engine. TurboCAD 19 was released in March 2012 and included 64-bit support for TurboCAD Professional. TurboCAD 20 was released in March 2013, and included the introduction of Surface Mesh (SMESH) tools, as well as 64-bit support for TurboCAD Deluxe and Designer. TurboCAD 21 was released in March 2014. TurboCAD 22 was released in March 2015 and was re-branded as TurboCAD 2015. The LightWorks rendering module was removed from the program and is now only available as a purchased plug-in. Point cloud viewing and editing functionality was also introduced into this version TurboCAD 2016 was released in February 2016, and included advanced 3D Blending, 3D Law tools and Point Cloud support. TurboCAD 2017 was released in March 2017, and included CAD interoperability, rendering, the improved functionality to both mechanical and architectural areas of design. TurboCAD 2018 was released in May 2018, and included new ribbon interface, shortcuts, thick profile abilities, and quick pull tool for surfaces. TurboCAD 2019 was released in 2019, and came in Designer (2D), Deluxe (2D/3D), Professional (Advanced), and Platinum (Premium) versions with MSRP range from USD $60 to $1600. TurboCad 2019 has an issue with upgrade downloads that the software requests a Licence key but this is neither the serial number nor Activation Code that IMSI provide with the software download link. As yet I have been unable to use the software because the download link and emails do not allow the software to be used. TurboCAD 2020 was released in 2020, and came in Designer (2D), Deluxe (2D/3D), Professional (Advanced), and Platinum (Premium) versions with MSRP range from USD $60 to $1600.

The seventh piece was also published for harp. They were written between 1915and 1917, individually, many for specific friends of the Russian composer, and premiered by him as a cycle lasting some twenty minutes on April 15, 1918, in Petrograd, Soviet Union. Gutheil published both the piano set and the one piece for harp in 1917 in Moscow. The cycle brings dissonant harmonies akin to music by Prokofiev contemporaries Schoenberg and Scriabin but retains original concepts of tonality and rhythm. The miniatures are vignette-like, whimsical, effervescent and bright. The overall effect is in the Impressionist style, not unlike work by Debussy. Because of the almost uniformly mellow style, performers must be willing to work on the relatively difficult technique required to capture its essence. David Fanning: ‚ÄúIn 1935 Prokofiev made recordings of ten pieces from the set, and his playing is notable for its wistfulness, subtle shadings and ‚Äî in places ‚Äî rhythmic freedom. Even the clowning of the Ridicolosamente is rather shy in Prokofiev‚Äôs hands, and the delicacy he brings to the following piece brings out its affinities with Debussy‚Äôs Minstrels.‚Äù History In August 1917, Prokofiev played them for Russian poet Konstantin Balmont, among others, at the home of a mutual friend. Balmont was inspired to compose a sonnet on the spot, called \\"a magnificent improvisation\\" by Prokofiev who named the pieces Mimolyotnosti from these lines in Balmont's poem: \\"In every fleeting vision I see worlds, Filled with the fickle play of rainbows\\". A French-speaking friend at the house, Kira Nikolayevna, immediately provided a French translation for the pieces: Visions fugitives. Prokofiev often performed only a couple of them at a time as encores at the end of his performances.Behind The Mask, Sergey Prokofiev, Diaries 1915‚Äì1923, translated from the Russian and annotated by Anthony Phillips, Cornell University Press, 2008 Movements =Lentamente= This short movement, a minute in duration, begins quietly and hesitantly, as if wandering, as the melody does not seem to resolve. The gentle floating chords are like spots of dappled sunshine through a canopy of leaves overhead, ever- changing in the wind, played softly but clearly. However, like the patterns of light, this movement lasts for just a moment. The Lentamente makes certain references to Impressionism due to the use of planing. =Andante= Like the first movement, this movement is also quiet and hesitant. However, unlike the first movement, the harmonic and melodic structures of this piece are based on diminished harmony, octatonic scales and dissonant intervals of 7ths, making it rather modern. Performance time lasts about a minute and a half. =Allegretto= This movement is in ternary form, with the middle section being rather more modern than the outer sections. The chords of the right hand in the beginning constitute a fauxbourdon texture, in contrast to the left hand's chromatic passage. The middle section is based on the octatonic scale, with the oscillation of note clusters in the left hand creating a tritone. Performances are approximately forty-five seconds in duration. =Animato= This movement, a minute in length, is noticeably more lively than its predecessors. The piece is played detached or staccato for the chordal passages and leggiero for the scalar passages. After this section, the piece goes to a slower, more mellow bass melody. The thematic material is accompanied in the left hand by an ostinato in minor thirds. =Molto giocoso= This twenty-five second piece is uniformly light and playful (rather scherzo-like), probably because the melody is rather disjunct, creating a humorous effect. This piece is polytonal and alternates often between G and G-flat major/F-sharp major, but eventually ends with a plagal cadence in G major. =Con eleganza= This movement is dance-like, with a gently rising melody which quickly blooms and fades away. This piece seems to imply A minor, though this has been undermined in the middle section with the appearance of E-flat and A-flat in the accompaniment. It ends with a perfect cadence in A minor. Like the movement before it, performance time lasts around twenty-five seconds. =Pittoresco (Arpa)= This movement begins with a narrante bass accompaniment somewhat reminiscent of the famous opening of Prokofiev's notorious Piano Concerto No. 2. The right hand enters with a fleeting, fairy-like, sparkling melody which seems to develop aimlessly. Close to the end of the movement there is a sudden, dark bass chord played forte, and the movement quickly dies after that. This movement has a performance time of around two minutes. =Commodo= This movement has one of the more traditional (non-dissonant) melodies of the work, though infused with certain modern elements. The harmonic and formal structures in this piece are based on 3rd relationships. The left hand provides a nocturne-style accompaniment for the piece. The piece is slightly over one minute in length. =Allegro tranquillo= A rising right hand melody breaks into a left hand run that becomes the new melody, which switches back to a bright right hand melody. The bass accompaniment is, in this case, to be played more prominently than usual because it complements the right hand melody, which is higher up on the keyboard and thus needs support if emphasis is desired. There are some bell- like tones right before the piece ends; its duration is approximately one minute. =Ridicolosamente= The left hand plays a simple \\"up-down\\" motif repeatedly while the right hand begins a dissonant grace-note based melody. The movement, as its title suggests, is jumpy and comical, and usually lasts around a minute and fifteen seconds. =Con vivacit√†= This movement's melody is almost-exclusively in upwards or downwards appoggiatura-like scale fragments interspersed with punctuated, accented dissonances. However, the piece has a short, legato middle section in B-flat minor. A performance lasts about a minute. =Assai moderato= This movement is noticeably heavier and more depressed than its predecessors. The entire temperament of the piece suggests something is wrong, but in a way which is slightly cautious (as opposed to outright scared), since it is played mostly solidly. The movement lasts about a minute. =Allegretto= At first listen, this movement appears to return to the wandering style introduced to the audience at the beginning of the work. It quickly develops, however, but this expansion is limited and just as quickly returns to the beginning melody. This movement, in ternary form, is around forty-five seconds in length. =Feroce= This movement, distinct from all the other movements in the work, is dissonant, commanding, and march-like, due to its driving, motoristic rhythm quite characteristic of a toccata. The repeating syncopated bass notes are a characteristic of this movement, which lasts around a minute. =Inquieto= This movement's repeating bass immediately creates a sense of urgency until it opens up to a heavily chordal staccato melody that gradually grows in magnitude until one great final shove, after which the piece ends. A performance lasts just under a minute. =Dolente= This movement is distinctly polyphonic and scalar. In contrast to the previous movement, the thematic material begins with a long, descending chromatic line, making the piece rather mournful; this material repeats five times before the end. The middle section is rather reminiscent of No. 8 with its lyrical accompaniment, with a lighthearted, slurred two-note motive reminiscent of Nos. 10, 11 or 12. The piece, around a minute and a half in duration, ends with a sustained E. =Poetico= The left hand melody proceeds unbothered by the lighter right hand accompaniment (which is, of course, a reversal of normal roles). The piece grows to the top of the keyboard, where both hands participate in a sparkling, nearly trill-like shifting of chords. This movement lasts around fifty seconds. =Con una dolce lentezza= This movement returns to the wandering style, though it remains somewhat more solid than its predecessors. Performances last about a minute and fifteen seconds. =Presto agitatissimo e molto accentuato= As its title suggests, this movement is more active and forceful, with a development based upon thirds. The movement abruptly ends with a pounding bass exchange that both hands share. The piece lasts about forty-five seconds. =Lento irrealmente= The final and longest movement in the suite, requiring just over two minutes to play, appears to be searching for something, and has a slightly exotic melody that includes some partial scalar passages which, like the rest of these movements, tends to develop towards the top of the keyboard before coming down for further bass development. It is in ternary form, each section lasting exactly eight measures.  References  External links * *Arrangement of movement 7 for harp, International Harp Archives, Harold B.

It was founded by John Todd, Nancy Jack Todd, and William McLarney. Its purpose was to research human support systems of food, water, and shelter and to completely rethink how these systems were designed. Purpose of the Institute The New Alchemy Institute was founded on a , former dairy farm in Hatchville, part of Falmouth, Massachusetts, on Cape Cod. Their stated aim was to do research on behalf of the planet: > \\"Among our major tasks is the creation of ecologically derived human support > systems - renewable energy, agriculture, aquaculture, housing and > landscapes. The strategies we research emphasize a minimal reliance on > fossil fuels and operate on a scale accessible to individuals, families and > small groups. It is our belief that ecological and social transformations > must take place at the lowest functional levels of society if humankind is > to direct its course towards a greener, saner world. > Our programs are geared to produce not riches, but rich and stable lives, > independent of world fashion and the vagaries of international economics. > The New Alchemists work at the lowest functional level of society on the > premise that society, like the planet itself, can be no healthier than the > components of which it is constructed. The urgency of our efforts is based > on our belief that the industrial societies which now dominate the world are > in the process of destroying it.\\" (Fall 1970, Bulletin of the New > Alchemists. ) Areas of research =Bioshelters= A bioshelter is a solar greenhouse that is managed as a self-contained ecosystem. The groupings of plants, animals, soil and insects are selected so that closed loops of life cycles, materials, water, and energy are created, and require minimal inputs from outside the system. They emulate natural rhythms of growth and cycling of nutrients. New Alchemy built several bioshelters: * \\"The Ark\\" located at the property in Hatchville, Massachusetts, United States * \\"The Ark\\" located at Spry Point, Prince Edward Island, Canada * others =Organic agriculture= New Alchemy investigated the practices of organic agriculture for both field crops, and greenhouse growing. They researched intensive gardening, biological pest control, cover cropping, irrigation using fish pond water, perennial food crops, and tree crops. =Aquaculture= New Alchemy experimented with growing edible fish in ponds in the bioshelters. The solar aquaculture ponds were above-ground, translucent tanks. The fertile pond water was used for irrigating the crops in the greenhouses. This proved to be a successful way to raise edible fish, floating hydroponic crops, and irrigated greenhouse food crops. Ideological basis The scientists working at New Alchemy were determined to rethink how human support systems were designed. They looked to nature as the ultimate designer, using careful observation of natural cycles and processes as the template for creating truly sustainable systems.

A survey stake is typically small, with a pointed end to make it easy to drive into the earth. It may be color-coded or have a space for people to write information on the stake. Surveyors use stakes when assessing sites to mark out boundaries, record data, and convey information to other people. On a job site, for example, survey stakes indicate where it is necessary to backfill with soil to raise the elevation, or to cut soil away to lower it.

The Fair's official description of the musical noted: \\"The new production takes place on a turntable 75 feet in diameter, one of the largest in the world; in a swimming pool in front of the stage; and on movable platforms that shuttle back and forth over the pool.

For instance, I'm doing a sports number and Ert√©'s idea about a girl playing tennis was to put a headdress on her with tennis balls and rackets.\\" Colt went on to say that Wonderworld was \\"full of crazy things, some quite unbelievable: a water ballet with costumes full of electric lights ... hundreds of dancers, swimmers, singers, clowns, and so forth, and scores of costumes.\\"Pecktal, Lynn (1999).

Career After working initially for his father Wilson was articled to Stark & Fulton, Engineers, of Glasgow. Wilson worked on the Caledonian Canal and various railways, including acting as the locomotive superintendent for the Hull and Selby Railway. From 1847 to 1853, he was engineer to the York and North Midland Railway, before assuming this position on the Midland Great Western Railway, Ireland in 1853. From 1858 he was Locomotive and Permanent Way Engineer for the Oxford, Worcester and Wolverhampton Railway (later the West Midland Railway). In 1864 Wilson set up his own practice, Edward Wilson & Co, and worked on the Metropolitan Railway and on several new lines on the Great Western Railway and on many Great Eastern Railway projects, including the first phase of Liverpool Street Station in 1874. He was joined in the practice by his nephew, John Wilson (1846-1922), who was his apprentice, and by the architect W. N. Ashbee; collectively the three contributed to the Great Eastern works. After Wilson's death in 1877 the practice of Edward Wilson & Co was carried on by John Wilson, in partnership with J. S.

Origins  Ring Oak originally was the land of antebellum cotton plantations Blakely Plantation and Ingleside Plantation. Prior to it having a name, this property began as a venture sometimes referred to as the Ireland-Ingalls ownership. This was a joint business/leisure concern between David S. Ingalls and Robert Livingston Ireland, Jr. Ingalls was a director of Pan Am World Airways and publisher of Cincinnati Times-Star. Ireland was an executive with M.A. Hanna Company, a coal company. By 1947 Ring Oak was established as a separate plantation and was owned by David S. and Louise Ingalls. Ring Oak had its own private landing strip making it possible for David Ingalls, an accomplished pilot, to leave Cleveland, Ohio on a Saturday and arrive for the opening of dove hunting season. The landing strip is there today. The name Ring Oak refers to a circular cut made around the live oak trees on the plantation and it's suggested that these rings were the work of local Native Americans and forced the tree to die so that canoes could be made. Many trees survived, scabbing over and creating a noticeable ring. Location of Ring Oak Plantation in 1967 The Ingalls also made purchases of Chemonie Plantation originally owned by George Noble Jones.

Gen. Nathan Bedford Forrest and Union forces commanded by Maj. Gen. James H. Wilson. The battle was a part of the Franklin‚ÄìNashville Campaign. General Forrest had been assigned by Lt. General John B. Hood to the command of the rear guard of the Army of Tennessee, which was in flight following the military disaster experienced at the Battle of Nashville on December 15‚Äì16, 1864. After evacuating Pulaski, Tennessee, on the evening of December 24, Forrest was confronted with the problem of slowing Wilson's aggressive pursuit enough so that the Confederate army could complete the final of its retreat to the Tennessee River.Official Records, Series I, Volume XLV, Chapter LVII.  Battle  Believing he was pursuing an enemy ripe for capture, Wilson had his troops on the road early on Christmas Day. By 3:00 p.m. he was several miles south of Pulaski when he encountered Forrest's skirmishers. Without hesitation he sent in pursuit three regiments of dismounted cavalry into a heavily wooded gorge leading to the top of Anthony's Hill. Good progress was made until a rail barricade was encountered. Here Forrest had posted his two brigades of infantry and two brigades of cavalry along with three masked field pieces. In moments the Federal troops had been blasted back by heavy musketry in the direction from which they came, with Forrest's men in rapid pursuit. Soon they encountered an additional brigade of Wilson's troops who quickly joined the retreat. After capturing a Federal cannon, the Confederates continued in pursuit an additional half-mile until they struck a full division of Union cavalry. At this point Forrest had chosen to disengage. His victorious troops returned up the hill to their original positions at the barricades, and then finally withdrew under the cover of darkness further south to Sugar Creek.Sword, pp. 417‚Äì18.  Aftermath  Forrest, who had already established a reputation for bold offensive action, displayed at Anthony's Hill an equal mastery of defensive warfare. His stands there and the following day at Sugar Creek bought important time for the stricken army to flee for safety behind the Tennessee River. That the Army of Tennessee survived to cross the river safely on December 26‚Äì28 barely hours ahead of their pursuers, and continued to fight into the following spring is due almost completely to Forrest's performance in delaying the Union pursuit.Sword, p. 418.

The traditional western boundary of the Pentapolis lay at Arae Philaenorum. Some historians claim it is 40 km west of El Agheila, while others place Arae Philaenorum near Ra's Lanuf,M√ºller, Geogr (l.c.) and the modern Italian commemorative arch featuring the Philaeni stood here before its destruction in 1973. =World War II= On 3 April 1941 there was a British war communiqu√© that in the North Africa Campaign in World War II in the night of 1 April 1941 Allied bomber aircraft heavily attacked German/Italian motor transport at Ra's Lanuf and destroyed many vehicles.Daily Telegraph 4 April 1941 quoted in Daily Telegraph 4 April 2011 page 28. =Growth under Gaddafi= Beginning in 1984, a major urban development program for Ra's Lanuf was initiated by the Brega and Ra's Lanuf Higher Committee to accommodate employees of the nearby oil industries, and envisaged for 40,000 inhabitants. The general design of the town layout was to be linear, following the coast and allowing extensive views and easy physical connection with the sea from all parts of town. The town's structure was based on a functional hierarchy, containing three centers forming public zones with community facilities extending to the Mediterranean coast; these are in turn surrounded by high-rise housing blocks. A pedestrian route links different public, commercial, and recreational facilities to residential areas. The project was carried out by Devecon Engineers and Architects. =Libyan Civil War= On 4 March 2011 after heavy fighting, anti-Gaddafi Libyan rebels captured Ra's Lanuf. The rebel advance was halted in the Battle of Bin Jawad and a counter-offensive by government forces opened the second phase of the Battle of Ra's Lanuf. After a heavy bombardment from air, land, and sea the government forces retook the city on 10 March. On 27 March rebels retook control of Ra's Lanuf as part of a rapid advance as 24 hours earlier they had retaken the strategic towns of Brega and Ajdabiya, but within a matter of days rebel forces retreated from the city once more in the face of a new government counter-offensive. On 23 August, rebels recaptured Ra's Lanuf from government loyalists and continued their advance towards Bin Jawad and Sirte; however, sporadic fighting continued in Ra's Lanuf into September. Administrative governance Under the Ottoman Empire, Ra's Lanuf was part of Tripolitania under Italy after 1934, then occupied by the British as again part of Tripolitania. In 1983 it became part of the Bin Jawad District. Since 1987, it has been under the Sirte District. Economy Ra's Lanuf is an import center for the petrochemical industry. The Ra's Lanuf Refinery has a capacity of . It is a part of larger petrochemical complex consisting of an ethylene plant, a polyethylene plant, plant utilities, and the Port of Ra's Lanuf. The Port of Ra's Lanuf consists of a small harbor, operated by the Veba Oil Company and RASCO. Its primary activities include loading crude oil and oil products. It has a maximum draft of 22 meters and is about west of the Benina International Airport. Ra's Lanuf is the terminus of the Defa-Ra's Lanuf oil pipeline and the Majid-Nafora-Amal-Ra's Lanuf oil pipeline. Ra's Lanuf has two airports: Ra's Lanuf Oil (Code:HLNF) and Matratin (Code:FR3803). Ra's Lanuf is to be a station on the new national railway system of Libya. In addition it is to be a construction base for the section to be built by Russian engineers, with a port for the delivery of supplies. The port will be connected to the base by a branch line.

This station is under ownership of Cumulus Media. Its studios are located at the Amarillo Building downtown on Polk Street, and its transmitter tower is based southeast of Amarillo in unincorporated Randall County along Loop 335 (Hollywood Road). KPUR was once KFDA on 1230 kHz. It hit the air in 1939. After World War II, Amarillo station KGNC moved from 1440 kHz to 710 kHz with greater power. KFDA filed to move to the vacated 1440 raising power from 250 watts on 1230 to 5,000 watts days and 1,000 watts nights. Night used a three tower directional antenna system. The call letters changed to KPUR in 1966. The station was sold by former television partner KFDA-TV (and Texas State Network interests) to Charlie Jordan, the manager at the time. The towers were located east of Amarillo just south of the former Route 66 (now I-40) which shared land with the studios. In the mid seventies the land was largely sold off to shopping center developers. Towers were relocated to the present site. That site was subject to a late 1970s fire when a Harris MW-5 transmitter melted down. The MW-5 used a step up transformer to raise the three phase input power (at 240 volts) to 17,000 volts. The primary wiring had been bundled closely to the secondary wiring and tightly lashed together. When an insulation breakdown allowed the input wiring to arc, the high temperatures allowed the secondary wires to short to the inputs. This caused extremely high circulating currents and a meltdown of the transformer frame (made of metal castings and laminations). The station is an affiliate of the Dallas Cowboys radio network and the West Texas Friday Night Scoreboard Show.

S. v. Richard D., 410 U.S. 614 (1973), was a United States Supreme Court case resulting in a ruling that a particular section of a Texas Penal Code did not apply to mothers with out-of-wedlock children. The case was argued on December 6, 1972 and decided on March 5, 1973.. Linda R. S., the petitioner and appellant, was the mother of the out of wedlock child. Richard D., the respondent and appellee, was the father of the out of wedlock child. Facts Linda R. S., the mother of an out of wedlock child, brought an action to enjoin the \\"discriminatory application\\" of Art. 602 of the Texas Penal Code, providing that any \\"parent\\" who fails to support his \\"children\\" is subject to prosecution but by state judicial construction applies only to married parents. Linda R. S. sought to enjoin the local district attorney from refraining to prosecute the father of her child for not providing child support. The three-judge District Court dismissed the action for lack of standing. Decision The Supreme Court affirmed the District Court's holding in a 5‚Äì4 decision. Justice Thurgood Marshall wrote the majority opinion, joined by Chief Justice Warren E. Burger and Justices Lewis F. Powell, Jr., Potter Stewart, and William Rehnquist. The Court held that \\"although appellant has an interest in her child's support, application of Art. 602 would not result in support but only in the father's incarceration, and a private citizen lacks a judicially cognizable interest in the prosecution or nonprosecution of another.\\" In December 1981, under Leeke v.

The FICPA represents approximately 18,500 CPAs and accounting professionals in Florida and beyond. Deborah Curry, CPA, CGMA, is the FICPA's president and CEO, and Abby Dupree, CPA, is the institute's 2019‚Äì2020 Board Chair. The FICPA provides opportunities for professional development, knowledge sharing, networking, community involvement, leadership and camaraderie while lobbying the Florida Legislature on issues that affect CPAs and promoting the CPA designation. The FICPA also works closely with the Florida Department of Business and Professional Regulation to warn the public on using unlicensed CPAs. It is also one of the 11 nonprofit members of the Federation of Schools of Accountancy. In December 2014, Forbes listed FICPA number 19 on The 100 Must- Follow Tax Twitter Feeds.  History  = Early history = The FICPA was founded in 1905. Walter Mucklow, T.G. Hutchinson and two other Florida accountants envisioned an association that would promote the exchange of ideas, enhance confidence in public accountants among businessmen, and encourage a high standard of efficiency in the science of accounting and the art of bookkeeping. These four men lobbied the Legislature and pushed through the first accountancy law in the Southern states. They created an accountancy exam. On April 20, 1905, they organized into a group of accountants under the name Florida Society of Accountants. One of the first acts of the newly formed Society was the publication of a pamphlet describing the objectives of the Society, which were to promote a higher standard of efficiency in the science of accounting and the art of bookkeeping; to bring together those interested directly or indirectly in matters of accounting, to promote the exchange of ideas, and to encourage mutual assistance between members; to encourage the adoption of improved methods and to secure uniformity in matters of accounting; and to promote confidence between the public accountant, the bookkeeper, and the man of business. For its first activity, the Society directed the collective energies of its members towards securing passage of an accountancy law. This was no easy task; while few states had such laws, none had been passed in any of the Southern States. The principal efforts towards securing passage of the accountancy law were expanded by the Society's special legislative committee, composed of T.G. Hutchinson and John A. Hansbrough. Governor Napoleon B. Broward signed Florida's first accountancy act on June 5, 1905 and Florida became the eighth state in the Union to pass an accountancy law, being preceded by New York, 1896; Pennsylvania, 1899; Maryland, 1900; California, 1901; Illinois, 1903; Washington, 1903; and New Jersey, 1904. A relatively simple Florida law, the 1905 accountancy act set up a three-member State Board of Accountancy and prescribed its powers and duties to provide for the examination of qualified accountants and to provide penalties for violations. The Board also was authorized to grant certificates to those candidates who passed the prescribed tests. The first State Board of Accountancy appointed by Governor Broward was composed of Mucklow, E.I. Matthews and George R. DeSaussure. The Board immediately began to function and granted its first five certificates. = Switch to Certified Public Accountants = As interest and activity in accountancy increased, the members of the Florida Society of Accountants gradually arrived at the decision to restrict membership to Certified Public Accountants. This necessitated the reorganization of the group under the new name of the Florida Society of Certified Public Accountants in 1916. Membership in the Society was limited to American citizens who held Certified Public Accountant certificates, issue by any State and who had been in continuous practice for themselves or in the office a public accountant for three years. Associate membership was limited to Certified Public Accountants who had not been in practice for three years. The period from 1917 to 1923 was one of little activity for the Society's affairs. World War I and economic adjustments that occurred shortly after that conflict claimed most of the accounting profession's attention. The Florida Boom of the early 1920s left members with little time to advance the public accounting profession through Society activities. The Society reorganized in 1924 under the name Society of Certified Public Accountants in Florida. Officers were Walter Mucklow, president' T.G. Hutchinson and John A. Hansbrough, vice-presidents; J.M. Jordan, secretary; and Robert Pentland, treasurer. The Society had 20 members in total. Early in 1927, serious thought was given to the ethics of the profession, including such matters as advertising and solicitation of accounting work. It was decided that the accountancy law should be amended or rewritten. A revised accountancy law was approved by the Governor to become effective July 1, 1927. The adoption of revised accountancy law attracted not only the attention of Florida accountants but that of practitioners around the nation.History of Florida Institute of Certified Public Accountants 1905‚Äì1963, published June, 1963 In 1928, the Society was officially incorporated under the name Florida Institute of Accountants.. = Recent history = In 1955, the Florida Society of Certified Public Accountants was renamed the Florida Institute of Certified Public Accountants (FICPA), which is their current name. At the time, there were 811 members and 350 candidates sat for the CPA exam. With interests in building a governmental relations program, the Board of Governors voted in 1979 to relocate the FICPA's headquarters to Tallahassee, Florida. In 1985, the FICPA moved into its new, official headquarters within walking distance of the Florida State Capitol. Four years later, the building was expanded. When it celebrated its 100-year anniversary on April 20, 2005, it represented more than 18,400 CPAs throughout Florida. Authors Lloyd \\"Buddy\\" Turman and Heidi Tyline King published a paperback book titled \\"FICPA: Florida Institute of Certified Public Accountants\\" in 2005 commemorating the milestone. The FICPA aims to uphold the high standards of the accounting profession and ensure its continued growth and success. The organization employs 65 association professionals, who focus on programs to enhance members' competency and professionalism; support standards of independence, integrity and objectivity that also are in the public interest; promote community involvement; and monitor and actively participate in the public policy-making process. = Past FICPA Presidents/Chairs = Chairs *Abby Depree (2019‚Äì2020) *Gary Fracassi (2018‚Äì2019) *Alan West (2017‚Äì2018) *Joey Epstein (2016‚Äì2017) *Mia Thomas (2015‚Äì2016) *Jeff Barbacci (2014‚Äì2015) * Ken Strauss (2013‚Äì2014) * Scott Price (2012‚Äì2013) Presidents * Stam Stathis (2011‚Äì12) * Michael R.

Publications such as Florida CPA Today, the FICPA's bi-monthly magazine and NewsFlash, the institute's electronic newsletter, update members and invite CPAs to share their expertise on important professional and public issues with members of the business community, the media and the public. The FICPA has eight fundamental objectives around which all of its activities, benefits and services revolve. Its website states those objectives as: # To foster ethical conduct and promote standards of independence, integrity and objectivity in the profession. # To promote the establishment and maintenance of high educational and professional requirements for persons in the profession. # To monitor and actively participate in public policy-making processes that impact the profession. # To collect, analyze and interpret data on changing market, economic, governmental and technological conditions affecting the profession. # To encourage the analysis, discussion and understanding of issues and trends in the profession. # To expand the public's knowledge and understanding of the profession. # To maintain relationships and activities with other organizations in pursuit of the institute's mission. # To provide an organizational structure that efficiently utilizes volunteer-leader and professional-staff resources for the continuing development of programs that effectively address the expectations of all members.The FICPA's Role & Objectives  Membership  With more than 19,500 members, the Florida Institute of CPAs is one of the largest CPA organizations in the United States. The FICPA serves Florida CPAs from all areas of practice, including public accounting, industry and government. The institute also provides specialized membership to meet the needs of accounting professionals who are not yet certified, accounting educators, professional affiliates, accounting firm administrators and students. The FICPA membership is organized through 26 chapters across Florida. These chapters are further grouped into six geographical regions. Each region and the chapters within that region hold and promote programming of local interest and provide a conduit for communication with the FICPA leadership. Participation in local chapters provides members with the opportunity to develop leadership skills by taking an active role in both the Institute and the profession. Members of the FICPA may also participate in leadership through the organization's 31 committees to help facilitate networking, community outreach, conference-planning, professional development and information dissemination. = Young CPAs = As a committee of the FICPA, the Young CPA Committee (YCPA) is geared towards developing ways to engage young CPAs (age 35 and under) in the accounting profession. The Young CPA Committee's goals are to provide increased networking opportunities for young CPAs by developing and promoting strong local YCPA organizations across the state; organize and support philanthropic events sponsored by YCPA organizations across the state; and to encourage other young CPAs to get involved with the FICPA and the profession as a whole. Advocacy The FICPA serves as a liaison for the CPA profession with various legislative and regulatory agencies in Florida. The FICPA's Governmental Affairs team helps develop annual proposed legislative and regulatory policies; monitors state legislation and regulatory actions; lobbies on behalf of the FICPA; and communicates changes to FICPA members. Fourth-generation Floridian and FSU graduate, Justin Thames is the current Director of Governmental Affairs. =Florida CPA/PAC= The CPA/PAC is an entity completely separate from the FICPA. It is supported solely by the voluntary contributions of the FICPA's members and others. The objective of the Florida CPA/PAC is to help protect the trust, confidence and esteem the CPA certificate holds in the public's eye. In 2001, the Florida CPA/PAC was separated into three geographic regions. Each chapter is \\"nested\\" into one of the three regions. Members are assigned to one of the three regional CPA/PACs based on geographic location: * North (includes 11 chapters) * Central (includes 9 chapters) * South (includes 7 chapters) Continuing professional education The FICPA helps CPAs meet continuing professional education (CPE) requirements by coordinating hundreds of in-person events across Florida as well as webcasts, webinars and on-demand courses. The Florida Board of Accountancy requires license holders to complete 80 hours of CPE for each re-establishment period, including at least 8 hours of accounting and auditing credit and four hours of ethics credit. The Florida Board of Accountancy has designated the FICPA can provide ethics courses and is a Continuing Education Ethics Provider. The Florida Institute of CPAs is registered with the National Association of State Boards of Accountancy as a Quality Assurance Service sponsor of continuing professional education.  Educational foundation  The FICPA Educational Foundation, Inc., is a not-for-profit organization that raises money to provide scholarships and educational programs to and for Florida's prospective and current accounting students. Established in 1959, the FICPA Educational Foundation has provided more than $3 million in scholarships and education programs to support Florida's accounting students. Through the donations of FICPA members, the Foundation continues to provide more than $200,000 a year in scholarships to assist Florida's future CPA leaders. Scholarships are coordinated with Florida Colleges and Universities, including the following state universities: *Florida A&M; University *Florida Atlantic University *Florida Gulf Coast University *Florida International University *Florida State University *University of Central Florida *University of Florida *University of South Florida ‚Äì 3 scholarships for $2,000 each *University of West Florida Other colleges and universities: *Barry University *Bethune‚ÄìCookman University *Flagler College *Florida Institute of Technology *Florida Southern College *Hodges University *Jacksonville University *Nova Southeastern University *St. Leo University *St. Thomas University *Southeastern University *Stetson University *University of Tampa References  External links  * Directory of State CPA Societies * Florida Division of Certified Public Accounting Professional accounting bodies Professional associations based in the United States Accounting qualifications ","title":"Florida Institute of CPAs"},{"id":"13220265","title":"Syracuse Orange men's soccer"},{"id":"13220270","text":"Coleg Ceredigion is a bilingual further education college in Ceredigion, Wales.

Founded in 1908 by a group of 14 students, the Georgia Tech Band is one of the school's oldest student organizations. The Yellow Jacket Marching Band performs at all home football games, and the pep band, composed of a contingent of marching band members, plays at all home basketball games. At least a portion of the marching band or pep band travels to most away games, as financed by the Georgia Tech Athletic Association. History =Early years= :Includes the directorships of Robert L. Bidez (pre-1908-1912), Mike Greenblatt (1912-1913), and Frank Roman (1913-1929) Founded in 1908, the first band at Georgia Tech had only 14 members.Robert L. \\"Biddy\\" Bidez of Mobile, Alabama founded the Georgia Tech band in 1908 along with 13 other students. Bidez was the student leader of the band from its inception in 1908 until he graduated from the school in 1912 with a degree in Textiles. The band was first chartered on January 1, 1911, making it one of the school's oldest student organizations. M.A. \\"Mike\\" Greenblatt was a student who directed the band from the Fall of 1912 through 1913. Frank \\"Wop\\" Roman was Georgia Tech's first professional band leader. He came to Tech in 1913 to play piccolo in the band, and became the director the next fall. He continued until his death on December 19, 1928. He wrote Tech's Alma Mater, as well as the arrangements for Ramblin' Wreck and Up With the White and Gold. Georgia Tech was the first Southern college to have its songs recorded; they were marketed by the Columbia Graphophone Company starting on November 13, 1925. Since then, the songs have been published in a variety of compilations. The Iota chapter of Kappa Kappa Psi, a national honorary band fraternity, was founded under Roman's directorship in 1924. =Garing era= :Includes the directorship of A. J. Garing (1929-1946) In 1929, Major A. J. Garing was hired to replace Frank Roman. Garing was a member of the John Phillip Sousa Band. In 1931, Georgia Tech's Alma Mater and the fight song \\"Up With the White and Gold\\" were copyrighted. =Sisk era= :Includes the directorship of Ben Logan Sisk (1946-1975) Ben Logan Sisk succeeded Major Garing, and served as director until his retirement in 1975. In 1954, two of the nine women who were enrolled at Tech, Trombonist Teresa Thomas and flutist Paula Stevenson, became the first female members of the band. Also during his term as director, the Music Department was established under Tech's general college and participation in the band and other music programs could be counted as free elective academic credits. The band also found its first permanent home in the Crenshaw Building, which was behind the Varsity Drive-In on 3rd Street. During this time the band would march through the 3rd street tunnel under the Atlanta Downtown Connector to get to the football games at Grant Field. The fans would know the band was on its way because the drum corps would line the sides of the tunnel as the rest of the band marched through it. The echoing drums could be heard in the stadium. Georgia Tech eventually sold the Crenshaw Building and the land to the Varsity, and the band moved into the former Church of God, on the corner of Ferst Drive and Hemphill Avenue. In 1970, athletic director Bobby Dodd requested that the band no longer play Dixie at basketball games. Dodd later extended this request to football games as well. You've Said It All (Budweiser) was substituted for Dixie as the song played at the end of the third quarter of football games and during a later timeout in the second half of basketball games. The song was chosen because of the popularity of the song when the band had played it as part of an advertisement for the Atlanta Beverage Company. The Epsilon Theta chapter of Tau Beta Sigma, an honorary band sorority, was founded in 1973 as the counterpart to Kappa Kappa Psi. =From activity to academics= :Includes the directorship of Edward Bridges and Ken Durham (1975-1983) and part of James \\"Bucky\\" Johnson's directorship (1983-1995) Edward Bridges was hired as the band's new director in 1975. Bridges came from an assistant directorship of the band at the University of Georgia (of which he was also an alumnus) and was also retired from the Air Force. Bridges' style of leadership differed greatly from Sisk's and created immediate tensions between him and the band's student leadership, which had traditionally been in charge of the band's day-to-day operations. Some former band members have posited that this was intentional, that the Institute administration was looking to take back control of the band from the students. It is unclear whether Bridges' selection as director was done with or without the input of the band's leadership at the time; however, Bridges abolished the student leadership structure upon taking the position. The positions of band officers remained, but in a significantly diminished capacity. Eventually, the clash between Bridges' leadership style and the band's culture resulted in Bridges' departure. He was replaced by Ken Durham, who had been hired as assistant band director in 1976. Durham had been a music educator in Atlanta for many years and had directed the band at Headland High School in the 1960s. He served as the band's director until 1983 when he accepted a promotion at his job at Ameriprise. Despite tensions, the band, and in fact Tech's music program as a whole, underwent significant growth and changes during Bridges' tenure as band director and head of the music department. In the summer of 1975, the music department moved from the Crenshaw building to the Couch Building, formerly Couch Elementary School. In 1976, an institute restructuring moved the Music Department from the general college to the College of Sciences and Liberal Studies. This eventually allowed band members and members of other music programs to count their participation toward their degrees' humanities requirement rather than just a free elective. In 1977, the Georgia Tech Jazz Ensemble was officially established by several band members with Doug Richards as its director. Following its informal formation in 1974, the Jazz Ensemble faced significant resistance against its formation by the band's student leadership. Sisk's retirement, the selection of Bridges as the band's new director, and the subsequent dismantling of the student leadership structure established under Sisk proved beneficial for the Ensemble. Bridges is credited with saving the Jazz Ensemble from an \\"early extinction\\" by providing its members with encouragement and suggesting that they submit a petition to the school to establish their practice sessions as a course offering. The Jazz Ensemble is currently under the direction of Professor Ron Mendola. The Georgia Tech Band Alumni Association was founded in 1979. Following the departure of Ken Durham, James \\"Bucky\\" Johnson was hired as Tech's first full-time director of bands. During his directorship, the Georgia Tech Band Club underwent changes with a revision of the Constitution of the Georgia Tech Band in 1988. In 1991, the Music Department expanded even further and was moved under the College of Architecture. In 1992, Johnson was named chair of the Music Department, and in 1995 the school began offering a certificate in music. During halftime of the 1991 rivalry game at the University of Georgia, the band executed a prank that drew media attention and gained a level of notoriety. As the band took the field for its halftime performance, several band members carried a large tarp with the GT logo painted on it onto the field and used it to cover the logo painted at midfield commemorating UGA's football program's centennial. The band's performance could not be heard over the boos that were elicited from the home crowd. Reportedly, the stands remained full during the Georgia Tech band's performance and cleared out when the Redcoat Band took the field, as spectators delayed making trips to the concession stands in order to boo the Tech band's actions. Georgia Tech Marching Band performing a pregame routine in 2019 =Modern history= :Includes the rest of James \\"Bucky\\" Johnson's directorship (1995-2002) and Andrea Strauss and Chris Moore's joint directorship (2002-present) Leading up to the 1996 Olympic Games, Bucky Johnson was the director of the Atlanta Olympic Band in addition to being the director of the Georgia Tech Band. Prior to Atlanta winning the Olympic bid, Georgia Tech's pep band, and occasionally the entire marching band would dress in Olympic colors and play to greet dignitaries visiting the campus. The band marched in the parade celebrating Atlanta's selection as the 1996 Olympic host city. In 2000, the marching band and symphonic band were invited to play in the 2001 St. Patrick's Day festivities in Dublin, Ireland. The marching band played in the parade, and the symphonic band played a concert in conjunction with the Dublin Institute of Technology. Upon Johnson's retirement in 2002, the marching band had nearly tripled in size, reaching its current membership of around 350 students. Following Johnson's retirement, Andrea Strauss, formerly the assistant band director, was named Director of Bands and director of the Symphonic Band. Chris Moore was named Director of Athletic Bands. Tech's first degree program in music, a Master of Science in Music Technology was approved in 2006. In 2007, 15 alumni trumpet players made commitments in support of an endowment which would provide an annual scholarship to a Georgia Tech trumpet player. The endowment and scholarship were conceived as a way to honor deceased trumpet alumni. Since 2005, three Tech trumpet players died either while still in school or not long after graduating. Prior to Tech's football season opener against Notre Dame on 2007-09-01, 150 members of the Georgia Tech Marching Band performed at the College Football Hall of Fame. 2008 marked the band's centennial. Band members and band alumni have been encouraged to contribute their memories and stories for possible inclusion in a book, which was slated for release in the fall of 2008. The band was also invited to march in the 2008 Macy's Thanksgiving Day Parade as part of its centennial celebration. The full membership of the marching band participated in the trip to New York. Most recently, the marching band has been invited to play in Italy during Summer 2012 for a music festival. Traditions Georgia Tech Rat Cap inscription diagram. =RAT rules= Every year, a number of freshmen, most notably those in the marching band, wear gold caps known as RAT caps at each football game. RAT is short for Recruit At Tech, although freshmen are sometimes addressed as RATS, or \\"Recruits at Tech\\", the often cited \\"Recently Acquired Tech Student\\" is not the true meaning. The RAT caps are decorated with the football team's scores, the freshman's name, hometown, major, expected graduation date, and \\"To HELL With georgia\\" emblazoned on the back of the cap. Freshmen, or RATs, in the band are expected to wear their RAT caps during all official band functions, including rehearsals and football games. =RAT parents= The original duty of RAT Parents was to haze freshman members of the band and enforce RAT Rules. The modern role of RAT Parents is to welcome freshman band members, teach them Georgia Tech and band traditions, help them adjust to life at Tech and in the band and to act as a friend and advisor to them. In the early days of the tradition, there was just a Rat Mom, who was always a male band member. Since the mid-1980s, there has been both a RAT Mom and a RAT Dad, the latter of which is always a female band member. Until 1990, the selection of Rat Parents was fairly informal. From 1990 to 1993, RAT Parents were selected by the band's executive board, partly to keep the decision in the hands of the students. When the executive board was dissolved in 1993, the selection was made by the director of bands following an interview process. More recently, RAT Parents are directly elected by the band as a whole. New RAT Parents are announced along with the new drum majors for the upcoming year. =Alumni band= Founded in 1979, the Alumni Band's mission is to \\"help connect GT Band Alumni with current GT Band activities and to help support the GT Band.\\" Most of the Alumni Band's activities center around homecoming. It often plays along with the current marching band in the stands and on the field at homecoming games. The Alumni Band is significantly involved with the forthcoming publication of a book about the history of the Georgia Tech Band, slated for release in the fall of 2008 in celebration of the band's centennial. =Cross-Register= Through the Cross-Registration Program in the Georgia Board of Regents, students of other colleges and universities without similar music programs were allowed to march in Georgia Tech's marching band. Students from Agnes Scott College, Atlanta College of Art, Clark Atlanta University, Clayton College & State University, Columbia Theological Seminary, Emory University, Georgia Institute of Technology, Institute of Paper Science & Technology, Interdenominational Theological Center, Kennesaw State University, Mercer University Atlanta, Morehouse College, Morehouse School of Medicine, Morris Brown College, Oglethorpe University, Southern Polytechnic State University, and Spelman College were able to march in Georgia Tech's marching band after a successful audition process. With the inauguration of the Georgia State Marching Band in 2010, the Marching Band no longer accepts any new wind or percussion cross-registration students. Students who had previously marched in the Georgia Tech Marching Band were allowed to continue, pending a successful audition process. Marching Pregame Show The Georgia Tech Marching Band typically marches two shows each season, a pregame show and a halftime show. However, shows are sometimes modified or substituted in the case of a special event. The halftime show is different each season, but the pregame show remains largely the same from season to season. Among the more famous forms the band makes on the field are the interlocking \\"GT\\" and \\"Tech Tower\\"TECH Tower on the fieldThe \\"T\\" formation at 2008 game vs Miami. Both of these forms are a part of the pregame show. The \\"GT\\" is commonly photographed aerially and this photo is one of the most widely used pictures of the band.GT formation vs Miami 2008 It is also in this form that the football team, led by the Ramblin' Wreck, runs onto the field. Music Pregame warmup Starting in the 2007 football season, the marching band's pregame show has begun with the band's run-out from under the north stands of Bobby Dodd Stadium at Historic Grant Field. This pregame has included a work entitled \\"Fantasia on Georgia Tech Themes\\" by current band director Chris Moore. \\"Fantasia on Georgia Tech Themes\\" contains segments of the school's prominent songs (Ramblin' Wreck, White and Gold, and the Alma Mater).http://www.gtband.net/pregame.php The band marches from the north end zone to the south, reverses field and forms the block T, and finishes with forming the Tech Tower. The National Anthem is played facing the west stands, followed by the Alma Mater. Then the band continues with \\"White and Gold\\" while forming the interlocking GT on the field. The band remains in this formation while the pregame announcements and videos are played. The Ramblin' Wreck leads the football team from the northeast corner of the stadium to the west sidelines while the band plays \\"Ramblin' Wreck\\". The band exits the field in the GT formation to take its place in the center of the lower north stands for the game. This change in 2007 was the first time pregame music at GT had been edited in many years. Before entering the stadium, the band assembles at the amphitheater by the Kessler Campanile for pregame warmup. Next the band plays \\"Budweiser\\" at the Library, then assembles at Cherry Street and Bobby Dodd Way to follow the Ramblin' Wreck car, Ramblin' Reck Club members and Buzz mascot, and marches down The Hill to Bobby Dodd Stadium, playing \\"White and Gold\\" and \\"Ramblin' Wreck\\". The band joins thousands of fans and the cheerleaders, and takes its place on the stairway at Callaway Plaza outside the north end of the stadium, where it plays \\"O Fortuna\\", the \\"Fanfare\\", \\"White and Gold\\", and finishes with \\"Ramblin' Wreck\\" before entering the stadium for the pregame show detailed above. GT Marching Band in front of library The band's halftime themes have varied over the years to include Latin and jazz, the 70's, hits from the band Chicago, etc. In the stands, the band entertains during TV timeouts and revs up the crowd after plays on the football field. Favorites are the \\"Let's Go Tech\\" response cheer after First Down plays, the \\"Go Jackets!\\" cheer or \\"White and Gold\\" tag after productive offensive plays, \\"School's Out for Summer\\" or \\"Mortal Kombat\\" after big defensive plays, Chords before 3rd down defensive plays, and the ever-popular \\"Budweiser\\" song at the end of the third quarter. After a Georgia Tech touchdown, the band first plays \\"White and Gold,\\" followed by \\"Ramblin' Wreck\\" if extra points are scored. After field goals, the band plays \\"Ramblin' Wreck\\". Following GT wins, the band plays \\"White and Gold\\" and \\"Ramblin' Wreck\\" with the players singing along with the band and fans. After postgame announcements, the band's last song is \\"The Horse\\". For the second verse, the band members spread out as far as possible in the stadium. A new tradition is that fans‚Äîespecially The Swarm students in the north and northeast sections of the stadium‚Äîstay for \\"The Horse\\" to be played and dance along with the band. Student organizations =Kappa Kappa Psi= The Iota chapter of Kappa Kappa Psi was founded on April 21, 1924, making it the sixth oldest active chapter of Kappa Kappa Psi and the oldest active chapter in the southeastern United States. =Tau Beta Sigma= The Epsilon Theta chapter of Tau Beta Sigma was founded on 12 May 1973.

She is to children in Zimbabwe as Mr. Rogers was to children in the United States. Biography Ambuya Mlambo was born in what was then known as then Southern Rhodesia. She was raised in an orphanage run by Christian missionaries after the death of her mother: her father dropped her off at the orphanage at the age of five along with her younger sister. Despite colonial iniquities and growing up in the harsh conditions of an orphanage, she graduated with a teaching diploma. Ultimately she returned to school and received a diploma in nursing, and would serve as a nurse and midwife in her community. She distinguished herself as one of the very few women of that time who would excel in education despite the challenges of the time. She began broadcasting children's programs on a local channel in the late 1960s. Her shows were both educational and entertaining. She would write children's stories and read them on air. Often you would find children in the townships of Zimbabwe singing, dancing, and laughing along with her in front of a radio as they listened to her distinctive voice. The name \\"Ambuya\\" means grandmother, as she became known as everyone's grandmother. This was primarily because in the midst of the laughing and joking, she educated children about good behavior - like a grandmother would do. After independence, she began to broadcast her shows on TV. The children's shows were either recorded in the studio with children from the community or were broadcast at schools. Her radio and TV shows included Farai Vana Vadiki, Potonjere, Look and Learn, and Crystal Sweets Corner. Some were in English and some were in Shona. She also made appearances in several TV shows as an actress. Besides raising her own six children, she raised nearly eight other children in her household. She married John Mlambo (died 1975) and had six children. She has 16 grandchildren and six great-grandchildren. At the age of 76 she was honored with a Doctorate in Arts by the University of Zimbabwe. She continued to work with organizations that support children's causes. After independence in 1980 she remained in the township of Mbare while most Zimbabweans moved to more affluent areas. On July 16, 2007, Ambuya Mlambo, along with the Tumbuka Dance Company, opened the 50th anniversary of the National Gallery of Zimbabwe with a dance and act that focused on humility and tolerance.Herald Newspaper.

The battle took place in the town of Carpi and resulted in an Austrian victory, with the Neapolitans being driven from the town. Battle After Murat was defeated at the Battle of Occhiobello, the Neapolitan advance was stopped on the banks of the Po River. From here, the Austrians launched a counterattack against the Neapolitan position in northern Italy. A corps under the command of Bianchi was ordered to march of the Neapolitan position around Modena and drive the Neapolitans out of the duchy. Half of Bianchi's corps marched on the town of Carpi, whilst the other half were sent to cut off the Neaplotian line of retreat. The Austrians reached Carpi on 10 April, opening with an artillery barrage on the town's north gate. However, the Austrian column came through the south gate, surprising the Neapolitan garrison of 5,000 men commanded by Guglielmo Pepe and crushing any Neapolitan opposition. Having already received news of the defeat at Occhiobello, the Neapolitan morale crumbled and most of the surviving garrison deserted after the battle. Meanwhile, Michele Carascosa, who was in command of all the Neapolitan forces in the Duchy of Modena, realised the remaining troops were in danger of being surrounded, and ordered a general retreat from the area.

Bisected by the Egremont Road that was surveyed to link London with the Lake Huron shoreline in 1832, the township began to attract settlers including those helped by charitable organizations, such as Lord Sheffield's Petworth settlers, and retired soldiers from the British Army. A village by the same name was surveyed within the township where Bear Creek crossed the Egremont. The larger village of Watford was established to the southeast of Warwick Village when the Great Western Railway was established in the 1850s. Watford became an incorporated village in 1873 while parts of Warwick were removed for municipal purposes when the villages of Forest and Arkona were incorporated in the 1870s. With municipal restructuring in 2001, Watford and Warwick were merged. While agriculture remains a mainstay the township's location between the cities of London and Sarnia means that increasingly residents find work in these larger centres. Starting in 2005 a group of volunteers actively worked to research and write a detailed history of the township and collect a substantial archive of historical materials. The resulting history was published as The Township of Warwick: A Story Through Time in 2008. Subsequently, an archives of the materials was established at the Lambton Room in Wyoming, Ontario. In addition to Warwick and Watford, the township also includes the smaller communities of Birnam and Wisbeach. Watford village Watford was first settled in 1851 at what was known as Brown's Corners, a stagecoach stop between the village of Warwick and Brooke Township. The Great Western Railway was built in 1856 and caused the settlement to be relocated to its present location near the tracks. It was incorporated as the village of Watford in 1873. Watford was named either for the Watford in England, or by Col. Brown for his home town of Watford, Ireland. There was a great fire in the 1880s that destroyed much of the town during a Guy Fawkes Night celebration. In 1972, Watford Roof Truss started manufacturing wood trusses for delivery in the Southwestern Ontario and Southern Michigan markets. Watford Roof Truss is still a major employer in the town.

Vineta was laid down at the AG Vulcan shipyard in 1895, launched in April 1897, and commissioned into the Navy in July 1898. The ship, named for the semi-legendary medieval town of Vineta, was armed with a battery of two 21 cm guns and eight 15 cm guns and had a top speed of . Vineta served abroad in the American Station for the first several years of her career. While on station in the Americas, she participated in the Venezuela Crisis of 1902‚Äì1903 and bombarded several Venezuelan fortresses. She returned to Germany in 1905 and was used as a torpedo training ship in 1908. She was modernized in 1909-1911, after which she was used as a school ship for naval cadets. In November 1912, she participated in an international naval protest of the First Balkan War. At the outbreak of World War I, Vineta was mobilized into V Scouting Group, but served in front-line duty only briefly. She was used as a barracks ship after 1915, and ultimately sold for scrapping in 1920. Design Line-drawing of the Victoria Louise class In the early 1890s, elements in the German naval command structure grappled with what type of cruiser ought to be built to fulfill the various needs of the fleet. The Reichsmarineamt (RMA‚ÄîImperial Navy Office) preferred to build a combination of large cruisers of around along the lines of and significantly smaller vessels of about to support them, while the Oberkommando der Marine (Naval High Command) argued that a uniform force of cruisers was preferable. In the event, the RMA carried the day and three 6,000-ton cruisers were authorized in 1895. They resembled the larger s, designed at the same time, albeit at reduced scale. Vineta was long overall and had a beam of and a draft of forward. As designed, she displaced , and at full load, her displacement rose to . Her propulsion system consisted of three vertical 4-cylinder triple-expansion steam engines, each driving a single screw propeller, with steam provided by twelve coal-fired D√ºrr boilers. Her engines were rated for , and provided a top speed of . The ship had a range of approximately at . She had a crew of 31 officers and 446 enlisted men. The ship was armed with two 21 cm SK L/40 guns in single turrets, one forward and one aft. The guns were supplied with 58 rounds of ammunition each. They had a range of . Vineta also carried eight 15 cm SK L/40 guns. Four were mounted in turrets amidships and the other four were placed in casemates. These guns had a range of . She also carried ten 8.8 cm SK L/35 naval guns. The gun armament was rounded out by machine guns. She was also equipped with three torpedo tubes with eight torpedoes, two launchers were mounted on the broadside and the third was in the bow, all below the waterline. The ship was protected with Krupp armor; their deck was on the horizontal with sloped sides that were thick. Her main and secondary battery turrets had 10 cm thick sides and the secondary casemates had the same level of protection. The conning tower had 15 cm thick sides. Service history Vineta was ordered under the contract name \\"M\\" and was laid down at the Imperial Dockyard in Danzig in 1896. She was launched on 9 December 1897, after which fitting-out work commenced. She was commissioned into the German navy on 13 September 1899. Following her commissioning in 1899, Vineta was sent overseas. Her commander was Kapit√§n zur See (Captain at Sea) Da Fonseca-Wollheim. The ship was assigned to the American Station, along with the unprotected cruiser and the gunboat . In May 1900, Vineta inspected Margarita Island for its potential as a naval base, but the Germans determined the port was insufficient for their purposes. In late 1901, Vineta and the unprotected cruiser were sent to Venezuela in a show of force to compel the Venezuelan government to make reparations for grievances related to internal conflicts in the 1890s. Starting in December 1902, Vineta participated in the German naval contingent in the Venezuela Crisis of 1902‚Äì1903. A British merchant ship had been boarded and its crew arrested by Venezuelan forces on 13 December; in response, British forces bombarded the forts at Puerto Cabello, and enlisted Vineta in the attack. Vineta was tasked with shelling the fortresses Libertador and Vigia. In January 1903, the gunboat attacked Fort San Carlos in Maracaibo, but was repulsed. Vineta therefore was sent to silence the guns on 21 January. During the bombardment of the fort, Vineta set it afire and destroyed the fortress.The New York Times, 23 January 1903, GERMAN COMMANDER BLAMES VENEZUELANS; Commodore Scheder Says That Fort San Carlos Fired First. In 1903, one of Vinetas 15 cm ammunition magazines exploded, but did not cause major damage to the ship. The accident had significant long-term consequences, however, as it exposed the volatility of German propellant charges. The Germans therefore reworked the composition of the propellant, which was in service by 1914. This new, more stable propellant saved several German battlecruisers from destruction when their magazines were penetrated by British shells during World War I. In January 1904, the ship visited New Orleans with the rest of the American Squadron, which at that time included Falke, Panther, and . Vineta was detached from the American Squadron and returned to Germany in 1905. She was used as a torpedo training ship starting in 1908. In 1909, she went to dry dock at the Imperial Dockyard in Danzig for a refit, during which she was re- boilered. Vineta originally had three stacks, and during the modernization they were trunked into two funnels. The refit was finished by 1911, at which point Vineta became a cadet training ship. The ship cruised in the western Mediterranean in the autumn of 1912, along with her sister . The old cruiser Geier was also in the region. As the Bulgarian army was poised to march on Constantinople during the First Balkan War, the Great Powers deployed a naval force to ensure the safety of foreign nationals in the Ottoman Empire. Vineta and the battlecruiser were sent to Constantinople as part of this force. The international fleet sent ashore a force of around 3,000 officers and men. The force was withdrawn to Crete after a ceasefire seemed imminent, but by February fighting again broke out, and the island was seized by Greece. On 23 January 1914, Vineta was in Haiti, when Michel Oreste abdicated from the presidency. He sought refuge aboard the ship, which landed marines along with the American armored cruiser in Port-au-Prince to prevent rioting in the capital. Vineta had a short career during World War I. At the outbreak of hostilities, she was briefly mobilized into V Scouting Group, which was tasked with training cadets in the Baltic Sea. By the end of 1914, however, the ships were again removed from service. She was then put into service as a coastal defense ship. After 1915, she was withdrawn from front-line duty again and employed as a barracks ship at the Imperial Dockyard in Kiel. She was stricken from the naval register on 6 December 1919 and sold to ship-breakers in Harburg. She was scrapped the following year.

Between wars, the USMC sustained limited sniper training but not enough to compete with other countries during WWII. During 1955-1956, the Army Marksmanship Training Unit operated the first US Army Sniper School at Camp Perry, Ohio. Unfortunately a lack of understanding, and appreciation for the effectiveness and potential that snipers could add to the fight, caused sniper training to be abandoned after this short training period. During the Korean War, Snipers were used during the first recapture of Inchon, Seoul, and the Battle of Chosin. When the war went into its static period in 1951 the Army and Marines as in WW I and WW II were deadly, especially during this static defense period of the war. Fifty (.50) caliber weapons with scopes were also used for sniping purposes by the U.S. The favorite was a M2 .50 caliber machine gun with a target scope attached; due to the weight, this system was not very mobile. Major advances were implemented in sniper tactical mission planning, information gathering, harassing and delaying the enemy. The top sniper of Korea was Sgt Boindot from the U.S. Army with 70 confirmed kills. After the Korean War, the U.S. sniper program was again discontinued. In Viet Nam, on July 1968, the US Army began centralized training in-country. The 9th Infantry Division established one of the first in-country Sniper Schools. The course, run by Major Willis Powell, lasted 18 days with the failure rate being 50%. In December 1968, a full complement of seventy-two snipers were ready for action. The US Army Sniper School was established in 1987, at the Infantry Center at Fort Benning, GA, and continues to produce top-notch snipers today. It‚Äôs continuous existence reflects the longest sniper training course in the history of the US Army and is a testament to the high priority sniper training now enjoys among the Army‚Äôs leadership. Following the terrorist attacks on the World Trade Center buildings, the U.S. military entered into combat operations in Afghanistan under Operation Enduring Freedom. Snipers proved themselves as an invaluable asset due to their ability to engage targets at great distances in a mountainous battlefield.https://www.armysniperassociation.org/about/history/ Purpose The Army Sniper Course trains selected individuals in the skills necessary to deliver long range precision fire and the collection of battlefield information.

According to statements by De Andr√© within his posthumous autobiography \\"Una goccia di splendore\\" [\\"A drop of brightness\\"], released in 2011, his collaboration with Francesco De Gregori, which gave birth to four of the eight songs on the album, originated when De Andr√© saw his colleague live on stage in Rome and was very impressed. Afterwards, he invited De Gregori to visit him in his rural house in Sardinia, where the two of them spent a month \\"getting drunk together and writing songs in the meantime.\\" Track listing All songs written by Fabrizio De Andr√© and Francesco De Gregori, except where indicated. #\\"La Cattiva Strada\\" ‚Äì 4:33 #\\"Oceano\\" ‚Äì 3:11 # \\"Nancy\\" (Leonard Cohen, translation by De Andr√©) ‚Äì 3:57 # \\"Le Storie di ieri\\" (Francesco De Gregori) ‚Äì 3:15 #\\"Giugno '73\\" (De Andr√©) ‚Äì 3:31 # \\"Dolce Luna\\" ‚Äì 3:25 # \\"Canzone per l'estate\\" ‚Äì 5:21 # \\"Amico fragile\\" (De Andr√©) \\\\- 5:29 The songs All of the songs on the album marked a stylistic shift in De Andr√©'s lyrics, which became more poetical, more complex and less immediate than anything he released earlier. Reviewers at the time criticized the changes, and attributed them to the influence of De Gregori, who was known for writing stylized, not-readily- understandable lyrics which he was not always able to explain. Still, \\"Giugno '73\\" and \\"Amico fragile\\" were both written by De Andr√© on his own before he met De Gregori, and feature the same linguistic and poetical depth as the rest of the album. He would return to his usual storytelling style on his next album, Rimini, co-written with the Veronese folk songwriter Massimo Bubola. *\\"La cattiva strada\\" [literally \\"The bad road\\", but more properly rendered as \\"The errant way\\"] is about an unnamed man (or boy - his age is not explicitly defined)In a spoken introduction from a 28 November 1975 live performance in Brescia, De Andr√© jokingly states that the song \\"was written for and about a friend of [his], called Jesus Christ.\\" [I concerti 2012 box set, CD 2, track 15.] who corrupts various people in various situations; all of the people he meets end up following him along his \\"errant way\\". At the end of the song, however, the protagonist displays his intention to disappear for good; he warns the people around him (who see him as either purely evil or purely good) that following him is ultimately worthless, wherever he may go, and De Andr√©, identifying with him, philosophically concludes that \\"there is love, a little love for everyone, and everyone has a love, along the errant way.\\" *\\"Oceano\\" [\\"Ocean\\"] is an enigmatic, cryptic song, quite obscure and hard to interpret, whose lyrics were written by De Gregori as a dedication to Cristiano De Andr√©, Fabrizio's young son. Cristiano was fascinated by De Gregori's 1973 song \\"Alice\\", whose first lines say: \\"Alice looks at the cats and the cats look into the sun.\\" When Cristiano asked De Gregori why Alice was looking at the cats and not at something else (like a streetlamp, or a bush, or a tree), the latter was unable to reply, but wrote \\"Oceano\\" instead. The song mentions a child who asks questions about green fields, rooms and the sea, possibly representing Cristiano, and a woman who is in love with a poet, a possible portrait of Dori Ghezzi. * \\"Nancy\\" is a translated version of Leonard Cohen's song \\"Seems So Long Ago, Nancy\\", originally from his Songs from a Room album. The lyrics are about the true story of a young girl from Montr√©al who committed suicide. * \\"Le storie di ieri\\" [\\"The stories from yesterday\\"], written entirely by De Gregori (who re-recorded the song on his album Rimmel in the same year) is about the choice of fascist ideology and its subsequent transformation into the MSI (post-fascist Italian party). * \\"Giugno '73\\" [\\"June '73\\"], one of the few songs which De Andr√© wrote entirely by himself after 1967, is a highly metaphorical and idealized account of the start of his relationship with Dori Ghezzi. Autobiographical details mentioned in the lyrics include Ghezzi's mother's open hostility to De Andr√©, as he was \\"a married man, and morover, a singer\\" (he was still married to Enrica \\"Puny\\" Rignon at the time), as well as Ghezzi's scorn of her partner's male friends, described as shabbily dressed (\\"All of my friends are kind to you, but their clothes look a bit weird; you tell me I should bring them to a tailor's, and you ask me: 'Are they the best ones we have tonight?' \\"), and (initially) of De Andr√© himself (\\"Just wait for a more trustworthy lover\\"). *\\"Dolce Luna\\" [\\"Sweet Moon\\"] is a portrait of an old drunken man, possibly a former sailor, who roams the streets at night while reminiscing about a rugged and varied sea life (including a whale named \\"Sweet Moon\\"), which he may have never lived. In the last verse, the man speaks in the first person to a woman, possibly his wife, about wanting a son; he states not to care whether the boy will learn to swim or not, but he is sure that his son will be born with as big a desire for a seafaring life as his own. *\\"Canzone per l'estate\\" [\\"Song for the summer\\"] features shared lyrics written over a previously existing piece of music by De Gregori. The words, a second-person Throughout the song, the person described in the lyrics is referred to as \\"you\\". autobiographical portrait of De Andr√© as seen by someone else, describe the tension between the bourgeois life he grew up in and lived much of his life in, and his attraction to anarchism and to society's outcasts, who seemed to him more genuine and alive than the upper classes.From Fabrizio De Andr√© in English, a blog containing translations into English of De Andr√©'s entire ≈ìuvre. * \\"Amico fragile\\" [\\"Frail friend\\"], also written entirely by De Andr√©, is a detached and cynical account, delivered through seemingly unconnected images in the form of a stream of consciousness monologue, of an evening De Andr√© spent with a group of friends, during which everybody (including himself) got drunk; the singer-songwriter was forced to sing in spite of him not really wanting to, and, in his intoxicated state, exposed all of his friends' vices and defects in an improvised bawdy songThe tune to which De Andr√© improvised his bawdy lyrics is not known, but it bore no resemblance to \\"Amico fragile\\", entirely written afterwards. The 2018 biopic Fabrizio De Andr√©: Principe libero [i.e. \\"Free prince\\"] includes a scene where the singer, portrayed by Luca Marinelli, sings a parody of \\"Il pescatore\\" using vulgar, scurrilous lyrics., interspersed with a series of truthful but unpleasant spoken comments; later on, when his friends had left, he retreated into his garage and wrote the song in a few minutes on the basis of those comments, some of which were incorporated into the final lyrics without any changes. (e.g. \\"Do you know I've lost two children?\\" \\"Lady, you are a pretty distracted woman!\\") The story behind the song was told by Cristiano De Andr√© in two separate orccasions: first as a voice-over narrator for the 2011 8-DVD anthology/documentary series Dentro Faber [\\"Inside Faber\\"], about De Andr√©'s life and works (his account of \\"Amico fragile\\" is within the fifth disc of the series, L'anarchia - \\"Anarchy\\"), and later in an interview excerpt featured in the short documentary video Filming Around Tour, about his 2009-2010 tribute tour, released as a bonus DVD with a live album recorded during the tour. The title, an unnamed friend's depiction of De Andr√© as an extremely sensitive and needful person, has since become a common way to identify De Andr√© himself, especially in the various tributes produced after his passing.

They were originally signed with Philadelphia-based Chancellor Records and later with Warner Bros. Records, but their biggest success came at MGM Records. They were associated with producers Teddy Randazzo, writer- producer for Little Anthony & The Imperials in the 1960s, and Bill Medley of The Righteous Brothers. Origin of group The two Ross sisters formed their musical group while attending high school in Baltimore. They practiced after class with their cousin, Veronica Brown, and friend, Terry Jones. When they began performing together in 1962, the group took its name from the Royal, a theater located in the 1300 block of Pennsylvania Avenue in Baltimore. Built in 1921, the theater was razed in 1970. Discography The Royalettes' biggest hit was \\"It's Gonna Take a Miracle\\" in 1965, charting at #41 on the Billboard Hot 100 and #28 on the Billboard R&B; chart. The song has since had more success as a cover, first by Laura Nyro in 1971 and later by Deniece Williams in 1982 who charted in the Top 10 and reached the #1 spot in the R&B; chart. The Royalettes had another hit in 1965 with \\"I Want to Meet Him\\" (#72 Hot 100, #26 R&B;). MGM released two albums by the group, produced by Teddy Randazzo who also arranged the records and co-wrote most of the songs. Randazzo gave the group a big production sound with a full orchestra, but despite the overall quality of the tracks and critical acclaim for their live performances, a major success eluded the group. A final single produced by Bill Medley also failed to chart and the group moved on to Roulette Records in 1967 before breaking up two years later. Afterward, Sheila worked briefly as a backup singer for The Three Degrees and had two solo single releases in the early 1970s. A CD retrospective was released in late 2010 of all their MGM tracks including the 27 songs produced by Randazzo for the two albums plus another three originally released on a single.

The school was a higher education institution offering a one-year M.Sc. in various renewable energy technologies, continuing education, and an undergraduate summer school program. All instructions and correspondence are in English. Established in 2006, the school formally commenced its operations in April, 2007, through a series of Declarations of Cooperation with universities in Iceland, involving the Icelandic Ministry of Education. and other institutions and energy and engineering firms. The school is owned and operated by Shareholders, a non-profit company whose shareholders include prominent energy and financial companies in Iceland.  Accreditation  RES graduates its students through its affiliation with the University of Iceland and the University of Akureyri. Both universities are accredited higher education institution in Iceland under the recent Higher Education Act in Iceland, No. 63/2006, for each of its academic subject areas. This accreditation covers RES's subject areas.  Academic program  RES offered an international program of graduate-level study in renewable energy science. All instructions and correspondence are in English. RES offered a 90 credit M.Sc. degree in renewable energy science with five specializations; geothermal energy, fuel cell systems and technologies, biofuels and bioenergy, hydropower and energy systems and policies. The school hoped to add more specializations in areas such as solar power, and wind and wave power. The graduate programme concluded in an MSc Degree in Renewable Energy Science, awarded in affiliation with Iceland's state universities: University of Iceland and the University of Akureyri. Each area of specialization at RES consisted of a series of intensive 1-3 week modules that carry 2-6 ECTS credits each. Each series of modules included field trips to sites related to Iceland's energy industry, known for its use of renewable resources. Students take an exam following the completion of each module and a final exam at the end of the trimester. The final degree requirement was a 30 credit Master's Thesis.  Faculty  Teaching staff of RES were researchers and professors from Iceland, energy experts from engineering and energy consulting firms, and various international experts from research universities in Europe, North and South America and Asia. In the academic year, 2010‚Äì11, 65 international experts were teaching in the M.Sc. Degree Program, 35 from abroad and 30 Icelandic. In addition to the RES professors, 16 research scientists, primarily from Icelandic energy and engineering companies, acted as students' Thesis Advisors during the academic year 2009-10.  Students  During the first year of the M.Sc. Degree Program in Renewable Energy Science, 2008-9, RES graduated 30 candidates from 9 different countries - coming from Poland (16), Slovakia (3), Hungary (3), Slovenia (2), United States (2), Germany (1), Portugal (1), Estonia (1), and Russia (1). During the second year, 2009‚Äì10, RES graduated 35 candidates from 11 countries in February 2010 - from Poland (14), United States (7), Mexico (3), Iceland (2), Slovakia (2), Hungary (2), Chile (1), Kazakhstan (1), Estonia (1), Finland (1), and Slovenia (1). During the third year of the M.Sc. Degree Program, RES is scheduled to graduate in February 2011 all together 49 candidates from 12 countries - coming from Poland (27), United States (8), Iceland (4), Canada (2), Spain (1), Estonia (1), Slovenia (1), Slovakia (1), Germany (1), Malaysia (1), France/Somalia (1), and Russia (1).  Tuition  Tuition for the M.Sc. programs at RES was 18.800 ‚Ç¨ for the full one-year program.  Scholarships and grants  Each academic year RES provided a limited number of RES Scholarships to exceptional students which have been accepted to the M.Sc. Degree Program. There are three types of RES Scholarships: 1\\\\. RES Scholarship Awards which were earmarked students coming from our partner universities in Europe, North-America and elsewhere. These awards are based on signed cooperation agreements between RES and each foreign partner university. The awards can include half (50%) or full (100%) tuition waivers. 2\\\\. RES Scholarship Awards for students applying to RES from non- partner universities or organizations. These awards included half (50%) tuition waivers. In few cases, and then primarily for students from developing countries this award could include full (100%) tuition waivers. 3\\\\. RES Scholarship Awards provided by a grant from the Icelandic National Power Company Landsvirkjun. These awards were only awarded to students enrolled in the Hydropower Specialization and included full (100%) tuition waivers for up to five students, each academic year. None of these awards covered living expenses (accommodation and meals; flights to and from Akureyri, Iceland). Also it may be required that students cover additional costs related their thesis work such as travel costs, if their thesis research is not done in Iceland.  Admission and requirements  Requirement for admission to the M.Sc. Program in Renewable Energy Science at RES was a B.Sc. degree with top grades in engineering or physical/natural sciences (chemistry, physics, geology, biotechnology, and related fields). Students had to demonstrate a good understanding of English, both in reading and writing. Applicants must prove their ability to follow a postgraduate course in English. The RES Academic Board evaluates each student's application, transcripts, letters of recommendations, and other supporting documents, and accepts those students for admission that fulfill all requirements for the M.Sc. Degree Program and have the highest grades.  Summer school  RES offered several summer courses for foreign students independently and also in collaboration with study-abroad organizations, such as the School for International Training. These courses combine classroom and field studies for a specialized two-week program and also 6-8 week program.

A PDF of the book is downloadable under a Creative Commons Noncommercial Sharealike license.Wealth of Networks wiki. Berkman Center for Internet & Society at Harvard University. Last accessed 16 Feb 2012. Benkler has said that his editable online book is \\"an experiment of how books might be in the future\\", demonstrating how authors and readers might connect instantly or even collaborate. Summary =Part 1: The Networked Information Economy= Benkler describes the current epoch as a \\"moment of opportunity\\" due to the emergence of what he terms the Networked Information Economy (NIE), a \\"technological-economic feasibility space\\" that is the result of the means of producing media becoming more socially accessible. Benkler states that his methodology in the text is to look at social relations using economics, liberal political theory, and focuses on individual actions in nonmarket relations. Benkler sees communication and information as the most important cultural and economic outputs of advanced economies. He traces the emergence and development of various communications (radio, newspapers, television) through the 19th and 20th centuries as functions of increasingly centralized control due to the high cost factor of production, and believes that media was thus produced on an industrial scale. Benkler's term for this is the Industrial information economy. With the emergence of computers, networks, and increasingly affordable media production outlets, Benkler introduces the concept of the NIE, which sees media access as a form of power, and recognizes decentralized individual actions in said media as a result of the removal of physical and economic constraints to the creation of media. To Benkler, this is due to a new feasibility space: lowered costs of access via digital production and radical decentralization rather than centralized messaging (\\"coordinate coexistence\\", 30). This results in emerging productions of information that use non-proprietary strategies (such as GNU licences and collaborative production formats). Goods The forms of cultural productions ‚Äî music is an example Benkler uses frequently ‚Äî are either rival or nonrival. Rival products decrease as they are used (e.g. pounds of flour), the use of nonrival products (e.g. listening to a song) does not decrease their availability for further use. Static vs. dynamic efficiency: one premise of exclusive rights has always been that only financial incentives can facilitate participation in information production. Benkler argues that in an age where computers reduce the cost of production, that the equation of innovation-to-rights shifts as well. The declining cost of communication means that in the networked society there are fewer barriers for individual cultural production that are \\"meaningful\\" to other users. Thus, in network economy, \\"human capacity becomes primary scarce resource\\". Peer production To close this section, Benkler argues that the networked environment makes possible a new modality of organizing production: that of commons-based peer production. He discusses the parameters of the commons and gives the example of Free/Libre/Open Source Software. He discusses shared acts of communication (utterances, reviews, distribution of information) and goods (like server space). Lastly, he draws a contrast to the regulation and rival resource of radio spectrum bandwidth and the sharability of space in a digital commons. The economics of social production Benkler argues here that the networked society allows for the emergence of non-hierarchical groups that are committed to information production. Open software is one of the ways we can view the emergence of this new form of information production. \\"Commons-based\\" peer production eschews traditional rational choice models offered by economists. Benkler details some of the key components of this new economy based not on financial remuneration but on user-involvement, accreditation, and tools that promote collaboration between individuals. In order to understand why people engage in production aside from financial incentives, Benkler argues that we can distinguish two types of motivation: # Extrinsic motivation: motivation that comes from outside in the form of financial reward, punishment, etc. # Intrinsic motivation: motivation that derives from within ourselves, such as the pleasure involved in completing a task. =Part 2: The Political Economy of Property and Commons= In this section, Benkler examines the relationship of individual access to participation in the dissemination and creation of information via communication systems, building on his earlier ideas of commons-based peer production. He examines the historical emergence of the mass media, looking at the relationship between print and radio and ever-broadening, industrial broadcast models of production which became supported by advertising. The criticisms of mass media which Benkler brings up include: * its commercialism, because he sees that as supporting the development of programs that appeal to large audiences rather than specific interests, in the name of mass broadcasting; * limited intake of information, due to the relatively small number of people gathering information; * too much power assigned to too few people. Benkler moves from this overview and criticism to exploring what this text describes as the potential for networked communications to do: :\\"Better access to knowledge and the emergence of less capital-dependent forms of productive social organization offer the possibility that the emergence of the networked information economy will offer up opportunities for improvement in economic justice, on scales both global and local.\\" From passive to active For Benkler, another key component of the network society is that individuals are more active in producing their education and cultural production. Online encyclopedias such as Wikipedia allow for users to create rather than just consume knowledge and information. =Part 3: Policies of Freedom at a Moment of Transformation= Benkler begins chapter 10 stating two early views on the anticipated social impact the internet would have on the users and their community: Firstly, the internet removed the user from society and allowed the individual to lead a life that was no longer molded by the interactions and experiences of a physical tangible civilisation with others. The second view was that using the internet would widen the field of a user's community by providing a novel system of communication and interaction. He observes that users show enhanced relationships with their close contacts while increasing the numbers of less close contacts with relationships maintained through internet mediated interaction. He believes this latter change stems from the shift from the one-to-many model of media distribution to a many-to-many model where it is more user centered and controlled. Benkler remarks that the early views were made on the premise that internet communication would replace real world forms communication rather than co-exist alongside it. He introduces the idea of the networked-individual who govern their own interactions and microcommunity roles in both real and virtual space and dynamically switch between when needed, eventually concluding that the early views were nostalgic and somewhat fatuous. A definition is offered whereby cultural freedom occupies a position that relates to both political and individual autonomy, but is synonymous with neither. Benkler then goes on to add that culture is significant because that is the context within which we exist ‚Äì these are our shared understandings, frameworks, meanings and references. Reception 2011-08 Haifa Wikimania Yochai Benkler DSCF6547 When Benkler's The Wealth of Networks was released in 2006, Lawrence Lessig announced the release of the book on his blog, stating: ‚ÄúThis is‚Äîby far‚Äîthe most important and powerful book written in the fields that matter most to me in the last ten years. If there is one book you read this year, it should be this.‚Äù The Wealth of Networks has been reviewed by many other blogs in addition to the Lessig blog, including Rough Type, Dreams in Digital, ', and Reading Media Under The Tree. The book has been reviewed in The German Law Journal and The Independent Review. Book reviews of The Wealth of Networks have also been featured by several news publications, including The Financial Times, The Times, and the New Statesmen. In addition to book reviews, interviews with Yochai Benkler about The Wealth of Networks have been conducted and published by openDemocracy.net, openBusiness.cc, and Public Knowledge, and Benkler was invited to give a lecture based on The Wealth of Networks at the Center for American Progress on May 31, 2006. Less than a month after its release in 2006, The Wealth of Networks became the focus of an intense read and review seminar on the famous political blog Crooked Timber. After reading the book, six well-respected scholars (several of them founding members of crookedtimbre.org) posted their reactions to the book, and at the end of the seminar, Yochai Benkler was given the opportunity to respond to the comments. =Writing style= In terms of Benkler's writing style, criticism on Crooked Timber targeted two main points: 1) that the book is written in a style that is too dense for the average reader, and 2) that it attempts to cover too many topics. As Dan Hunter points out in his review titled ‚ÄúA General Theory of Information Policy‚Äù, The Wealth of Networks is an attempt to articulate an underlying, grander ‚Äúwhole‚Äù that ties together the myriad issues involved in information policy and the internet. Hunter states: \\"Benkler provides something close to a General Theory of Information Policy for the networked age that begins to explain how we should think about topics as different as spectrum policy, copyright, user-generated content, network neutrality‚Ä¶well, the list pretty much encompasses all questions within internet law and policy.\\" Hunter's main criticism of the book is that it is too academically dense for the average reader, and too reliant on assuming the reader is familiar with several internet organizations and websites, such as Wikipedia, PayPal, and Slashdot. As Hunter later states: :\\"I‚Äôm worried that too many of the peer-producers‚Äîthe blog writers, the open source software gurus, the amateurs who create for the love of it; in short the people who this book is written about‚Äîwill pick up this work in the hope of understanding how their creativity fits into the grand scheme of innovation, and what their role will be in the amateur production sphere that promises to change the way that we view information goods within society. And they may not get past the introduction.\\" =Physical hardware and infrastructure= Another criticism of Benkler's theory is that so much focus is given to the potential of peer- production and innovation in the networked information economy, but little to no attention spent addressing issues related to the physical hardware required to keep the network that Benkler's theories rely on up and running. In a review of the book by Siva Vaidhyanathan, Benkler's ‚Äúsoft technological determinism‚Äù is brought under fire. Vaidhyanathan states: :\\"This one issue remains underwritten in the text: the story of the technology itself. Throughout the text, there seems to be an almost givenness about the technology. TCP/IP is just there. Even Cisco‚Äôs notorious discriminating servers, the source of so much tension over the end of network neutrality, just appear‚Ä¶. We get a sense that particular technologies are malleable, adaptable, contingent, and socially shaped. We get no account of developer‚Äôs wishes or users‚Äô adaptions. We only get cursory accounts of the conflicts over the future of these technologies that have unleashed (to choose a loaded term) so much creativity.\\" Benkler addressed this criticism in his response to Vaidhyanathan's review, conceding that perhaps more attention to the physical elements of the networked information economy could have been given: :\\"His [Vaidhyanathan‚Äôs] complaint ... is that I wrote a book about how the dynamics of technology, society, economy, and law intersect to fundamentally alter how information, knowledge, and culture are produced, rather than a book about the dynamics of how the technology component itself got to be as it is, and how it may or may not change given present pressures ... not every book can be about everything. Perhaps Vaidhyanathan is correct that a book that offers as broad a canvass as this on the networked information environment needs a chapter on the technology itself: where it originates and what are the dynamics and pressures, historically and today, that led to its past and that affect its future.\\" In a review of the book by Ben Peters, a similar sentiment to Vaidhyanathan's criticism is expressed: ‚ÄúIt may also do very well to account for massive information infrastructure costs, the fiber optic cables, the wifi, and the laptops that the Benkler's optimism depends upon in the international development scene.‚Äù In The Independent Review: A Journal of Political Economy, Peter G. Klein stated: :\\"Although information itself cannot be ‚Äúowned,‚Äù the tangible media in which information is embedded and transmitted are scarce economic goods. Information may yearn to be ‚Äúfree,‚Äù but cables, switches, routers, disk drives, microprocessors, and the like yearn to be owned. Such innovations do not spring from nowhere; they are the creations of profit-seeking entrepreneurs that consumers or other entrepreneurs purchase to use as they see fit.\\" =Optimism= Derek Belt, who reviewed the book on his blog titled ‚ÄúDreaming in Digital‚Äù, targeted Benkler's optimism as his main point of criticism, suggesting that Benkler's optimism was too rooted in what was possible in the future, neglecting to take into consideration the position in which we as a society find ourselves in at the present time in relation to information policy. He states: :\\"His unwavering belief in the greater good offers hope for the future but fails to adequately address the present, leaving readers to wonder what he would have said about the prospects of another decade in which the industrial information economy, backed by powerful lobbyists and defiant legislative activity, holds all of the cards. Would our future look so cheery then?\\" In contrast to these attacks on Benkler's optimism, a review by Debora Halbert suggested that: :\\"Although he is generally pro-technology, especially regarding the Internet, Benkler is not a techno-utopianist. He argues that techno-utopianists who see the Internet as a perfect public platform are incorrect, but so are the technophobes who believe the Internet simply leads to increasing fragmentation and alienation. He seeks to strike a middle ground, arguing that the industrial media model of central control over mass communication fits nicely with authoritarian structures.\\" Jack Balkin, a participant on in the Crooked Timber read and review took a similar stance in his interpretation of Benkler's optimism, stating: :\\"Benkler‚Äôs book wavers between an optimistic description of what the digitally networked economy has produced and will produce and a warning that these bounties will be squandered if the legal regime goes in the wrong direction‚Ä¶as much as Benkler might wish that features of the digitally networked environment and information economics will lead us inevitably toward a blessed world of peer production, he well understands that the political economy of information production has repeatedly pushed the law along a different path. Benkler shows us a vibrant world that we are moving toward and might yet achieve; but it is up to us to realize it.\\" The Wealth of Networks has been criticized for technological determinism. David M. Berry contends that Benkler's work builds on \\"a rather shaky binary distinction between proprietary industrial forms of economic and technological structure and non- proprietary peer-production models\\".Berry, David M, (2008) \\"The poverty of networks\\". Theory, Culture & Society 25(7‚Äì8): 364‚Äì372 Berry challenges Benkler's assumptions that network fosters non-proprietary models and that the latter are sounder and ethically preferable to the former model. According to Berry, Benkler fails to recognize that should network forms of organization happen to be wealth generating, \\"they will be co-opted into mainstream ‚Äòindustrial‚Äô ways of production. To paraphrase Steve Jobs, the corporate world may soon provide peer-production for the rest of us.\\"Berry, 2008: 369 Johan S√∂derberg links Benkler's optimism towards networked modes of production to a larger current of thought generated by the hacker community. Drawing on Serge Proulx' work, S√∂derberg asserts that such a narrative, neoliberal in origin, recomposes the discussion on information society in a problematic way: \\"The fantasy of a frictionless market in information is transformed into a vision of an information-sharing society\\".S√∂derberg, Johan (2013). \\"Determining social change: The role of technological determinism in the collective action framing of hackers\\". New media & society 15(8): 1277‚Äì1293 =The future of information policy and network development= Although The Wealth of Networks has been the target of pointed criticism, the vast majority of published reviews are very emphatic about the fact that despite certain criticisms, The Wealth of Networks is an incredibly important book, and brings to the table many issues that are pertinent to the future of information policy and network development. Benkler is credited with bringing forth new perspectives related to social production, the role of the commons, how society is using and interacting with the internet, and how the internet is transforming the way people interact, create, and exchange goods and information. As Siva Vaidhyanathan stated in the opening of his review, ‚Äúthere is no better place to turn for an account of the processes of creativity and commerce relating to digital networks and the work that people do with them.‚Äù More specifically, The Wealth of Networks is also hailed as an incredibly important piece of writing for those advocating for greater protection of the cultural commons and open access models on the Internet. For the German Law Review, James Brink wrote: :\\"The Wealth of Networks is a worthwhile outward- and forward-looking manifesto for an information infrastructure that has come of age. At the same time, internet advocates would do well to take Benkler‚Äôs lessons in the history of the industrial information economy to heart, and to work hard to fulfill his vision of a true commons-based and nonproprietary ecology within the networked information economy.\\"  See also  * Information ecology * Carr-Benkler wager References External links * Wiki of the book, summaries, commentary, downloads * Copies of the book: HTML, PDF * Audio of Benkler's talk, \\"The Wealth of Networks: How Social Production Transforms Markets and Freedom,\\" given at UC Berkeley's Boalt Hall School of Law on 27 April 2006. * Netizens awake, Paul Duguid, The Times Literary Supplement, July 7, 2006. * outsidethemarket.info (archived copy at https://web.archive.org/),‚Äîa remix of an essay which is based on the book * Free digitally-voiced audiobook of The Wealth Of Networks at Babblebooks.com 2006 non-fiction books Creative Commons-licensed books Works about the information economy Economics books Yale University Press books Economics of intellectual property Articles containing video clips ","title":"The Wealth of Networks"},{"id":"13220825","text":"Heath Benedict (June 30, 1983 ‚Äì March 23, 2008) was a Dutch American football player.

After his birth, the family moved to Greer, South Carolina, where Benedict grew up playing baseball, basketball, and soccer. Benedict was originally a talented baseball prospect, with fastballs reaching the low 90's by the time he reached high school. After his freshman year Benedict had surgery on his pitching elbow to have bone spurs removed. Instead of letting this setback deter him, Benedict began playing football, a sport he found he naturally excelled at. After his sophomore year, Benedict transferred from Riverside High School in Greer to the Peddie School in New Jersey to focus on football. It was there that Benedict mastered his craft. Upon completion of his senior season in 2003, he was considered the top football prospect in the state of New Jersey. Benedict was the Number 7 Parade All-American in that year as well. He had scholarship offers from all major Division 1 programs. Benedict chose to visit Tennessee, South Carolina, Miami, Florida State, and Oklahoma (which was canceled after his decision to attend the University of Tennessee). He originally signed to play for the University of Tennessee but played right tackle at Newberry College. Benedict left school with one semester of classes remaining to pursue an NFL career, and participated in the Senior Bowl (being the only Division II player since 2004 to do so) as well as the NFL Scouting Combine.

Early life Ireland was born in Cleveland, Ohio on February 1, 1895. He was the son of Robert Livingston Ireland Sr. (1867‚Äì1928), a prominent Cleveland businessman, and Kate Benedict Ireland (1871‚Äì1936), who married in 1894. His sister, Elisabeth Ireland (known as \\"Miss Pansy\\"), was married to Parker Barrington Poe and inherited Pebble Hill Plantation, their maternal grandfather's estate in Thomasville, Georgia. His parents divorced in 1918; his father remarried to Esther Wood in 1920, and his mother remarried to Perry Williams Harvey. His paternal grandfather was prominent lawyer, John Busteed Ireland, a grandson of Jonathan Lawrence of the Continental Army and of William Floyd, a signer of the Declaration of Independence. His paternal grandmother was Adelia Duane (n√©e Pell) Ireland, the daughter of Maria Louisa (n√©e Brinckerhoff) Pell and Robert Livingston Pell, a descendant of Robert Livingston the Elder, 1st Lord of Livingston Manor, and Thomas Pell, 1st Lord of the Pelham Manor. He attended University School in Shaker Heights, Ohio and went on to prepare for college at The Taft School in Watertown, Connecticut. He graduated from Asheville School in North Carolina in 1914. From 1914-1915 he also attended Phillips Andover Academy followed by studying mining engineering at Yale University. He left Yale during World War I and enlisted in the Naval Reserve Flying Corps. Career He had a long career with the M.A. Hanna Company founded by his maternal grandfather, Howard Melville Hanna, a brother of Marcus Alonzo Hanna, a U.S. senator from Ohio. He also had a long run with Consolidation Coal Company. From 1920 to 1924, he worked for Susquehanna Collieries Company, a subsidiary of Hanna Coal Company in Pennsylvania. In 1924, he returned to Cleveland and became an assistant to the general manager of SCC. He worked his way up in Hanna Coal and became manager in 1929 followed by president in 1931. When Consolidation Coal Company purchased Hanna Coal, he became chairman of the executive committee followed by vice-chairman of the board of directors. He retired in 1966. =Philanthropy= He was an active civic leader and active in politics serving on the board of directors of several organizations. He financially supported all the arts but disliked opera and classical music. His first wife and daughter Louise were great Opera enthusiasts. They promoted and supported the Metropolitan Opera's annual tour visit to Cleveland where Liv played to role of announcer bouncer at a high society reception before the opera. A few minutes prior to the start of the opera he would proceed through the reception with a loud noise maker telling everyone to head up to the auditorium. When the group had departed, he would retreat to a small office and work. He was a prominent figure in the local and state Republican Party and through his friend, Governor Jim Rhodes, funding was approved for The Ireland Cancer Center at University Hospitals in his memory.Case Western Reserve: Encyclopedia of Cleveland History Active in civic affairs, he served as president of the board of trustees of the Hawken School, Cleveland, and as a trustee of St. Timothy's School in Baltimore, Maryland. He was a member of the finance committee of the Day Nursery Association, chairman of the investment committee of the Visiting Nurse Association, and a member of the advisory committee on investments of the Benjamin Rose Institute, all in Cleveland.

Tennyson Down is a grassy, whale-backed ridge of chalk which rises to 482 ft/147m above sea level. Tennyson Down is named after the poet Lord Tennyson who lived at nearby Farringford House for nearly 40 years. The poet used to walk on the down almost every day, saying that the air was worth 'sixpence a pint'.  Overview  It is part of the chalk ridge that forms the backbone of the Isle of Wight, this ridge extends to the west for where it ends with The Needles. To the east the hill descends gently down to Freshwater Bay where the sea has cut through the ridge. To the south is Highdown Cliffs, a near vertical chalk cliff drop of over 100 metres to the sea below. The top of the Down is fairly flat and is predominantly grass downland which provides a wide area for walking. There is some scrubland and small trees mainly on the northern side which is away from the prevailing wind. The Down is owned and managed by the National Trust and is grazed by cattle and rabbits which ensures that its grass surface is closely cropped. It is open to the public. The Tennyson Monument on Tennyson Down, with the Dorset coastline in the distance At the top of the Down at a height of 147m stands a huge granite cross commemorating the life of Alfred Lord Tennyson. From here on a clear day it is possible to see Old Harry Rocks and the Isle of Purbeck to the west, Yarmouth and Lymington to the north, and to the east, much of the Solent, Fawley Oil Refinery, a large part of the western half of the Isle of Wight, and St. Catherine's Point, 20 km away across Brighstone Bay. Surprisingly it is not possible to see the Needles from here as they are hidden beyond the next hill to the west which is known as West High Down. The Tennyson Trail, an Isle of Wight footpath, passes right along Tennyson Down and also makes up part of the Isle of Wight Coast Path in this area. Tennyson Down is one of the most significant downland sites in Britain. It forms the western end of the Tennyson Heritage Coast.

In July 1941, Nigeria became the flagship of Force K, commanded by Rear Admiral Philip Vian. During this period, Force K made two expeditions to Spitsbergen (Norwegian territory), the first to ascertain the situation and the second, in September, to escort a troopship, , with Canadian troops and a team of demolition experts (see Operation Gauntlet). Their task was to evacuate Norwegian and Soviet personnel from the archipelago and destroy coalmines and fuel stocks that might be of use to the enemy.

They are among the largest dry caverns in the United States. Dry caverns compose only 3% of caverns in the world. Because of the lack of water, stalagmites and stalactites are rare in the caverns. During the Mississippian Period, 345 million years ago, the southwestern United States was covered by ocean. Skeletons of sea life settling to the depths, created a mud with a high percentage of calcium. This eventually hardened into the limestone bedrock seen in the caverns today. Over millions of years, the bedrock was pushed up to over above sea level. Approximately 35 million years ago, rainfall flowed into the rock, and eroded passages that lead to the Colorado River and what is now the Grand Canyon. Millions of years later, the evaporating water left calcium deposits on the walls and floors, creating the formations that can be viewed today.  Contemporary history  In 1927, Walter Peck discovered the caverns by chance. After a failed search for gold, he opened the caverns to travelers and began charging 25 cents admission, which included a view of a purported caveman. In the 1960s the \\"caveman\\" was shown to be the remains of two inhabitants of the area, who had died in the winter of 1917‚Äì1918. Part of a group of Hualapai Native Americans harvesting and cutting firewood on the caverns' hilltop, they were trapped there for three days by a snowstorm. Two brothers died from influenza, and since the ground was frozen solid with and covered in snow, they were buried in what was thought to be only a hole, as returning them to their tribal headquarters in Peach Springs risked spreading the flu. In 1935, the Civilian Conservation Corps and the Works Progress Administration made an agreement with Peck to build a new entrance to the Caverns. In 1962, another entrance was built by blasting a shaft into the limestone and installing a large elevator. At that time the natural entrance was also sealed off at the request of the Hualapai Indians as it was considered a sacred burial place. Near the natural entrance, the skeletal remains of a Paramylodon harlani (Glossotherium harlani) were also found. This giant and extinct ground sloth lived during the Age of Mammals around 11,000 years ago, when the woolly mammoth and saber tooth cat roamed North America. Peck had named the caverns Yampai Caverns, with the name being changed several times. Up until 1957, they were known as The Coconino Caverns. From 1957 through 1962, they were known as The Dinosaur Caverns. In 1962, they were renamed The Grand Canyon Caverns. During the 1962 Cuban Missile Crisis, the U.S. government designated the caverns as a fallout shelter, with supplies for 2,000 people. These supplies remain in the caverns. In 1979, a cosmic ray telescope was installed at Grand Canyon Caverns, below the surface.  Features  The area includes a hotel, (The Grand Canyon Caverns Inn), an RV park, campgrounds, a restaurant, a convenience store, and a runway.  Geology  Located on the Coconino Plateau, a few miles west of the Aubrey Cliffs that rise to over above sea level, the Caverns lie within an alluvial plain at an elevation of about . Limestone comprises the majority of the subsurface area of this vicinity of the Coconino Plateau, an area riddled with numerous cavernous veins that run for miles in all directions.

Personal life Mahon, the eldest of four children, was born into a prominent Roman Catholic family in Ennis, County Clare. His father was Patrick Mahon of New Park, who took part in the Rebellion of 1798; his mother Barbara, a considerable heiress, was the only daughter of James O'Gorman of Ennis. Mahon studied at Clongowes Wood College, where he was one of the earliest pupils, and at Trinity College Dublin, where he took his BA in 1822 and his MA in law in 1832. Until his father's death in 1821, he was sent an annual allowance of ¬£500; afterwards, he inherited half the family property, also becoming a magistrate for Clare. He soon adopted the title \\"the O'Gorman Mahon\\", O'Gorman being his mother's maiden name.\\"Mahon, Charles James Patrick\\", Oxford Dictionary of National Biography. This was in part intended to give the false impression that he was the head of the Mahon clan.\\"Riches of Clare: The O'Gorman Mahon\\", Clare Champion, 13 September 2002. In 1830, Mahon married Christina, the daughter of John O'Brien of Dublin. She was an heiress and had property valued at ¬£60,000 in her own right, which gave Mahon the resources to seek election to parliament. The couple spent little time together, and she died apart from him in Paris in 1877. They had one son, St John, who died in 1883. Born in a time when duelling was relatively common in Ireland, Mahon later claimed to have instigated and fought thirteen duels; and in these, to have been injured in six but to have drawn blood in seven. These enhanced the tall, striking Mahon's dashing reputation. Politics In 1826, Mahon joined the newly formed Catholic Association.Guide to the O'Gorman Mahon Papers 1824 ‚Äì 1892, The University of Chicago Library. He encouraged fellow member Daniel O'Connell to stand for election at the 1828 Clare by-election. O'Connell's election, in which Mahon played a large role, persuaded the British Government to pass the Catholic Relief Act 1829, which finalised the process of Catholic Emancipation and permitted Roman Catholics to sit in the British Parliament. As a result, when Mahon was elected for Clare at the 1830 general election, he was entitled to take his seat. However, during the election campaign he quarrelled with O'Connell, and after his election he was unseated for bribery. He was subsequently acquitted, and stood again at the 1831 election, but was defeated by two O'Connell-backed candidates, one of whom was his old schoolfriend Maurice O'Connell, Daniel O'Connell's son. Mahon gave up on politics, became deputy lieutenant of Clare, and captain of the local militia. At the 1847 general election, Mahon was elected for Ennis, and declared himself a Whig in favour of Irish Repeal. However, he opposed the Young Irelanders, and narrowly lost his seat at the 1852 election. After exploits abroad he returned to Ireland in 1871 and was a founding member of the Home Rule League. Nearly ruined by his ventures, he even ended up at the Old Bailey as a consequence of his dealings, but was acquitted. He was defeated in Ennis at the 1874 general election, and also at the Clare by-election in 1877. Finally, he won the 1879 Clare by-election, and held the seat at the 1880 general election. He was a close associate of Charles Stewart Parnell, who he successfully nominated for the leadership of the League in 1880, but in 1885 was dropped as a party candidate because of his age and his tendency to vote with the Liberal Party in Parliament. He was also embroiled in a court case disputing the will of his son, St John Mahon, who died in 1884. Parnell personally ensured Mahon was a candidate at the 1887 Carlow by-election, which he won at the age of 87 as a Liberal. By this point, Mahon was the oldest MP in the House of Commons of the United Kingdom. He died at his home in South Kensington while still in office. Mahon had served alongside William O'Shea as an MP, and the two were close friends. He introduced him and Katharine O'Shea, his wife, to Parnell. After Parnell was named in the O'Sheas' divorce case in 1890, Mahon split with Parnell, siding with the Irish National Federation. However, Parnell attended Mahon's funeral in Glasnevin Cemetery a few months later. Travels Mahon became a barrister in 1834, but the following year, he left for Paris. There he associated with Charles Maurice de Talleyrand- P√©rigord, becoming a favourite at Louis-Philippe's court and working as a journalist. He travelled the world, spending time in both Africa, where he befriended Ferdinand de Lesseps, engineer of the Suez Canal, and South America, before returning to Ireland in 1846. Following his defeat in the 1852 election, Mahon returned to Paris, then travelled on to St Petersburg, where he served in the Imperial Bodyguard. During this period, he journeyed through lands from Finland (where he hunted bear with the tsarevich) to Siberia. He then travelled across China, India and Arabia. His finances largely exhausted, he served as a mercenary in the Ottoman and Austrian armies before returning to England in 1858. Late that year, he left for South America, where he attempted to finance the construction of a canal through Central America. He investigated the disappearance of Commander Lionel Lambert, captain of the paddle sloop , on which Mahon had voyaged, and forced the Peruvian Government to instigate an investigation which revealed that Lambert had been murdered. He reported these findings to Lord Palmerston, a former Parliamentary colleague. Mahon then returned to soldiery. He served in a number of forces, often in honorary positions. In Uruguay he was appointed a general in the government forces during the Uruguayan Civil War. He also claimed to have commanded a Chilean fleet during the Chincha Islands War and to have served as a colonel in Pedro II of Brazil's army. Later legends claimed that he was made an archbishop while in Brazil. When Mahon heard that the American Civil War had broken out, he went to fight for the Union. In 1866, he returned to Paris, where he was made a colonel in a regiment of chasseurs by Louis-Napoleon, but in 1877, he moved to Berlin, where he became a close associate of Otto von Bismarck. He was plagued by debts in this period, seeking money in speculative ventures, and in 1871 he returned to Ireland.

His best season occurred just after his military discharge in 1946 when he went 6‚Äì3 with a 1.99 ERA for the Brooklyn Dodgers. An earlier arm injury forced him to cut his career short. Melton's playing career overlapped that of his cousin, Cliff Melton, who pitched for the New York Giants. Melton died in an automobile accident in Greer, South Carolina in 1971.

It is designed to utilize a drawbar to pull or push heavy or exceptionally large trailer loads. When feasible, lowboy-style semi-trailers are used to minimize a load's center of gravity. Typical drivetrains are 6√ó4 and 6√ó6. Typical ballast tractor loads include oil rig modules, bridge sections, buildings, ship sections, and industrial machinery such as generators and turbines. Only a handful of manufacturers produce dedicated ballast tractors. Extra-heavy-duty chassis versions of mass-production tractor units are fitted with drawbar hitches and a separate ballast box as an alternative. Increasingly, remote-controlled, self-propelled modular transporters (SPMT) are being employed in traditional ballast tractor/trailer roles.  Description  MAN ballast tractor hooked via drawbar to transformer on Nicolas modular axles Commercial MAN SE ballast tractor, using a drawbar to tow a multi-wheeled trailer carrying a 70-ton turbine shaft The ballast tractor's name derives from the nautical term \\"sailing ballast\\" describing heavy material added to a vessel to improve stability. For a ballast tractor, ballast is added over the driving wheels to maximize traction. The additional weight increases the friction between the tyres and the road surface, allowing the tractor to overcome the inertia and friction of moving a heavy trailed load. Without it, there would be unproductive wheelspin. With a semi-trailer, ballast is added in the form of the weight of the attached trailer pressing down upon the tractor's fifth wheel. Since the load is separate from a ballast tractor, it provides no ballast: the drawbar only transmits a horizontal force. High inertia is encountered when starting to move a heavy load. To overcome this, ballast tractors tend to have high powered, low geared engines that provide substantial torque, especially at low speeds. Additionally, ballast tractors are often fitted with heavy duty hub reduction axles, a combination resulting in exceptionally low maximum speeds. A strong chassis is required to both support the extra ballast weight and pulling forces transmitted by the drawbar. A reinforced chassis also allows multiple tractors to be coupled together to maximize power and traction. Heavy-duty versions of commercial tractor units may be fitted with a ballast box and suitable drawgear, or a ballast tractor may be purpose-built. Ballast is placed above the driving axle, or spread out over multiple driving axles to maximize traction on each and evenly distribute its load. A purpose built ballast tractor tends to be the heaviest class of on-road trucks. In some cases, its kerb weight can be greater than their axle configuration's legal Gross Vehicle Weight (GVW) permits, requiring special permission to use public roads. Typical ballast tractor configurations employ an independent drawbar trailer, modular wheel- trailer units, or dolly trailer. An advantage of using ballast tractors is the ability to push-steer a trailer around a corner. A girder trailer, for example, is double-articulated so the front tractor can pull the load around a corner while the rear tractor pushes it through, thereby making the load more manoeuvrable than a simple towing configuration. Use of a following tractor also can increase control and brake force descending an incline. Manufacturers Only a handful of manufacturers produce dedicated ballast tractors. Most high-volume manufacturers offer heavy duty chassis versions of certain tractor units which enable a ballast box to be fitted. In Europe, manufacturers tend to send some of their products to another company (owned by the parent) to be converted into a special heavy duty version. ;Belgium *MOL ;Canada *Hayes *Pacific ;Czech Republic *Tatra ;France *Nicolas Tractomas 8√ó8 and 10√ó10 ultra-heavy-duty tractors *PRP *Will√®me ;Germany * Tadano Faun GmbH * MAN (OAF) * Mercedes-Benz (Titan) ;India * Ashok Leyland * Mahindra * MAN India ;Italy *Astra-SIVI (Iveco) ;Netherlands * DAF (GINAF) ;Russia (formerly Soviet Union) * MAZ * NAMI ;Spain *TBO Trabosa *TMU ;Switzerland *NAW ;UK *Atkinson Vehicles *Foden Trucks *Rotinoff Motors ‚Äì 35 heavy haulage tractors were built by the company between 1952 and 1959, of which 11 are known to survive. *Scammell ‚Äì Many early examples, now used and seen as showman's vehicles, originally served with the army. *Thornycroft *Unipower ;USA * Diamond T - Ex-army Diamond T M20 tank transports were popular post World War II with heavy hauliers in the UK. * Kenworth * Mack * White * Oshkosh Corporation Operators Three ballast tractors from JB Rawcliffe & Sons (two MAN pulling and one Mercedes pushing) with transformer on Nicolas modular-5 Greiner bed 5-axle trailer en route to a wind farm substation Most heavy haulage and heavy lift engineering firms employ heavy duty tractor-unit models that can accommodate a ballast box. Countries where modernisation is taking place, such as regions of the Middle East and South Africa, operate larger number of ballast tractors due to the greater frequency of heavy loads (such as power station components).

It is named after former Manchester United manager Sir Matt Busby, who managed the club in two spells, from 1945 to 1969 and from 1970 to 1971. The award was renamed in his honour in 1996, following his death in 1994, and a new trophy was commissioned ‚Äì a scaled-down replica of the statue of Busby at the east end of Old Trafford. The first winner of the award was Brian McClair in 1988, who also became the first player to win it twice, having also won it in 1992. Since then, six other players have won the award more than once, of which four have won it in consecutive seasons: Roy Keane (1999, 2000), Ruud van Nistelrooy (2002, 2003), Cristiano Ronaldo (2007, 2008), and David de Gea (2014, 2015, 2016). Ronaldo's 2008 win made him the first player to receive the award three times, having also won in 2004. De Gea won the award in 2016 for the third consecutive year, becoming the second player after Ronaldo to do so, and the first in three consecutive seasons. After Ander Herrera won the award in 2017, David de Gea became the first player to win it four times, in 2018. Voting takes place towards the end of each season, usually in April, and is open to anyone who has an account on the club's official website. Voting was originally done by post until the 1994‚Äì95 season, when a phone voting system was introduced. Postal voting forms were included in the club magazine, Inside United, and before that, voting was open only to members of the official supporters' club, who would receive a voting form in the post at the end of the season. Until the establishment of the official supporters' club, a separate award had been given by the members of its predecessor, the independent Manchester United Supporters Club. Other end- of-season awards given by Manchester United include the Denzil Haroun Reserve Player of the Year Award, the Jimmy Murphy Young Player of the Year Award, the Players' Player of the Year Award, and the Goal of the Season Award. Of these, the Jimmy Murphy Young Player of the Year Award and the Players' Player of the Year Award are voted for by the players. The prizes for all five awards are given at an annual awards night, which is held near the end of the league season and broadcast live on the club's television channel, MUTV.

Burchard, who was gay, testified as an expert witness in several court cases involving prosecutions on grounds of Paragraph 175, which criminalized homosexual practices.  Early life  Burchard was born in Heilsberg (modern Lidzbark Warmi≈Ñski, Warmian- Masurian Voivodeship). He studied medicine in T√ºbingen, W√ºrzburg and Kiel, taking his doctoral degree in 1900 with a dissertation on Einige F√§lle von vor√ºbergehender Glycosurie. After his studies, he worked as a physician in Berlin and opened his own practice. Here he met Dr. Magnus Hirschfeld and joined him to found the Scientific-Humanitarian Committee along with the pastor Georg Plock and Baron Hermann von Teschenberg.  Gay rights activism  Burchard had a successful career in medicine. After several years as a general practitioner in Berlin, he assisted Hirschfeld in starting the Scientific Humanitarian Committee with publisher Max Spohr, lawyer Eduard Oberg and writer Max von B√ºlow. The group aimed to undertake research to defend the rights of homosexuals and to repeal Paragraph 175, the section of the German penal code that had criminalized homosexual acts between men since 1871. They argued that the law encouraged blackmail, and the motto of the Committee, \\"Justice through science\\", reflected Hirschfeld's belief that a better scientific understanding of homosexuality would eliminate hostility toward homosexuals. Hirschfeld was a tireless campaigner and became a well- known public figure. Benedict Friedl√§nder and some others left the Scientific Humanitarian Committee and formed another group, the \\"Bund f√ºr m√§nnliche Kultur\\" or \\"Union for Male Culture\\", which however did not exist long. It argued that male-male love is a simple aspect of virile manliness rather than a special condition. The Scientific-Humanitarian Committee, under Hirschfeld's leadership, managed to gather over 5000 signatures from prominent Germans for a petition to overturn Paragraph 175. Signatories included Albert Einstein, Hermann Hesse, K√§the Kollwitz, Thomas Mann, Heinrich Mann, Rainer Maria Rilke, August Bebel, Max Brod, Karl Kautsky, Stefan Zweig, Gerhart Hauptmann, Martin Buber, Richard von Krafft-Ebing and Eduard Bernstein. The bill was brought before the Reichstag in 1898, but was only supported by a minority from the Social Democratic Party of Germany, prompting a frustrated Hirschfeld to consider the controversial strategy of \\"outing\\" ‚Äî that is, forcing some of the prominent lawmakers who had remained silent out of the closet. The bill continued to come before parliament, and eventually began to make progress in the 1920s before the takeover of the Nazi party obliterated any hopes for reform. He and Hirschfeld co-authored several articles on sexology. In 1913, Burchard published his books Zur Psychologie der Selbstbezichtigung and Der sexuelle Infantilismus, and in 1914 he published his Lexikon des gesamten Sexuallebens. Burchard also wrote lyric poems for the gay periodicals Der Eigene and Jahrbuch f√ºr sexuelle Zwischenstufen, including the poem \\"Vivat Fridericus\\". Burchard died on February 5, 1920, in Berlin and was buried at the Luisenfriedhof cemetery.  Works  * Der sexuelle Infantilismus (with editor Magnus Hirschfeld), Halle a.

The bridge, named for the first governor of Maryland, Thomas Johnson, saw construction start in 1972 and opened to traffic on December 17, 1977. The bridge, carrying an average of 33,000 vehicles a day on Maryland Route 4 (MD 4), is one of two crossings of the Patuxent River in Southern Maryland (the other is the Benedict Bridge approximately 20 miles up river, where MD 231 connects Calvert County and Charles County). The north end of the bridge, on the Calvert side, is located in Solomons. Just prior to the bridge, MD 2-4 narrows from four lanes to two, and MD 2 exits the highway, passing under the bridge and heading toward downtown Solomons. MD 4 continues onto the bridge itself and over the Patuxent River. Description The bridge, carrying two lanes and no shoulders, rises to a height of approximately tall, making a trip over the bridge in windy weather somewhat nerve-wracking for travelers. From the top of the bridge, one can see the entire town of Solomons, the runways at the Patuxent River Naval Air Station, and the Chesapeake Bay. The bridge begins in St. Mary's County, before even reaching the Patuxent River. It passes over Town Creek first, then crosses over the unincorporated community of Spencers Wharf on a viaduct. Once over the community, the bridge passes over the Patuxent River, entering Calvert County. Shortly after reaching land, MD 2 joins MD 4 and cross Calvert County together for a long concurrency on a four-lane divided highway. The Thomas Johnson Bridge is a variable depth beam bridge. Massive concrete pilings hold the bridge up over the river. Problems In the summer of 1988, cracks were found in the foundation of the Thomas Johnson Bridge, causing it to be closed for repairs over several months. People traveling north into Calvert County were forced to make a half-hour detour to the Benedict Bridge. People traveling south into St. Mary's County were likewise forced to either utilize the Benedict Bridge or take a free charter boat across the Patuxent River to a park and ride lot on the southern side. , there has been much talk and public debate over either expanding the Thomas Johnson Bridge by adding a parallel span, or replacing the bridge with a four-lane span. The reasons for such proposals are twofold. First, the recent increase in the amount of traffic of commuters traveling to and from the Patuxent River Naval Air Station has made the two-lane, single-span bridge functionally obsolete. Traffic on the bridge during rush hour can cause back-ups all the way back to the Route 235 intersection, and instances where there is an accident on the bridge itself can cause total gridlock. Secondly, the fear of more structural issues of the Thomas Johnson Bridge arising (such as the one in 1988), coupled with the apparent over-capacity use of the bridge on a daily basis, has caused some safety concerns about the bridge's stability. These fears have grown substantially in the wake of the I-35W Mississippi River bridge collapse in Minneapolis, Minnesota on August 1, 2007. , a study to determine whether the bridge should be expanded or replaced is being debated by Maryland governmental officials. Incident history The bridge has a history of traffic accidents; some minor resulting in a slight delay to major accidents resulting in the bridge being closed for numerous hours. Also, at times the bridge has been closed numerous times for Maintenance and Repairs. Since the bridge opened in December 1977 (up to October 2016), at least 14 people have jumped off the bridge and died, and six have now jumped and survived, according to Southern Maryland Newspapers accounts.

The court held that making RAM copies as an essential step in utilizing software was permissible under ¬ß117 of the Copyright Act even if they are used for a purpose that the copyright holder did not intend. It also applied the \\"substantial noninfringing uses\\" test from Sony Corp. of America v. Universal City Studios, Inc. to hold that Quaid's software, which defeated Vault's copy protection mechanism, did not make Quaid liable for contributory infringement. It held that Quaid's software was not a derivative work of Vault's software, despite having approximately 30 characters of source code in common. Finally, it held that the Louisiana Software License Enforcement Act clause permitting a copyright holder to prohibit software decompilation or disassembly was preempted by the Copyright Act, and was therefore unenforceable. Background information Vault Corporation created and held the copyright for a program called PROLOK, which provided copy protection for software on floppy disks. Software companies purchased PROLOK from Vault in order to protect their software from end users making unauthorized copies. PROLOK worked by having an indelible \\"fingerprint\\" on each PROLOK protected disk in addition to the PROLOK software and the software to be protected. The PROLOK protected program allowed the software to function only if the fingerprint was present on the disk. Quaid Software Ltd. created a program called RAMKEY, which allowed copies of Vault's clients' software to function without the original program disks. RAMKEY made PROLOK think that the necessary fingerprint was present even though it was not. Actions and claims Vault sought preliminary and permanent injunctions against Quaid to prevent them from advertising and selling RAMKEY. They also sought an order to impound all of Quaid's copies of RAMKEY, as well as $100,000,000 in monetary damages. Vault asserted the following claims: #Infringement of the exclusive right to copy by copying PROLOK into RAM for a purpose other than that intended by Vault #Contributory infringement by providing software that customers can use to infringe on Vault's and Vault's clients' copyrights #Creation of an infringing derivative work by one version of RAMKEY that contained approximately 30 characters of the PROLOK source code #Breach of license agreement based on Louisiana License Act, which Vault utilized to attempt to prohibit decompilation and disassembly of its software Procedural history The district court initially dismissed Vault's complaint for lack of personal jurisdiction, but this was reversed by the circuit court. On remand, the district court denied Vault's motion for a preliminary injunction. After agreement by both parties to submit the case for final decision, the district court entered a final judgment based on its decision on the preliminary injunction. Vault subsequently appealed. Direct infringement claim The district court held that Quaid's copying of the software into RAM was permissible under , which permits copies \\"created as an essential step.\\" Vault argued that the ¬ß117(1) exemption does not apply when the program is used in a manner not intended by the copyright holder. The circuit court disagreed with this argument, writing that the statute does not contain \\"language to suggest that the copy it permits must be employed for a use intended by the copyright owner.\\" Contributory infringement claim Sony Corp. of America v. Universal City Studios, Inc. established the \\"substantial non-infringing use\\" test for contributory infringement. Quaid argued that RAMKEY passes this test because it can be used to create archival copies that are exempt under 17 U.S.C. ¬ß117(2). Vault argued that RAMKEY did not have any non-infringing use because one could create a sufficient archival copy without the use of RAMKEY. Vault asserted that the archival copy exemption of 17 U.S.C. ¬ß117(2) was designed to protect only against \\"destruction or damage by mechanical or electrical failure,\\" but not against (for example) loss or destruction of a disk. The court declined to construe the archival exemption in this manner, saying that even though it had appeal, it was not the law and that only the Congress could decide to limit the exemption in that way. Derivative work claim One version of RAMKEY contained approximately 30 characters of source code from PROLOK. Vault alleged that this constituted an infringing derivative work. The district court focused on the size of the copied code, arguing that it was not significant. Vault argued that the court should instead focus on the qualitative aspect of the copied code because the 30 characters were important to the correct operation of PROLOK. The circuit court rejected the argument that the copying was qualitatively significant on the basis that PROLOK and RAMKEY \\"serve opposing functions.\\" Louisiana Software License Enforcement Act claim The license agreement for PROLOK depended on the Louisiana Software License Enforcement Act to give it the authority to prohibit users from decompiling or disassembling the software. The Act purported to permit certain license agreements to contain \\"...prohibitions on translating, reverse engineering, decompiling, disassembling, and/or creating derivative works based on the computer software.\\" Vault had included such a provision in its license agreement and claimed that Quaid violated this provision when it reverse engineered PROLOK. The district court held that the Louisiana License Act was unenforceable because it was preempted by the Copyright Act. The circuit court ruled only on the clause permitting a licensor to prohibit decompilation or disassembly, holding that this clause was preempted by the exemptions of 17 U.S.C. ¬ß117, which grant permission to make \\"essential step\\" and archival copies.

Seminole was laid down on 16 December 1938 by the Bethlehem Shipbuilding Corporation, Staten Island, New York; launched on 15 September 1939; sponsored by Miss Grace Svenningsen, daughter of the Foreman Carpenter at the Staten Island Yard; and commissioned on 8 March 1940, Lt. Comdr. William G. Fewel in command.  East Coast operations  Following shakedown along the U.S. East Coast, Seminole steamed for San Diego, California, and towing operations along the U.S. West Coast, and around Hawaii, Wake Island, and to the Panama Canal.  World War II Pacific Theater operations  On one such trip, Seminole departed Pearl Harbor en route to San Diego. At 1317 on 7 December 1941, however, the ocean-going tug sounded general quarters, reversed her course, and anchored at Pearl Harbor on the 12th. With her sister ship, , the Seminole operated in Pearl Harbor during the busy, hectic days following the Japanese attack. On 15 February 1942, however, Seminole embarked a salvage team and departed Pearl Harbor for Canton Island where, from 21 February to 24 March 1942, she assisted in unsuccessful salvage operations for the grounded Army transport ship, , which was eventually abandoned on the coral reef (and removed in the 1950s). On 24 March 1942, she reembarked her divers; took the fleet tug in tow; and steamed (under her diesel-electric power) for Pearl Harbor. Arriving on 31 March 1942, she remained in the harbor on channel escort duty until 31 May 1942, when she commenced salvage operations on patrol craft YP-108 off nearby Wahie Point, Lanai. Three days later Seminole returned to Pearl Harbor. = Sailing to the South Pacific = On 4 June 1942, the fleet ocean tug got underway from Pearl Harbor for Midway Island. Arriving on 10 June 1942, she took the crippled minesweeper/fleet tug in tow and delivered her to Pearl Harbor for emergency repairs on 17 June 1942. Repairs and further channel escort duty followed; then, on 15 August 1942, she got underway to Fiji. Moving south and west, Seminole anchored in Suva Harbor, Fiji Islands on 26 August 1942; she continued on the next day to the Tonga Islands; anchored at Tongatapu on 29 August 1942; and commenced channel escort duty in Nukualofa anchorage, Tongatapu. She continued her escort duties at Tongatapu until 8 October 1942. = Battle action at Tulagi = Seminole arrived off Tulagi on 18 October 1942, where she was assigned to ferry ammunition, gasoline, and troops. On the morning of 25 October 1942, Seminole and YP-284, a converted fishing vessel, were unloading aviation gasoline, howitzers, and U.S. Marines about three and one-half miles east of Lunga Point when three enemy destroyers, , and appeared to the northwest. The smaller vessels immediately got underway, heading eastward in hopes of avoiding the enemy fire. The enemy, after breaking contact with two American destroyers, changed course and pursued the slower Seminole and YP-284. The first shells to hit Seminole did so at about 1115, and were followed by two more hitting salvos. = Abandon ship = On 25 October 1942, the order to abandon the burning, sinking ship was given at 1120, minutes after YP-284 went under. Seminole sank about 1,000 yards off- shore between Lengo and the point to the east. Since the majority of the enemy projectiles had passed through her thin-skinned sides without exploding, Seminole lost only one crew member in the action. Seminole was struck from the Navy list five weeks later on 2 December 1942.  Awards  Seminole received one battle star for World War II service.

Currently there are seven titles in the series.  Titles in the Cycle  #Homecoming (1981) #Dicey's Song (1982) ‚Äì winner of Newbery Medal (1983) #A Solitary Blue (1983) ‚Äì winner of Newbery Honor Award (1984) #The Runner (1985) #Come a Stranger (1986) #Sons from Afar (1987) #Seventeen Against the Dealer (1989) The series does not follow a strict chronological order. Dicey's Song, A Solitary Blue, and Come a Stranger are interlocked and overlap. The Runner is a standalone novel and the events in it take place about ten years before Homecoming.  Synopsis  In Homecoming, the four Tillerman children search for a new home after they are abandoned by their emotionally ill mother. Dicey and her younger brothers and sister eventually settle in with their grandmother (\\"Gram\\") on a stark homestead in Crisfield, Maryland on the Chesapeake Bay. In Dicey's Song, Dicey is confused about where she fits into the family now that Gram has taken over responsibility for the youngsters, but she soon learns that the family still needs her resourcefulness and solid good sense. In her spare time, Dicey works at restoring a derelict sailboat, meticulously sanding down layers of old paint. Metaphorically, her emotional defenses wear away as she slowly opens to hope, friendship, expressive writing, and finally acceptance of her mother's death. When Gram and Dicey bring her mother's ashes home from Boston, the broken family is nearly healed. The Runner is about Samuel \\"Bullet\\" Tillerman, Gram's son and the children's uncle, and takes place before any of the other books in the series. A Solitary Blue covers events in the life of Jeff Greene, Dicey's love interest. Come a Stranger covers events in the life of Wilhemina Smiths, Dicey's best friend. In Sons from Afar, James enlists his brother Sammy's help to find Francis Verricker, who may be the father who deserted them long ago. Seventeen Against the Dealer resumes Dicey's life story.  Main characters  *Dicey Tillerman: Eldest of the four Tillerman children, Dicey is the central character of three of the novels: Homecoming, Dicey's Song, and Seventeen Against the Dealer. She was born somewhere between 1965‚Äì1968 to single mother, Liza Tillerman, and her wayward lover Francis Verricker in Provincetown, Massachusetts. As her mother was mentally unstable for most of their childhood, Dicey acted in a parenting role from a very young age. Dicey is fiercely independent and a problem- solver. She is very realistic and driven. Because she grew up quickly to take care of her siblings, she struggles to fit in with her peers. She loves boats and hopes to build them professionally. *James Tillerman: James Tillerman is the next eldest child, a thinker rather than a doer, and a natural loner. He loves books and learning, and did well academically but did not have any friends at school. James is known for having ideas and plans. He works from an early point towards getting a scholarship to college, James struggles with his self-image and fears being seen as a \\"dork.\\" He gets anxious at the thought of physical pain and so, prefers activities that do not require much manual labor. He proves to be good with negotiations early on in life which leads him to think he should pursue law school but reconsiders after taking a position as an office clerk in Dr. Landros' office. *Maybeth Tillerman: Maybeth's teachers thought she was slow and she was kept back a year in school. Because of her bashfulness and fright of strangers, Dicey and James are concerned that she may have inherited their mother's mental illnesses. Maybeth is a gifted singer and begins piano lessons. She also becomes less bashful at school and makes friends, but struggles to keep up in the classroom. She is an excellent cook and enjoys growing her own herbs and vegetables. She sells bundles of herbs to supplement the family income. *Sammy Tillerman: As a youngster, Sammy had a temper and was constantly fighting because taunts about his 'insane' mother, lack of father, and mentally slow sister. Sammy was named after his uncle, who was killed in Vietnam. Sammy shares not only his name with his deceased uncle but also, it seems, his good looks and talent for sports. He prefers physical labor to schoolwork. Kids at school respect him because he does things on his own terms and the opinion of others rarely changes his course. Sammy is a hard working person, loves tennis and has a talent for working on cars. As a boy, he, James and Jeff have a crabbing business and when he gets older, he works part-time at the filling station. *Wilhemina \\"Mina\\" Smiths: Mina is the daughter of Reverend Amos Smiths and nurse Raymonda Smiths. She is the fifth of six children, all named after kings and queens from European history. She is black, extremely intelligent and perceptive, as well as being a talented dancer and singer. She is popular at school and Dicey's best friend. *Abigail \\"Gram\\" Tillerman: Abigail is the Tillerman children's maternal grandmother. She is regarded by her townspeople as strange and a loner, but when her grandchildren appear on her doorstep she takes them on as their legal guardian, later adopting them. She is a strong, proud woman like Dicey. Gram is an involved parent who understands and advises the children according to each personality. She allows them to make their own choices even when it goes against her better judgment so that they can learn from their own mistakes. *Jeff Greene: Jeff is the only child of the \\"Professor\\" and his mother left who them when Jeff was 7. Jeff's father, heartbroken, isolated himself leaving Jeff to a quiet and often lonely homelife. Jeff enjoys poetry and playing the guitar. Jeff falls in love with Dicey and they date throughout the cycle and he adopts the Tillermans as his surrogate family. He makes his own place in the family easily by connecting with each of the Tillermans in a special way. He has a talent for giving gifts in a way that even the proud Tillermans can accept.  Recurring supporting characters  *Tamer Shipp: Tamer is a main character in The Runner and Come a Stranger. In the first, he is a classmate of Bullet's and runs cross country with him; in the second, it is ten years later and he is a Reverend and father of three. *Reverend Amos Smiths: Mina's father, Reverend Smiths features in Come a Stranger and Sons from Afar. Although a deeply spiritual and religious man, he does not push religion on his children. *Mrs Smiths: Mrs Raymonda Smiths appears in Come a Stranger as Mina's tough, caring, intelligent, insightful mother. *Isaac Lingerle: Mr Lingerle is Maybeth Tillerman's piano teacher. He becomes like an extra member of the Tillerman family. He appears first in Dicey's Song and then in Sons from Afar. *Professor Horace Greene: The Professor is Jeff's father and a main character in A Solitary Blue. He is an introverted man who is heartbroken over his wife's leaving him when Jeff is seven. As a consequence, the Professor becomes very closed off, even to Jeff. *Brother Thomas: Brother Thomas is a good friend of Professor Greene's. They meet at the college in Baltimore where they both work. *Mr. Chappelle: An English teacher that Dicey and Mina have in Dicey's Song and Jeff has in A Solitary Blue.

The book was used as the basis for the 2002 movie of the same name, starring Clint Eastwood. Connelly was inspired to write the story by a friend who received an organ transplant. Plot summary After receiving a heart transplant, retired FBI criminal profiler Terrell \\"Terry\\" McCaleb is contacted by Graciela Rivers, the sister of his donor Gloria, and asked to investigate her death, which occurred during an unsolved convenience store robbery. McCaleb had become a minor celebrity as the head of the FBI task force on the \\"Code Killer\\", an L.A.-based serial killer (similar to the Zodiac Killer) who always signed his notes with the code \\"903 472 568\\", but he is now living on his fishing boat and has been inactive to prevent rejection of his new heart (to the extent that he cannot even drive). He reluctantly agrees to help Graciela but finds the police handling the case to be extremely hostile. However, he is able to match the style of another killing to Gloria's and gets a copy of the files for both cases from Jaye Winston, the sheriff's deputy on that case. He surprisingly discovers that the call reporting Gloria's shooting was placed slightly prior to the actual shooting, leading him to suspect that Gloria was targeted for murder. He interviews the only witness to the second crime, a man called James Noone, but fails to learn much. As he continues to investigate, with Winston's support but against the wishes of his doctor, he finds that the two cases plus a third case are linked through the use of a common gun and a common line said by the killer after the shooting, \\"Don't forget the cannoli\\" from The Godfather. He then learns that the first two victims had McCaleb's blood types and were on a list of people who had previously donated blood. If the victims died, McCaleb would benefit from their death as a potential organ recipient. Because of this, the police on Gloria's case focus on him as the possible killer and get a search warrant for his boat. Then, the real killer begins to plant evidence implicating McCaleb on his boat, expecting the police to find it, but McCaleb finds and then conceals the most incriminating evidence. Examining the facts again, McCaleb realizes that the distinctive attribute of the \\"Code Killer\\" was that the nine-digit identifying code did not include a one, and that \\"Noone\\" (\\"no one\\") is actually the Code Killer. By following the contact information on Noone, McCaleb and Jaye Winston find the Code Killer's files, which prove that he had deliberately killed three people to get McCaleb a new heart. Although McCaleb is thus cleared, the fact that Gloria's death was directly due to his illness creates a rift in his increasingly personal relationship with Graciela and her nephew Raymond, Gloria's son. McCaleb, who is still supposed to be inactive, secretly continues to trace the Code Killer from information that he learned during his interview with \\"Noone\\" and drives to a location in Baja California that matches one Noone described. He then finds and is overpowered by the Code Killer, who tells him that he has kidnapped Graciela and Raymond and buried them alive. Despite serious medical problems from so much activity, McCaleb is able to kill him and then uses the little information he has to locate and rescue Graciela and Raymond. Upon his return, he apologizes to his doctor and says that he went to Mexico because he needed a vacation. Only Jaye Winston among the law enforcement officials figures out what really happened.

Controversy  In late 2007 and early 2008, the CDFA became the center of a controversial eradication program for the light brown apple moth involving aerial spraying of the pesticide Checkmate. After an initial spraying in Monterey and Santa Cruz counties, hundreds of reports of adverse health effects and plans to expand the spraying into the Bay Area resulted in negative media attention, several state legislative responses to close the loophole that allowed the spraying without an environmental impact report, rejection of the plan by numerous city and county councils, and an investigative report by the Associated Press that led to the suspension of a nearly $500,000 public relations campaign undertaken by the CDFA to \\"counter the concerns raised by local environmentalists and residents, who complained of breathing problems and other ill health effects after the spraying.\\" In March 2008, the mayor of Albany, California, Robert Lieber, called for the resignation of CDFA Secretary Kawamura.

Background Henry Wylde was born at Bushey, Hertfordshire, elder son of Henry Wylde (1795‚Äì1876) and Martha Lucy n√©e Paxton.Henry Wylde senior entered the Chapel Royal aged nine on 4 June 1805 under the patronage of The Princess Mary. It is believed his marriage was an early-arranged match. Martha Lucy Paxton was orphaned almost at birth. Her godmothers, neither ever married, were her mother's cousin Sarah Catherine Martin and her father's cousin, Martha Caroline Goldsworthy, sub-governess to The Princess Mary and the other children of King George III and Queen Charlotte. His father, then the organist at St. Mary's Church, Watford, was himself a music teacher. Henry, the father, one of the Children of the Chapel Royal was for many years vicar choral of the Chapels Royal and cantor there and he was a soloist at the marriage of Queen Victoria. Young Henry's mother's Durham based Paxton family included the 18th century musicians Stephen Paxton (c.1734‚Äì1787) and his elder brother William Paxton (1725‚Äì1778). Both, originally cathedral choristers, became cellists and composers. William remained based in Durham but the better-known Stephen had moved to London by 1756 and the next year was elected a member of the Royal Society of Musicians.L. M. Middleton, 'Paxton, Stephen (bap. 1734, d. 1787)', rev. Fiona M. Palmer, Oxford Dictionary of National Biography, Oxford University Press, 2004 Not as well known but also active in London were Frances, a church organist and the brothers' nephew (d. 1779) also a cellist. The vicar of Watford was the genial Hon. William Robert Capel (1775‚Äì1854), cricketer for Homerton and W R Capel's XI, later a chaplain to Queen Victoria. Capel, who might reduce his sermon to a very few minutes to be sure of catching a train to a foxhunt, wished to encourage a revival of the then moribund art of church music and its use in services. Capel stood sponsor at the baptism of Henry's younger brother, James, and may be safely presumed to have been a strong influence in young Henry's early career. About 1832 a new room was added to the Wylde house at Stone Grove and the Cassiobury House music library brought to it. Youth When aged thirteen young Henry was organist of Whitchurch, St Lawrence, Little Stanmore, near his parents' house at Stone Grove, Edgware on the edge of the small park that 100 years earlier had held the mansion of Cannons. Cannons was the short-lived house of James Brydges, Duke of Chandos, where Handel had been house composer 1717‚Äì1719. While Handel was at Cannons the ducal chapel was still being constructed, but Brydges had already rebuilt the local parish church, St Lawrence, Whitchurch, to his baroque taste. Here Handel's church music was performed, the Chandos Te Deum and the Chandos Anthems. At the east end of the church is the organ used by Handel, the organ case carved with cherubs and pea pods and attributed to Grinling Gibbons. When a boy, Henry Wylde was educated privately and at Westminster School. He became a pupil of Ignaz Moscheles at the age of sixteen and studied under Cipriani Potter at the Royal Academy of Music, where he was later appointed Professor of Harmony. From 1844 to 1846 he was organist at the Wren church, St Anne and St Agnes, in Gresham Street. He resigned to take up his teaching post at the Royal Academy of Music. Wylde had previously been admitted to Trinity College, Cambridge and his degree of Doctor of Music was conferred on 4 April 1851. Public life Dr Henry Wylde was appointed one of the musical jurors representing England for the Great Exhibition. In 1852 he encouraged and participated in the founding of the New Philharmonic Society,New Philharmonic Society at Exeter Hall and from 1858 to 1879 directed their concerts. Rehearsals were thrown open to the public from 1859. These concerts were not limited to classical music and they acquired a reputation for novelties. Berlioz was their first conductor but he soon fell out with Wylde, whose attitudes to the playing were considered by the musicians to be excessively academic. Wylde was the first to provide programme notes to the audience. After the first season Berlioz moved on and attendances fell. Later performances were conducted in conjunction with Lindpaintner and Spohr and after Wylde's retirement, under Wilhelm Ganz. It was at one of these concerts that Wagner's Lohengrin was heard for the first time. Academic life He succeeded Edward Taylor as the Royal Academy's Gresham Professor of Music in July 1863 holding that post until his death. In 1867 he founded and was principal of the London Academy of Music. He wrote several books on music and composition, and served as the music critic of the Echo newspaper. Dr Henry Wylde married Jane, only child of Captain Henry Shuttleworth RN of Bayswater at St Peter's Notting Hill on 28 January 1858. His wife was able to assist in the funding of his public concerts. They had one son, Henry, who showed no special musicianship but who married and died in Melbourne Australia; and two daughters: Edith Baroness von Verschuer, wife of a German army officer and Amy Carmichael, wife of a London stockbroker. His eldest sister, Lucy Marianne, married entomologist James Charles Dale, his younger brother, James, emigrated to New Zealand in July 1853 taking his harp with him. After a short illness Henry Wylde died of bronchitis, aged 67, intestate, at 76 Mortimer Street, Regent Street, London W1. He is buried at Kensal Green Cemetery in London. He may have parted from his wife, she married Alexander Ritchie Leask in 1894. Publications Wylde's books include: *Music in its art-mysteries (London, Booth,1867); *Harmony and the science of music: Complete in one volume (Cramer, 1871); *Occult principles of music (A.S. Mallett, 1871); *The evolution of the beautiful in sound: A treatise, in two sections.

Greer debuted in 1940 with the Midland Cowboys and hit .305/?/.464 with 80 runs in 94 games. In 1941, he moved on to the Big Spring Bombers and batted .335/?/.524 with 99 runs, 30 doubles, 11 triples, 16 homers, 18 steals and 115 RBI. In 1942, Greer split time between the Santa Barbara Saints (.319/?/.489, 60 R in 68 games) and the Dayton Ducks (.259/?/.393). Overall, he scored 108 runs, hit 45 doubles and stole 22 bases. He led the California League in runs and doubles (26). Stubby then missed the 1943‚Äì1945 seasons due to military service, perhaps costing him any shot at the majors. In 1946, Stubby returned as player-manager of the Abilene Blue Sox. Greer led the West Texas‚ÄìNew Mexico League in hits (202) and steals (38) and his team had a .708 winning percentage. Greer was named MVP and All-Star shortstop. He hit .358/~.430/.577. He was third in the league in total bases (326), 5th in average, fourth in runs (146) and led shortstops in fielding percentage (.956, 20 points ahead of the runner-up). He hit 23 home runs, 39 doubles and 8 triples and drove in 131 in 135 games. He also fielded .962 in 28 games at second base, the best in the league for players with 15+ games there. Returning to Abilene in 1947, he hit .345/?/.537 and scored 110 runs in 112 games. He hit 16 homers and stole 25 bases. He also spent 24 games with the Mobile Bears, hitting a fine .366/?/.427. Returning as Mobile's regular third baseman in 1948 for his only full season at AA, he batted .276/?/.382, solid numbers but far from what he had done in the low minors. Returning to Abilene in 1949, Greer hit .326/?/.520 with 19 homers, 106 RBI, 28 steals and 122 runs in 118 games. He also managed the team to a second-place finish. In his usual role as Abilene's player-manager, the 30-year-old hit .330/~.435/.553 while his team fell to a disappointing last place. In 1951, Greer moved on to the Artesia Drillers and they too finished last. He batted .331/?/.549 with 18 homers and 18 steals. In 1952, Greer joined the Roswell Rockets, but only as player, not manager. He hit .360/~.412/.650 with 15 home runs, 117 RBI and 44 doubles, second in the Longhorn League. He also led the Longhorn League's regular shortstops in fielding percentage (.954) and was named All-Star shortstop. In 1953, Stubby started the year as player-manager of the Brownsville Charros and held that role until June 10. He hit .310/~.374/.458 in 57 games. He then joined up with the Amarillo Gold Sox and batted .365/~.452/.642 in 32 games there. Greer returned to Roswell in 1954, just in time to be teammates with Joe Bauman in Bauman's legendary 70-homer campaign. Several sources now list Greer as finishing second to Bauman on Roswell in homers, with 12, but the sources of the time list him with 13, third on the club. He hit .398/~.477/.603 in that hitter-friendly league. He scored 122 runs and drove in 101 in 103 games as a 3B/OF. He was second to Bauman in OBP and average, losing the batting title race to his now-legendary teammate by two points. In 1955, Greer managed Roswell to a second-place finish, in his final season in the driver's seat. He batted .337/?/.564 with 39 doubles, 8 triples, 22 homers, 111 runs and 113 RBI in 123 games. In 1956, Stubby moved on to the Victoria Eagles but struggled, only hitting .210/?/.261 in 37 games. The next year, he wrapped up his career with the Ballinger Westerners, batting .314/~.381/.508 with 16 home runs. Playing in high-offense leagues primarily, Greer hit .330/?/.519 in 1,669 minor league games. He scored 1,348 runs, drove in 1,274, hit 441 doubles, 80 triples and 204 home runs and stole 212 bases.

The school was established by the Sisters of Mercy who have administered it up to 1988. Since 1989 the College has been administered solely by lay staff. History In 1873, Father Stephen O'Donough requested Mother Bridget at All Hallows for a few sisters to come to Warwick to open a primary school. Sister Magdalen Rooney, first Superior, Sister M Regis Quirke and Sister M Colman D'Alton arrived in Warwick in October 1874. In 1876 Mother M Kevin arrived and set about the building of St Mary's Primary School and Convent of the Assumption. In between 1873 and 1876, Mother Bridget bought from Mr George Clarke in April 1874 a thirty-three acre paddock near the southern end of Dragon Street for 10 pounds an acre. Meanwhile Father O'Donough secured a house at one pound a week as accommodation for the sisters. The Foundation Stone of the Convent was laid on 16 August 1891 by the Right Reverend Dr Dunne and officially opened on 19 March 1893 by Archbishop Dunne. Further additions to the Convent were completed in 1903 and 1914. A great pioneer of education in the Warwick district was Mother Kevin. Her mottos of 'Lord, teach us how to pray' and ‚ÄòWe must live chiefly for the life to come' characterised her approach to the preparation for the sacraments and learning. Many children were imbued with a sense of the Mercy way of life, namely, a spirit of piety, devotion to the Church, love of the poor and love of children. In 1905 Father Michael Potter, later Monsignor Potter, was appointed the new Parish Priest of Warwick and set about beginning a number of new building projects. In 1912 the Christian Brothers arrived in Warwick and this significantly eased the numbers in the sisters' classrooms. Archbishop Duhig dedicated a new wing in the Convent in 1914 for a high school. From this time on the Convent High School would be separate from St Mary's with its own staff, students and secondary curriculum. Sewing, painting, the art of speech, music and high quality concerts became a feature of the girls' education. The school especially catered for boarders out of town and during the Second World War boarders from All Hallows were evacuated to Warwick. The present College was officially opened in 1969 to provide additional facilities for the then students of the Sisters of Mercy Convent High School. At the end of 1974 the decision was made on financial grounds, to discontinue Years 11 and 12 at both the Convent High School and the Christian Brothers College. In 1980 Assumption College became a co- educational Junior Secondary College following the rationalisation of the school system in Warwick. The boys from St Joseph‚Äôs Christian Brothers College came to Assumption College as full time students. Assumption College introduced Year 11 in 2000 and graduated its first Year 12 class in twenty-six years in 2001.

Although having the word \\"ministry\\" in its name, the MP is not a ministry in the sense of government department. Roles Among others, the Portuguese Constitution and the common law give the following roles to the Public Prosecution Service: * to conduct the public prosecution; * to direct the criminal investigation; * to participate in the execution of the criminal policy; * to represent the State; * to defend the democratic legality; * to defend the rights and the interests of the child and young people; * to exercise ex officio the patronage of the workers and their families in the defense of their social rights; * to defend the collective and diffuse interests; * to defend the independence of the courts; * to ensure that the judicial function is exercised in accordance with the Constitution and the laws. Organization The superior body of the Public Prosecution Service is the Procuradoria-Geral da Rep√∫blica (attorney-general's office), presided by the Procurador-Geral da Rep√∫blica (PGR). The PGR is the only magistrate of the Public Prosecution Service that is politically designated, being proposed by the Government and appointed by the President of the Republic for six years in office. The PGR is also the only magistrate of the Public Prosecution Service that can be chosen from among persons that previously were not magistrates, the person chosen not even being mandatory linked to any area of recruitment or having a specific training. However, in practice, most of the persons appointed for the office of PGR came from the career magistracy. Under the Procuradoria-Geral da Re√∫blica there are also four procuradorias-gerais distritais (district attorneys-general's offices) and 23 procuradorias da Rep√∫blica (attorney's offices). The first ones represent the Public Prosecution Service in the courts of second instance and the last ones in the courts of first instance. For the role of directing the criminal investigation, each of the Public Prosecution Service offices includes a department of investigation and prosecution, composed of attorneys specially dedicated to the investigation of the most serious crimes. For the criminal investigation, the Public Prosecution Service also controls the activity of the Judiciary Police. Public Prosecution Service magistrates The attorneys of the Public Prosecution Service are magistrates as the judges, but constitute a parallel and independent body from the Portuguese Judicial Magistracy. The career of the magistrates of the Public Prosecution Service includes the following categories: procurador-geral-adjunto (deputy attorney- general), procurador da Rep√∫blica (attorney) and procurador-adjunto (deputy attorney). The Procurador-Geral da Rep√∫blica (attorney-general) has also the status of the magistrate while in office, but it is not mandatory that he or she had been a Public Prosecution Service magistrate before being appointed for the role. Regarding the Vice-Procurador-Geral da Rep√∫blica (vice-attorney- general), he or she is a magistrate with mandatory origin in the Public Prosecution Service career magistracy. The Public Prosecution Service is represented by the Procurador-Geral da Rep√∫blica and by procuradores-gerais- adjuntos before the Supreme Court of Justice, the Constitutional Court, the Supreme Administrative Court and the Accountants Court. It is represented by procuradores-gerais-adjuntos before the rela√ß√µes and the central administrative courts. Before the first instance courts, it is represented by procuradores-gerais-adjuntos, procuradores da Rep√∫blica and procuradores- adjuntos. The access to the career of Public Prosecution Service magistrate obeys to the same previous conditions as the access to the careers of judges, also implying the graduation in the Centro de Estudos Judici√°rios (Center of Judiciary Studies).

A rear gunner in a Halifax bomber, he was credited with shooting down 8 German aircraft and damaging several others, making him the RAAF's only \\"ace\\" who was not a fighter pilot. Early life Williams was born in Narrandera, New South Wales, the eldest child of Elsie Mary Gibbs and William Francis Williams. He was educated on the family farm until the family moved to Leeton, New South Wales, where his father ran a garage. He attended St Joseph's Convent School and then the Catholic College run by the Marist Brothers in Sale, Victoria. He left school aged 16, and worked in Leeton. Second World War He was working for the New South Wales Water Conservation and Irrigation Commission at the outbreak of the Second World War. He joined the Australian Army, and transferred to Royal Australian Air Force in May 1941. He became the top student in his air gunnery course, and left for England on the troopship SS Strathallan in March 1942. He became the rear gunner in the Halifax bomber piloted by Des Smith in No. 10 Squadron RAF in August 1942. He completed a tour of 30 missions, being decorated with two Distinguished Flying Medals, and then volunteered with his crewmates to become a Pathfinder with No. 35 Squadron RAF, flying ahead of the main force to mark targets. His aircraft was severely damaged on a raid over D√ºsseldorf in March 1943, with his turret's rotation mechanism rendered inoperable and a wing on fire. While the crew prepared to bail out, the pilot heard Williams calling him to turn starboard, allowing his machine guns to bear on a closing German nightfighter, which blew up. The bomber dropped its bomb load, but was attacked by a second German fighter. With bullet wounds in his stomach and legs, Williams legs were paralysed, but he managed to shoot down the second fighter. The Halifax limped back to England, where it crash-landed. Williams was cut out of his turret, and spent several months in the hospital recuperating from his injuries. He was awarded the Conspicuous Gallantry Medal. He later said that he had been told he would have received the Victoria Cross if he had died. He returned to Australia in April 1944, and was posted as a tutor at the air gunnery school in Cressy, Victoria. He refused to go, requesting an active posting instead. He became a belly gunner in an RAAF B-24 Liberator bomber in No. 23 Squadron RAAF, based in the Northern Territory and on Morotai. Later life He joined the headquarters of No. 81 Wing RAAF in Japan after the war ended, as part of the occupying forces. By then a flight lieutenant, he was demobilised in May 1948. He returned to Australia, taking up a soldier's settlement block near Wakool, New South Wales on the Murray River, developing a rice farm which doubled as a nature reserve. He opposed a plan in the 1950s to drain Christies Creek, which ran through his farm, because it would adversely affect local wildlife. He returned to the RAAF in 1952 with a short-service commission, serving as an air traffic controller during the Malayan Emergency and Korean War. He finally returned to Australia in April 1954, and resigned his commission as an acting squadron leader in September 1954. He married Maisie Lamont in 1951. He died peacefully at Barham, New South Wales. He was survived by his wife and their three children.

The company is located in BregaLibya Energy Data, Statistics and Analysis: Oil, Gas, Electricity, Coal. Energy Information Administration (EIA) July 24, 2007 SOC‚Äôs operations include oil and gas exploration and production (E&P;) and manufacturing. Background The company was initially known as Esso Standard Libya Inc., the first company to discover commercial quantities of crude oil in the Zelten oil field. In 1981, Exxon (parent company of Esso Standard) withdrew their Libyan operations, after which Sirte Oil Company was formed as a NOC subsidiary. It was established to operate the former Esso Sirte installation like the Marsa el-Brega refinery. In 1986, SOC took over the assets of Grace Petroleum, one of the five US companies forced by the U.S. government to leave Libya. In 1991, SOC merged with the National Petrochemical Company, creating the Sirte Oil Company for Production, Manufacturing of Oil and Gas. Activities included oil refining, liquefaction of natural gas and petrochemicals (methanol, ammonia and urea). In 2000, SOC reportedly made a 13-billion-cubic- meter-per-year natural gas discovery in the Sirte Basin (Africa Energy Intelligence, 2000a, b).Libya‚ÄîPromising find on NC-186: Africa Energy Intelligence, No. 288, December 6, 2000 p. 3 In 2005 SOC signed a $643 million contract with Shell to restore the Marsa el Brega LNG. The complex was damaged after political unrest after the Libyan civil war in 2011 and is out of operation today. SOC operates the Raguba field in the central part of the Sirte Basin. The field is connected by pipeline to the main line between the Nasser field, one of the largest in Libya, and Brega. As of 2005, besides Nasser, SOC was in charge of two other gas fields - Attahadi and Assumud - plus the Marsa el-Brega liquefied natural gas (LNG) plant. The LNG plant at Brega processed about 900 million cubic meters per year, or about 700,000 metric tons per year, of natural gas, as of 2005. In 2018 SOC announced the exploration and production of oil and gas in the Sahl field, after they had to stop for four years because of local security problems. In 2019 SOC announced would conduct corrosion control chemical field trials in 2020 for its gas production facilities. Production Overview *Crude Oil Storage: The Tank Farm includes sixteen tanks. The design capacity of each individual tank is . *Refinery: Capacity for processing . The products are primarily used to satisfy domestic demand. The production slate includes: (1) gasoline; (2) kerosene jet fuel (Jet A): diesel oil (ADO): naphtha: and heavy fuel oil (HFO). SOC Petrochemical Complex SOC's petrochemical complex is located near Brega. It consists of six plants: The combined production capacity for the three products is 6,950 mtpd.metric tons per day All products are marketed by the Brega Marketing Company. *Methanol plants (2): each having a capacity of 1,000 mtpd (1978 and 1985)Date of establishment *Ammonia plants (2): one having a capacity of 1,000 mtpd and other with a capacity of 1,200 mtpd (1978 and 1983) *Urea plants (2): one having a capacity of 1,000 mtpd and another with a capacity of 1,750 mtpd (1981 and 1984). *Methanol Production: Uses natural gas from SOC‚Äôs gas fields for raw material. This product is vital for the production of many chemical compounds and is also used as fuel for some machinery in addition to its use in making protein for animal food products. Most of the methanol produced from the two plants is exported. *Ammonia Production: SOC‚Äôs ammonia-producing plant first converts natural gas (i.e. methane) into gaseous hydrogen. Starting with a natural gas feedstock, the first step in the process entails removal of sulfur compounds from the feedstock, because sulfur deactivates the catalysts used in subsequent steps. Ammonia is produced in liquid form at a temperature of -33 ¬∞C. Ammonia is used especially in the manufacturing of nitrogen fertilizers, one of which is urea fertilizer. Most of the production is used in making urea fertilizer. The remaining ammonia is usually exported. *Urea Production: Urea is manufactured from ammonia, which comes from SOC‚Äôs two ammonia plants. SOC‚Äôs urea quality is considered among the top quality nitrogen fertilizers. A large proportion of the production is exported in large quantities or packaged in 50 kg bags. This fertilizer contributes to Libya‚Äôs agricultural projects. It is also used for manufacturing animal food, insecticides as well as formaldehyde production. Attached to the urea plants are three stores each with a storage capacity of 35,000 tons. SOC Brega Port, Marine and Utility Facilities Brega port exports SOC's oil, crude oil gas and petrochemical products. The port comprises a single and double berthing docks with various depths, cargo docks, jetting and mooring for SOC products.

He was a member of the interwar Chetnik Association and the Organisation of Yugoslav Nationalists, a Yugoslav National Party member of the National Assembly, and a leader of the opposition to King Alexander between 1929 and 1934. The following year, he became the propaganda chief for the Yugoslav government. Following the Axis invasion of Yugoslavia in April 1941, he became a Chetnik leader in Herzegovina and joined the Chetnik movement of Dra≈æa Mihailoviƒá. Jevƒëeviƒá collaborated with the Italians and later the Germans in actions against the Yugoslav Partisans. Although Jevƒëeviƒá recognised the authority of Mihailoviƒá, who was aware of and approved of his collaboration with Axis forces, a number of factors effectively rendered him independent of Mihailoviƒá's command, except when he worked closely with Ilija Trifunoviƒá- Birƒçanin, Mihailoviƒá's designated commander in Dalmatia, Herzegovina, western Bosnia and southwestern Croatia. During the joint Italian‚ÄìChetnik Operation Alfa, Jevƒëeviƒá's Chetniks, along with other Chetnik forces, were responsible for killing between 543 and 2,500 Bosnian Muslim and Catholic civilians in the Prozor region in October 1942. They also participated in one of the largest Axis anti-Partisan operations of the war, Case White, in the winter of 1943. His Chetniks later merged with other collaborationist forces that had withdrawn towards the west, and were put under the command of SS- Obergruppenf√ºhrer Odilo Globocnik of the Operational Zone of the Adriatic Littoral. Jevƒëeviƒá fled to Italy in the spring of 1945, where he was arrested by Allied military authorities and detained at a camp in Grottaglie. He was eventually set free, having received considerable Allied support. Yugoslavia's requests for extradition were ignored. Jevƒëeviƒá moved to Rome and lived under an assumed name. In the years following the war, he collected reports for various western intelligence services and printed anti-communist publications. He resided in Rome until his death in October 1962. Early life and political career Dobroslav Jevƒëeviƒá was born on 28 December 1895 in the hamlet of Milo≈°evac in Praƒça, near the town of Rogatica, in the Austro-Hungarian- occupied Bosnia Vilayet of the Ottoman Empire, to Dimitrije and Angela Jevƒëeviƒá ( Kosoriƒá). Jevƒëeviƒá's father was a Serbian Orthodox priest, and the family was of Montenegrin Serb origin. Jevƒëeviƒá was raised in the Christian faith and attended secondary school in Sarajevo. There, he joined the revolutionary organisation known as Young Bosnia and became a friend of Gavrilo Princip, the assassin who killed Archduke Franz Ferdinand of Austria on 28 June 1914. The day of the assassination, Jevƒëeviƒá's father was arrested by the Austro-Hungarian police for his connections with the Serb revolutionary organisation Narodna Odbrana (National Defence). He was charged with high treason, sentenced to death by hanging in April 1916 and executed in Banja Luka. Jevƒëeviƒá was a successful writer and poet in his youth. He studied law at the universities of Zagreb, Belgrade, and Vienna and spoke Serbian, Italian, German and French. Jevƒëeviƒá's political career began in 1918. During the interwar period, he was one of the most influential Serb politicians in Bosnia. He was a member of the Chetnik Association, an aggressively Serb- chauvinist political movement of over 500,000 members led by Kosta Peƒáanac. He was also one of the leaders of the Independent Democratic Party of Yugoslavia and headed the movement's military wing, the Organisation of Yugoslav Nationalists, which terrorised those Serbs in Bosnia, Herzegovina and Croatia who refused to join the party. Jevƒëeviƒá later became a parliamentary candidate of the opposition Yugoslav National Party in the Kingdom of Yugoslavia. He was elected to the Yugoslav Parliament a total of four times, representing the district of Rogatica then Novi Sad, and was an opposition leader during King Alexander's dictatorship of 1929‚Äì34. His tendency to cooperate with various Yugoslav political factions earned him the reputation of \\"being willing to sell himself to any political group in return for personal favours or advancement\\". In 1935, he was appointed as the Yugoslav government's propaganda chief by Prime Minister Bogoljub Jevtiƒá. Jevƒëeviƒá approved of the creation of the Banovina of Croatia in 1939 and advocated a large Serb counterpart that would include most of Bosnia and Herzegovina. This advocacy drew him close to the various Chetnik associations that existed during the interwar period. In 1941, his cousin, Colonel Du≈°an Radoviƒá, left Yugoslavia and joined the Royal Air Force. World War II Jevƒëeviƒá fled to Budva on the Montenegrin coast following the Axis invasion of Yugoslavia in April 1941. That month, the Germans and Italians created a puppet state known as the Independent State of Croatia (; NDH), which implemented genocidal policies against Serbs, Jews and Romanis. The Serb population began to resist, and Jevƒëeviƒá became a prominent leader of the Chetnik uprising against NDH authorities in Bosnia and Herzegovina in 1941. He was known for his pro- Italian sympathies prior to the war, and Chetnik leader Dra≈æa Mihailoviƒá jokingly described him as \\"an Italian who likes Serbs\\". Jevƒëeviƒá and pre-war Chetnik leader Ilija Trifunoviƒá-Birƒçanin sought to work with the Italians in the belief that an Italian occupation of both Bosnia and Herzegovina would limit the ability of the NDH to carry out its anti-Serb policies. Jevƒëeviƒá reportedly hoped that the Italians would allow the formation of a Serbian state of Bosnia and Herzegovina under their protection, but they were more interested in obtaining the practical assistance of his Chetniks in fighting the Partisans than helping him achieve his political aims. In the summer of 1941, Jevƒëeviƒá established links with the Italians, promoting Trifunoviƒá- Birƒçanin and himself as civilian intermediaries for the eastern Bosnian Chetniks of Jezdimir Dangiƒá. On 20 October 1941, Jevƒëeviƒá and Trifunoviƒá- Birƒçanin met and agreed to collaborate with the head of the information division of the Italian VI Corps. In late January 1942, Jevƒëeviƒá offered to assist the Italians if they occupied Bosnia, and to organise Chetnik detachments to work alongside Italian units in their fight against the communist-led Partisans. These contacts involved General Renzo Dalmazzo, commander of the Italian VI Corps, and Chetnik leaders Stevo Raƒëenoviƒá, Trifunoviƒá-Birƒçanin, Dangiƒá and Jevƒëeviƒá. In February, Jevƒëeviƒá consulted with one of Dangiƒá's supporters, Bo≈°ko Todoroviƒá, who instructed him to negotiate with the new commander of the Italian Second Army, Mario Roatta, to arrange the withdrawal of NDH and German troops from eastern Bosnia, to be replaced by an exclusively Italian administration. Both Jevƒëeviƒá and Todoroviƒá impressed Dalmazzo with the influence they were able to exert over the eastern Bosnian Chetniks, but Todoroviƒá was killed by the Partisans in Herzegovina in late February. The influence Jevƒëeviƒá had was demonstrated when Serb nationalist armed groups in the Gora≈æde and Foƒça districts swung over to an anti-Partisan and pro-Italian attitude when they were informed of Jevƒëeviƒá and Trifunoviƒá- Birƒçanin's ties with VI Corps headquarters. The plans for Italian expansion into eastern Bosnia were later discussed between Jevƒëeviƒá and NDH State Secretary Vjekoslav Vranƒçiƒá. Dalmazzo urged Roatta to expand Italian links with Serb nationalist groups into an alliance with them. At this time, the Italians were looking for allies to restore order, fight the Partisans, and support their political claims to NDH territory, and were under the impression that the various Serb nationalist groups were far better organised than they actually were. For example, Roatta was under the impression that Jevƒëeviƒá represented the Herzegovinian Chetniks, and that they were aligned with Dangiƒá. In early March, Jevƒëeviƒá and Trifunoviƒá-Birƒçanin suddenly told the Italians that they were effectively in control of a Chetnik movement, and were ready to collaborate with the Italians on the latter's terms. Jevƒëeviƒá sent a message to Dalmazzo explaining that the Herzegovinian Chetniks wanted to avenge Todoroviƒá and were concentrating around Nevesinje ready to demonstrate their loyalty to the Italians. Despite their statements, Jevƒëeviƒá and Trifunoviƒá-Birƒçanin faced significant difficulties; the Serb nationalist groups had yet to demonstrate their military value to the Italians, and not all of the armed groups even acknowledged their leadership. In the spring and summer of 1942, Jevƒëeviƒá and Trifunoviƒá-Birƒçanin regularly toured villages in the Gora≈æde, Kalinovik and Foƒça districts, encouraging the local civilians and Chetnik detachments to behave loyally towards the Italians. The Italians were unable to gain German support for their plan to use Chetnik groups as auxiliaries during the joint Italian-German anti-Partisan Operation Trio in April‚ÄìMay. In May, Jevƒëeviƒá met with German intelligence officers in Dubrovnik and was asked whether he would cooperate in the pacification of Bosnia. Mihailoviƒá was aware of and condoned the collaborationist arrangements entered into by Jevƒëeviƒá and Trifunoviƒá-Birƒçanin. Jevƒëeviƒá and Trifunoviƒá-Birƒçanin frequently met with Chetnik commander Momƒçilo ƒêujiƒá in Split, and the three men quarrelled over how to divide the financial assistance they were receiving from the Italians. alt=map showing the partition of Yugoslavia, 1941‚Äì43 In an internal Chetnik report of June 1942, Jevƒëeviƒá claimed that the Partisan proletarian brigades contained many \\"Jews, Gypsies and Muslims\\". In July 1942, he issued a proclamation to the \\"Serbs of eastern Bosnia and Herzegovina\\" claiming that: Jevƒëeviƒá charged the Partisans with having \\"destroyed Serb churches and established mosques, synagogues and Catholic temples\\". In mid-1942, the Chetniks became aware that the Italians were planning to largely withdraw from significant parts of the NDH that they had been occupying in force up to that time. Jevƒëeviƒá and Trifunoviƒá-Birƒçanin told the Italians that in response to this, Mihailoviƒá was considering evacuating Serb civilians from Herzegovina to Montenegro and moving Montenegrin Chetniks north to meet the Usta≈°e, who were expected to unleash a new wave of violence on Serb civilians. Over 22‚Äì23 July 1942, Mihailoviƒá chaired a conference with Jevƒëeviƒá and Trifunoviƒá-Birƒçanin in Avtovac, Herzegovina. On the second day of the conference, Jevƒëeviƒá and Trifunoviƒá-Birƒçanin traveled to nearby Trebinje where they conferred with Herzegovinian Chetnik leaders Radmilo Grƒëiƒá and Milan ≈†antiƒá. The German consulate in Sarajevo reported that this meeting established the ultimate goals and immediate strategy of the Herzegovinian Chetniks as: Under the auspices of the Italians, the Chetniks thoroughly ethnically cleansed eastern Herzegovina of its Croats and Muslims in July and August 1942. In response to a massacre of non-Serbs in Foƒça in August, Jevƒëeviƒá issued a proclamation to the Muslims in eastern Herzegovina demanding that they join the Chetniks in their struggle against the Usta≈°e. He stated: \\"I personally believe that in a future state the Muslims have no other choice but to finally and definitely accept Serb nationality and renounce their speculative maneuvering between the Serb and Croat nations, above all because all the lands in which the Muslims live will indisputably and inviolably become part of the Serb state entity.\\" That month, Roatta contacted Jevƒëeviƒá and \\"legalised\\" 3,000 of his Chetniks, formally authorising them to operate in eastern Herzegovina. In the autumn of 1942, Jevƒëeviƒá took a radically different approach than other Chetnik leaders and spoke in favour of collaborating with the Muslims to form Muslim Chetnik units in the fight against the Usta≈°e and the Partisans. He favoured such tolerance in areas where the Muslims were protected by the Germans, and considered it a tactical necessity while stressing that \\"there can be no true unity with them\\". In late September or early October 1942, Jevƒëeviƒá and Chetnik commander Petar Baƒáoviƒá held talks with Muslim leader Ismet Popovac and agreed to form a Muslim Chetnik organisation. Jevƒëeviƒá then urged the Italian military to occupy all of Bosnia and Herzegovina in order to end Usta≈°e rule and claimed the support of 80 percent of the population, consisting of Serbs and Muslims. At the same time, he requested that the Germans grant autonomy to Bosnia and Herzegovina until the end of the war, citing that the Muslims were \\"tested friends of the Germans both in the earlier and in the present era\\". Although Jevƒëeviƒá attempted to recruit Muslims while making use of the Bosnian desire for autonomy to support his alliance with the occupying Axis powers, nothing developed from these requests. =Operation Alfa= Towards the end of August 1942, Mihailoviƒá issued directives to Chetnik units, including those operating in the NDH such as Jevƒëeviƒá's forces, ordering them to prepare for a large scale anti-Partisan operation alongside Italian and NDH troops. In September 1942, aware that they were unable to defeat the Partisans alone, the Chetniks tried to persuade the Italians to undertake a large operation against the Partisans in western Bosnia. Trifunoviƒá-Birƒçanin met with Roatta on 10 and 21 September and urged him to undertake this operation as soon as possible to clear the Partisans from the Prozor‚ÄìLivno area and offered 7,500 Chetniks as aid on the condition they be given the necessary arms and supplies. He was successful in obtaining some arms and promises of action. The proposed operation, faced with opposition from Paveliƒá and a cautious Italian high command, was nearly cancelled, but after Jevƒëeviƒá and Trifunoviƒá-Birƒçanin promised to cooperate with Croat and Muslim anti-Partisan units, it went ahead, with less Chetnik involvement. Also in September, Jevƒëeviƒá offered the Germans a Bosnian Chetnik force of 12,000 men to protect the railway line between Sarajevo and Vi≈°egrad, but his overtures were rejected by the German plenipotentiary general to the NDH, Generalmajor Edmund Glaise-Horstenau. In early October 1942, Jevƒëeviƒá and Baƒáoviƒá, with 3,000 Chetniks from Herzegovina and southeast Bosnia, participated in the Italian-led Operation Alfa. This involved a two-pronged thrust towards the town of Prozor. German and NDH troops drove from the north, and Italian and Chetnik forces pushed from the Neretva River. Prozor and some smaller towns were captured by the combined Italian‚ÄìChetnik force. Individual Chetnik bands, acting on their own, proceeded to burn a number of Muslim and Catholic villages, and killed between 543 and 2,500 non-Serbs in the Prozor area. Their behaviour angered the NDH government and the Italians had to order the Chetniks to withdraw. Some were discharged altogether while others were sent to northern Dalmatia to aid ƒêujiƒá's forces. A month after the massacre, Jevƒëeviƒá and Baƒáoviƒá wrote a self- critical report on Prozor to Mihailoviƒá, hoping to distance themselves from the actions of the troops. =Case White= alt=A tall male Chetnik amongst a group of men dressed in Italian Army uniform In a meeting with Roatta in November 1942, Jevƒëeviƒá obtained Italian agreement to \\"legalise\\" another 3,000 Chetniks and recognition of almost all of eastern Herzegovina as a \\"Chetnik zone\\". In return, the Chetniks had to promise not to attack Muslim and Croat civilians and agreed to having an Italian liaison officer embedded in all their formations of regiment strength or more. On 15 November 1942, Jevƒëeviƒá agreed to support the Italian decision to start arming Muslim anti-Partisan groups. This support almost cost him his life when several Chetniks, who strongly opposed the arming of Croat and Muslim anti-Partisan groups by the Italians, visited Mostar with the intention of assassinating him. By the end of 1942, Chetnik‚ÄìItalian collaboration was routine. Chetnik forces were included in the Italian planning for Case White, a major Axis anti-Partisan offensive which was to be launched on 20 January 1943. On 3 January, Jevƒëeviƒá participated in an Axis planning conference for Case White in Rome, along with senior German, Italian and NDH commanders. The plans included the 12,000 Chetniks under Jevƒëeviƒá's command, and on 23 February 1943 he concluded an agreement with the Germans that they would not cross the Neretva River and that contact between German and Chetnik troops would be avoided. Early in the operation, Jevƒëeviƒá concluded an agreement for cooperation with the commander of NDH troops in Mostar. Later in the operation Jevƒëeviƒá requested, through the Italians, the assistance of the 7th SS Volunteer Mountain Division Prinz Eugen in defending Nevesinje, which faced severe pressure from Partisan forces that had broken through the Chetnik lines at the Battle of the Neretva River. Although the Italians also made this request themselves, the Germans declined, stating that the division was reserved for other tasks. After the death of Trifunoviƒá-Birƒçanin in February 1943, Jevƒëeviƒá, along with ƒêujiƒá, Baƒáoviƒá, and Radovan Ivani≈°eviƒá, vowed to the Italians to carry on Trifunoviƒá-Birƒçanin's policies of closely collaborating with them against the Partisans. The Italians were able to exert pressure on Jevƒëeviƒá, as his brother and fianc√©e were interned in Italy. Mihailoviƒá apparently felt that Jevƒëeviƒá had exceeded his authority by attending the Case White planning conference in Rome, and indeed, when the Yugoslav government-in-exile awarded Jevƒëeviƒá the Order of Karaƒëorƒëe's Star in early 1943 for his services to the Serb population during the Usta≈°e massacres of 1941, Mihailoviƒá suppressed the announcement of the award because of the nature of Jevƒëeviƒá's agreement with the Italians, although the reason may also have been because he was aware of Chetnik revenge killings of Herzegovinian Catholics and Muslims in response to atrocities committed by the Usta≈°e in Croatia. Tensions between Mihailoviƒá and Jevƒëeviƒá became so apparent that Mihailoviƒá reportedly threatened to \\"string [him] up from the nearest tree\\". In March, Jevƒëeviƒá publicly demanded an end to the Chetnik killing of Croats in Herzegovina. In May, Benito Mussolini finally gave in to German pressure and ordered Italian troops to co-operate in the disarming of Chetnik groups. Jevƒëeviƒá was immediately placed under house arrest. His house arrest did not last long, as in the following month, Mihailoviƒá sent Jevƒëeviƒá to Slovenia to report on the state of Chetnik forces there. Jevƒëeviƒá began developing contacts with the Germans prior to the Italian capitulation in September 1943. On 3 September, he travelled to Rome via Rijeka and made contact with German intelligence services. This marked the beginning of his collaboration with the Germans. Following the German occupation of NDH territory that had previously been held by the Italians, Jevƒëeviƒá moved to Trieste and stayed at the Hotel Continental. There, he helped organise displaced Chetniks and arranged for them to be returned to the town of Opatija. He stayed in Trieste until January 1944, when he relocated to Opatija with Chetniks from Trieste who had been placed under his command. He then moved his Chetniks to Ilirska Bistrica, and collaborated with the Germans until the end of the war. =Withdrawal= In December 1944, Jevƒëeviƒá's 3,000 remaining fighters joined ƒêujiƒá's Chetniks, Dimitrije Ljotiƒá's Serbian Volunteer Corps, and the remnants of Milan Nediƒá's Serbian Shock Corps, which were under the command of SS-Obergruppenf√ºhrer und General der Waffen-SS (SS General) Odilo Globocnik, the Higher SS and Police Leader of the Adriatic Littoral. Despite this, they attempted to contact the western Allies in Italy in an effort to secure foreign aid for a proposed anti-communist offensive to restore royalist Yugoslavia. They were all blessed by Serbian Orthodox bishop Nikolaj Velimiroviƒá upon his arrival in Slovenia. On 11 April 1945, a detachment of Jevƒëeviƒá's Chetniks, along with three regiments of the Serbian Volunteer Corps, marched into south-western Croatia with the aim of linking up with the Montenegrin Volunteer Corps of Pavle ƒêuri≈°iƒá, which was marching across Bosnia in an attempt to reach Slovenia. The relief effort came too late, because the Montenegrin Volunteer Corps had already been defeated by NDH forces at the Battle of Lijevƒçe Field near Banja Luka, after which ƒêuri≈°iƒá was captured and killed. The relief force then marched north to Slovenia, where it fought the Partisans before retreating into Austria. These Chetniks were subsequently captured by the Allies and repatriated to Yugoslavia, where they were summarily executed by the Partisans. Jevƒëeviƒá remained highly influential among the Chetniks until the end of the war. Exile and death =Release from captivity= In the spring of 1945, Jevƒëeviƒá fled to Italy, where he was arrested by Allied forces and detained at a camp in Grottaglie. An estimated 10,000 Chetniks reportedly followed him and ƒêujiƒá into the country. Jevƒëeviƒá was interned in Grottaglie for some time along with others, including the former Usta≈°e commissioner for Banja Luka, Viktor Gutiƒá. During this time, an indictment was issued against him in Sarajevo. It charged that under his command in \\"the first half of October 1942 in and around Prozor [the Italians and Chetniks] butchered and killed 1,716 persons of both sexes, of the Croatian and Muslim nations, and plundered and burnt about 500 households\\". Jevƒëeviƒá received considerable Allied support in Italy despite being wanted by British authorities in connection with these allegations. On paper, the Chetniks in Italy were listed as \\"surrendered enemy personnel\\", but were largely viewed with sympathy by the Allies, who considered them anti-German. Hence, many Chetnik prisoners were handed British Army uniforms and given non- combatant duties throughout Italy, such as guarding munitions and supplies. In August 1945, Jevƒëeviƒá became the commander of a camp for disarmed Chetniks in Cesena. He was eventually set free and Yugoslavia's requests for extradition were ignored. =Intelligence-gathering activities= A Central Intelligence Agency chart illustrating the flow of the information generated by Jevƒëeviƒá. According to the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA), Jevƒëeviƒá lived in Rome under the aliases \\"Giovanni St. Angelo\\" and \\"Enrico Serrao\\". He spent most of his time and money quarrelling with √©migr√© Yugoslav politicians, trying to prove that his collaboration with the Italians was necessary in order to protect the population of Bosnia and Herzegovina from the Partisans and Germans. He became a member of the Association of Free Journalists of Central- Eastern Europe, and served as an informant for the Italian intelligence services between 1946 and 1947. During this period, he published a confidential periodical called the Royal Yugoslav Intelligence Bulletin which he shared with the Italians. Jevƒëeviƒá also contributed to a number of newspapers, including the Serb nationalist Srbobran. In 1946, he helped form the Serbian National Committee in Rome and, with help from Achille Marazza, published a pan-Serb and anti-Croat newspaper, Srpske Novine, in Eboli. He also established contacts with Italian neo-fascist groups and with an anti- communist group called the Committee of Nations Oppressed by Russia. Disagreement over who would lead the 10,000 Chetnik exiles in Italy escalated into a feud between Jevƒëeviƒá, ƒêujiƒá and General Miodrag Damjanoviƒá in mid-1947. Damjanoviƒá had been appointed by Mihailoviƒá in March 1945 to lead the Chetniks into northwestern Italy. Jevƒëeviƒá and ƒêujiƒá refused to accept this and claimed that they were Mihailoviƒá's only successors as leaders of the Chetnik movement. By 1949, the CIA claimed that Jevƒëeviƒá's intelligence material was being used by the Italian Ministry of Interior, the United States Counterintelligence Corps, British Forensic Science Service in Trieste, and French intelligence services in Rome and Paris. His intelligence correspondents included ƒêujiƒá, who disseminated his intelligence reports to the CIA, Konstantin Fotiƒá, the former Yugoslav ambassador to the United States, and Miro Didek, Croat politician Vladko Maƒçek's self-styled intelligence representative in Rome. The intelligence reports were mostly collected from refugees fleeing Yugoslavia and arriving in Italy via Trieste and from √©migr√© groups in Italy and Greece. By 1949, Jevƒëeviƒá claimed to have formed a large network of anti-communist propagandists in Italy and intelligence collection centres in Albania, Bulgaria and Greece. The CIA believed that these claims were exaggerated, if not entirely fictitious. In 1951, Jevƒëeviƒá began printing an anti-communist, pro-Chetnik publication from an unidentified religious institution in Italy. Issues were regularly mailed to Yugoslav exiles and former Chetniks living in the United States, Canada, Australia and various European countries. In May and June 1952, Jevƒëeviƒá visited Canada and addressed the Congress of the Serbian National Defence (Srpska Narodna Odbrana) in Niagara Falls regarding developments within Italy's Serb √©migr√© community. The following year, he and ƒêujiƒá issued a proclamation in Chicago declaring their intention to organise Chetnik groups against Damjanoviƒá, who had since emigrated to Germany. Jevƒëeviƒá later received threatening letters warning him not to go through with such a plan for fear of disuniting the Yugoslav diaspora. Little is known of his activities after 1953. He continued to live in Rome until his death in October 1962.

Annually, over one million travelers visit Namibia, with roughly one in three coming from South Africa, then Germany and finally the United Kingdom, Italy and France. The country is among the prime destinations in Africa and is known for ecotourism which features Namibia's extensive wildlife. In December 2010, Lonely Planet named Namibia 5th best tourist destination in the world in terms of value.Namibia gets top tourist accolade The Namibian, 22 December 2010 History The first rough estimate took place in 1989, when it was predicted that 100,000 non-domestic tourists stayed in the country. This figure has risen over time to 1,176,000 visitors in 2014 (source: World Bank International Tourism data). Employment In 1996, around 600 jobs were related directly to the country's tourism sector. In 2008 it was estimated that 77,000 jobs directly or indirectly depend on Namibia's tourism, amounting to 18.2% of all formal jobs in Namibia. Tourism in Namibia also has had a positive impact on resource conservation and rural development. Some 50 communal conservancies have been established across the country, covering 11.8 million hectares of land and resulting in enhanced land management while providing tens of thousands of rural Namibians with much needed income.

Both of these landscapes lend themselves towards some of the most unusual sight-seeing opportunities in Namibia. The lagoon and harbour is home to various species and large numbers of sea mammals and bird life. The Namib desert on the other side is called \\"The Living Desert\\", because of the large number of living species found there. Walvis Bay is one of many tourism activity centers of Namibia. Activities include various water-related actions, like shore angling, boat angling, shark angling, sight seeing and photographic boat cruises, sea kayaking and wind- and kite surfing. Walvis Bay yearly houses one of the international legs of speed kite and wind surfing. Land activities include Sandwich Harbour sightseeing tours, desert sightseeing tours, 4X4 dune driving tours into the massive dunes south of the Kuiseb river, dune hang gliding, dune boarding and dune skiing, guided educational, historic and anthropologic quad biking tours into the Kuiseb Delta, visits to the Topnaar people, descendants of the Khoin-Khoin, and living desert tours. =Swakopmund= Swakopmund (2017) Swakopmund is a beach resort and an example of German colonial architecture. It was founded in 1892 as the main harbour for German South-West Africa. Attractions include spectacular sand dunes near Langstrand south of the Swakop River. The city is known for extreme sports. Nearby is a farm that offers camel rides to tourists and the Martin Luther steam locomotive, dating from 1896 and abandoned in the desert. The Desert Express, a TransNamib tourist train, runs between Windhoek and Swakopmund. The Swakopmund Skydiving Club has operated from the Swakopmund Airport since 1974. =National Parks= Entrance to Etosha National Park in March 2007 Namibia has many prominent National Parks, the oldest, most visited and best known is Etosha National Park.

The Namibia Tourism Board  The Namibia Tourism Board (NTB) was established by an Act of Parliament: the Namibia Tourism Board Act, 2000 (Act 21 of 2000). Its primary objectives are to regulate the tourism industry and to market Namibia as a tourist destination. As a statutory body, the NTB is the only legal national tourism organization or authority in Namibia mandated by Government to regulate the industry. The following sectors of business within or relating to the Namibian tourism industry are sectors that are regulated by the Namibia Tourism Board: * Accommodation Establishments * Activity Operators * Air charter operators * Booking agents * Conference centre operators * Foreign tour operators * Shuttle and transport service operators * Tour facilitators * Tour and safari operators * Trophy hunting operators * Vehicle rental operators  Trade Associations  There are a number of trade associations that represent the tourism sector in Namibia, they include the following: # Federation of Namibia Tourism Associations (the umbrella body for all tourism associations in Namibia) # Hospitality Association of Namibia # Association of Namibian Travel Agents # Car Rental Association of Namibia # Tour and Safari Association of Namibia Statistics See also *Visa policy of Namibia References * Weaver, David, and Katharine Elliot. \\"Spatial Patterns and Problems in Contemporary Namibian Tourism.\\" The Geographical Journal 162.2(1996): 205-217.

It gathered delegates from 14 different countries, among which important figures of the anarchist movement, including Errico Malatesta, Luigi Fabbri, Beno√Æt Broutchoux, Pierre Monatte, Am√©d√©e Dunois, Emma Goldman, Rudolf Rocker, Christiaan Cornelissen, et al.  Organisation of the Congress  The Belgian and Dutch anarchists were at the initiative of the congress.Jean Maitron, Le mouvement anarchiste en France, tome I, Tel Gallimard (Fran√ßois Maspero, 1975), pp.443-445 While the Dutch took care of the material organisation of the event, the Belgians started the publication of the Bulletin of the Libertarian Internationale, which had as main editor Henri Fuss. In December 1906-January 1907, they launched a memo in seven languages calling for an international meeting, which was signed by the anarchist federations of the Netherlands, Belgium, Germany, Bohemia, London (anarchists speaking Yiddish)‚Äì it was not signed by any French anarchists. In France, the anarchist movement was divided into those who rejected the very idea of organization, and were therefore opposed to the very idea of an international organisation, and those who put all their hopes in the trade-unions, and thus \\"were occupied elsewhere\\". Only 8 French anarchists assisted the Congress, including Beno√Æt Broutchoux, Pierre Monatte and Ren√© de Marmande.  The 1907 Amsterdam Congress  Various themes were treated during the Congress, in particular concerning the organization of the anarchist movement and syndicalism. Other issues included popular education, the role of the general strike, and anti-militarism‚Äì an International Antimilitarist Congress simultaneously took place in Amsterdam. However, the most important debate concerned the relation between anarchism and syndicalism (or trade-unionism). In the end, a resolution was agreed upon, which stated that \\"the ideas of anarchy and organization, far from being incompatibles, as it has sometimes been pretended, complete themselves and enforce each another,\\" and concluded on the necessary \\"creation of anarchist groups and on the federation of the already created groups.\\" An Anarchist International was thereafter constituted, composed of an international bureau of 5 members (Errico Malatesta, Rudolf Rocker, Alexander Schapiro, John Turner and Jean Wilquet), with the task of \\"creating international anarchist archives\\" and to \\"connect anarchists from different countries.\\" The bureau was sited in London, and a new congress envisioned for 1909. The new International, to which the French anarchists remained hostile, only edited 12 issues of an irregular bulletin. At the end of 1911, the London bureau ceased all activities.  The debate between Malatesta and Monatte  Malatesta and Monatte in particular disagreed on the issue of organization. Upholding the principles of the 1906 Charter of Amiens, which had proclaimed the ideological neutrality of trade-unions and their independence from political parties, Monatte thought that syndicalism, as understood in France, was revolutionary and would create the conditions of a social revolution.French: \\"A ce syndicalisme d'opinion qui a produit, en Russie par exemple, des syndicats anarchistes, en Belgique et en Allemagne, des syndicats chr√©tiens et des syndicats social-d√©mocratiques, il appartient aux anarchistes d'opposer un syndicalisme √† la mani√®re fran√ßaise, un syndicalisme neutre ou, plus exactement, ind√©pendant. De m√™me qu'il n'y a qu'une classe ouvri√®re, il faut qu'il n'y ait plus, dans chaque m√©tier et dans chaque ville, qu'une organisation ouvri√®re, qu'un unique syndicat. A cette condition seule, la lutte de classe - cessant d'√™tre entrav√© √† tout instant par les chamailleries des √©coles ou des sectes rivales - pourra se d√©velopper dans toute son ampleur et donner son maximum d'effet. Le syndicalisme, a proclam√© le Congr√®s d'Amiens en 1906, se suffit √† lui-m√™me.\\" See Extract of Monatte's declaration Monatte opposed this \\"French model\\" of neutrality of trade-unions to Russian anarchist trade-unions or to Belgian or German Christian or social-democrat trade-unions. On the other hand, Malatesta criticized Monatte, stating that \\"syndicalism was not a necessary and sufficient means of social revolution,\\" while at the same time supporting (as Monatte) the ideological neutrality of trade-unions, in order not to divide the workers' movement.Extract of Malatesta's declaration Malatesta thought that trade-unions were reformist, and could even be, at times, conservative. Along with Corn√©lissen, he cited as example US trade-unions, where trade- unions composed of qualified workers sometimes worked in opposition to non- qualified workers in order to defend their relatively privileged position. According to Malatesta, anarchists had to also defend this Lumpenproletariat instead of only working for the improvement of labor conditions. Malatesta underlined divisions of interests inside the workers' movement itself, going so far as to criticize the notion of social class: \\"There is no class, at the strict sense of the word, as there are no class interests. Inside the workers' 'class' itself, there is, just as in the bourgeoisie, competition and struggle.\\" Henceforth, he thought that workers' solidarity needed a common ideal, which could not be found in the frame of the professional trade-union. If Monatte had criticized the risk of a possible bureaucratization of the trade-unions, while asserting the necessity of maintaining permanent employees in trade-unions, Malatesta categorically denied the legitimacy for an anarchist to become such a permanent employee of a trade-union. Finally, Malatesta criticized over-idealization of the general strike, stating that the latter could not, by itself, provoke a revolution, which would necessarily have to pass, according to him, by an armed insurrection.  Legacy  According to some views, this opposition between two visions of the organization of the workers' movement in trade-unions was later on merged in anarcho-syndicalism, which combined the revolutionary conception of trade- unionism with anarchist principles. However, French syndicalists Monatte and Robert Louzon continued to argue for (revolutionary) syndicalist unions independent of any political party or grouping, while Maletesta continued arguing against the syndicalist or anarcho-syndicalist conception of revolutionary unions. To him unions needed to be open to all workers open to activity to defend their conditions, and anarchists should work inside those unions to influence the broadest layer of workers, without wanting to make the unions themselves anarchist.Errico Malatesta, ‚ÄúSyndicalism and Anarchism‚Äù (April/May 1925).

Published by Elsevier Ltd, Available online 15 July 2004 The Sikh diaspora is the modern Punjabi Sikh migration from the traditional area of the Punjab region. Sikhism is (de facto) an ethnic religion, the Punjab region being the historic homeland of Sikhism. The Sikh diaspora is largely a subset of the Punjabi diaspora.Encarta The starting point of the diaspora is commonly accepted to have begun after the fall of the Sikh Empire in 1849 and the Empire's subsequent annexation into the British Raj. The most famous personification of the Sikh diaspora was the first, Maharajah Duleep Singh, the last Emperor of the Sikhs who was coerced into a lifetime exile by the British Raj. Since Duleep Singh's exile, the rate of Sikh migration from the Punjab has remained high; however the destination for Punjabi Sikh migrants has changed during the ensuing 150 years. The development of the Punjabi Sikh diaspora concept has given diaspora Sikhs a conscious political and cultural identity, which forms a reference point for their 'Sikhism'. Religion With approximately 27 million worldwide Sikhs are adherents to the fifth-largest religion in the world, Sikhism, making up 0.39% of the world population.CIA Factbook The 2011 Indian census reported approximately 20.8 million Sikhs living in India. Of these, 16 million, or 76% of all Indian Sikhs, live in the northern state of Punjab, where they form 58% of the population. Substantial communities of Sikhs, more than 200,000, lived in the Indian states and union territories of Haryana, Rajasthan, Uttar Pradesh, Delhi, Himachal Pradesh, Maharashtra, Uttarakhand and Jammu and Kashmir as of 2011. The Canadian province of British Columbia is also home to over 200,000 Sikhs. Historical migration patterns The Sikhs as a political entity, distinct from other Indian traditions, can be said to have begun with the martyrdom of the fifth Sikh Guru, Guru Arjan Dev Ji in 1606, Sikh distinction was further enhanced by the establishment of the Sikh 'Pure' brotherhood or Khalsa (‡®ñ‡®º‡®æ‡®≤‡®∏‡®æ), by Guru Gobind Singh Ji in 1699.BBC History of Sikhiam - The Khalsa This gives the Sikhs, as an organized political grouping, a relatively recent history of around 400 years. Migrations of Sikhs during the era of the Gurus were limited to the boundaries of modern-day India and Pakistan, and in particular restricted to the Sikh tribal heartland of the Punjab Region.The development of the Sikh Confederacy and the development of the Sikh Empire (1716‚Äì1849), led to Sikhs migrating to conquered parts of their empire such as Ladakh and Peshawar. However these migrations were limited, transitory and unsustained, depending on the Empire's fluctuating boundaries. During the time of the Sikh Empire, there was a net cultural immigration, with Napoleonic and British influences vying for the 'ear' of the then Sikh Maharajah Ranjit Singh.Maharaja Ranjit Singh: Lord of the Five Rivers (French Sources of Indian History Series) by Jean-Marie Lafont. Pub. by Oxford University Press (2002). Pp. 23-29. With respect to the Sikh diaspora, the most important political aspect of this period was the historical establishment of a Sikh homeland; the idea of a powerful Sikh state was a reality. Annexation of the Punjab Maharajah Duleep Singh, the first and most famous member of the Sikh diaspora Sikh migration from the Punjab began in earnest in the second half of the 19th century when the British Raj had successfully completed its annexation of the Punjab. The pivotal action in the British annexation was the lifetime exile of the then eleven-year-old Maharaja, Duleep Singh, thus making Singh the first (although unwilling) member of the Sikh diaspora. Although a largely secular figure who did little for the Sikh body politic, Axel (2001)A review of The Nation's Tortured Body: Violence, Representation, and the Formation of the Sikh \\"Diaspora\\" by Brian Keith Axel . Pub. by Duke University Press (2001). argues that Duleep Singh's exile has had a major impact on the Sikh diaspora psyche. Axel(2001)A review of The Nation's Tortured Body: Violence, Representation, and the Formation of the Sikh \\"Diaspora\\" by Brian Keith Axel . Pub. by Duke University Press (2001). Pp. 48-65 says that Duleep Singh is the archetypal 'tragic hero' figure in Sikh culture, \\"a King without a Kingdom, a Sikh separated from his people\\"; the contrast between Duleep Singh and his strong ruler father, Maharaja Ranjit Singh Ji, makes Duleep's exile even more 'galling' for the Sikhs and results in a strong sense of communal injustice, which is a later trait in the diaspora's development. Having annexed the Sikh Kingdom, the British Raj preferentially recruited Sikhs in the Indian Civil Service and, in particular, the British Indian Army, which led to migration of Sikhs to different parts of British India and the British Empire.Diffusion of Sikhism and recent migration patterns of Sikhs in India by A. K. Dutt1 and S. Devgun. Pub. GeoJournal Volume 1, Number 5 / September,1977.Pp 81-89. Available online Semiskilled artisans were transported from the Punjab to British East Africa to help in the building of railways, while many Sikhs found themselves in Australia working as Ghans, or cameleers and as labourers on cane plantations. 20th century The Sikhs made tremendous contributions to Punjab from 1857 to 1947. Sikhs founded the city of Rawalpindi. Sikh agricultural and entrepreneurial skills brought prosperity to Sheikhupura, Sialkot, Jhelum, Multan, Sargodha, Gujrat, Ludhiana, Amritsar, Jullundar. Lahore, the capital of undivided Punjab, had thriving Sikh neighborhoods. The era of peace and prosperity turned into a nightmare in 1947. The partition of Punjab between India and Pakistan was a seminal tragedy for Sikhs. The Sikh communities were practically wiped out from Lahore, Rawalpindi, Multan, Sialkot, Lyallpur, Jhelum, Gujrat, Sargodha, Sheikhupura and other districts of West Punjab. The birthplace of Sikhism, Nankana Sahib, was split away in West Punjab. Millions of Sikhs fled to freedom and safety in East Punjab in India. Such intense violence in East Punjab had caused many villages and cities to go through reconstruction. Smaller numbers also fled to Afghanistan. In 1960s and beyond many Sikhs migrated to the UK and North America in search of economic opportunities. Some of the Sikhs who had settled in eastern Africa were expelled by Ugandan leader Idi Amin in 1972.Sikhism. Encyclop√¶dia Britannica. 2007. Encyclop√¶dia Britannica Online. 12 Sept. 2007 Sikhs are primarily an agrarian community and with the pressures of having only a limited amount of land, high birth rates and the desire to make a better living, the male offspring of Sikh farmers were encouraged to migrate to foreign countries. Subsequently, the main 'push' factor for Sikh migration has been economic with significant Sikh communities now being found in Philippines, Canada, the United Kingdom, the United States, Malaysia, East Africa, Australia and Thailand. Agitation for a homeland Sikh Flag- The Nishan Sahib Axel (2001) argues that the Sikh diaspora community, having established themselves in foreign countries, begin to fetishize the past and nurture idealized designs for their 'lost and imaginary' Sikh empire. This comes into fruition to a certain degree with the establishment of Indian Punjab in 1966 as a Sikh majority state. However, Tatla(1998)The Sikh Diaspora Search for Statehood by Darshan Singh Tatla(1998). Pp. 16-33. Pub. by University of Washington Press. 10-295-97715-9 argues that the marginalization and sense of grievance that Indian Sikhs were facing due to Indira Gandhi's heavy-handed tactics were amplified in the Sikh diaspora. Subsequently, the Sikh diaspora, especially in South Vancouver, CanadaThe Sikh Diaspora in Vancouver: Three Generations Amid Tradition, Modernity, and Multiculturalism by Kamala Elizabeth Nayar. Pub. by University of Toronto Press (April 8, 2004) Pp. 34- 57. and the UK become willing suppliers of logistical and financial support when the organic agitation for a separate Sikh nation, Khalistan, began in the late 1970s. The actions taken by the Indian government to counter the Sikh separatist movement, via 1984's Operation Blue Star, had a seismic effect on the Sikh diaspora. Axel (2001) A review of The Nation's Tortured Body: Violence, Representation, and the Formation of the Sikh \\"Diaspora\\" by Brian Keith Axel . Pp.68 - 72. Pub. by Duke University Press (2001). argues that the desecration of the Sikh's holiest shrine, Harimandir Sahib, and the following Sikh Genocide in which thousands of Sikhs were massacred; led to a resurgence in Sikh religiosity and a strengthening of ties with their Sikh brethren in Punjab. Diaspora Sikhs felt betrayed by India, and the events of 1984 defined their Sikhism and underlined a distinct commonality shared with other diaspora Sikhs. Mark TullyBBC Archives: After Blue Star describes 1984's Operation Blue Star as the Sikh's '9/11', this was certainly the case for diaspora Sikhs, who in the main could only watch on in horror as the events of 1984 played out on TV. In 1971 Dr Jagit Singh Chohan, an ex-minister in a short-lived government of Akali dissidents, saw an alignment of like-minded Sikhs. Chohan placed a half-page advertisement in The New York Times of 12 October 1971, making several claims about Punjab as a Sikh homeland. However, Chohan won little sympathy from ordinary Sikhs Sikhs in London protest against Indian government actions Tatla summarises the change in Sikh diaspora community leaders post 1984 a being a \\"painful transition from a self-confident community with haughty discourse, to the self-defensive strategies of a vulnerable minority\\". Organisations such as the International Sikh Youth Federation (ISYF), the Babbar Khalsa and the Council of Khalistan emerged within the diaspora, and these agencies rallied against \\"Hindu imperialism\\" or \\"Indian nationalism\\" and lobbied to join the Unrepresented Nations and Peoples Organization UNPO aligning the Sikh cause with other ethnic groups seeking freedom, citing cases of Jews, Palestinians, Kurds, Balochis, Kashmiris and Sri Lankan Tamils. Another organization by the name of Sikhs for Justice, headquartered in New York, which surfaced roughly in 2014, has now self appointed it as the leader for the separatist movement, and is campaigning for the cause using activities like #BurnTheTricolour. Axel (2001) argues that the history of the Sikh diaspora, its psyche of grievance and the violence inflicted on it, means that the notion of the Sikh diaspora as a community today inevitably converges on the notion of Khalistan. In addition to this, Axel points out the 'nightmare' scenario facing the Sikh diaspora; the Indian state 'demands' the 'Unity-in- Diversity' model of 'rashtriya ekta' (national integration) which Axel contends is signified by \\"the denial of difference through surrender, assimilation and integration\\". Since the formation of the Khalsa, the Sikhs have defined themselves though their 'separateness' and have differentiated themselves philosophically and physically from other Indian religious communities, thus the process of 'rashtriya ekta' is a threat to Sikhi itself. Any 'weakening' or 'dilution' Sikhi in the Punjab, is doubly painful for the Sikh diaspora for it means a corresponding weakness in Khalistan, which, both real and imaginary, epitomizes the Sikh diasporic place today. Sikh identity today Whilst the rate of Sikh migration from the Punjab has remained high, traditional patterns of Sikh migration that favored English speaking countries, particularly the United Kingdom, has changed in the past decade due to factors such as stricter immigration procedures. Moliner(2006)Sikh Migration Patterns - 'Workshop on Indian Migration' at Laboratoire d‚ÄôAnthropologie Urbaine/CNRS (14/15 November 2006) Abstract 'Sikhs in France' by Christine MOLINER (PhD Student, Ecole des Hautes Etudes en Sciences Sociales (EHESS)) states that as a consequence of the 'fact' that Sikh migration to the UK had \\"become virtually impossible since the late 1970s\\", Sikh migration patterns altered to continental Europe. Italy has now emerged as a fast-growing area for Sikh migration,Sikh Storia e immigrazione - The Sikhs: History and Immigration by R. Cipriani(2006). Pub. in International Sociology.2006; 21: 474-476 Available on with Reggio Emilia and the Vicenza province being areas of significant Sikh population clusters.Now, Sikhs do a Canada in Italy The Italian Sikhs are generally involved in the areas of agriculture, agro-processing, machine tools and horticulture.Report of 'NRI' News in ITALY Canada has maintained a liberal immigration policy, and the Sikh community there is the second largest in proportion to the country's population after only India (1.4% of Canada's population versus 1.7% of India's), and about 2.5 times the size of the U.S. Sikh community. The largest North American Sikh community is thought to be located in South Vancouver, British Columbia and nearby Surrey, British Columbia, while Brampton, Ontario also has a large Sikh population. The Sikh migration to Australasia has also increased to a large extent in the first decade of the 21st century. In the post-9/11 era, the Sikh diaspora in Europe and North America stand out as a visible minority often confused with radical Islamic groups because of their turbans. There have been numerous hate crimes targeted at Sikhs. France banned turban-wearing Sikh students from publicly funded schools as part of a broader policy originally intended to restrict Muslim head-scarves. Western security think-tanks quote the Air India bombing to justify profiling of Sikh travellers at airports. Countering this train of thought, on January 16, 2018, Gurbir Grewal became attorney general of New Jersey - the first practicing Sikh in the US to become a State Attorney General.N.J. gets first Sikh attorney general in U.S. history The soft influences of popular culture and the need for fitting in with peers are driving many young Sikhs to shed Khalsa symbols such as the turban and beard. Some second-generation Sikhs growing up in the West do not have proficiency in the Punjabi language. On the other hand, small groups of Westerners have converted to Sikhism. There are now Sikh Gurduwaras (equivalent of churches and temples) scattered across Europe, North America, Australia and Malaysia. The combination of these factors creates a new and more complex Sikh identity that may slowly emerge in the 21st century.

Unitas Stolzenfels Bonn was established in 1910. It is a Catholic student fraternity at the University of Bonn in Germany. It is member of the Unitas-Verband (UV) an umbrella organisation of several Catholic fraternities and sororities. Unitas Stolzenfels is the second oldest of the four today existing Unitas associations in Bonn. Others are W.K.St.V. Unitas-Salia (1847), W.K.St.V. Unitas Rhenania (1912) and the sorority W.K.St.V. Unitas Clara-Schumann (1992).  History  = 1910‚Äì1938 =  Foundation: 1910  Unitas Stolzenfels was founded in Bonn on November 28, 1910 as Unitas Sigfridia and was associated with the Unitas-Verband on June 6, 1911 by the 52. general assembly (Generalversammlung, GV) of the Unitas-Verband in Fulda. World War I prevented a fast buildup of the Aktivitas (the active student association). Only in winter term of 1919/20 the fraternity was re-established.  Colour- Crisis  The colour-crisis was a struggle among the different fraternities of the Unitas-Verband. Some associations wanted to carry colours (hats and ribbons with the colours of the fraternity). Unitas Sigfridia was one of them. Therefore, it left the umbrella association in 1924 and founded with other fraternities the RKDB (Ring Katholischer Deutscher Burschenschaften (Ring of Catholic German fraternities)).  1st Re-establishment  Together with 8 other members Hermann-Josef Stumpe, religion teacher, and Dr. Karl Loskant founded Unitas Stolzenfels in 1927, which didn't want to break away from Unitas umbrella association. The name refers to the castle Stolzenfels near Koblenz, Germany. With the other Unitas associations in Bonn Unitas Stolzenfels developed a viable confraternity. Before fraternities were banned by the national socialists, each of the associations in Bonn had 50 to 40 active members. The first house of Stolzenfels is still standing on Bonner Talweg. In 1938 Unitas Stolzenfels as the whole umbrella organisation Unitas was banned. = Post-war period =  2nd Re-establishment  After WWII Unitas Stolzenfels was re-established in the winter term of 1949/1950. A few out-of-town members and a few members of Unitas-Salia helped. Once again Hermann-Josef Stumpe, now pastor of the Bonn minster and bank director Dr. Karl Loskant were founding members. Official affiliation followed on August 4, 1950 during the 73rd general assembly (Generalversammlung, GV) in Munich. In 1956 a new house had to be bought, since the old house was dispossessed by the national socialists, but was not given back after the war. The house and the parties held in this house will always remain a nice memory of the students of the 50s and 60s. In 1967 the house was sold to the Deutsche Bahn to finance a new house. This wasn't to good for fraternity life, since no festivities could be held in own rooms. It also wasn't possible to provide cheap housing for new students and members. In 1970 this changed at once with the opening of the new house on Hatschiergasse. There was more space for festivities and more rooms for students. The fraternity began to flourish once again. The house was inaugurated during the 95th GV in Bonn in 1972 by the nuncio in Germany, Archbishop Corrado Bafile. Since 1963 an irregular magazine is published by Stolzenfels called \\"Convent\\".

The results of such tests are published in journals, magazines, whitepapers, websites, and in other media. Those who test and evaluate equipment can be roughly divided into two groups: \\"Objectivists\\", who believe that all perceivable differences in audio equipment can be explained scientifically through measurement and double-blind listening tests; and the \\"Subjectivists\\", who believe that the human ear is capable of hearing details and differences that cannot be directly measured.\\"Basic Issues of Equipment Reviewing and Critical Listening: Our Present Stance,\\" Peter Aczel, The Audio Critic, issue number 16, page 31 (PDF page 25), accessed 2007-05-18. Summary of Objective versus Subjective Audiophiles, in general: *Both agree that measurements are not a substitute for listening tests. *Both agree that different audio components may have different sound qualities. *Disagree that subjective listeners can overcome placebo and confirmation bias in non-blind listening tests. *Disagree about whether perceived sound quality can be measured through objective means. Objectivists Objectivists believe that audio components and systems must pass rigorously conducted double-blind tests and meet specified performance requirements in order to validate the claims made by their proponents. *Objectivists point out that properly conducted and interpreted double-blind tests fail to support subjectivists' claims of significant or even subtle sonic differences between devices in cases where measurements predict that there should be no sonic differences in normal music listening.Paste This in Your Hat! - What Every Audiophile Should Know and Never Forget , Peter Aczel, Biline.ca, Accessed 2007-05-11 *Objectivists feel that subjectivists often lack engineering training, technical knowledge, and objective credentials, but nevertheless make authoritative claims about product performance. *Objectivists are likely to stress the importance of accounting for the influence of placebo and confirmation bias in subjective listening tests . *Objectivists reject arguments that are based on accepted physical principles but applied to circumstances where they are irrelevant. For instance, the skin effect, which relates the efficiency of cables to the frequency transmitted, is often applied to audio frequencies where it is insignificant . *Objectivists believe that subjectivists' preferences are often driven by gullibility and fashion‚Äîe.g., the late eighties' vogue for marking the edges of CDs with a green felt marker or suspending cables above the floor on small racks‚Äîand bear no relation to well-known laws of physics. *Objectivists claim that subjectivists often reject attempts to notate differences in sound using objective measurements, despite the evidence of their effectiveness. *Because measured audio distortion is higher in electromechanical components such as microphones, turntables, tonearms, phono cartridges, and loudspeakers than in purely electronic components such as preamplifiers and power amplifiers, objectivists generally do not accept that very subtle differences in the latter can have an appreciable effect on the perceived quality of reproduced sound. British audio equipment designer Peter Baxandall, who is often considered an objectivist, has written, \\"I ... confidently maintain that all first-class, competently designed amplifiers, tested under completely fair and carefully controlled conditions, including the avoidance of overloading, sound absolutely indistinguishable on normal programme material no matter how refined the listening tests, or the listeners, may be; and that when an inferior amplifier is compared with a very good one and a subjective quality difference is genuinely and reliably established, it is always possible, by straightforward scientific investigation, to find a rational explanation for this difference.\\" Baxandall also proposed a \\"cancellation test\\", which he claimed would prove his point.Baxandall, Peter J. Audible amplifier distortion is not a mystery. Wireless World, November 1977, pp. 63. Subjectivists Subjectivist Harry Pearson, long-time editor of the audiophile magazine The Absolute Sound has stated: > \\"We believe that the sound of music, unamplified, occurring in a real space > is a philosophic absolute against which we may judge the performance of > devices designed to reproduce music.\\" *Subjectivists rely on demonstrations and comparisons, but believe there are problems in applying double-blind methods to comparisons of audio devices. They believe that a relaxing environment and sufficient time measured in days or weeks is necessary for the discriminating ear to do its work.The Objective Subjective Review Debate , Martin Colloms, 1991, Retrieved on 2007-05-09 from hificritic.com *Subjectivists believe that careful individual listening is an appropriate tool for discovering the true worth of a device or treatment, and will generally acquire equipment that suits their own listening or style preferences as opposed to measurable equipment performance. *Subjectivists are likely to de-emphasize or ignore the potential impact of placebo and confirmation bias on subjective listening tests. Some audiophile equipment designers and consumers are obsessed over seemingly irrelevant details. Many components, for instance, are able to reproduce frequencies higher than the limit of human hearing‚Äî20 kHz. Some sources, such as FM radio, will not reproduce frequencies higher than 15 or 16 kHz. Subjectivists claim that experienced listeners can be relied upon for valid advice on how equipment sounds. British Hi-fi critic, Martin Colloms, writes that \\"the ability to assess sound quality is not a gift, nor is it the feature of a hyperactive imagination; it is simply a learned skill\\", which can be acquired by example, education and practice.Working in the Front Line:An approach to equipment reviewing , Martin Colloms, Stereophile, Vol.14 No.1, January 1991 Retrieved on 2007-05-09 from hificritic.com In any event, the eventual purchase decision will be made by the end-user, whose \\"perception is reality\\" and can be influenced by factors other than the equipment's actual performance. Opposing viewpoints The most significant difference between the two groups is that subjectivists claim there is a limit to what can be tested using objective measurements, while objectivists believe that since blind testing is the gold standard of all science, perceived sound quality should not be exempt from objective measurements. Objectivists tend to see the subjectivists as irrational and prone to gullibility, while subjectivists often dismiss objectivists as simple \\"meter men\\" who lack a nuanced appreciation of sound. Although the debate can be heated in certain quarters, both groups seek optimal listening experiences, and in some cases, the findings of one group has informed the other. Objectivists argue that vacuum-tube amplifiers often exhibit lower-fidelity than solid-state designs, and that in addition to their substantially higher total harmonic distortion level, they require rebiasing, tend to be less reliable, less powerful, generate more heat, and are usually more expensive. Subjectivists are often argue that while tube electronics are less linear than solid-state electronics at high-signal levels, they are much more linear at low-signal levels (less than one watt) and that many musical signals spend much of their time at these low levels. However, in cases where the subjectivists' claims can be verified by objective measure, it could not be considered a strictly \\"subjective\\" position. A more literally subjectivist argument is that listeners may be able to discern pleasurable benefits from tube equipment that would escape any attempt at objective measurement. Objectivists claim that digital sound can have higher fidelity than analog sound because it lacks clicks, pops, wow, flutter, audio feedback, degradation, generational loss, and rumble, has a higher signal-to-noise ratio, has a wider dynamic range, has less total harmonic distortion, and has a flatter and more extended frequency response. Subjectivists have argued that the process of converting a bit-stream to an analog waveform requires heavy filtering to remove spurious high-frequency information and that it should be expected that such filtering should involve some signal degradation and a large amount of phase shift in the passband. They point out that commonly used consumer-grade digital-to-analog converters (DACs) exhibit poor linearity at low levels. Both of these problems have since been verified by objective measure, and were then addressed by such solutions as digital filtering, oversampling, and the use of DACs operating at 20-bit (or higher) resolution. Today, many objectivists and subjectivists may agree that a preference for analog formats is often rooted in pleasing and familiar distortions and artifacts. At the same time, members of both camps might also agree that the best historical analog formats have often displayed great levels of audio fidelity as well. Musician Neil Young is a harsh critic of the sound of the original CD format, but has expressed approval for the sound of higher definition formats such as SACD, which he believes has a greater safety margin between its ideal behavior and the theoretical limits of human hearing. However, many independent listening tests and mathematical studies have shown that Young's assertions are basically untrue.\\"Results From Our Audio Poll: Neil Young and High-Definition Sound,\\" Justin Colletti, \\"Trust Me, I'm a Scientist,\\" May 2012 issue, Retrieved on 2012-09-06 from trustmeimascientist.com\\"24/192 Music Downloads ...and why they make no sense,\\" xiph.org, 2012, Retrieved on 2012-09-06 from xiph.org Regardless, in 2011, Neil Young filed paperwork to trademark his own developing high-resolution audio player. Objectivists and Subjectivist were once at odds about the importance of total harmonic distortion. Both groups now seem to agree that the distribution of harmonic distortion can be important in perceived sound quality. This is another case where subjective opinion was eventually verified by objective measure, and taken into account by objectivist engineers. Although this is no longer technically a point of contention, objectivists may be more likely to stress the importance of reducing total harmonic distortion in a system, while subjectivists may more often stress the importance on creating a more pleasing distribution of harmonic distortion. Difficulty of testing It is difficult, but very important, to match sound levels before comparing systems, as minute increases in loudness‚Äîmore than 0.15 dB\\"Our Last Hip Boots Column,\\" Peter Aczel, The Audio Critic, issue number 29, Summer/Fall 2003, page 5 (PDF page 6), accessed 2007-07-05. or 0.1 dB\\"The Amp/Speaker Interface: Are Your Loudspeakers Turning Your Amplifier into a Tone Control?\\" E. Brad Meyer, Stereo Review, June 1991, page 54, accessed 2007-07-05.‚Äîhave been demonstrated to cause perceived improvements in sound quality. Listening tests are subjected to many variables, and results are notoriously unreliable. Thomas Edison, for example, showed that large audiences responded favorably when presented both live performances by artists and reproductions by his recording system, which today would be regarded as primitive in quality. Similarly, results of component evaluation between various listeners or even the same listener under different circumstances cannot be easily replicated or standardized. Similarly, the acoustic behavior of the listening room‚Äîthe interaction between loudspeakers and the room's acoustics‚Äîand the interaction between an electromechanical device (loudspeaker) and an electronic device (amplifier) are subjected to many more variables than between electronic components. Thus the \\"difference\\" in sound quality between amplifiers is actually the ability of an amplifier to interface well with loudspeakers or a lucky combination of loudspeaker, amplifier, and room that works well together.The Amp/Speaker interface, Brad Meyer, Sound & Vision Magazine, Accessed 2007-05-11 The introduction of switching apparatus, with either metal connection (mechanical switches) or electronic processing (solid-state switches), may, some believe, obscure the differences between the two signal sources being tested. Skepticism advocate James Randi has offered a $1 million prize to subjectivists who can prove their most dubious claims through scientific blind testing. The prize remains unclaimed.

They signed another treaty with the federal government in 1856.\\"The Fourteenth Creek Treaty\\", concluded at Washington, D. C., on the 7th of August, 1856, was one of the most important in the history of the Creek. The names of the Creek delegates who signed it: Tuckabatchee Minco, Echo Harjo, Chilly McIntosh and Daniel N. McIntosh (sons of chief William McIntosh, who was executed in 1825 for signing the Treaty of Indian Springs), Benjamin Marshall, and George W. Stidham. These names continue to be prominent in the Creek Nation. Their descendants are among the leaders of the present generation of Creek. This treaty is an attempted summary of all former treaties, canceling many old provisions that seemed to have outlived their usefulness and adjusting many disputes which had arisen during the preceding decade. Chronicles of Oklahoma During the American Civil War, the tribe split into two factions, one allied with the Confederacy and the other, under Opothleyahola, allied with the Union. There were conflicts between pro-Confederate and pro-Union forces in the Indian Territory during the war. The pro-Confederate forces pursued the loyalists who were leaving to take refuge in Kansas. They fought at the Battle of Round Mountain, Battle of Chusto-Talasah, and Battle of Chustenahlah, resulting in 2,000 deaths among the 9,000 loyalists who were leaving.Creek Indians in the American Civil War Muscogee Creek beadwork After defeating the Confederacy, the Union required new peace treaties with the Five Civilized Tribes, which had allied with that insurrection. The Treaty of 1866 required the Creek to abolish slavery within their territory and to grant tribal citizenship to those Creek Freedmen who chose to stay in the territory; this citizenship was to include voting rights and shares of annuities and land allotments.1870 Loyal Creek abstract - Creek Treaty - Article IV provides how the losses of the loyal Creeks are to be ascertained ... and a roll of the names of all soldiers that enlisted in the Federal army, loyal refugee Indians ... If the Creek Freedmen moved out to United States territory, they would be granted United States citizenship, as were other emancipated African Americans.Note: Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution and American Indians: The Amendment was intended to give citizenship to African-American former slaves and not to Indians, who were considered to have independent sovereignty and citizenship within the territories of their reservations. Government agencies (the Bureau of Indian Affairs, the Department of the Interior), and the courts (state, federal, and, ultimately, the Supreme Court) consistently held that the Fourteenth Amendment did not confer citizenship on Indians. Under the Constitution, and the Supreme Court's interpretation of the Constitution, Indian tribes were classified as \\"domestic dependent nations,\\" and therefore, Indians were tribal citizens, not United States citizens. The Creek established a new government in 1866 and selected a new capital of Okmulgee. In 1867 they ratified a new constitution to incorporate elements of the new peace treaty, and their own desire for changes. They built their capitol building in 1867 and enlarged it in 1878. Today the Creek National Capitol is a National Historic Landmark. It now houses the Creek Council House Museum, as more space was needed for the government. During the prosperous final decades of the 19th century, when the tribe had autonomy and minimal interference from the federal government, the Nation built schools, churches, and public houses. At the turn of the century, Congress passed the 1898 Curtis Act, which dismantled tribal governments in another federal government attempt to assimilate the Native American people. The related Dawes Allotment Act required the break-up of communal tribal landholdings to allot land to individual households. This was intended to encourage adoption of the European-American style of subsistence farming and property ownership. It also was a means to extinguish Native American land claims and prepare for admitting Indian Territory and Oklahoma Territory as a state, which took place in 1907. The government declared that communal land remaining after allotments to existing households was \\"surplus\\". It was classified as excess and made available for sale to non-Natives. This resulted in the Creek and other tribes losing control over much of their former lands. In the hasty process of registration, the Dawes Commission registered tribal members in three categories: they distinguished among \\"Creek by Blood\\" and \\"Creek Freedmen,\\" a category where they listed anyone with visible African ancestry, regardless of their proportion of Creek ancestry; and \\"Intermarried Whites.\\" The process was so confused that some members of the same families of Freedmen were classified into different groups. The 1906 Five Civilized Tribes Act (April 26, 1906) was passed by the US Congress in anticipation of approving statehood for Oklahoma in 1907. During this time, the Creek had lost more than to non-Native settlers and the US government. Later, when Creek communities organized and set up governments under the 1936 Oklahoma Indian Welfare Act, some former Muscogee tribal towns reorganized that were in former Indian Territory and the Southeast. Some descendants had remained there and preserved cultural continuity. Ohers reorganized and gained recognition later in the 20th century. The following Muscogee groups have gained federal recognition as tribes: the Alabama-Quassarte Tribal Town, Kialegee Tribal Town, and Thlopthlocco Tribal Town of Oklahoma; the Coushatta Tribe of Louisiana, the Alabama-Coushatta Tribe of Texas, and the Poarch Band of Creeks in Alabama. The Muscogee (Creek) Nation did not reorganize its government and regain federal recognition until 1970. This was an era of increasing Native American activism across the country. In 1979 the tribe ratified a new constitution that replaced the 1866 constitution. The pivotal 1976 court case Harjo v. Kleppe helped end US federal paternalism. It ushered in an era of growing self-determination. Using the Dawes Rolls as a basis for determining membership of descendants, the Nation has enrolled more than 58,000 members, descendants of the allottees. Creek Freedmen controversy From 1981 to 2001, the Creek had membership rules that allowed applicants to use a variety of documentary sources to establish qualifications for membership. In 1979 the Muscogee Nation Constitutional Convention voted to limit citizenship in the Nation to persons who could prove descent by blood, meaning that members had to be able to document direct descent from an ancestor listed on the Dawes Commission roll in the category of \\"Creek by Blood\\". Persons proving they are descended from persons listed as Creek by blood can become citizens of the Muscogee (Creek) Nation. The 1893 registry was established to identify citizens of the nation at the time of allotment of communal lands and dissolution of the reservation system and tribal government.Sessional indexes to the Annals of Congress: Register of Debates in Congress ...

Roman concrete, also called opus caementicium, was a material used in construction in Ancient Rome. Roman concrete was based on a hydraulic-setting cement. It is durable due to its incorporation of pozzolanic ash, which prevents cracks from spreading. By the middle of the 1st century, the material was used frequently, often brick-faced, although variations in aggregate allowed different arrangements of materials. Further innovative developments in the material, called the concrete revolution, contributed to structurally complicated forms, such as the Pantheon dome, the world's largest and oldest unreinforced concrete dome. Roman concrete was normally faced with stone or brick, and interiors might be further decorated by stucco, fresco paintings, or thin slabs of fancy colored marbles. Made up of aggregate and cement, like modern concrete, it differed in that the aggregate pieces were typically far larger than in modern concrete, often amounting to rubble, and as a result it was laid rather than poured.Henig, Martin (ed), A Handbook of Roman Art, p. 30, Phaidon, 1983, Some Roman concretes were able to be set underwater, which was useful for bridges and other waterside construction. It is uncertain when Roman concrete was developed, but it was clearly in widespread and customary use from about 150 BC; some scholars believe it was developed a century before that.Bo√´thius, Axel, Ling, Roger, Rasmussen, Tom, Etruscan and Early Roman Architecture, pp. 128‚Äì129, Yale/Pelican history of art, 1978, Yale University Press, , Google Books Historic references Caesarea is the earliest known example to have used underwater Roman concrete technology on such a large scale. Vitruvius, writing around 25 BC in his Ten Books on Architecture, distinguished types of aggregate appropriate for the preparation of lime mortars. For structural mortars, he recommended pozzolana (pulvis puteolanus in Latin), the volcanic sand from the beds of Pozzuoli, which are brownish- yellow-gray in color in that area around Naples, and reddish-brown near Rome. Vitruvius specifies a ratio of 1 part lime to 3 parts pozzolana for cement used in buildings and a 1:2 ratio of lime to pozzolana for underwater work, essentially the same ratio mixed today for concrete used in marine locations.Heather Lechtman and Linn Hobbs \\"Roman Concrete and the Roman Architectural Revolution\\", Ceramics and Civilization Volume 3: High Technology Ceramics: Past, Present, Future, edited by W.D. Kingery and published by the American Ceramics Society, 1986; and Vitruvius, Book II:v,1; Book V:xii2 By the middle of the first century, the principles of underwater construction in concrete were well known to Roman builders. The city of Caesarea was the earliest known example to have made use of underwater Roman concrete technology on such a large scale.Lechtman and Hobbs \\"Roman Concrete and the Roman Architectural Revolution\\" For rebuilding Rome after the fire in 64 AD, which destroyed large portions of the city, Nero's new building code largely called for brick-faced concrete. This appears to have encouraged the development of the brick and concrete industries. Example of opus caementicium on a tomb on the ancient Appian Way in Rome. The original covering has been removed. Material properties Roman concrete, like any concrete, consists of an aggregate and hydraulic mortar ‚Äì a binder mixed with water that hardens over time. The aggregate varied, and included pieces of rock, ceramic tile, and brick rubble from the remains of previously demolished buildings. Gypsum and quicklime were used as binders. Volcanic dusts, called pozzolana or \\"pit sand\\", were favored where they could be obtained. Pozzolana makes the concrete more resistant to salt water than modern-day concrete.Wayman, Erin. ‚ÄúThe Secrets of Ancient Rome‚Äôs Buildings.‚Äù Smithsonian.com. 16 November 2011. Retrieved 24 April 2012. The pozzolanic mortar used had a high content of alumina and silica. Tuff was often used as an aggregate. Concrete, and in particular, the hydraulic mortar responsible for its cohesion, was a type of structural ceramic whose utility derived largely from its rheological plasticity in the paste state. The setting and hardening of hydraulic cements derived from hydration of materials and the subsequent chemical and physical interaction of these hydration products. This differed from the setting of slaked lime mortars, the most common cements of the pre-Roman world. Once set, Roman concrete exhibited little plasticity, although it retained some resistance to tensile stresses. The setting of pozzolanic cements has much in common with setting of their modern counterpart, Portland cement. The high silica composition of Roman pozzolana cements is very close to that of modern cement to which blast furnace slag, fly ash, or silica fume have been added. The strength and longevity of Roman marine concrete is understood to benefit from a reaction of seawater with a mixture of volcanic ash and quicklime to create a rare crystal called tobermorite, which may resist fracturing. As seawater percolated within the tiny cracks in the Roman concrete, it reacted with phillipsite naturally found in the volcanic rock and created aluminous tobermorite crystals. The result is a candidate for \\"the most durable building material in human history\\". In contrast, modern concrete exposed to saltwater deteriorates within decades. Crystal structure of tobermorite: elementary unit cell Compressive strengths for modern Portland cements are typically at the level and have improved almost ten-fold since 1860. There are no comparable mechanical data for ancient mortars, although some information about tensile strength may be inferred from the cracking of Roman concrete domes. These tensile strengths vary substantially from the water/cement ratio used in the initial mix. At present, there is no way of ascertaining what water/cement ratios the Romans used, nor are there extensive data for the effects of this ratio on the strengths of pozzolanic cements.C. A. Langton and D. M. Roy, \\"Longevity of Borehole and Shaft Sealing Materials: Characterization of Ancient Cement Based Building Materials\\", Mat. Res. Soc. SYmp.

Seismic technology For an environment as prone to earthquakes as the Italian peninsula, interruptions and internal constructions within walls and domes created discontinuities in the concrete mass. Portions of the building could then shift slightly when there was movement of the earth to accommodate such stresses, enhancing the overall strength of the structure. It was in this sense that bricks and concrete were flexible. It may have been precisely for this reason that, although many buildings sustained serious cracking from a variety of causes, they continue to stand to this day.W. L. MacDonald, The Architecture of the Roman Empire, rev. ed. Yale University Press, New Haven, 1982, fig. 131B; Lechtman and Hobbs \\"Roman Concrete and the Roman Architectural Revolution\\" Another technology used to improve the strength and stability of concrete was its gradation in domes. One example is the Pantheon, where the aggregate of the upper dome region consists of alternating layers of light tuff and pumice, giving the concrete a density of . The foundation of the structure used travertine as an aggregate, having a much higher density of .K. de Fine Licht, The Rotunda in Rome: A Study of Hadrian's Pantheon.

Because of its unusual durability, longevity and lessened environmental footprint, corporations and municipalities are starting to explore the use of Roman-style concrete in North America, replacing the coal fly ash with volcanic ash that has similar properties. Proponents claim that concrete made with volcanic ash can cost up to 60% less because it requires less cement, and that it has a smaller environmental footprint due to its lower cooking temperature and much longer lifespan. Usable examples of Roman concrete exposed to harsh marine environments have been found to be 2000 years old with little or no wear.M. D. Jackson, S. R. Chae, R. Taylor, C. Meral, J. Moon, S. Yoon, P.

The street, which starts at the Chicago River between Wabash and North Michigan Avenues, runs directly north until it slants on a diagonal as it crosses Chicago Avenue then it continues to Cedar and State Streets, making it slightly less than a mile long. One lane also runs southbound from Ohio Street (600N) to Kinzie Street (400N) as part of a two-way street segment. It runs parallel to and one block west of the Magnificent Mile on the two-way traffic North Michigan Avenue, which runs at 100 east up to 950 north.. The street, which is also one block east of the one-way southbound Wabash Avenue, formerly ran slightly further south to the Chicago River where over time various bridges connected it to the Loop, Chicago's central business district. Rush Street's history traces back to the original incorporation of the city in the 1830s. It has since hosted important residences, such as the house of the first Mayor of Chicago, and significant commerce. Today, it continues to run through some of the wealthiest neighborhoods in the country and has businesses that correspond to the demands of its residents. The neighborhood hosts highly rated restaurants, five-star hotels, and four-star spas. The street, which was named after Declaration of Independence signator Benjamin Rush, was once known for its nightlife, especially at the northern end, which features entertainment that attracts locals and visitors. During the 1960s and 1970s, it was the most vibrant nightlife entertainment destination in the country outside of Las Vegas, with major stars like Tony Bennett, Frank Sinatra, Barry Manilow. Better Midler, Oscar Peterson to name a few along with some of the greatest groups to hail from the city of Chicago. By the 1980s many of these establishments shuttered. Today, the street has emerged into an overflow of Oak Street with luxury shopping lining the streets from Barney's to Bugatti. The southern end of the street was an integral part of the city as a main river crossing at various incarnations of the Rush Street Bridge across the main branch of the Chicago River from the mid-19th century until the 1920s. The Rush Street Bridges have a rich cultural history, which includes both a prominent role in facilitating vehicular land traffic and a prominent role as a commercial port location. However, commerce on the Chicago River has declined since the 1930s and the Michigan Avenue Bridge has taken over the role as the primary river crossing for this neighborhood. Background Benjamin Rush by Charles Willson Peale, 1783 Rush Street was named after Benjamin Rush, one of the four physician signators of the United States Declaration of Independence. It is one of several places named after Rush in Chicago; other such places are Rush Medical College and Rush-Presbyterian-St. Luke's Medical Center. As part of the original incorporated city of Chicago in 1837, Rush Street is one of the city's oldest thoroughfares. Like Clark Street, parts of Rush Street roughly follow the path of an Indian trail called Green Bay trail (later Green Bay Road) that ran to Green Bay, Wisconsin. Early Rush Street was commonly agreed to be desirable place of residence, and hosted the first house designed by an architect in Chicago (designed for the first Mayor of Chicago William Ogden by John M. Van Osdel). The house, bounded by Erie, Ontario, Rush and Cass (now Wabash Avenue) Streets, did not survive the Great Chicago Fire of 1871. After the Great Chicago Fire, the Near North Side became a refuge for many due to its wide streets, high ground, good drainage, and proximity to both the Lake Michigan lakeshore and Lincoln Park. Cyrus McCormick built a mansion at 675 Rush Street between 1875 and 1879.. The mansion, located at the corner of Rush and Erie, lured so many relatives to move nearby that the neighborhood became known as \\"McCormickville\\" by the 1880s... The street subsequently hosted elite Chicago socialites. Cyrus' brother Leander J. McCormick built the Virginia Hotel at the northwest corner of Rush and Ohio. Opening just a few years before the 1893 World's Columbian Exposition, the 400-room hotel was advertised as \\"an absolutely fire-proof building and a finished hotel second to no other.\\" The hotel featured ornate granite interiors decorated with marble statues, separate \\"gentlemen's smoking room\\" and \\"ladies dining room\\", and a room of boilers and dynamos to offer the latest technology: electric lights. Well into the 20th century, residential buildings faced Rush Street until the demands of the expanding commerce‚Äîespecially concentrations of restaurants and night clubs‚Äîconsumed its real estate. In the 1950s, the Chicago City Council began to use the Uniform Vehicle Code of 1931 to fight traffic congestion by creating one-way streets. This was most effectively used in the Loop and Near North Side community areas. Most of the Near North Side streets remain one-way today as a result. Rush Street is among the area's one-way streets: except for a short segment, only northbound travel is permitted. Geography Rush Street runs north‚Äìsouth and in a north-northwest direction (see map in external links). It runs north‚Äìsouth at 65 east from 400 north at its southern terminus at Kinzie Avenue to 800 north at Chicago Avenue between Michigan Avenue to the east at 100 east and Wabash Avenue to the west at 44 east. On the north side of Chicago it runs straight on a slight diagonal to the street grid. By the time it travels three blocks north to Delaware Place at 900 north, it intersects Wabash.. It then continues on a diagonal for four more blocks where it intersects the north‚Äìsouth running State Street (the centerline between east and west). at Cedar Street which runs at 1120 north.. It is crossed by Ohio Street and Ontario Street which feed from and to the Kennedy Expressway to the west. On the north side of Chicago Avenue Rush Street is part of the Gold Coast neighborhood of the Near North Side community area. The Gold Coast is the nation's second wealthiest neighborhood, trailing only the Central Park East neighborhood of Manhattan's Upper East Side. Between Chicago Avenue and the Chicago River, Rush Street is part of the River North Gallery District. The River North District hosts more art galleries than any neighborhood outside of Manhattan. Both of the diagonal crossings border Chicago Park District parks that are situated on the resulting triangular land plots. At the Wabash crossing, which has an official address of 871 North Wabash, a park exists that was renamed Connors Park for former Illinois State Senate Minority Leader William Connors in 1970. This park was acquired by the city in 1848 and has been renamed several times. At the State Street crossing, which has an official address of 1031 North State Street, Mariano Park exists and was renamed for Louis Mariano in 1970. This park was acquired by the city in 1848 and was transferred to the Park District in 1959. It hosts a structure designed by Birch Burdette Long, who was a Frank Lloyd Wright protege, according to a plaque in the park. In the area surrounded by the Trump International Hotel & Tower to the west, the Chicago River to the south, Rush Street and the Wrigley Building to the east and McDonald's and River Plaza to the north the towers designers have planned a Riverfront Park & Riverwalk along a space that is . In the Gold Coast neighborhood, honorary streets such as Frank Sinatra Way (Bellevue Place at 1030 north). and Mike Ditka Way (East Chesnut Street at 860 north). cross Rush Street. Ditka has a restaurant at 100 East Chestnut and coached the Chicago Bears to a Super Bowl XX victory. Sinatra made \\"My Kind of Town (Chicago is)\\" and \\"Chicago (That Toddlin' Town)\\" famous. Bridge While there is currently no bridge along Rush Street at the main stem of the Chicago River, the main stem has through its history been crossed by four bridges at Rush Street. The first bridge was a floating bridge that was hinged to one bank. Ropes were used to open and close this bridge. A March 1849 ice storm was the first of two instances in which all bridges on the main stem of the Chicago River were destroyed overnight. An iron and timber swing bridge with center supports was built in 1857 at a cost of $48,000. The bridge stood until, on November 3, 1863, a passing ship's whistle spooked a herd of cattle that was crowding the bridge and stampeded into the river. The bridge was repaired and still in use on October 8, 1871 when it was destroyed in the Great Chicago Fire. In 1872 the Detroit Bridge and Iron Works company built a wrought-iron replacement that stood until 1883, when a barge struck and collapsed the bridge. It was replaced by another swing bridge that lasted for several decades until after the Michigan Avenue Bridge was built in 1920. This final 1884 bridge had trusses measuring in the center and on the ends. Its deck used white pine planks. The southeast corner of the Rush Street Bridge, which connected to Michigan Avenue, was the location of the Goodrich docks from which the SS Christopher Columbus made its daily round-trip excursions to Milwaukee, Wisconsin. Although she was used for excursions elsewhere around the Great Lakes, her regular schedule was a daily trip to Milwaukee, leaving Chicago mid-morning, sailing to Milwaukee for a two-hour stopover, and then returning. The Goodrich Transportation Company used the Goodrich wharves from the time of the American Civil War until the 1930s to connect Chicago with other port locations throughout Lake Michigan and the Great Lakes. Today, skyscrapers have replaced the industrial structures that historically lined the riverbanks of the nations most significant inland port. Before the Michigan Avenue bridge (pictured right), vehicular traffic crossed the river at Rush and traveled up to Ontario Street before heading east to Pine Street (now North Michigan Avenue after multiple renamings).. The bridge carried 77% of all the automobiles and 23% of the commercial vehicles that commuted into the Loop each day. There were several plans starting in the 1880s for improving Michigan Avenue that involved Rush Street, but nothing came of any of them.. The final Rush Street Bridge was not designed for automobile traffic, which caused congestion on the south bank of the River where both Michigan and Wabash fed onto River Street (now Wacker Drive). In May 1904, the Chicago Tribune declared that the wide Rush Street Bridge, which handled approximately 50% of the north‚Äìsouth traffic in the city, was unfit for the contemporary pedestrian and vehicular traffic.. Thus Daniel Burnham's 1909 Plan of Chicago called for the replacement of the bridge with a new bridge at Michigan Avenue and the redevelopment of Wacker Drive. The bridge was quickly removed after the completion of the new Michigan Avenue Bridge. Commerce and education In the 1960s, Rush Street was the center of the Chicago nightlife as home to many great cabarets, bars, clubs and restaurants. However, many of the bars migrated north to Division Street as the street gentrified. Currently, the late night establishments mostly lure suburbanites and tourists. The Chicago Sun-Times describes it as the \\"hippest strip\\" in Chicago, with specific kudos to the part between Oak Street and Chicago Avenue. It continues to be the destination where visiting conventioners in pursuit of Chicago nightlife are brought by taxi as well as a preferred place for thirtysomething singles to congregate at night, especially in the summer. Although Rush Street ends two blocks south of Division Street, the nightlife ambiance now continues to Division and spreads west from there. Rush Street is known for hosting some of the few highly rated and esteemed restaurants in the Chicago Gold Coast neighborhood. According to Frommer's and Zagat Survey, Gibsons Steakhouse is one of the favorite restaurants in Chicago, and is located on Rush Street. Rush Street is a block east of the original location of the Chicago-style deep dish pizza, Uno Chicago Grill, and it hosts Giordano's, its answer to Uno's. Among the most prominent businesses along this strip is the Bentley and Lamborghini Gold Coast showroom, which is located across East Pearson Street from The Clare at Water Tower along Rush Street. The Clare is one of the tallest residential buildings reserved for seniors anywhere in the world. Rush Street's southern terminus is adjacent to a rear entrance of the Wrigley Building as well as the Trump International Hotel and Tower which has a 401-North Wabash address.. The 800 block of the Gold Coast neighborhood portion of Rush Street is a block away from Michigan Avenue and four of the tallest buildings in the world: John Hancock Center (875 North Michigan Avenue), 900 North Michigan, Water Tower Place (845 Michigan), & Park Tower (800 Michigan). Four more of the fifty tallest buildings in Chicago are also a block from Rush Street: Olympia Centre (737 Michigan), One Magnificent Mile, (980 Michigan), Chicago Place (700 Michigan), and Palmolive Building, (919 Michigan). 55 East Erie Street, which was the second tallest all-residential building in the world from 2004 until 2007 when 340 on the Park was completed, is among the skyscrapers on or with entrances on Rush street. There is a current proposal to redevelop 740 North Rush Street (at the corner of East Superior Street) with a fifty-story skyscraper designed by Skidmore, Owings & Merrill and developed by Fordham Company. This address currently houses the Chicago offices of Crain Communications Inc., and it is just north of Giordano's, which has a 730 North Rush Street address. Several prominent hotels are located on or bounded by Rush street. The Peninsula Chicago is one of only three five star hotels in the Midwestern United States, is located on East Superior between Rush Street and Michigan. The Four Seasons Hotel Chicago, another of the Midwest's five star hotels, is also located on a cross street between Rush Street and Michigan Avenue. These two hotels host the highest rated spas in Illinois. Although the main entrance and official address of the Chicago Marriott Downtown Magnificent Mile is 540 North Michigan Avenue, the driveway for the hotel has a 541 North Rush Street address. Similarly, the former Chicago Conrad Hotel (since 2015, The Gwen) located at 521 North Rush Street is a reconstruction of the former 520 North Michigan Chicago Landmark McGraw-Hill Building. The former Archbishop Quigley Preparatory Seminary, which has been converted for use by the Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Chicago is located on Rush Street between Superior and Chestnut. The Water Tower Campus of the Loyola University Chicago is located along East Pearson St., which crosses Rush Street between the Bentley/Lamborghini Gold Coast Showroom to the North and The Clare @ Water Tower to the South on the west side of the street. The Quigley Seminary Building was listed on the National Register of Historic Places on February 16, 1996. Rush Street also hosts one of three regional Royal Thai Consulate- General locations to support Royal Thai Embassy in Washington, D.C.

In commemoration of Kawaguchi's visit to Nepal (Bodnath, Kathmandu) Kawaguchi performing Tibetan ceremonies. (February 26, 1866 - February 24, 1945) was a Japanese Buddhist monk, famed for his four journeys to Nepal (in 1899, 1903, 1905 and 1913), and two to Tibet (July 4, 1900‚ÄìJune 15, 1902, 1913‚Äì1915), being the first recorded Japanese citizen to travel in either country.Hyer, Paul (1979). \\"Narita Yasuteru: First Japanese to Enter Tibet\\". Tibet Journal Vol. IV, No. 2, Autumn 1979, p. 12. Life and early journey From an early age Kawaguchi, whose birth name was Sadajiro, was passionate about becoming a monk. In fact, his passion was unusual in a country that was quickly modernizing; he gave serious attention to the monastic vows of vegetarianism, chastity, and temperance even as other monks were happily abandoning them. As a result, he became disgusted with the worldliness and political corruption of the Japanese Buddhist world.Berry 1989, p. 11-12 Until March, 1891, he worked as the Rector of the Zen in Tokyo (a large temple which contains 500 rakan icons). He then spent about 3 years as a hermit in Kyoto studying Chinese Buddhist texts and learning Pali, to no use; he ran into political squabbles even as a hermit. Finding Japanese Buddhism too corrupt, he decided to go to Tibet instead, despite the fact that the region was officially off limits to all foreigners. In fact, unbeknownst to Kawaguchi, Japanese religious scholars had spent most of the 1890s trying to enter Tibet to find rare Buddhist sutras, with the backing of large institutions and scholarships, but had invariably failed.Okuyama 2008, pp. 215-7. He left Japan for India in June, 1897, without a guide or map, simply buying his way onto a cargo boat. He had a smattering of English but did not know a word of Hindi or Tibetan. Also, he had no money, having refused the donations of his friends; instead, he made several fishmonger and butcher friends pledge to give up their professions forever and become vegetarian, claiming that the good karma would ensure his success.Berry 1989, p. 14 Success appeared far from guaranteed, but arriving in India with very little money, he somehow entered the good graces of Sarat Chandra Das, an Indian British agent and Tibetan scholar, and was given passage to northern India. Kawaguchi would later be accused of spying for Das, but there is no evidence for this, and a close reading of his diary makes it seem quite unlikely.Hopkirk, Peter (1997): Trespassers on the Roof of the World: The Secret Exploration of Tibet, pp. 150-151; 157. Kodansha Globe (Pbk). . Kawaguchi stayed in Darjeeling for several months living with a Tibetan family by Das' arrangement. He became fluent in the Tibetan language, which was at that time neither systematically taught to foreigners nor compiled, by talking to children and women on the street.Berry 1989, p. 26-7 Crossing over the Himalayas on an unpatrolled dirt road with an untrustworthy guide, Kawaguchi soon found himself alone and lost on the Tibetan plateau. He had the good fortune to befriend every wanderer he met in the countryside, including monks, shepherds, and even bandits, but he still took almost four years to reach Lhasa after stopovers at a number of monasteries and a pilgrimage round sacred Mount Kailash in western Tibet. He posed as a Chinese monk and gained a reputation as an excellent doctor which led to him having an audience with the 13th Dalai Lama, Thubten Gyatso (1876 to 1933).Kawaguchi 1909, pp. 309-322 He spent some time living in Sera Monastery.Kawaguchi 1909, pp. 323-328. Kawaguchi devoted his entire time in Tibet to Buddhist pilgrimage and study. Although he mastered the difficult terminology of the classical Tibetan language and was able to pass for a Tibetan, he was surprisingly intolerant of Tibetans' minor violations of monastic laws, and of the eating of meat in a country with very little arable farmland. As a result, he did not fit in well in monastic circles, instead finding work as a doctor of Chinese and Western medicine. His services were soon in high demand.Berry 1989, pp. 169-200 Kawaguchi spent his time in Lhasa in disguise and, following a tip that his cover had been blown, had to flee the country hurriedly. He almost petitioned the government to let him stay as an honest and apolitical monk, but the intimations of high-ranking friends convinced him not to. Even so, several of the people who had sheltered him were horribly tortured and mutilated.Hopkirk, Peter (1997): Trespassers on the Roof of the World: The Secret Exploration of Tibet, pp. 149, 154. Kodansha Globe (Pbk). . Kawaguchi was deeply concerned for his friends, and despite his ill health and lack of funds, after leaving the country he used all his connections to petition the Nepalese Prime Minister Chandra Shumsher Rana for help. On the Prime Minister's recommendation, the Tibetan Government released Kawaguchi's loyal Tibetan friends from jail.\\"The First Recorded Japanese Visitor: Ekai Kawaguchi\\" - pdf file from the Japanese Embassy in Nepal. Reporting in Japan When Kawaguchi finally returned to Japan he caused a sensation and an instant surge of interest in distant Tibet. His travelogue, quickly published based on talks he gave, shows his shock at the lack of hygiene amongst Tibetans, the filth of Tibetan cities, and by many Tibetan customs, including sexual practices, monastic immoderation, corruption and superstitious beliefs. On the other hand, he had great admiration for many Tibetans ranging from great religious and political leaders to common people and made many friends while he was in Tibet.Berry (2005), pp. 37-45, 57. Ironically given Kawaguchi's faithful background, newspapers criticized his lectures to the public about Tibetan hygiene and sexual practices as being a hodge-podge of lowbrow humor and dirty stories unbecoming of a monk.Okuyama 2008, p. 208. Narita Yasuteru, a Japanese spy secretly dispatched to Tibet in the late 1890s, anonymously accused Kawaguchi of having never been there; this accusation was quickly debunked by the Japanese newspapers.Berry 1989, pp. 250-251 In fact, internal documents show that Narita himself had never reached Tibet on his expensive spy mission, making Kawaguchi the first person to have actually arrived there.Kimura 1981 Further travels Partly as a result of hearing about the discovery of an Ashoka Pillar in 1896 identifying Lumbini as the birthplace of Gautama Buddha, he visited Lumbini with other Japanese pilgrims in 1912. He then returned to Tibet a final time in 1913. While his more mature narrative of this trip is mainly occupied with Japanese poems about the beauty of the land, he could not resist some final criticisms of the monks' lax attitude towards monastic rules.Berry 1989, p. 292 He brought back to Japan a large collection of Tibetan scriptures, but had a lengthy and public dispute with the other pilgrims about who the Dalai Lama had intended to give them to, causing him to lose some face in the Buddhist world.Okuyama 2008, p. 222. He did assist the German Theravada monk Nyanatiloka in the 1920s. After this Kawaguchi became an independent monk, living with his brother's family for the rest of his life, and earning an income from scholarly publications. He refused to assist the military police when they sought intelligence on Tibet, and died in 1945.Berry 1989, p. 299 He was a friend of Mrs. Annie Besant, President of the Theosophical Society, who encouraged him to publish the English text of his book, Three Years in Tibet.Kawaguchi, Ekai (1909): Three Years in Tibet, page vii. Reprint: Book Faith India (1995), Delhi. The Government of Nepal issued a postage stamp in 2003 commemorating Kawaguchi's visits to that country. He is also said to have planted two saplings of Himalayan Cicada trees (also called: Riang Riang; Ploiarium alternifolium), which he had brought back with him, near the gate of the Obaku-san Manpukuji Zen Buddhist temple on the outskirts of Kyoto, where he had studied as a young man. These are now grown into tall trees. From the Japanese embassy in Nepal Buddhist Doctrinal Reformer Kawaguchi was disturbed by the confusing messages of the main objects of veneration based on a pantheon of deities, spirits, historical and mythological figures. Instead he called for a return to veneration of Shakyamuni and lay-centered practice. Footnotes References *Berry, Scott: A Stranger in Tibet: The Adventures of a Wandering Zen Monk.

Themes of the story The following are major themes of the story, Theme of materialism Theme of inferiority Theme of psychological fixation Plot summary Oliver Bacon is this story's protagonist. Once a poor boy in the streets of London, he has become the richest jeweller in England. As a young man, he sold stolen dogs to wealthy women and marketed cheap watches at a higher price. On a wall in his private room hangs a picture of his late mother. He frequently talks to her and reminisces, once chuckling at his past endeavors. One day, Oliver enters into his private shop room, barely acknowledging his underlings, and awaits the arrival of the Duchess. When she arrives, he has her wait.

The Duchess and the Jeweler are described as \\"... friends, yet enemies; he was master, she was mistress; each cheated the other, each needed the other, each feared the other...\\" On this particular day, the Duchess comes to Oliver to sell ten pearls, as she has lost substantial money to gambling. Mr. Bacon is skeptical of the pearls' authenticity, but the Duchess manipulates him into buying them for twenty thousand pounds. When the Duchess invites him to an event that includes a cast of royalty and her daughter Diana, Oliver is persuaded to write a cheque . In the end, the pearls are found to be fakes, and Oliver looks at his mother's portrait, questioning his actions. However, what Oliver truly bought was not actually the pearls: it was Diana. 1938 short stories Short stories by Virginia Woolf Works originally published in Harper's Bazaar ","title":"The Duchess and the Jeweller"},{"id":"13222629","text":"ADP ribose ADP-ribosylation is the addition of one or more ADP-ribose moieties to a protein. It is a reversible post-translational modification that is involved in many cellular processes, including cell signaling, DNA repair, gene regulation and apoptosis. Improper ADP-ribosylation has been implicated in some forms of cancer. It is also the basis for the toxicity of bacterial compounds such as cholera toxin, diphtheria toxin, and others. History The first suggestion of ADP-ribosylation surfaced during the early 1960s. At this time, Pierre Chambon and coworkers observed the incorporation of ATP into hen liver nuclei extract. After extensive studies on the acid insoluble fraction, several different research laboratories were able to identify ADP-ribose, derived from NAD+, as the incorporated group. Several years later, the enzymes responsible for this incorporation were identified and given the name poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase. Originally, this group was thought to be a linear sequence of ADP-ribose units covalently bonded through a ribose glycosidic bond. It was later reported that branching can occur every 20 to 30 ADP residues. The first appearance of mono-ADP-ribosylation occurred a year later during a study of toxins: corynebacterium diphtheria diphtheria toxin was shown to be dependent on NAD+ in order for it to be completely effective, leading to the discovery of enzymatic conjugation of a single ADP-ribose group by mono-ADP-ribosyl transferase. It was initially thought that ADP- ribosylation was a post translational modification involved solely in gene regulation. However, as more enzymes with the ability to ADP-ribosylate proteins were discovered, the multifunctional nature of ADP-ribosylation became apparent. The first mammalian enzyme with poly-ADP-ribose transferase activity was discovered during the late 1980s. For the next 15 years, it was thought to be the only enzyme capable of adding a chain of ADP-ribose in mammalian cells. During the late 1980s, ADP-ribosyl cyclases, which catalyze the addition of cyclic-ADP-ribose groups to proteins, were discovered. Finally, sirtuins, a family of enzymes that also possess NAD+-dependent deacylation activity, were discovered to also possess mono-ADP-ribosyl transferase activity. Catalytic mechanism Mechanism for ADP-ribosylation, with residues of the catalyzing enzyme shown in blue. The source of ADP-ribose for most enzymes that perform this modification is the redox cofactor NAD+. In this transfer reaction, the N-glycosidic bond of NAD+ that bridges the ADP- ribose molecule and the nicotinamide group is cleaved, followed by nucleophilic attack by the target amino acid side chain. ADP- ribosyltransferases can perform two types of modifications: mono-ADP ribosylation and poly-ADP ribosylation. =Mono ADP-ribosylation= Mono-ADP ribosyltransferases commonly catalyze the addition of ADP-ribose to arginine side chains using a highly conserved R-S-EXE motif of the enzyme. The reaction proceeds by breaking the bond between nicotinamide and ribose to form an oxonium ion. Next, the arginine side chain of the target protein then acts a nucleophile, attacking the electrophilic carbon adjacent to the oxonium ion. In order for this step to occur, the arginine nucleophile is deprotonated by a glutamate residue on the catalyzing enzyme. Another conserved glutamate residue forms a hydrogen bond with one of the hydroxyl groups on the ribose chain to further facilitate this nucleophilic attack. As a result of the cleavage reaction, nicotinamide is released. The modification can be reversed by ADP-ribosylhydrolases, which cleave the N-glycosidic bond between arginine and ribose to release ADP-ribose and unmodified protein; NAD+ is not restored by the reverse reaction. =Poly ADP-ribosylation= Poly-(ADP-ribose) polymerases (PARPs) are found mostly in eukaryotes and catalyze the transfer of multiple ADP-ribose molecules to target proteins. As with mono-ADP ribosylation, the source of ADP-ribose is NAD+. PARPs use a catalytic triad of His-Tyr-Glu to facilitate binding of NAD+ and positioning of the end of the existing poly-ADP ribose chain on the target protein; the Glu facilitates catalysis and formation of a (1->2) O-glycosidic linkage between two ribose molecules. There are several other enzymes that recognize poly-ADP ribose chains, hydrolyse them or form branches; over 800 proteins have been annotated to contain the loosely defined poly ADP-ribose binding motif; therefore, in addition to this modification altering target protein conformation and structure, it may also be used as a tag to recruit other proteins or for regulation of the target protein.  Amino acid specificity  Many different amino acid side chains have been described as ADP-ribose acceptors. From a chemical perspective, this modification represents protein glycosylation: the transfer of ADP-ribose occurs onto amino acid side chains with a nucleophilic oxygen, nitrogen, or sulfur, resulting in N-, O-, or S-glycosidic linkage to the ribose of the ADP-ribose. Originally, acidic amino acids (glutamate and aspartate) were described as the main sites of ADP-ribosylation. However, many other ADP-ribose acceptor sites such as serine, arginine,Laing S, Koch-Nolte F, Haag F, Buck F. \\"Strategies for the identification of arginine ADP- ribosylation sites\\".

Function =Apoptosis= During DNA damage or cellular stress PARPs are activated, leading to an increase in the amount of poly-ADP-ribose and a decrease in the amount of NAD+. For over a decade it was thought that PARP1 was the only poly-ADP-ribose polymerase in mammalian cells, therefore this enzyme has been the most studied. Caspases are a family of cysteine proteases that are known to play an essential role in programmed cell death. This protease cleaves PARP-1 into two fragments, leaving it completely inactive, to limit poly-ADP-ribose production. One of its fragments migrates from the nucleus to the cytoplasm and is thought to become a target of autoimmunity. During caspase-independent apoptosis, also called parthanatos, poly-ADP-ribose accumulation can occur due to activation of PARPs or inactivation of poly(ADP-ribose) glycohydrolase, an enzyme that hydrolyses poly(ADP-ribose) to produce free ADP-ribose. Studies have shown poly-ADP- ribose drives the translocation of the apoptosis inducing factor protein to the nucleus where it will mediate DNA fragmentation. It has been suggested that if a failure of caspase activation under stress conditions were to occur, necroptosis would take place. Overactivation of PARPs has led to a necrotic cell death regulated by the tumor necrosis factor protein. Though the mechanism is not yet understood, PARP inhibitors have been shown to affect necroptosis. =Gene regulation= ADP-ribosylation can affect gene expression at nearly every level of regulation, including chromatin organization, transcription factor recruitment and binding, and mRNA processing. The organization of nucleosomes is key to regulation of gene expression: the spacing and organization of nucleosomes changes what regions of DNA are available for transcription machinery to bind and transcribe DNA. PARP1, a poly-ADP ribose polymerase, has been shown to affect chromatin structure and promote changes in the organization of nucleosomes through modification of histones. Crystal structure of PARP1 zinc finger domain bound to DNA (purple). PDB: 4AV1 PARPs have been shown to affect transcription factor structure and cause recruitment of many transcription factors to form complexes at DNA and elicit transcription. Mono ADP-ribosyltransferases are also shown to affect transcription factor binding at promoters. For example, PARP14, a mono ADP- ribosyltransferase, has been shown to affect STAT transcription factor binding. Other ADP-ribosyltransferases have been shown to modify proteins that bind mRNA, which can cause silencing of that gene transcript. =DNA repair= Poly-ADP-ribose polymerases (PARPs) can function in DNA repair of single strand breaks as well as double strand breaks. In single-strand break repair (base excision repair) the PARP can either facilitate removal of an oxidized sugar or strand cleavage. PARP1 binds the single-strand breaks and pulls any nearby base excision repair intermediates close. These intermediates include XRCC1 and APLF and they can be recruited directly or through the PBZ domain of the APLF. This leads to the synthesis of poly-ADP ribose. The PBZ domain is present in many proteins involved in DNA repair and allows for the binding of the PARP and thus ADP-ribosylation which recruits repair factors to interact at the break site. PARP2 is a secondary responder to DNA damage but serves to provide functional redundancy in DNA repair. DNA repair facilitated by PARP1 recruitment of repair enzymes. Repair of a single strand break in DNA is initiated by the binding of PARP1. PARP1 binds single-strand breaks and pulls base excision repair intermediates close, leading to the synthesis of poly-ADP ribose. XRCC1 is the X-ray repair cross complementing protein 1. XRCC1 complexes with polynucleotide kinase (PNK) which processes DNA termini. PCNA is the proliferating cell nuclear antigen that serves as a DNA clamp that aids in the DNA polymerase activity (DNA pol) FEN1 (Flap endonuclease 1) is then recruited to remove the overhanging 5' flap. The last step of DNA repair involves DNA ligase which brings the final DNA strands together in a phosphodiester bond. There are many mechanisms for the repair of damaged double stranded DNA. PARP1 may function as a synapsis factor in alternative non-homologous end joining. Additionally, it has been proposed that PARP1 is required to slow replication forks following DNA damage and promotes homologous recombination at replication forks that may be dysfunctional. It is possible that PARP1 and PARP3 work together in repair of double-stranded DNA and it has been shown that PARP3 is critical for double-stranded break resolution. There are two hypotheses by which PARP1 and PARP3 coincide. The first hypothesis states that the two ADP-ribosyltransferases serve to function for each other's inactivity. If PARP3 is lost, this results in single-strand breaks, and thus the recruitment of PARP1. A second hypothesis suggests that the two enzyme work together; PARP3 catalyzes mono-ADP ribosylation and short poly-ADP ribosylation and serves to activate PARP1. The PARPs have many protein targets at the site of DNA damage. KU protein and DNA-PKcs are both double-stranded break repair components with unknown sites of ADP- ribosylation. Histones are another protein target of the PARPs. All core histones and linker histone H1 are ADP-ribosylated following DNA damage. The function of these modifications is still unknown, but it has been proposed that ADP-ribosylation modulates higher-order chromatin structure in efforts to facilitate more accessible sites for repair factors to migrate to the DNA damage. =Protein degradation= The ubiquitin-proteasome system (UPS) figures prominently in protein degradation. The 26S proteasome consists of a catalytic subunit (the 20S core particle), and a regulatory subunit (the 19S cap). Poly-ubiquitin chains tag proteins for degradation by the proteasome, which causes hydrolysis of tagged proteins into smaller peptides. Tankyrase (TNKS), an ADP-ribosyltransferase, interacts with proteasome regulator PI31. Evidence in Drosophila and human cell lines demonstrates that the Ankyrin domain (ANK) of TNKS facilitates interaction with the N-terminal TNKS-binding motif and C-terminal HbYX domain of PI31. This promotes ADP-ribosylation of PI31 by the PARP domain of TNKS. In addition, it was shown that treatment of Drosophila cells with a TNKS inhibitor, XAV939, attenuated 26S proteasome activity. Moreover, ADP-ribosylation of PI31 has been demonstrated to block PI31-mediated inhibition of Œ±-subunits of the 20S particle. Therefore, a working hypothesis is that tankyrase-mediated ADP-ribosylation reduces PI31's activity, which in turn decreases protein degradation performed by the proteasome. Clinical significance =Cancer= PARP1 is involved in base excision repair (BER), single- and double-strand break repair, and chromosomal stability. It is also involved in transcriptional regulation through its facilitation of protein‚Äìprotein interactions. PARP1 uses NAD+ in order to perform its function in apoptosis. If a PARP becomes overactive the cell will have decreased levels of NAD+ cofactor as well as decreased levels of ATP and thus will undergo necrosis. This is important in carcinogenesis because it could lead to the selection of PARP1 deficient cells (but not depleted) due to their survival advantage during cancer growth. Susceptibility to carcinogenesis under PARP1 deficiency depends significantly on the type of DNA damage incurred. There are many implications that various PARPs are involved in preventing carcinogenesis. As stated previously, PARP1 and PARP2 are involved in BER and chromosomal stability. PARP3 is involved in centrosome regulation. Tankyrase is another ADP-ribose polymerase that is involved in telomere length regulation. PARP1 inhibition has also been widely studied in anticancer therapeutics. The mechanism of action of a PARP1 inhibitor is to enhance the damage done by chemotherapy on the cancerous DNA by disallowing the reparative function of PARP1 in BRCA1/2 deficient individuals . PARP14 is another ADP-ribosylating enzyme that has been well-studied in regards to cancer therapy targets; it is a signal transducer and activator of STAT6 transcription-interacting protein, and was shown to be associated with the aggressiveness of B-cell lymphomas. =Bacterial toxins= Bacterial ADP- ribosylating exotoxins (bAREs) covalently transfer an ADP-Ribose moiety of NAD+ to target proteins of infected eukaryotes, to yield nicotinamide and a free hydrogen ion. bAREs are produced as enzyme precursors, consisting of a \\"A\\" and \\"B\\" domains: the \\"A\\" domain is responsible for ADP-Ribosylation activity; and, the \\"B\\" domain for translocation of the enzyme across the membrane of the cell. These domains can exist in concert in three forms: first, as single polypeptide chains with A and B domains covalently linked; second, in multi-protein complexes with A and B domains bound by non-covalent interactions; and, third, in multi-protein complexes with A and B domains not directly interacting, prior to processing. Crystal structure of the diphtheria toxin. PDB: 1MDT Upon activation, bAREs ADP-ribosylate any number of eukaryotic proteins; such mechanism is crucial to the instigation of the diseased states associated with ADP-ribosylation. GTP-binding proteins, in particular, are well-established in bAREs pathophysiology. For examples, cholera and heat-labile enterotoxin target the Œ±-subunit of Gs of heterotrimeric GTP-binding proteins. As the Œ±-subunit is ADP-ribosylated, it is permanently in an \\"active\\", GTP-bound state; subsequent activation of intracellular cyclic AMP stimulates the release of fluid and ions from intestinal epithelial cells. Furthermore, C. Botulinum C3 ADP-ribosylates GTP- binding proteins Rho and Ras, and Pertussis toxin ADP-Ribosylates Gi, Go, and Gt. Diphtheria toxin ADP-ribosylates ribosomal elongation factor EF-2, which attenuates protein synthesis. There are a variety of bacteria which employ bAREs in infection: CARDS toxin of Mycoplasma pneumoniae, cholera toxin of vibrio cholera; heat-labile enterotoxin of E.Coli; Exotoxin A of Pseudomonas aeruginosa; Pertussis toxin of B. Pertussis; C3 toxin of C. botulinum; and Diphtheria toxin of Corynebacterium diphtheriae.

Barbree is the only journalist to have covered every non-commercial human space mission in the United States, beginning with the first American in space, Alan Shepard aboard Freedom 7 in 1961, continuing through to the last mission of the Space Shuttle, Atlantis's STS-135 mission in July 2011. Barbree was present for all 135 Space Shuttle launches, and every manned launch for the Mercury, Gemini, and Apollo eras. In total, Barbree was witness to 166 human space launches. Early life Barbree grew up on his family's farm in Early County, Georgia, and entered the United States Air Force in 1950, when he was only 16 years of age. Following the Air Force, Barbree began his broadcast journalism career at WALB in Albany, Georgia where, in 1957, he saw Sputnik's spent booster rocket orbiting in the sky and then wrote radio and TV reports about the Soviet Union's launch of the first artificial satellite. Career =Reporting career= Vanguard exploded within seconds of launch on December 6, 1957 Barbree was so interested in the space program that he paid for his own ticket to get to Cape Canaveral, Florida in 1957 to watch the attempted Vanguard launch. The failed launch was one Barbree would never forget: \\"There's ignition. We can see the flames,\\" Barbree reported. \\"Vanguard's engine is lit and it's burning. But wait... wait a moment, there's... there's no liftoff! It appears to be crumbling in its own fire... It's burning on the pad... Vanguard has crumbled into flames. It failed ladies and gentlemen, Vanguard has failed.\\" Early the next year, he returned and witnessed the successful launch of Explorer 1 on January 31, 1958, all the while calling in his reports to WALB. Eventually, Barbree was hired by radio station WEZY in Cocoa Beach, and worked as a traffic reporter, covering the space program as well. Six months later, Barbree joined NBC as a part-time space program reporter, eventually moving up to full-time. Over the years, Barbree had been offered the opportunity to move to Washington, D.C., or New York City, but he turned down every offer, preferring to stay and report on what had quickly become his passion, spaceflight. In 1958, while in a restroom, Barbree overheard a general and a NASA official, talking about an upcoming launch called \\"Project SCORE\\", one of the earliest American satellites. This would become one of Barbree's many \\"scoops\\", when after a bit of digging, he found that President Dwight D. Eisenhower would use the satellite to broadcast a pre-recorded Christmas message from outer space. When SCORE launched in 1958, Barbree broadcast the story, knowing the military would not deny it once the satellite was in space. In the early days of the space program, astronauts and reporters would often socialize together in Cocoa Beach, and had a very different relationship than they do today. Barbree described his relationship with the astronauts as a friend and confidant, often going out to dinner with them, or socializing together when the astronauts were in town. In his book, Barbree writes that in 1961 Alan Shepard told him an \\"off the record\\" fact: He was going to be the first American astronaut in space. Barbree noted that if he were to report this, it would not only jeopardize the friendships, but possibly his career as well, so he said nothing. Barbree also recounts a conversation with Gus Grissom about the astronaut's concerns regarding Apollo not long before the fatal Apollo 1 fire. Barbree's association with the astronauts had some unexpected bonuses as well, Neil Armstrong carried a gold coin to the Moon on Apollo 11 for Barbree, and Pete Conrad flew several flags and patches on Apollo 12, which Barbree later handed out to friends. In the early 1980s, when NASA developed the Teacher in Space program, a similar program was developed, the Journalist in Space program. Barbree was one of forty finalists to be selected as a Journalist in Space. Both the teacher and journalist programs were discontinued after the Space Shuttle Challenger disaster. In 1986, following the Space Shuttle Challenger accident, Barbree placed a telephone call to a friend and retired employee of NASA, who‚Äîas a favor to Barbree‚Äîwent to Kennedy Space Center, looked over the accident information and analysis being done, and later reported the early findings to Barbree. Consequently, Barbree was the first journalist to report on the source of the destruction of the Space Shuttle Challenger: Faulty O-rings. He was also part of the NBC News Space Unit that won an Emmy award for NBC's coverage of the Apollo 11 moon landing. Following the Space Shuttle Columbia accident, Barbree was the first reporter to break the news of an internal NASA memo expressing concerns about foam striking the orbiter's left wing during ascent. In 1995, NASA awarded him with recognition for being the \\"only journalist known to have covered all 100 flights\\". Among those present for the ceremony were several NASA officials, Alan Shepard, and Space Shuttle commander Robert L. Gibson. In 2011, Barbree was honored by the Space Foundation as a recipient of the Douglas S. Morrow Public Outreach Award in recognition of the role he played in shaping the way the nation views and understands space. Barbree was one of the longest-serving network correspondents to work continuously on a single subject. He started working for NBC on July 21, 1958 covering the space program, and remained on that beat until his retirement in 2017. He never missed a mission launch, despite suffering a heart attack while jogging along Cocoa Beach in 1987, and being declared clinically dead for several minutes. Following his heart attack, he had bypass surgery, and still did not miss any launches. =Career as author= Barbree is the author or coauthor of eight books, including two memoirs. In 1993, Shepard, fellow Mercury astronaut Deke Slayton, journalist Howard Benedict, and Barbree collaborated to write the book Moon Shot. Slayton was a participant in name only and died before the book was completed. Barbree's book \\"Live from Cape Canaveral: Covering the Space Race, from Sputnik to Today\\" was released on August 28, 2007, to coincide with the 50th anniversary of spaceflight, that began with the Sputnik 1 launch on October 4, 1957. The foreword is written by Tom Brokaw. Barbree's book attempts to illustrate how the media has changed in their coverage of the space programs, from the early enthusiasm to the relative disinterest in the program today. Barbree says he wrote the book because as he looked back over his career, when recalling all the people he'd worked with, very few were left. Barbree claims that he told himself, \\"You're the only one who has covered the whole program going all the way back to the beginning, and if you don't tell the story, who is going to do it?\\" It received generally poor reviews from space historians. Barbree also collaborated with Martin Caidin on a number of non-fiction works, such as Destination Mars: In Art, Myth and Science (Penguin, 1997, ) and A Journey Through Time: Exploring the Universe with the Hubble Space Telescope (Penguin, 1995, ). Barbree also wrote the novelization of \\"Pilot Error\\", an episode of The Six Million Dollar Man, a television series based upon Caidin's novel Cyborg (Warner, 1975, ). Over the years, Barbree has stated that he has stayed away from sensationalizing the space program, or those associated with it, and commented that he would not put some items that could be considered harmful into his newest book, stating \\"The whole idea of the book is not to hurt somebody.\\" Barbree attempts to illustrate this in his memoir by telling of a private investigator who approached him with an audio tape which allegedly contained proof of an extramarital affair involving an astronaut. Barbree told the investigator he would speak to his superiors, but then proceeded to erase the tape. Personal life Barbree has been married since 1960 to the former Jo Reisinger, whom he met while covering her participation in Florida beauty pageants. They live in Merritt Island. They have three children, Steve, Alicia, and Karla. Their son Scott died in infancy following a premature birth.

Pratt and Paul Schilder, founder of group analysis in the United States. He was the inventor of the concept of neurodynamics. Life Trigant Burrow was the youngest of four children in a well-off family of French origin. His father was an educated Protestant freethinker, his mother, however, was a practicing Catholic. He initially studied Literature at the Fordham University, Medicine at the University of Virginia, receiving his M.D. in 1900, and eventually Psychology at Johns Hopkins University (Ph.D., 1909). While working at the New York State Psychiatric Institute, he had the opportunity to attend a theater performance, during which he was introduced to two European doctors who were on a lecture tour in the United States: Sigmund Freud and Carl Jung. The same year Burrow traveled with his family to Zurich in order to undergo a year-long Freudian analysis by Jung.,E. G. and G. O. Pertegato eds., From Psychoanalysis to Group Analysis (2013) p. xxiii He would later help to popularise Freud and Jung's ideas on images in particular.Eric Berne, A Layman's Guide to Psychiatry and Psychoanalysis (1971) p. 60 Upon his return to the United States he practiced as a psychoanalyst in Baltimore until 1926. The American Psychoanalytic Association was founded in 1911, and he acted as the president in 1924 and 1925, though he was later expelled from it in 1932.E. G. and G. O. Pertegato eds., From Psychoanalysis to Group Analysis (2013) p. xlii In 1926 Burrow founded the Lifwynn Foundation for Laboratory Research in Analytic and Social Psychiatry and published his first major work, The Social Basis of Consciousness. Until his death Burrow acted as the research director for the foundation and devoted particular attention to the physiological substructures of harmonious and rivaling participants within groups and societies, but also between states. His methods for measuring the electrical activity of the brain in connection with specific eye movements has led some to call him the father of trauma therapy [Eye Movement Desensitization and Reprocessing (EMDR)]. Founder of group analysis In 1921, Burrow was challenged by one of his analysands, Clarence Shields, with regard to the inherently authoritarian role of the psychoanalyst .E. G. and G. O. Pertegato eds., From Psychoanalysis to Group Analysis (2013) p. xxvii The student criticized the perceivable difference in authority during the analysis and demanded his teacher be more forthright. It came as a shock to Burrow when he realized, \\"that, in individual application, analytical attitude and authoritarian attitude can not be separated.\\" Experimenting with reversing the roles of analyzer and patient, as well as with mutual analysis,E. G. and G. O. Pertegato eds., From Psychoanalysis to Group Analysis (2013) p. xxiv Burrow and Shield became convinced that both displayed blind spots, adherence to social conventions and considerable utilization of defense mechanisms. In Trigant Burrow's eyes acknowledging this distortion of the analytical endeavor is indispensable to restoring relationships to normality. To Burrow and Shields, clarifying and ultimately diminishing the neurotic dislocation of emotions and cognition seemed possible only in a group setting. Both invited previous patients, relatives, and colleagues, including the Swiss Psychiatrist, Hans Syz, to sit in on some group sessions. Trigant Burrow coined the term group therapy and wrote three fundamental texts which were released between 1924 and 1927. While Burrow considered his work a legitimate extension of Freudian thinking, Freud himself did not accept it as such.E. G. and G. O. Pertegato eds., From Psychoanalysis to Group Analysis (2013) p. xxxviii Burrow's innovations led to a breach with orthodox psychoanalysis, Otto Fenichel for example criticising as repressive/inspirational ‚Äúthe work of Burrow who, by 'phyloanalysis,' tries to bring his patients to a reconsideration of their natural ways of functioning‚Äù.Otto Fenichel, The Psychoanalytic Theory of Neurosis (1946) p. 567 In retrospect however, he can be seen as pioneering investigations into such phenomena as countertransference,E.

The three districts in the ward are Coombe Dingle, Lawrence Weston and Sea Mills. The ward takes its name from the old district of Kings Weston (usually spelt in two words), now generally considered part of Lawrence Weston. Coombe Dingle Coombe Dingle is a suburb of Bristol, centred on where the River Trym emerges from a gorge passing through the Blaise Castle Estate. A desirable area, the private housing was mainly built in the 1920s and 1930s. Further downstream is Sea Mills. There was a tin Methodist church which was demolished in the mid-1990s. There are still some photos of it on tin Tabernacles. It was a small gothic building of the 1890s. Lawrence Weston Council owned flats in Long Cross, Lawrence Weston Lawrence Weston is a post war housing estate in north west Bristol between Henbury and Shirehampton. It is bounded in the east by the Blaise Castle estate and woods. It is situated directly beneath the wooded Kingsweston Hill. The industrial complex and port of Avonmouth is a mile or so away, across the flood plain. The residential area was built in the late 1940s/early 1950s. Originally council owned, much of the housing stock is now in private hands. It is known as \\"El Dub\\" to its inhabitants. The row of shops in Ridingleaze has been revamped and each shop is now adorned with a mural. Lawrence Weston is well known locally for its vibrant facilities for young people. There are two youth centres, a BMX track, a young people's shop called Juicy Blitz and a Youth Inclusion project. it has the community farm and a range of clubs and groups for young people.  Kings Weston  Kings Weston was originally a hamlet (or tything) in the parish of Henbury,Extract from National Gazetteer, 1868 to the west of Lawrence Weston, subsumed into Lawrence Weston when the estate was built in the 1940s. Historically it was known as the location of Kings Weston House. The village also gave its name to Kingsweston Hill and Kings Weston Lane, the main road between Lawrence Weston and Shirehampton. There is a Roman villa at Kings Weston. Sea Mills The remains of the dock wall and the Severn Beach line crossing the Trym at Sea Mills. Sea Mills is a suburb of the English port city of Bristol. It is situated some 3.5 miles (6 km) north-west of the city centre, at the seaward end of the Avon Gorge. Nearby suburbs are Shirehampton, Sneyd Park, Combe Dingle and Stoke Bishop.Ordnance Survey (2004). OS Explorer Map 154 ‚Äì Bristol West & Portishead. . Sea Mills was the site of a Roman settlement, known as Portus Abonae. The name and location suggest that this was a river port, but to date there has been no archaeological proof of this. The Roman settlement seems to have been abandoned by the 4th century, and there is no evidence of Saxon settlement. By the Middle Ages Bristol had become a major port, with all traffic between the port and the sea having to pass through the Avon Gorge and past Sea Mills. In 1712, Joshua Franklin, a Bristol merchant, built a wet dock at Sea Mills, to eliminate the need for large sailing ships to navigate the dangerous River Avon any further upstream. This was located where the River Trym enters the River Avon. However, poor transport links doomed the enterprise and the harbour facilities fell into disrepair by the end of the 18th century. Some remains of the dock still exist, and are used as a harbour by pleasure craft. In the 1920s and 30s, Sea Mills was developed as a planned green suburb. Much of the housing was local council, although it is now mainly in private ownership. Adjacent to the Portway is a small estate of prefabricated bungalows dating from a post-WW2 housing scheme. The wide A4 Portway trunk road passes along the south-west edge of Sea Mills and links central Bristol with its outport at Avonmouth. Running parallel to the serpentine path of the River Avon, the Portway was the most expensive road in Britain when it was opened in 1926. Both the Portway and the railway line have bridges over the harbour outfall into the Avon. Ocean-going ships used to sail past Sea Mills, going to and from Bristol City Docks. Nowadays most of the shipping is in the form of pleasure craft, Bristol's main docks now being at Avonmouth and Portbury. October 2006 saw the opening of The Portway Rugby Development Centre. The facilities it has are 2 outdoor 3G Crumb pitches, suitable for Rugby and Football. Outdoor grass Rugby pitches (ready for August 2007). There are 2 meeting room's and they host many aerobics classes. Population According to the 2001 Census there are 10,844 people living in Kingsweston ward, over 95% of whom were white. Transport Kingsweston ward is served by 1 railway station, at Sea Mills, just outside the ward boundary. With hourly services between Bristol Temple Meads and Avonmouth, there are also peak connections to Severn Beach. Bus services serving the area are 40, 41, 429, 584, 585 and N7.

Concentration- camp and Margolius-marriage years  Married to her childhood sweetheart, Rudolf Margolius, she was separated from her parents when the Jews were taken out of the ≈Å√≥d≈∫ ghetto on arrival to the Auschwitz concentration camp in 1944. After arriving at Auschwitz, she was chosen to survive‚Äîthough her parents were immediately gassed‚Äîand to work as a laborer in the Christianstadt labour camp. When the Eastern Front of the war between Germany and the Soviet Union approached the camp, its prisoners were evacuated. With a few other women in the first months of 1945, it was decided while on this journey to Bergen- Belsen, to escape back to Prague. After arriving in the city, Margolius discovered that most of the people who remained in the city during the war were too frightened by the threat of German punishment to aid an escapee from the camps. When Soviet forces finally freed Prague from Nazi control the Communist Party began to rise.

Emigration from Czechoslovakia to the United States  Finally in 1968, when once again Soviet Union troops invaded Prague after the Prague Spring and occupation seemed inevitable, Margolius Kov√°ly fled Czechoslovakia to the United States. She worked as a reference assistant librarian in the Harvard Law School Library at Harvard University, in Cambridge, Massachusetts.  Return to Prague  Margolius Kov√°ly returned to Prague to retire with her second husband in 1996.  Writing  Her memoir was originally written in Czech and published in Canada under the title Na vlastn√≠ k≈Ø≈æi by 68 Publishers in Toronto in 1973. An English translation appeared in the same year as the first part of the book The Victors and the Vanquished published by Horizon Press in New York. A British edition of the book excluded the second treatise and was published by Weidenfeld and Nicolson under the title I Do Not Want To Remember in 1973. In 1986, she re-published her memoir Under A Cruel Star ‚Äì A Life in Prague 1941‚Äì1968 (published in the United Kingdom as Prague Farewell). The memoir is dedicated to her son and it has been widely translated and is available in French and English as an e-book.

In 1985 she published a novel called Nevina (Innocence) in Czech by Index, K√∂ln and republished in the Czech Republic in 2013 by Mlad√° fronta, Praha. The English translation, by Alex Zucker, was published by Soho Press, New York in June 2015.http://sohopress.com/books/innocence/ Professor Marci Shore said of the book: \\"Although it is crime fiction and designed to be fine reading there is a deeper philosophical point which is that there is no innocence ... To participate in the resistance is to take on the guilt of retaliation and to not participate is to take on the guilt of passivity.\\"'In Slavic Languages, Life Happens to You', Marci Shore interview with Tom McEnchroe, Radio Praha, 23 March 2019, https://www.radio.cz/en/section/one-on-one/marci-shore-in- slavic-languages-life-happens-to-you Between 1958 and 1989 she translated from German or English into the Czech language over 24 works of well-known authors such as Arnold Zweig, Raymond Chandler, Philip Roth, Saul Bellow, Arnold Bennett, Muriel Spark, William Golding, John Steinbeck, H.

Release details *2008, UK, Century (), pub date 14 January 2008, hardback (First edition) *2008, USA, Little Brown (), pub date 5 February 2008, hardback Michael Campion, the teenage son of California's ex-governor, has mysteriously vanished. Knowned as the \\"Boy with a Broken Heart\\" because of his incurable heart defect, Michael grew up in the eye of an adoring public. The pressure on Detective Lindsay Boxer to find Michael is overwhelming. When she finally gets a lead, it is devastating. While working on the Campion case, Lindsay and Rich Conklin also investigates the terrifying fires that are destroying some of the most beautiful homes in San Francisco-and killing their owners in the flames. But when Lindsay Boxer invites her friends in the Women's Murder Club to help her uncover the arsonist, the blazes suddenly gets too close to home. Now as these two intense, demanding cases bring Lindsay and Rich closer, Lindsay will find herself on the brink of an emotional meltdown. Plot Lindsay is confronted - as frequently happens in these series - by 2 cases. We meet 2 thugs called Pidge and Hawk whose idea of fun is burning people alive. They kill three couples until they try the big one in the house of a senator, Campion, whose son has recently disappeared. Campion reacts, though, and kills Hawk. Pidge flees but after some search led by Boxer and her team, they find a lead in the college they attended together with the kids of the victims; they were some sort of geniuses who wanted to try the perfect murder without being caught and for no reason, being inspired by similar gory stories collected in a novel, *The 7th Heaven*, full of latin quotations they actually left behind them in the murder scenes. After a final confrontation at his house, Pidge, too, is captured and incarcerated. The parallel story concerns the same Michael Campion, son of a famous politician, who was reported missing but now he's been said to have visited a prostitute - Junie Moon - right before his disappearance. Junie Moon is interviewed by the Police and confesses Campion died in her arms and then, caught by panic, she had called her boyfriend and decided to slaughter him and throw him away in plastic bags. Junie is taken to court and tried but found not guilty. In the meantime, a creepy wannabe writer, Twilly, stalks Yuki Castellano, who had represented the People in the trial and tells her he knows who killed Campion and tries to kill Yuki, too; he's caught in the act, though, and he reveals he knew Campion left Junie Moon alive and he had asked her to make up the whole story in order to write a book. The reader is left with no answer until the very end, where we discover Junie Moon had contrived the whole thing; Michael's alive, he had actually been at Junie's that night as so many more as they were lovers and now, with everybody believing he's dead, they reunite and fly towards a new life together! 2008 American novels American crime novels Women's Murder Club (novel series) American thriller novels 2008 British novels British thriller novels British crime novels ","title":"7th Heaven (novel)"},{"id":"13223223","text":"Liberty Way, Nuneaton Liberty Way (known as the \\"Coombe Abbey Arena\\" for sponsorship reasons) is a multi-use sports stadium in Nuneaton, Warwickshire, England, which is owned by Nuneaton Town F.C. but is also used by Nuneaton R.F.C., which rents the stadium from the football club.

The name of the camp is an acronym derived from the school's name, TOdd SEminary for BOys, and meant to sound like a Native American Indian word. The camp was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2000. History Portage Lake was first developed in the 1840s, when a sawmill was constructed near the old lake outlet. Lumbering was the principal industry until the 1880s, but the summer resort industry quickly developed in its wake. The Red Park resort, occupying part of the current Camp Tosebo, was developed in 1895 by Cleveland G. Davis. Red Park included a dance pavilion, now the Camp Tosebo Clubhouse, and numerous cottages nearby. In 1901, Noble Hill constructed a cottage in the area. Hill was a pioneer in progressive education as a teacher and then headmaster and owner of the Todd Seminary for Boys. Davis intended to continue the development of the resort, but by 1912, the area was in decline due to competition from other resorts in the area. Noble Hill opened Camp Tosebo in 1912 on property near his cottage as an extension of the Todd Seminary for Boys school program. The program immediately flourished, and in 1914 Hill purchased the former Red Park dance pavilion and its associated property. Hill hired Charles A. Anderson of Manistee as a general contractor to transform the pavilion into a clubhouse. Tents were used to house the boys initially; by the 1920s the smallest boys stayed in a cabin. Camp Tosebo soon had tennis courts, an arts and crafts shed, shower facilities, and other outbuildings. Orson Welles attended the Todd Seminary for Boys, and in 1932 visited Camp Tosebo. Noble Hill, and later his son Roger Hill and daughter Carol Hill Taylor Fawcett, continued to run the camp even after the Todd Boys School closed in 1954. However, in 1962, the camp passed out of their ownership. It continued to operate as a boys' summer camp under the name \\"Camp Tosebo\\" until 1978. The camp was re-imagined as a bed-and- breakfast, and as of 2018 the camp operates as a resort rental on its wooded property and fully restored buildings. Description Camp Tosebo is located in a wooded area on the shore of Portage Lake. It contains the former campground in an open field and a number of late 19th century and early 20th century buildings. The most significant of these are the Camp Tosebo Clubhouse, the Trunk House, and the Welcome House. Other structures include a Shower Houes, toilet, craft house, bunkhouses, boat house, and three more cottages. The Camp Tosebo Clubhouse is a two-story balloon-framed structure combining an Arts and Crafts style with late Victorian and Stick Style elements. It has a cross-gable and hip roof with a central cupola, and a hip roof front porch, and is clad with clapboard siding. Much of the clubhouse was recycled from the 1895 Red Park dance pavilion. The main portion of the clubhouse measures 40 feet by 60 feet. A 12 foot by 60 foot flat-roofed addition to one side was completed in 1912. A poured cement basement was added to the structure in 1995/96. The interior of the Clubhouse originally contained the camp dining room, kitchen, pantry, recreation rooms, and a sitting room on the first floor, with bedrooms and bathrooms on the second floor. Recent renovations converted the upper floor into nine guest rooms and seven baths. The Trunk House is a two-story balloon-framed rectangular structure, constructed in 1916, with a hip roof. It is covered with horizontal wooden weatherboarding and has one-over-one double-hung windows. It measures 32 feet by 22 feet. The Welcome House, or Fred W. Cron Cottage, us a two-story L-shaped balloon-framed cottage with a gable roof.

Education and career In October 2006, Vice Mayor Howard Gentry picked Rip Ryman to be Chair of the Budget and Finance Committee. He serves on both the Parks, Library, Recreation, and Public Entertainment Facility Committee and the Public Safety - Beer and Regulated Beverages Committee. Rip Ryman served in the U.S. military during the Korean War, from 1952 to 1954. He graduated from East High School in 1952, attended Belmont College from 1954 to 1955, and went to the University of Tennessee at Nashville from 1959 to 1962. Political views =Proposals= Rip Ryman proposed raising the mayor's salary from $136,500 to $160,000, an increase of 17%, after the Metro Civil Service Commission recommendation based on the salaries of mayors in 13 other comparable cities. Ryman also suggested amending the resolution to bring down the pay raise to only 9%, because Metro employees had their salaries raised by only 4% in the four previous years. Upset by a $10 parking ticket he got outside Metro City Hall, and difficulty finding parking spaces outside the building, he proposed restricting the on- street parking open to the public to Metro city council members during the afternoons. =Votes= Rip Ryman voted against Sylvan Park historic zoning, for Lower Broadway historic zoning, and against a Westin Hotel on Lower Broadway. On the third reading, he voted in favor of the proposal for a new ballpark for the Nashville Sounds, which included provisions for hotels, condos, shops and other businesses on the land adjacent to the stadium. Controversies The faith-based drug/alcohol rehab program Teen Challenge accused Rip Ryman of using his political influence to block their attempts to get land use permits for a rehabilitation facility. After the Metro government granted the permits anyway, Ryman suggested a zoning change for the property that would have effectively blocked their plans. Teen Challenge sued the Metro government for $500,000 in damages as an institution and $50,000 for each of the three plaintiffs that would have been residents of the facility. The city of Nashville eventually settled the lawsuit in 2008. 1 male student and 2 female students received monetary damages.

On September 2, 2008, WROC changed from an Air America affiliate to an ESPN affiliate. The format is closely affiliated with Buffalo sister station WGR, and carries Buffalo Sabres games, ESPN Radio, and beginning late 2012, Buffalo Bills games.Fybush, Scott. NorthEast Radio Watch. August 18, 2008. The station's studios are located at High Falls Studios downtown, and its transmitter tower is on Rochester's southside near the I-390/I-590 freeway interchange. The station also airs on 95.7 FM as ESPN Rochester. The station's call sign is a reference to WROC-TV; while the stations are not and have never been co-owned, WROC radio has an agreement with WROC-TV to provide local news coverage, and the borrowing of the WROC call sign from WROC-TV is included in this agreement. (The WROC call sign was previously used on 1280 kHz, now WHTK, which was originally co-owned with WROC-TV.) WROC began broadcasting in 1947 under the callsign WARC. It was an early affiliate of the ABC radio network, but later changed to a locally programmed, personality-driven popular music station. It was purchased by the B. Forman regional department store chain in 1953 and changed its call letters to WBBF, the last three letters of which stood for \\"Buy B. Forman\\". In 1966 it was sold to LIN Broadcasting for what was then a market record of over $2 million, but retained its popular music format and personality lineup until the early 1980s. As WBBF, 950 AM was a popular Top 40 music station in Rochester, often leading the market in ratings surveys from the 1950s through the early 1970s, and ranking among the city's top stations through the late 1970s even after strong format competition arrived in 1972 from WAXC and later on the FM band from WPXY. Consistent success was achieved although as a relative latecomer to the AM band in the postwar era, WBBF's coverage area had to be restricted to the east and west to prevent interference with other stations on the same channel (WWJ in Detroit and WIBX in Utica). In 1982, as hit music radio listeners were migrating to FM, the station evolved into a talk format. WBBF remained a talk station through the mid-1980s, then switched the an Oldies format. Then in 1987, it became a Classic County station. As WBBF and later WEZO, from 1990 to 2000, the station carried an Adult Standards format. The WROC call sign was adopted in 2002 when the station adopted a second-tier conservative talk format featuring The Laura Ingraham Show and The Radio Factor; the station switched to progressive talk radio upon the launch of Air America Radio in 2004, a format it held until 2008, when it adopted its current sports format. The WBBF calls are now in use in Buffalo, New York. Programming Aside from sports play-by-play, WROC runs a straight feed of ESPN Radio outside a few programs (syndication of One Bills Live and The Sports Bar with Mike Danger and Gene Battaglia) on weekdays and some part of the morning hours on the weekends. Schopp and the Bulldog, the afternoon show based at WGR, was heard on WROC from 2008 to 2011, but was dropped in summer 2011 without explanation (Entercom had ended or outsourced its other syndicated offerings at the same time). WROC carries the aforementioned Sabres and Bills, both of which are also carried on WCMF-FM to improve the reach. WROC was also the exclusive radio home of the Rochester Knighthawks (ironically, WROC's Buffalo sister station, WWKB, is also the home of the Knighthawks' chief rival, the Buffalo Bandits). In January 2012 it was announced that WROC will be the AM home of the Buffalo Bills (WCMF is the corresponding FM home). WROC (both AM and FM) entered into an agreement to carry the Rochester Americans, the Sabres' AHL affiliate, starting in 2016.http://www.amerks.com/article/AMERKS,%20ENTERCOM%20ROCHESTER%20ANNOUNCE%20MULTI- YEAR%20RADIO%20PARTNERSHIP References External links *WROC Website *Fybush.com WROC history ROC Sports radio stations in the United States Radio stations established in 1947 1947 establishments in New York (state) ESPN Radio stations Entercom radio stations Buffalo Bills broadcasters Buffalo Sabres broadcasters ","title":"WROC (AM)"},{"id":"13223348","text":"An≈ç Station is the name of three train stations in Japan: * An≈ç Station (Fukuoka) (Á©¥ÁîüÈßÖ) * An≈ç Station (Shiga) (Á©¥Â§™ÈßÖ) * Anoh Station (Mie) (Á©¥Â§™ÈßÖ) ","title":"An≈ç Station"},{"id":"13223353","title":"Bill Davis (artist)"},{"id":"13223365","text":"Nuthouse is the third full-length album from the Canadian band Haywire, released in 1990.

From 1930 it was called the Todd School for Boys. Under headmaster Roger Hill from 1929, it became a progressive school that provided students including Orson Welles with a creative educational environment that emphasized practical experience over traditional academics. Only one building, Rogers Hall, remains from the original campus. History The Todd School for Boys was founded by Reverend Richard K. Todd, who brought from his native Vermont, the New England philosophy of \\"plain living and high thinking, and in harmony with Puritan traditions\\".Todd Seminary for Boys Prospectus. Woodstock, Illinois: Todd Seminary for Boys, 1922. Reverend Todd moved to Woodstock, Illinois, from Vermont in 1847 to be pastor of a newly formed Presbyterian Church. In 1848 he opened a day school in the parsonage, for both boys and girls. This parsonage school continued to 1859, the student population ranged between 6 and 15 students. During this time Reverend Todd also served as the School Superintendent for McHenry County from 1849‚Äì1855.Hoke, Joel F.

Chicago, Ill: University of Chicago, 1937. In 1858 the plans for the Pastorage Institute were announced in the Woodstock SentinelWoodstock Sentinel, September 7, 1859 to form a boarding school. The Pastorage Institute grew in enrollment until, in 1861, the Woodstock University was incorporated by the state legislature. In 1864, the title of the school was again changed, this time to the Woodstock Collegiate Institute. At this time the student body consisted of between 80 and 149 students, mostly from the McHenry County area. In 1867 the school underwent extensive improvements at which time it became exclusively a seminary for boys, and became known as the Woodstock Institute. It held this name until 1873 when it became known as the Todd Seminary for Boys. The final name change occurred in 1930 when it became the Todd School for Boys. Noble Hill joined the institution in 1888 as Reverend Todd's assistant. Hill resigned a year later due to differences in opinions with Todd. A year later Hill returned with a promise from Todd that he would have his full support. Reverend Todd's wife died during the winter of 1891 and the Reverend now in his 70sFederal Census, 1870 went to live with his son who was a professor at the University that would become Stanford University. In June 1892 Noble Hill arranged to purchase the Seminary from Reverend Todd, at a cost of $20,000. In 1929, Noble Hill transferred ownership of the school to his son Roger Hill, called Skipper, and retired to California. As headmaster, Skipper Hill developed the Todd Seminary for Boys into a progressive educational institution based on his philosophy that all young people were \\"created creators\\". In addition to academics the school's educational plan offered a 300-acre working farm; a radio station; a theatre company with facilities on campus and tour buses that took the company throughout North America; sound motion picture production facilities; and a nearby airport with a flight simulator and small aircraft for students who were interested in flying their own plane.Tarbox, Todd, Orson Welles and Roger Hill: A Friendship in Three Acts. Albany, Georgia: BearManor Media, 2013, . The New Yorker described Todd in October 1938: > Todd is a preparatory school of considerable antiquity, now run on severely > progressive lines. The present headmaster, Roger Hill, a slim white-haired, > tweed-bearing man, who looks as if he had been cast for his role by a > motion-picture director, has never let the traditional preparatory-school > curriculum stand in the way of creative work. All the boys spend as much > time as they want in the machine shop, the print shop, the bookbindery, or > the school theatre. The Todd School for Boys closed in 1954. Campus In 1937 the Todd School campus consisted of an area of Woodstock bound by McHenry Avenue, Seminary Avenue, Northampton Street and Mansfield Avenue. In addition the school purchased in 1904 20 acres (81,000 m2) of woods north of the school grounds. These woods were referred to as the Seminary Woods in school publications. Main buildings on the campus included Wallingford Hall, Clover Hall, Rogers Hall, Grace Cottage, the gymnasium, Headmasters' Cottage, West Cottage, Cozy Cottage and North Cottage. The school also had an airstrip located to the east of the campus, where Marian Central Catholic High School is now located. From 1912, the school operated a summer camp in Onekama Township, Michigan, called Camp Tosebo. There was also a winter campus on Marathon Key, Florida, that was called Todd Island. With the demolition of Grace Hall in 2010, Rogers Hall is the sole remaining building from the original campus. Rogers Hall, once a classroom building with a 200-seat theater, is now an apartment building. Notable alumni Los Alamos =Robert Wilson= Nuclear physicist Robert R. Wilson attended the school in 1922, at the age of eight. When his parents separated Wilson lived with his grandmother, Nellie Embree Rathbun, who went to work at Todd as a house mother.

New York: St. Martin's Press, 1985 At Todd Welles came under the influence of teacher, later headmaster, Roger Hill, who became his mentor and lifelong friend. Hill provided Welles an ad hoc educational environment that proved invaluable to his creative experience, allowing him to concentrate on subjects that interested him. \\"I was passionate about the theatre‚Äîputting on plays was all I ever wanted to do with my life‚Äîand Skipper, God bless him, was the only one of my elders who encouraged my theatrical ambitions,\\" Welles recalled. \\"That's why they call him my mentor, you know.\\"Feder, Chris Welles. In My Father's Shadow: A Daughter Remembers Orson Welles. Algonquin Books of Chapel Hill, 2009. . In spring 1927 Welles became a member of the Todd Troupers, a touring company that presented shows in suburban Chicago movie houses and the Goodman Theatre. For three years Welles was director of productions at Todd, producing eight to ten plays a year. These included Moli√®re's The Physician in Spite of Himself, Dr. Faustus, and an innovative Everyman that he staged with platforms and ladders.Brady, Frank, Citizen Welles: A Biography of Orson Welles. New York: Charles Scribner's Sons, 1989 Welles graduated in 1931 and later collaborated with Hill to write a series of books, Everybody's Shakespeare. \\"Edited for Reading and Arranged for Staging\\", the plays were shortened to acting versions of a reasonable length and illustrated with numerous line drawings by Welles. In 1934 three plays‚ÄîJulius Caesar, The Merchant of Venice and Twelfth Night‚Äîwere published separately and in a single volume by The Todd Press and marketed strictly as textbooks for secondary schools.Selby, John, \\"The Literary Guidepost: Shakespeare Done By Orson Welles\\".

His short film The Hearts of Age was shot on the Todd campus during the festival. Welles planned to use the Todd campus as the setting for his 1946 film, The Stranger.

Her dark, tense style contrasted with the dominant pastel colors of the late Baroque era.Weidemann, Christiane, Petra Larass, and Melanie Klier. 50 Women Artists You Should Know. Munich: Prestel, 2008. . Page 45.  Biography Lama was born in the parish of Santa Maria Formosa in Venice. She was trained initially by her father, the painter Agostino Lama. She may have studied alongside a childhood friend, Giambattista Piazzetta (1682‚Äì1754), at the Scuola di Antonio Molinari in Venice. As a result of learning together their styles are similar in the sharp contrasts of light and shade. Piazzetta painted a portrait of his friend in c.1715‚Äì1720. A letter written by the Abate Conti to Madame de Caylus in March 1728 has been important in determining Lama's background and character. He remarks, \\"The poor girl is persecuted by the painters, but her virtue triumphs over her enemies. It is true that she is as ugly as she is witty but she speaks with grace and precision, so that one easily forgives her her face.\\"Gaze, D. (1997) Dictionary of Women Artists: 2. London: Fitzroy Dearborn. p. 820. The letter reveals that in addition to being a painter she was skilled in mathematics, poetry, and lace making. Judith and Holofernes Lama was active as a historical painter and poet in Venice from till after 1753. One of her pieces, a Crucifixion altarpiece, remains in situ at San Vitale. She had a successful career in private and public figure painting. Lama appears to have been one of the first women to break the barrier against women studying and drawing the nude figure from life.\\"Lama, Giulia\\". Grove Art Online. 2003 Over 200 drawings that were recently discovered clearly show that she indeed studied both male and female nude figures during her training. She had public success in a style that was typically a position held by men, giving rise to opposition from her male counterparts who were not prepared to tolerate such competition. As a highly trained professional, she was just as capable of painting a sensitive portrait such as Young Man with a Turban as she was of carrying out large, original commissions, such as altarpieces, with confidence. It is through the identification of three such altarpieces in a Venetian guidebook of 1733 that Lama's artistic personality began to be reconstructed. That she was as fully competent as the male artists with whom she competed is demonstrated by the names to which her work has been attributed. Recovery of Lama's oeuvre has required reattribution of works by not only Piazzetta, but also artists such as Federico Bencovich, Domenico Maggiotto, Francesco Capella, and Zurbar√°n, among others.

Even in her mature years and legally blind for the last the last 17 years due to the insidious onset of macular degeneration, she continues to pursue her love of researching and writing books on exciting people and events in our nation's colourful history. Born in 1925 she lived in Gunnedah until she was sent to a boarding school in Sydney. On the outbreak of WWII she left the school and returned to Gunnedah where she ran the property with her mother, an invalid father and eventually three Italian Prisoners of War. She has written ten books.Flying high with her 10th book Biography Initially educated by Brackfriars Correspondence School at the family rural property, ‚ÄúKareela‚Äù, outside of Gunnedah in north-western NSW followed by secondary schooling in Sydney at Ascham Girls School to Intermediate standard. In 1943, aged 15, she joined the Women's Emergency Signalling Corps in Sydney where she taught Morse code to the personnel from the Australian Air Force, Merchant Navy and also American Airmen, who had trouble grasping the concept. This was the time of the midget sub shelling on Sydney suburbs and their torpedo attacks on harbour shipping in 1942. With her father doing his war duty as an Army officer in Victoria Barracks in Sydney and the family farm being run by a manager, Pat's world was turned upside down when the farm manager suddenly resigned in 1943 and the women folk were required to return to look after the property. Suddenly thrust into a man's world as a teenager, she together with her mother and 5-year-old brother, faced the complexities of running a rural property ‚Äì compounded by wartime rationing and a raging drought. Battling these elements, she learned many farm skills including killing and cutting up their own meat with Pat even learning to drive a Caterpillar type tractor to build a dam for part of their emergency water supplies. One of her heartbreaking jobs was the mercy killing of stock at death's door from the results of the drought. A year after Pat took over ‚ÄúKareela‚Äù her father was invalided out of the Army and to relieve their manpower shortage they were assigned three Italian prisons of war (POW) for working on the property. Pat often worked on her own with these men in remote parts of the property and never felt threatened by them even though these people were technically the enemy. She wrote and illustrated a book on these experiences titled ‚ÄúOnly Our Gloves On‚Äù, the title reflecting that Pat and her sister, Joan, slept in the hot summer evenings in the nude but wore gloves to protect the bed sheets from the homemade concoction that softened their rough farmers‚Äô hands in an effort to preserve their femininity. (Pat's older sister, Joan, received her discharge from the Australian Women's Army Service (AWAS) towards the end of the war and returned home to help on the farm.) After the war Pat and her sister became share farmers (working their father's land for a share of the profits) with their own tractor, truck and equipment. They were the first known women broad acre share farmers in NSW and possible Australia and traded as the Studdy Sisters with even their truck sign written with that title. Marrying Jim Clift from Breeza, NSW in 1948, they moved in late 1954 to a river front property near Condamine in the western Darling Downs in Queensland, which they developed with almost 30 years of hard but rewarding work. Again she faced many challenges not the least of which was being left alone by the menfolk in a heavily pregnant state and with a small but active toddler and his two older brothers, who travelled to school by boat and bus, while being surrounded by floodwaters for 6 months and having no forms of communication. Heavily engaged in transforming the under developed lands into a thriving rural enterprise she also involved herself and the family with many local activities. One unusual interest that the family followed from the start of the 1960s was water skiing on the local lagoons with Pat becoming very proficient at water ballet. She has written up these and many other experiences in a book called ‚ÄúOn the Banks of the Condamine‚Äù with a later revised edition named ‚ÄúOn the Banks of the Condamine Revisited‚Äù. It personalises the challenges of being on the land and threads a tapestry of the strong social fabric of the surrounding rural community of those times. ‚ÄòRetiring‚Äô to northern NSW in the 1980s and captivated by the cosmopolitan nature of the Tweed Shire she wrote and illustrated two books called ‚ÄúThe Many Faces of the Tweed‚Äù, a snapshot of the characters from her newly adopted neighbourhood. Interviewing and recording a diverse range of people varying from followers of Hare Krishna and ‚ÄòOrange People‚Äô through to singers like Jade Hurley and the civic movers and shakers, she immersed herself in many aspects of local culture very foreign from her rural roots. The second Tweed book was a project in association with local unemployed youths. Having time to seriously pursue her love of writing she then undertook research and completion of a number of books on some of our lesser known events and characters. A chance meeting with an ex Northern Territory policeman, Ron Brown, led to a collaboration between them that produced two books. The first, ‚ÄúBush Justice‚Äù, tells of Ron's experiences as a lone representative of the white man's law and mediator on camel patrols in the red centre of Australia between 1945 and 1952. The second, titled ‚ÄúDarwin Dilemmas‚Äù, details life and the events at that top end administrative centre through the eyes of a local policeman stationed there between the years of 1939 to 1945. His firsthand account recalls the times of the much hushed up 68 air raids on northern Australia by Japanese bombers and the human face of Darwin in the period. In 1996 Pat completed perhaps her most intriguing book to date. Thoroughly researched and based on historical facts, ‚ÄúThe Lady Bushranger‚Äù relives the life of Elizabeth Jessie Hickman, n√©e Martini, n√©e Hunt, a colourful woman with many aliases, whose story remained hidden along with the Wollemi Pine and her hideout in the extended valleys of the Blue Mountains until the early 90s. Jessie's early circus life, cattle duffing, repeated escapes from the police and her final taming are now portrayed for all but like most accounts of bushranging adventures it is mixed with truth, legend and mystery. In between all these activities Pat, with a strong love of music, found time to teach the piano, organ and keyboard. At one time she even played for a choral group appropriately named the Condamine Belles. Following Pat's diagnosis with macular degeneration in the early 1990s, her sight has deteriorated to a world of blurred images and shapes with some very very minor peripheral vision. She treats her handicap as just another one of life's challenges and continues to undertake as many of her previous activities as possible. Unfortunately she can no longer do her own illustrations. Cooking at times has provided an interesting interpretation of the menu with non-correct identification of critical ingredients! Writing continued to be a passion for Pat and she produced two books in 2009. The first chronicled the history of a small 1934 monoplane called St Paulus that started its flying life in the wild and rugged New Guinea mainland for a German-based Roman Catholic mission and after many adventures and mishaps, including an attack by a Japanese Zero, the plane ended up in Australia. Passing through several owners and continuing to notch up some very interesting escapades the ‚ÄòIncredible Klemm‚Äù survives to this day as most likely the oldest mission plane in the world. Her second effort also came from New Guinea during World War II when, aided by an Aussie ex-pat, a group of five nuns walked for three months from the Sepik coast over some of the most rugged country on earth up the highlands to escape the Japanese. Titled, ‚ÄúWhen Nuns Wore Soldiers‚Äô Trousers‚Äù, it reveals a tale of adventure and endurance known to few outside of PNG. Pat's final literary effort, an addendum to her Lady Bushranger book, provides an update of her continuing research and data collection on that subject since its original publication 15 years before. She feels her Lady Bushranger book will be perhaps her most lasting legacy and illustrates this by stating it has been under film options almost since its production. Unfortunately now her failed sight has meant that she cannot carry on with her love of writing as she is unable to keep track of the continuity in presenting a story. Even in her senior years life is never dull for Pat as she often is presented as one of the Lismore City Library's Living Books that ‚Äòreaders‚Äô borrow for half an hour before putting her back ‚Äòon the shelf‚Äô! Despite being in her mid 80s, Pat's mind is as sharp as ever and illustrating this point is the example of a recent conversation when it was stated that she was ‚Äúvisually impaired‚Äù. Her retort was that there was nothing wrong with the way she looked but she had trouble with her eyesight and so was actually ‚Äúvision impaired‚Äù!

A top-level cabinet adviser in the German Empire and the Weimar Republic, he negotiated Germany's underwriting of Russia's October Revolution and authored the 1914 September Program which outlined German war aims during World War I. The posthumous publication of his secret notes and diaries played a role in the \\"Fischer Controversy\\" among German historians in the early 1960s. Early life Riezler was born in Munich in 1882 to a prominent Catholic family; his grandfather had co-founded the Bayerische Hypotheken- und Wechselbank (now HypoVereinsbank, UniCredit Group). He studied classics at the University of Munich and was granted his doctorate in economic history with highest honors in 1905. His prize-winning thesis on the Oikonomika, a classical Greek treatise once attributed to Aristotle, was soon published. After working as a journalist for the Norddeutsche Allgemeine Zeitung, a semi- official newspaper, he joined the press section of the German Foreign Office in 1907 and attracted the attention of Wilhelm II.Thompson, p.10 When Theobald von Bethmann Hollweg became chancellor of Germany in 1909, Riezler became his chief adviser and confidant. Political career Riezler's duties in the chancellor's office concerned primarily, but not exclusively, foreign policy. In 1914 he authored the September Program which proposed as possible German war aims limited annexations, a hard peace for France, and a Belgian vassal state.Thompson, p.98-9 In October 1917 he was posted to the German embassy in Stockholm to arrange a cease-fire on the Eastern Front, and then to Moscow as the top aide to Germany's ambassador to Russia, Count Wilhelm von Mirbach. Riezler was an eyewitness to Mirbach's assassination by the Left Socialist- Revolutionaries on 9 July 1918, having unwittingly ushered the gunman Yakov Blumkin into Mirbach's presence. During this period, Riezler served as the conduit for German subsidies to the Bolsheviks and personally negotiated these with Lenin's representatives Karl Radek and Alexander Parvus. Riezler later claimed privately that it had been his own idea to transport Lenin in the famous \\"sealed train\\" from Zurich through Germany to Russia in April 1917.Thompson, p.135 Following the war, Riezler became a staunch supporter of the Weimar Republic. He joined the German Democratic Party, contributed regularly to the pro-Weimar newspaper Die Deutsche Nation, and served as the Foreign Office's representative during the drafting of the Weimar Constitution. From November 1919 until April 1920 he was chief of cabinet to President Friedrich Ebert and played a central role in suppressing the Bavarian Soviet RepublicThompson, p.177 and the Kapp Putsch.Thompson, p.204-6 Academic career In 1927 he was named Kurator of the University of Frankfurt, to which he attracted a distinguished faculty that included Ernst Kantorowicz, Adolph Lowe, Karl Mannheim, Paul Tillich, and Max Wertheimer. Riezler consequently played a crucial role in the 1930 inception of the Frankfurt School; for example, it was Riezler who recommended Herbert Marcuse to Max Horkheimer. Because of his concurrent appointment to the philosophy faculty, Riezler was also prominent in German philosophical circles. In 1929 Riezler sided with Martin Heidegger during the famous \\"Davos encounter\\" with Ernst Cassirer and wrote an eyewitness account of this event, \\"Davoser Hochschulkurse 1929,\\" for the Neue Z√ºrcher Zeitung. Riezler was forced out of the university in April 1933 by the Nazis but, having been allowed by them to draw his pension, remained in Germany for the next five years, publishing books on aesthetics and Parmenides. Emigration In late 1938 he contacted the Kreisau Circle, an aristocratic anti-Nazi faction, and soon emigrated to the United States to accept a professorship in philosophy at the New School for Social Research. He was to remain at that institution until his retirement, interspersed with visiting professorships at Columbia University and the University of Chicago. During this period he became a close friend and colleague of the political philosopher Leo Strauss, who devoted the final chapter of his book What is Political Philosophy? to Riezler. Noting that Riezler's philosophy was \\"shaped by both the influence of Heidegger and the reaction to him,\\" Strauss concludes that it \\"was ultimately because he grasped the meaning of shame and awe that Riezler was a liberal, a lover of privacy.\\" Kurt Riezler returned to Europe in 1954, lived for some time in Rome and died in Munich in 1955. He was preceded in death by his wife K√§the (1885-1952), daughter of the German impressionist painter Max Liebermann. His survivors included their daughter Maria, wife of Howard B. White (1912-1974), a New School professor of political philosophy who had been Leo Strauss's first graduate student; and his brother Walter Riezler (1878-1965), a prominent musicologist, art historian and associate of the Deutscher Werkbund.

In 1991, by which time it had become South Africa's largest Afrikaner bank, Volkskas merged with United Building Society, Allied Building Society and Trust Bank to form Amalgamated Banks of South Africa. The bank issued banknotes for circulation in South West Africa between 1949 and 1959 from its Windhoek branch.  Early years  Volkskas was formally opened on 1 February 1935 in the De Villiers building in Pretoria by J.J. Bosman and a typist. It was registered as a cooperative loan bank under the Co-Operative Societies Act and thus began serving Afrikaners forced by the Great Depression to move to the city between 1929 and 1933. The bank was already registered on 9 July 1934 as Volkskas (Ko√∂peratief) Beperk (i.e. \\"Limited\\"). The bank provided credit union services in which people could set up savings or deposit accounts, and clients could obtain bank loan installments against the signature of two friends or other approved security. After four months in business, the bank turned a profit of R17.06. At this stage, the bank had no branches and two tellers. The first branch was opened on 1 August 1935, on Mark Street in Johannesburg. The premises on which the building stood were the first property owned by Volkskas.  Expansion  In 1939, Volkskas began opening checking accounts. Negotiations with the other large banks of the time came to nothing, so on 1 March 1941, Volkskas began circulating its first checks. Within three weeks, the other banks began accepting Volkskas's checks. That same year, it also expanded to become a full commercial bank, realizing the founders' long-awaited dream. Full banking status brought rapid expansion and a solid economic footing to the company. Volkskas's inter-registration with established local banks under the Banking Law of 1942 helped it connect better with the local economy, to the point that in 1947, it became a member of the Settlement Banking Office and set up agency agreements with other area banks in towns where the latter were unrepresented. Already in 1946, overseas representation began to meet the growing needs of clients who conducted transactions through other channels in other countries. This branch was aided by Volkskas getting certification in 1947 as a foreign currency handler. The bank handled most currencies of the world.  Further growth  In 1950, it was decided to change the name from Volkskas to Suid- Afrikaanse Nasionale Handelsbank Bpk. The name had already been approved by the authorities by Barclays Bank (D.C. & O.), and a suit was filed in the High Court of South Africa over the name. In 1951, the verdict was resolved in Barclays's favor. In 1952, J.J. Bosman, founder of Volkskas, died. At the time of his death, it was already the third-largest bank in South Africa. On 22 August 1952, the 100th branch was opened in Strand, Western Cape by Dr. T.E. D√∂nges. Later that year, a branch also opened in Transkei. Changes in the financial world required Volkskas to eventually diversify into other industries. The bank entered the leasing field with the purchase of Trans- Orange Finance and Development Bank and long-term financing through the Volkskas Belegginskorporasie Beperk. Volkskas helped found the Nasionale Bouvereniging, which later played a primary role in supporting Afrikaner interests in construction along with Saambou. The bank has been computerized since 1967. The integration of wholesale banking by the company was also a highlight. Volkskas Aksepbank Beperk (\\"Volkskas Merchant Banking Limited\\") established operations to serve corporate clients in the industries of industrial materials, mining, trade and real estate, public corporations, and local authorities. Volkskas Industri√´le Bank Beperk provided wholesale financing for large lease-to-buy and rental transactions with a focus on industrial materials. Volkskas Kommersi√´le Eiendomme Beperk was the division handling property interests (other than branches). This expansion required the group to restructure so the divisions could fully realize their profit potential. A new bank holding company, Volkskas-Groep Beperk, was founded with five active subsidiaries, including Volkskas Beperk, Volkskas Aksepbank Beperk, Volkskas Industri√´le Bank Beperk, Volkskas Nywerhede Beperk, and Volkskas Kommersi√´le Eiendomme Beperk. In 1978, the Volkskas Building (now ABSA Centre Pretoria) opened. In the early 1990s, the Amalgamated Banks of South Africa (ABSA) group was formed from the merger of United, Allied, and Volkskas Groups with part of the Sage Group. This resulted from the acquisition of the Bankorp Group in 1992. These banks all traded under their own names until 1998, when United, Volkskas, Allied, and TrustBank all merged under the ABSA umbrella.

It was constructed from 1778 onwards,Gloucestershire County Council Archives and there were three locks below Middle Forge. Following the construction of the Lydney Canal in 1813, the canal connected to that, rather than Lydney Pill, and it was disused after 1840, by which time a horse-drawn tramway had been built up the valley of The Lyd. The tramway was eventually relaid as a steam railway and is now preserved as the Dean Forest Railway. Most of the canal, colloquially called The Cut, still exists below Middle Forge. History Large parts of the parish of Lydney were organised as an estate, which had been managed by the Bathurst family since 1723. The estate contained mineral reserves, and they profited from this by building ironworks. The Lower Forge ironworks were supplied with water by several streams, which were augmented by a long leat which left the Newerne stream near the Chepstow road. In 1775, David Tanner from Tintern was granted a lease of the Upper Forge, on the northern borders of Lydney. A new 99-year lease was negotiated in 1778, which included powers to construct a canal from there to the Lower Forge. It is known that the canal had been built by 1790, although the precise date of construction is unknown. Tanner sold his lease in 1789, and in 1790 it was sold again to members of the Pidcock family, who were glassmasters from Staffordshire. The Pidcocks managed the forges until 1813, when the lease was sold back to the Bathursts. They also had coal mining rights, and transported coal to Lydney Pill using the canal. On surrender, the lease covered the Upper and Middle Forges, the Lower Forge and rolling mill, the White Cross furnace, and the canal, which had by then been extended to Lydney Pill. John James took on the lease from 1814, building another forge at New Mills in the 1820s, and using the Lower Forge as a tinplate works from 1844. In 1889, Richard Thomas, who had leased the works from 1876, made improvements to the Lower Forge tinplate works, and the remaining works were stripped and abandoned. The Lydney and Lydbrook Railway (tramway) was authorised by an Act of Parliament in 1809. This became the Severn and Wye Railway and Canal in 1810 and construction of a tramway and canal to Lydney Harbour commenced in the same year. The tramway ran parallel to Pidcock's canal as it followed the course of the Newerne Valley. Pidcock's Canal fell into disuse in the 1840s.Jim Shead, Waterways History, Pidcock's Canal Route The canal started at the Upper Forge, and ran close to the Newerne stream, also called The Lyd. The lower section took a more direct route to the Lower Forge, using the course of the leat which had supplied the works with water. There were three locks near the Middle works. The canal crossed the Chepstow road between Lydney and Newerne, and the branch from the Lower Forge to Lydney Pill was quite short. The route diagram shows the waterways as they existed in 1880. The Upper Forge, New Mills and Middle Forge all had extensive ponds upstream of the works, contained by stone dams. Once the canal closed, the ponds covered its route between Upper Forge and Middle Forge. Ordnance Survey maps for the period show weirs and sluices at the downstream ends of the ponds, and the central one at Middle Forge appears to feed the canal. By 1880 there was no obvious route around the dams, and there is no mention of locks to allow boats to move between levels. As on modern maps, the canal was known as The Cut at the time. From the Lower Mill, the canal formerly ran to Lydney Pill, but the waterways were altered as a result of the construction of the Lydney Canal. The 1880 map shows two channels below the Lower Mill, one clearly joining the bottom of The Lyd, before it discharges into the Lydney Canal, and the other running from the reservoir on the upstream side of the works to a wide basin near the Lydney Canal, but with no obvious connection between them. Halfway along this section is a small branch which ends just to the south of Station Road Cottages.Ordnance Survey, 1:2500 map, 1880 Points of interest See also *Canals of Great Britain *History of the British canal system Bibliography =References= Canals in Gloucestershire Lydney ","title":"Pidcock's Canal"},{"id":"13223583","text":"A dancer from Maljarka, a Romani dance ensemble in Estonia, performing during a festival.

Diocesan Museum Nonantola Michele di Matteo, also sometimes used with further qualifications of da Bologna or Lambertini (active 1410- 1448 or 1469) was an Italian painter of the late Gothic period in Bologna. Biography In 1410, he labored with Francesco Lola in painting processional standards for the city's reception of the Antipope Alexander V. He painted frescoes and designed windows for the Basilica San Petronio and the church of San Giacomo of Bologna. In 1447, he painted in the church of San Giovanni at Siena the twelve articles of the Apostles Creed. He also painted a Piet√† between Saints John, Mark, Roch, and Anthony Abbot (1462) and a Virgin and Child, (1469) found in the Academy of Bologna. The Gallerie dell'Accademia of Venice has an altar- piece of the Virgin and Child with Saints and scenes from the life of St Helena. In 1428, he worked in Bologna with Giovanni da Modena. A polyptych depicting the Virgin Mary and St John the Evangelist and other Saints (1430-1437) by Michele is present at the Museum of Art of the University of Missouri in Columbia. It was painted for the church of Sant'Elena, Venice. He is also attributed a painted crucifix at the Pinacoteca Nazionale of Bologna.The Samuel H.

It started on 25 September 1655 and ended on 13 October 1655. Capitulation treatment was signed 4 days later. Polish troops marched out the city on 19 October. The city's defense was led by Kiev's castellan Stefan Czarniecki, while Swedish forces were commanded by king Charles Gustav and Arvid Wittenberg.  Background  On August 2, 1655, when news of Swedish victories reached the city, the mayor of Krak√≥w, Andrzej Cieniowicz, urged residents to organize defence of the ancient Polish capital. He also collected taxes for employment of 1,000-strong infantry unit. The garrison of Krak√≥w was ordered to watch the city walls and control foreigners, especially Germans, who resided in the city. Furthermore, works on the fortifications were initiated under city engineer Izydor Affaita, and Krzysztof Mieroszewski of the local nobility. To cover the cost of the works, queen Marie Louise Gonzaga handed over some of her jewelry. On August 27, Bishop of Krak√≥w Piotr Gembicki urged residents to pledge allegiance to the king and to defend the city. The bishop paid for 300 soldiers, who strengthened the garrison, while city council created armed militia, which consisted of students and other residents. On September 19, King Jan Kazimierz came to Krak√≥w, after the lost Battle of Zarnow. The king brought a few thousand soldiers and lev√©e en masse, but the morale of his army was low. Several members of the nobility abandoned the king, while the army, concentrated at Pradnik, organized itself into a confederation, demanding money and renouncing Hetman, Stanislaw Lanckoronski. On September 20, the Council of the Senate had a meeting, in which allegiance to the king was confirmed. Soon after the meeting, the queen, together with Primate Andrzej Leszczy≈Ñski left the city. On September 24, Jan Kazimierz, who had initially planned to stay in Krak√≥w, decided to leave the city as well. Together with Bishop Gembicki, the king at first headed eastwards, to Wojnicz. He then turned south, to Nowy Wi≈õnicz, Nowy SƒÖcz, and the Polish border.  The Siege  Stefan Czarniecki defending Krak√≥w in 1655 The garrison of Krak√≥w, under Castellan Stefan Czarniecki and colonel of infantry Fromhold Wolff, consisted of some 5,000 men ‚Äì soldier of the regular army, plus city militia. In order to prepare the defence, Czarniecki burned the suburbs of Kleparz, Biskupie and Garbary, and constructed a system of Earthworks. On September 25, the Swedes attacked Kazimierz, pillaging it after capture. On the same day, they tried to enter Krak√≥w itself, but Polish counterattack forced them to retreat. On the next day, Charles Gustav ordered an artillery barrage, leaving Arvid Wittenberg with 8,000 soldiers. The Swedish king himself headed with a smaller army towards Wojnicz, where he once again defeated the Poles in the Battle of Wojnicz (October 3). News of this battle quickly reached Krak√≥w, together with Swedish demands for capitulation. Since Polish royal army units, scattered around the city, did not engage themselves in any skirmishes with the Swedes, the defenders of Krak√≥w felt abandoned, without hope of any support. Nevertheless, they continued to fight. On October 6, Charles Gustav returned to Krak√≥w, and while inspecting Swedish positions, his horse was killed by a Polish bullet, near St. Florian's Gate. As the siege progressed, morale among the defenders sank even lower. Czarniecki, well aware of this, on October 12 initiated negotiations. Further resistance meant destruction of Krak√≥w and starvation of its residents, so on the next day, Czarniecki agreed to capitulate.  Capitulation  On October 17, a truce was signed with the Swedes. It guaranteed freedom of religion, safety of the Roman Catholic clergy, civil servants and residents, keeping all privileges of the city and its university, and exchange of prisoners of war. The Swedes allowed Polish units to leave Krak√≥w, and march to winter quarters in western Lesser Poland, near O≈õwiƒôcim, Zator, S≈Çawk√≥w and Siewierz. These forces were to remain neutral until November 18. After that date, they were to decide whether to join the Swedish or the Polish king. On October 19, Czarniecki's forces gathered at Krak√≥w's Main Square. Some 1,800 men with 12 cannons left the city, while Czarniecki was invited by Charles Gustav to a feast. Soon afterwards, 2,500 Swedish infantry plus 500 reiters entered Krak√≥w. The Swedish king came to the city on October 19 in the afternoon. After meeting the city council, Charles Gustav visited Wawel with its Cathedral church. The Swedes immediately broke the agreement, imposing high taxes and robbing churches. Altogether, the booty stolen by the Swedes was estimated at 5 million zlotys.  References  * Pawe≈Ç Jasienica, Rzeczpospolita Obojga Narod√≥w.

Joseph Estrada, et al., 26558 Sandiganbayan, September 12, 2007) took place between 2001 and 2007 at the Sandiganbayan. Estrada, popularly called Erap, was ousted from office in 2001 during a popular uprising in Metro Manila after an aborted impeachment trial in which he was charged with plunder and perjury. Soon after his ouster, the same charges were filed against him at the Sandiganbayan. After a lengthy trial, the Sandiganbayan ruled Estrada not guilty of perjury while ruling him as guilty of plunder and sentenced him to reclusi√≥n perpetua. All of his co-accused were acquitted. The trial =Charges filed= A few months after the January 2001 popular uprising that ousted Estrada, the Philippine Ombudsman filed two charges at the Sandiganbayan on April 4, 2001; one for plunder and the other for perjury. The plunder case consisted of four separate charges: acceptance of 545 million pesos from proceeds of jueteng, an illegal gambling game; misappropriation of 130 million pesos in excise taxes from tobacco; receiving a 189.7-million-peso commission from the sale of the shares of Belle Corporation, a real-estate firm; and owning some 3.2 billion pesos in a bank account under the name Jose Velarde. The minor charge of perjury is for Estrada under-reporting his assets in his 1999 statement of assets, liabilities and net worth and for the illegal use of an alias, namely for the Jose Velarde bank account. Estrada's son, Jinggoy Estrada, an incumbent senator, and Edward Serapio, his personal lawyer, were his co-accused. Also charged were Charlie Ang, Yolanda Ricaforte, Alma Alfaro, Eleuterio Tan, Delia Rajas, and Jaime Dichaves, who was later added. The plunder charge was based upon a complaint filed before the ombudsman by Dante Jimenez, human rights lawyer Romeo Capulong, trial lawyer Leonard de Vera, 1971 Constitutional Convention delegate Ramon A. Gonzales, lawyers Antonio T. Carpio and Dennis B. Funa. One complaint was docketed as OMB-0-00-1756 (Romeo T. Capulong, Leonard de Vera and Dennis B. Funa v. Joseph Ejercito Estrada et al.; see Victor Tan Uy v. Office of the Ombudsman et al., G.R. No. 156399-400, June 27, 2008). On January 22, 2001, two days after his implied resignation from office, President Estrada was ordered by the ombudsman to file his counter-affidavit in answer to the complaints. Finding probable cause, the complaint would be filed as Criminal Case No. 26558. Estrada v. Desierto et al., G.R. No. 146710-15, March 2, 2001 Serapio v. Sandiganbayan et al., G.R. No. 148468, January 28, 2003 =Arraignment and plea= =Prosecution's case= The Philippine government's prosecution team was led by Special Prosecutor Dennis Villa-Ignacio and other government lawyers. Their case against Joseph Estrada was based on the following: =Defense's case= Former President Joseph Estrada's defense panel, led by Atty. Estelito Mendoza and composed of former Supreme Court justices and other celebrated Philippine lawyers, based their defense on the following points: President Estrada recalls the Arroyos plotting with the civil society and the military in January 2000, to take over a year later; The House of Representatives impeaching him without debate and voting; The Senate blue- ribbon committee not hearing him out; The Impeachment Court not citing for contempt the losers in a democratic debate and voting; and the Supreme Court conniving with the elite to swear in then-Vice President Gloria Macapagal- Arroyo at 12:20 p.m. of January 20, 2001, -(Manila Times, September 30, 2007) 1\\\\. The whole process is against the constitution. a) the legal possibility of removing a sitting president is by impeachment. Paguia, one of Estrada's lawyers, argues former President Estrada was not convicted and removed by the Senate acting as an Impeachment Court, therefore it is unconstitutional to subject him to the jurisdiction of the Sandiganbayan. -(Manila Times, September 14, 2007) b) the Supreme Court relied on a biblical, not constitutional passage, with President Estrada still in the Palace c) the same Court created a special division for President Estrada (not done in the case of the Marcoses and the cronies and the military). d) Actually, the plot to oust President Estrada was planned by the then-Vice President Arroyo, who met with some political and religious leaders calling for a what she called \\"Transition Government\\" under her rule. 2\\\\. The Sandiganbayan did not find him guilty of stealing a single centavo of public money. (Manila Times, September 30, 2007) Lead counsel Estelito Mendoza insisted there is no evidence Estrada received bribe money from jueteng lords. There was also no evidence he received commission money or checks from the Belle transactions. The one who admitted to receiving bribe money from gambling lords was former governor Chavit Singson of Ilocos Sur. But he was not charged as a co-conspirator. He ran for senator in May 2007 but lost. 3\\\\. Fabrication of evidence: Manrique, a former action officer of the Volunteers Against Crime and Corruption (VACC), narrated in his affidavit how he, sometime in the last week of October 2001, was contacted by a lawyer(State Prosecutor Dennis Villa-Ignacio) who represented himself as a member of the prosecution team in the Estrada cases. Manrique said the lawyer convinced him to file another perjury case against the deposed president since the original case filed by the Ombudsman was deemed to be weak and insufficient in evidence. The lawyer added Manrique‚Äôs complaint against Estrada had to be antedated to make it appear that even before the Ombudsman had filed his own case, 4\\\\. Saguisag, one of Estrada‚Äòs lawyers said the defense will base its legal argument on the prosecution‚Äôs failure to indicate in the information that Estrada had received jueteng money ‚Äúby reason of his public office,‚Äù ‚ÄúThere was no allegation that it was received by reason of his public office. That‚Äôs one of the elements of plunder,‚Äù (inquirer, September 2007) 5\\\\. The Sandigan special graft court has an image problem. It is not perceived as being impartial or independent or even fair. Reynato Puno has one of the worst trust ratings for a public figure. (Manila Times September 12, 2007) =Verdict= Initial reports of the nature of the conviction pronounced Estrada guilty of the PHP 545 million jueteng case and the Belle Corporation case, while the other two charges were dropped. The sentence of reclusi√≥n perpetua also includes the return to the government of the over PHP 200 million Erap Muslim Youth foundation and PHP 189 million Jose Velarde monies, the penalty of civil interdiction, and perpetual absolute exclusion from public office. The Court also ordered the arrest of all the other co-defendants in the case. On September 12, 2007, Joseph Estrada was acquitted of perjury but found guilty of plunder and sentenced to reclusi√≥n perpetua with the accessory penalties of perpetual disqualification from public office and forfeiture of ill-gotten wealth. On September 12, 2007, Sandiganbayan's Presiding Justice Teresita de Castro and two other magistrates unanimously acquitted his son, Senator Jinggoy Estrada, and a lawyer Edward Serapio of plunder charges.

All channels provide rolling news coverage 24 hours a day, focusing primarily on regions of the metro area outside Manhattan, Queens, and Staten Island. History The first of the channels, News 12 Long Island, was launched by Cablevision on December 15, 1986, to customers on its Long Island system, as the first 24-hour regional cable news service in the United States. Over the years Cablevision expanded the reach of News 12 by adding additional networks across its footprint. The network was formerly operated by Newsday Media Holdings and presided over by Patrick Dolan, son of Newsday majority owner Charles Dolan and brother of James L. Dolan. Altice USA, who bought Cablevision in 2016, has retained Dolan as a senior network advisor. In December 2005, News 12 Networks generated criticism when it changed its website and mobile app to a pay subscription service for those who live outside the News 12 viewing area. The News 12 website is offered free of charge to subscribers of Cablevision, Charter Spectrum, Comcast, or Service Electric. This has been used as a marketing tool against customers signing up for Verizon FiOS, or satellite providers DirecTV or Dish Network, which are available in many of the areas News 12 covers. At one point Cablevision even made the network's slogan, \\"Only on Cable. Never on FiOS. Never on satellite.\\" (In some ads, FiOS was substituted with \\"phone company television\\" and in most areas, \\"Cable\\" was substituted with Cablevision in areas where Cablevision was only provided as a cable provider, notably Long Island). In response, Verizon FIOS partnered with RNN to create FiOS1 News in June 2009 and later expanded to the Lower Hudson Valley in 2014, which could be viewed only by FiOS customers. Unlike News 12, FiOS1's website was not behind the paywall and was open to all users, with the exception of its live broadcast (which was only offered to FiOS customers). In October 2016, newspaper reports stated News 12 was consolidating its Westchester and Connecticut News operations, moving news anchor desks and studio operations to New Jersey and Long Island, and news and production staff at these operations would be laid off. Reports indicated Westchester News Director Janine Rose was allowed to resign, and Connecticut News Director Tom Appleby was dismissed. By August 2017, the seven News 12 Network cable channels began airing Cheddar's news summaries segments. In April 2018, Altice announced that it would form a new division named Altice USA News (renamed to Altice News after Cheddar acquisition) that would consist of News 12 and I24NEWS. The division was headed by Michael Schreiber now succeeded by Jon Steinberg. Altice has departed from Cablevision's long-standing policy of ensuring that News 12 remained exclusive to cable. In July 2019, Altice began to simulcast News 12 on Atlantic City station WACP between 6 AM and 9 AM every weekday morning. Beginning on November 4, 2019, Verizon FiOS began carrying News 12 and News 12+. They were meant to replace FiOS 1, which shut down 9 days later. Verizon later added sister networks i24News and Cheddar in early 2020.

Origins The college was opened in 1975 by Bishop John Rodgers SM, Bishop of Rarotonga. It was first staffed by Father Peter Salamonsen SM and Sister Berenice Stevens RSM. The Christian Brothers provided staff for the school from the beginning of the 1976 school year until the end of 2009. Brother Terence Vitus \\"Terry\\" McErlane became the second headmaster. Brothers Simon Coughlan and Joseph McRae were the other members of that first Christian Brothers community. For some years Sister Elizabeth Browne-Russell (SJC), a sister of St Joseph of Cluny, served as deputy principal.Graeme Donaldson, pp. 20-21; Brother V. Hawley cfc, \\"Christian Brothers' Mission in the Cook Islands\\", Our Life, May 2007, p. 36: . From its beginnings, the school's financial position was somewhat parlous especially after it became necessary to employ lay teachers starting in the 1980s. In 2000 the Cook Islands' Government began to pay 75% of teachers' salaries and running costs in all private and church schools. At the same time the schools' principal, Brother Norman Gillies established a charitable trust to ensure a regular supplementary income for future maintenance and development.Graeme Donaldson, p. 21 The Silver Jubilee of the College and the presence of the Christian Brothers was marked in 2000. In 2005, the school had a roll of 190. On 20 February 2006 part of the school was destroyed by fire. Later that year the block was rebuilt with funds supplied by the New Zealand Government through the Cook Islands Investment Commission (CIIC). The new block was designed by an Auckland architecture firm, Architectus. In May 2011, a college shrine in honour of Our Lady of Perpetual Help (containing the icon that was in the former chapel of the Christian Brothers) and a plaque honouring all the Brothers who taught at Nukutere College were unveiled on the wall of the new school building, overlooking the college playing field.

The block had been rebuilt after the 2006 fire. The director of Religious studies, Sister Lusianna Matai, lost all the teaching resources she had built up. The college was reopened in time for senior students to prepare for their NCEA exams in the second week in November. An emergency appeal for funds to rebuild the school was launched.Phil Cody and Cecily McNeill, \\"Rarotongan school again destroyed by fire\\", Wel-Com, November 2013, Issue 311, p. 1.

Sister Lusianna Matai of the Sisters of St Josephs of Cluny had been director of religious studies at Nukutere College for 10 years when she left the college in 2015. She was succeeded by Mr Iokimi Narovu in 2016.Nukutere College, News and Events (Retrieved 23 June 2018) Land At the time of the destruction of the classrooms, the school was faced with the expiration in November 2014 of the 1899 lease of the school site. Negotiations took place between the government of the Cook Islands, the school board, the Catholic Church and the landowners for the continued occupation of the land. An agreement was finally concluded in 2018 which resulted in the \\"warranting of the land\\". Two separate entities were created: Nukutere College Incorporated ‚Äì responsible for management of the college and Nukutere Holdings Incorporated ‚Äì answerable for the management of the land.Malina Etches, \\"Nukutere college rebuilds after the ashes\\", Cook Island News, 28 March 28, 2019 (Retrieved 3 May 2020) The Catholic cathedral, St. Joseph's Cathedral, Avarua which is near Nukutere College was also affected by the same land problem and benefitted from the same solution. Future In October 2019, the foundation stone for the rebuilding of the school after the 2013 fire and on the resolution of the land problems, was laid in the presence the Prime Minister of the Cook Islands, Henry Puna and the Bishop of the Rarotonga, Bishop Paul Donohue SM. Mr Puna said that the Cook Islands government supported the school all the way through and were aware of the land issues. ‚ÄúIt became clear to us, one really positive way we can help out and that was to ensure you never encounter land issues anymore, so you can plan with certainty going into the future.\\" Delaney Yaqona, the principal of the college, said, \\"this is a new beginning for Nukutere this is the start of the rebuild; thank you to the landowners for the peaceful negotiations, the Catholic community, all the teachers, students and the parents\\". He said that the college was looking forward to introducing a year 12 class. This would mean that the students could gain university entrance qualifications while remaining at Nukutere. \\"Earth rocks\\" selected from the Arai-Te-Tonga marae were laid into the foundation by Mark Brown (Deputy Prime Minister), Mrs Munukoa Purea (chairman of the school board), Bishop Donaghue, Mike Savage and Sister Elizabeth. Bishop Donoghue also placed a jar holding a statue of St Joseph and a list of names of every student of the college present at the occasion into the foundation trench. In his closing address he noted: 'St Joseph is our spokesperson with God, he is our protector, he is the patron of workmen.' Christian Brothers The Christian Brothers ceased to be on the staff of the college at the end of 2009.\\"Churchnews: Christian Brothers departing Rarotonga\\", Cook Islands News, 19 August 2009 (retrieved 17 February 2011) More than 20 Christian Brothers served at Nukutere College (1975‚Äì2009).\\"Churchnews: Nukutere's founding fathers finishing soon\\", Cook Islands News, 19 August 2009 (retrieved 17 February 2011) Among them were: Br Simon Germaine Coughlan, Br Andrew Dawani, Br Anthony Eugenio Gherardi, Br Norman Campion Gillies, Br Paul Kikisi, Br Terence Vitus McErlane, Br Joseph De Porres McRae, Br John Didicus O'Neill, Br Francis William Perkins, Br John Paschal Prendergast, Br Ignacy John Rubisz, Br Michael Benignus Scanlan, Br Benjamin Everard Ryan and Br Lawrence Hubert Wilkes. The Christian Brothers Congregation in New Zealand supported the college and the brothers financially so the new school could develop. Several brothers did extra work outside the school to assist the local community. Brother Anthony Gherardi is remembered for promoting the sport of volleyball on Rarotonga and Brother John O'Neill spent several years as the Catholic prison chaplain. Brother Gherardi (died 1998, aged 60) and Brother Ignacy Rubisz (died 23 October 2005, aged 56), died while stationed at the college and are buried in the Old Cathedral Cemetery, Avarua, adjacent to the grounds of Nukutere College.

The Virtual College used an interdisciplinary approach applying courses from several colleges which would unite to benefit a researcher in the field of biotechnology. Biotechnology courses January, 2000 saw the formation of the Virtual College of Biotechnology to research the rapidly growing field and innovations of science and public policies of innovative technological advancements in relation to living things. Even though, as mentioned above, The Canadian Light Source and Synchrotron is the only such Canadian institution for nuclear and biotechnology research and is gaining international fame, there is no actual College of Biotechnology. Students enroll in a separate and distinct college, to take interdisciplinary courses. Some examples are to enroll in the College of Arts & Science to earn a Bachelor of Science (B.Sc.) and finishing with Honours and Four-year Major in Biotechnology and either Cell Biology, Biochemistry or Microbiology. Enrolling in the College of Arts & Science to achieve a Bachelor of Arts (B.A.) pursuing either a Major in the Sociology of Biotechnology or a Minor in Philosophy, Science and Biotechnology. Either research into the economic impact of the agri-food sector or management, commercialisation and marketing of biotechnology research would be the result of enrolling in the College of Commerce resulting in a Bachelor of Commerce (B.Comm.) with a Major in Biotechnology Management. Because of the diverse nature of the new area of biotechnology, there is also exploration available by enrolling into the College of Agriculture and Bioresources to pursue a Bachelor of Science in Agriculture (B.S.A.) with a minor in Biotechnology. Finally by enrolling in the College of Engineering research would include creating biomass-derived oils, biodegradation of toxic pollutants or perhaps bioprocess engineering of post-harvest systems to name a few upon completion of a Bachelor of Science in Engineering (B.E.) diversifying into biochemistry or biotechnology of the Chemical Engineering program. The Virtual College of Biotechnology has seen breakthroughs in the biotechnology field in conjunction with the several Adjunct Research Facilities. And it doesn't stop there, virtually every area of the University of Saskatchewan has direct involvement with the new field of biotechnology. The legal aspects are explored the college of Law as licensing of technology, and Plant Breeders‚Äô Rights have direction and precedents established. Philosophy studies the impact of biotechnology science on societies ethics, epistemological systems and metaphysics. The provincial government established Ag-West Biotech Inc. to strengthen innovations, communication and networking of biotechnology between Saskatchewan's Research Facilities, University of Saskatchewan graduate research breakthroughs and their impact on International trade. Society's evolution has transcended the nomadic hunter-gatherer practices, the homesteader subsistence and the cash crops lifestyle following the industrial revolution. Society is evolving into the next stage of agricultural practices involving technological advances as applicable to the international scene of plant, human, and animal life sciences. From the formative years of the University of Saskatchewan, Board of Governors and Senate committee consisting of John Dixon, D. P. McColl, and President Murray saw a need that the University of Saskatchewan > should keep in the forefront the great needs of a prairie province and that there should also be > a harmonious combination of the Liberal Arts and Pure Sciences with the > Sciences as applied to Agriculture and the Professions. This is the mandate of the Virtual College of Biotechnology in the 21st century. Cancer, human, animal, and pediatric related disease research all benefit from medical biotechnology. Bioprocess engineering, genomics, addressing global warming, engineering, radiology, medicine, environmental ecosystems, waste management, pharmaceutical, nutritional and plant microbiology are all diverse fields of rapid growth. Technology research involving biology for today's society can be found at University of Saskatchewan Research - Discovery @ U of S: News. A very brief introduction would include: * Beef Industry profits from reliable DNA test.

Dissolution It is felt that the Virtual College of Biotechnology has not created its own identity for university and industry communities nor gained enough impetus to form a College of Biotechnology as of this date. There is a proposal to restructure and rename the Virtual College of Biotechnology changing the focus of undergraduate and graduate programming. The faculty positions would move to School of Public Policy for work in innovation and biotechnology management. The College of Arts and Science will administer the BTECH courses until the new School is set up. The Virtual College of Biotechnology would be served by the School of Public Policy which would offer master's degree in Public Policy, a PhD in Public Policy, and a Masters of International Trade. The Planning and Priorities Committee will pursue undergraduate platforms as an alternative to virtual colleges which lack clarity in its direction, and no decisive leadership in programming.

Zelten holds the title as the largest oil field in the Gulf of Sidra. The 229 wells in Zelten use a gas lifting system. The Zelten oil field is not associated with the town Zelten, which is located in the North-West of Libya. Background Discovered in 1956, Zelten was Libya's first major oil well, producing about . In 1959, its reserves were estimated at of 38¬∞ API oil, lying at 5,500-7,600 feet. Esso Standard began production of Zelten in 1961. The Zelten gas-lift system was installed during the period from 1969 to 1971 and represented one of the first uses of gas lift on a fieldwide basis to produce the high volume wells typical of Middle East Oil fields. In 1979, approximately of total liquid was being produced by gas lift. By 2006, the accumulated production of the Zelten field reached 2,426 mmb of oil and of associated gas. Sirte Oil Company The Sirte Oil Company (SOC), a subsidiary of the National Oil Corporation, was originally created in 1981 to take over Exxon's holdings in Libya. In 1986, SOC took over the assets of Grace Petroleum, one of the five US companies forced by the US government to leave Libya in 1996. SOC operates the Raguba field in the central part of the Sirte Basin. The field is connected by pipeline to the main line between the Zelten field and Brega. Besides Zelten, SOC is in charge of two other gas fields (Attahadi and Assumud) plus the Brega liquefied natural gas (LNG) plant.

In the Central Sirte Basin, carbonates of Upper Cretaceous, Paleocene and Eocene age produce in 150 fields on significant horst blocks or platforms (e.g., the Beda and Zelten platforms). Reservoirs are largely carbonate build-ups and reefs with some offshore production in the Gulf of Sidra. Carbonate reservoirs are largely related to two Upper Cretaceous and two Paleocene cycles of sedimentation in a syn-rift fill sequence; however, there is minor Mid-Cretaceous calcarenite production. Giant oil fields in this unit include Intistar, Beda, Defa, Waha, Haram, Zelten (Nasser), Hofra and Nafoora.Belazi, The geology of the Nafoora oil field, Sirte basin, Libya: In the Journal of Petroleum Geology, v. 12, p. 353‚Äì366 (1989) Upper Cretaceous Sirte Shale of the Rakb Group is the dominant source rock. Geochemical data of 81 oils demonstrate that the Sirte Shale generates a low sulfur, high gravity oil with low gas oil ratios. Generation began in Eocene era and continues to present. Onshore the petroleum is dominantly oil; however, offshore increased thermal gradients and deeper burial suggest higher gas oil ratios and natural gas potential. The Upper Cretaceous carbonate reservoirs are commonly dolomites whereas the lower Paleocene cycles include calcilutites, calcarenites, oolites and skeletal debris.

The protest was resolved without violent clashes. Other than Spetsnaz forces of Ukraine, the unit was one of the first to be mobilized during the Crimean Crisis and the War in Donbass by being deployed to the Crimean-Kherson border in order to prevent Russian forces from a possible advance into mainland Kherson Oblast on 13 March 2014. On March 26 Ukrainian forces secured the Russian Mars-75 naval navigation station located in Kherson Oblast. The unit was deployed to Donbass in May 2014 and fought in the Battle in Shakhtarsk Raion where it held the objective of securing both the Russian border and the strategic Savur-Mohyla hill. The unit, along with the 72nd Guards Mechanized Brigade became trapped in southern Luhansk oblast as pro-Russian forces cut their supply lines from the bulk of Ukrainian force in July. Ukrainian forces attempted to keep the units resupplied delivering 15 tons of supplies through enemy lines to the unit. The 79th Airmobile Brigade was able to break through enemy lines on 7 August 2014 along with much of their equipment, however it was reported that the unit was severely short on ammunition and would likely not be able to continue holding its positions if it did not break through the encirclement. Due to spending a month surrounded by enemy forces the unit was sent back to its home station in order to regroup. The unit was redeployed after a month of R/R to hold the southern Donetsk Oblast in the Mariupol and Donetsk regions.

Such perturbations and disturbances can include stochastic events such as fires, flooding, windstorms, insect population explosions, and human activities such as deforestation, fracking of the ground for oil extraction, pesticide sprayed in soil, and the introduction of exotic plant or animal species. Disturbances of sufficient magnitude or duration can profoundly affect an ecosystem and may force an ecosystem to reach a threshold beyond which a different regime of processes and structures predominates. When such thresholds are associated with a critical or bifurcation point, these regime shifts may also be referred to as critical transitions. Human activities that adversely affect ecological resilience such as reduction of biodiversity, exploitation of natural resources, pollution, land use, and anthropogenic climate change are increasingly causing regime shifts in ecosystems, often to less desirable and degraded conditions. Interdisciplinary discourse on resilience now includes consideration of the interactions of humans and ecosystems via socio- ecological systems, and the need for shift from the maximum sustainable yield paradigm to environmental resource management which aims to build ecological resilience through \\"resilience analysis, adaptive resource management, and adaptive governance\\". Definitions The concept of resilience in ecological systems was first introduced by the Canadian ecologist C.S. Holling in order to describe the persistence of natural systems in the face of changes in ecosystem variables due to natural or anthropogenic causes. Resilience has been defined in two ways in ecological literature: # as the time required for an ecosystem to return to an equilibrium or steady-state following a perturbation (which is also defined as stability by some authors). This definition of resilience is used in other fields such as physics and engineering, and hence has been termed ‚Äòengineering resilience‚Äô by Holling. # as \\"the capacity of a system to absorb disturbance and reorganize while undergoing change so as to still retain essentially the same function, structure, identity, and feedbacks\\". The second definition has been termed ‚Äòecological resilience‚Äô, and it presumes the existence of multiple stable states or regimes. Some shallow temperate lakes can exist within either clear water regime, which provides many ecosystem services, or a turbid water regime, which provides reduced ecosystem services and can produce toxic algae blooms. The regime or state is dependent upon lake phosphorus cycles, and either regime can be resilient dependent upon the lake's ecology and management. Mulga woodlands of Australia can exist in a grass-rich regime that supports sheep herding, or a shrub-dominated regime of no value for sheep grazing. Regime shifts are driven by the interaction of fire, herbivory, and variable rainfall. Either state can be resilient dependent upon management. Theory Ecologists Brian Walker, C S Holling and others describe four critical aspects of resilience: latitude, resistance, precariousness, and panarchy. The first three can apply both to a whole system or the sub-systems that make it up. # Latitude: the maximum amount a system can be changed before losing its ability to recover (before crossing a threshold which, if breached, makes recovery difficult or impossible). # Resistance: the ease or difficulty of changing the system; how ‚Äúresistant‚Äù it is to being changed. # Precariousness: how close the current state of the system is to a limit or ‚Äúthreshold.‚Äù. # Panarchy: the degree to which a certain hierarchical level of an ecosystem is influenced by other levels. For example, organisms living in communities that are in isolation from one another may be organized differently from the same type of organism living in a large continuous population, thus the community-level structure is influenced by population- level interactions. Closely linked to resilience is adaptive capacity, which is the property of an ecosystem that describes change in stability landscapes and resilience. Adaptive capacity in socio-ecological systems refers to the ability of humans to deal with change in their environment by observation, learning and altering their interactions. Human impacts Resilience refers to ecosystem's stability and capability of tolerating disturbance and restoring itself. If the disturbance is of sufficient magnitude or duration, a threshold may be reached where the ecosystem undergoes a regime shift, possibly permanently. Sustainable use of environmental goods and services requires understanding and consideration of the resilience of the ecosystem and its limits. However, the elements which influence ecosystem resilience are complicated. For example, various elements such as the water cycle, fertility, biodiversity, plant diversity and climate, interact fiercely and affect different systems. There are many areas where human activity impacts upon and is also dependent upon the resilience of terrestrial, aquatic and marine ecosystems. These include agriculture, deforestation, pollution, mining, recreation, overfishing, dumping of waste into the sea and climate change. =Agriculture= Agriculture can be seen as a significant example which the resilience of terrestrial ecosystems should be considered. The organic matter (elements carbon and nitrogen) in soil, which is supposed to be recharged by multiple plants, is the main source of nutrients for crop growth. At the same time, intensive agriculture practices in response to global food demand and shortages involves the removal of weeds and the application of fertilisers to increase food production. However, as a result of agricultural intensification and the application of herbicides to control weeds, fertilisers to accelerate and increase crop growth and pesticides to control insects, plant biodiversity is reduced as is the supply of organic matter to replenish soil nutrients and prevent run-off. This leads to a reduction in soil fertility and productivity. More sustainable agricultural practices would take into account and estimate the resilience of the land and monitor and balance the input and output of organic matter. =Deforestation= The term deforestation has a meaning that covers crossing the threshold of forest's resilience and losing its ability to return its originally stable state. To recover itself, a forest ecosystem needs suitable interactions among climate conditions and bio-actions, and enough area. In addition, generally, the resilience of a forest system allows recovery from a relatively small scale of damage (such as lightning or landslide) of up to 10 per cent of its area. The larger the scale of damage, the more difficult it is for the forest ecosystem to restore and maintain its balance. Deforestation also decreases biodiversity of both plant and animal life and can lead to an alteration of the climatic conditions of an entire area. Deforestation can also lead to species extinction, which can have a domino effect particularly when keystone species are removed or when a significant number of species is removed and their ecological function is lost. =Climate change= Climate resilience is generally defined as the capacity for a socio-ecological system to: (1) absorb stresses and maintain function in the face of external stresses imposed upon it by climate change and (2) adapt, reorganize, and evolve into more desirable configurations that improve the sustainability of the system, leaving it better prepared for future climate change impacts. Increasingly, climate change is threatening human communities around the world in a variety of ways such as rising sea levels, increasingly frequent large storms, tidal surges and flooding damage. One of the main results of climate change is rising sea water temperature which has a serious effect on coral reefs, through thermal-stress related coral bleaching. Between 1997-1998 the most significant worldwide coral bleaching event was recorded which corresponded with the El Nino Southern Oscillation, with significant damage to the coral reefs of the Western Indian Ocean. =Overfishing= It has been estimated by the United Nations Food and Agriculture Organisation that over 70% of the world's fish stocks are either fully exploited or depleted which means overfishing threatens marine ecosystem resilience and this is mostly by rapid growth of fishing technology. One of the negative effects on marine ecosystems is that over the last half-century the stocks of coastal fish have had a huge reduction as a result of overfishing for its economic benefits. Blue fin tuna is at particular risk of extinction. Depletion of fish stocks results in lowered biodiversity and consequently imbalance in the food chain, and increased vulnerability to disease. In addition to overfishing, coastal communities are suffering the impacts of growing numbers of large commercial fishing vessels in causing reductions of small local fishing fleets. Many local lowland rivers which are sources of fresh water have become degraded because of the inflows of pollutants and sediments. =Dumping of waste into the sea= Dumping both depends upon ecosystem resilience whilst threatening it. Dumping of sewage and other contaminants into the ocean is often undertaken for the dispersive nature of the oceans and adaptive nature and ability for marine life to process the marine debris and contaminants. However, waste dumping threatens marine ecosystems by poisoning marine life and eutrophication. Poisoning marine life According to the International Maritime Organisation oil spills can have serious effects on marine life. The OILPOL Convention recognized that most oil pollution resulted from routine shipboard operations such as the cleaning of cargo tanks. In the 1950s, the normal practice was simply to wash the tanks out with water and then pump the resulting mixture of oil and water into the sea. OILPOL 54 prohibited the dumping of oily wastes within a certain distance from land and in 'special areas' where the danger to the environment was especially acute. In 1962 the limits were extended by means of an amendment adopted at a conference organized by IMO. Meanwhile, IMO in 1965 set up a Subcommittee on Oil Pollution, under the auspices of its Maritime Safety committee, to address oil pollution issues. The threat of oil spills to marine life is recognised by those likely to be responsible for the pollution, such as the International Tanker Owners Pollution Federation: The marine ecosystem is highly complex and natural fluctuations in species composition, abundance and distribution are a basic feature of its normal function. The extent of damage can therefore be difficult to detect against this background variability. Nevertheless, the key to understanding damage and its importance is whether spill effects result in a downturn in breeding success, productivity, diversity and the overall functioning of the system. Spills are not the only pressure on marine habitats; chronic urban and industrial contamination or the exploitation of the resources they provide are also serious threats. Eutrophication and algal blooms The Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution calls nutrient pollution the most widespread, chronic environmental problem in the coastal ocean. The discharges of nitrogen, phosphorus, and other nutrients come from agriculture, waste disposal, coastal development, and fossil fuel use. Once nutrient pollution reaches the coastal zone, it stimulates harmful overgrowths of algae, which can have direct toxic effects and ultimately result in low-oxygen conditions. Certain types of algae are toxic. Overgrowths of these algae result in harmful algal blooms, which are more colloquially referred to as \\"red tides\\" or \\"brown tides\\". Zooplankton eat the toxic algae and begin passing the toxins up the food chain, affecting edibles like clams, and ultimately working their way up to seabirds, marine mammals, and humans. The result can be illness and sometimes death. Sustainable development There is increasing awareness that a greater understanding and emphasis of ecosystem resilience is required to reach the goal of sustainable development. A similar conclusion is drawn by Perman et al. who use resilience to describe one of 6 concepts of sustainability; \\"A sustainable state is one which satisfies minimum conditions for ecosystem resilience through time\\".Perman, R, Ma, Y, McGilvray, J and M.Common. (2003). ‚ÄúNatural Resource and Environmental Economics‚Äù. Longman. 26, 52, 86. Resilience science has been evolving over the past decade, expanding beyond ecology to reflect systems of thinking in fields such as economics and political science. And, as more and more people move into densely populated cities, using massive amounts of water, energy, and other resources, the need to combine these disciplines to consider the resilience of urban ecosystems and cities is of paramount importance. = Academic perspectives = The interdependence of ecological and social systems has gained renewed recognition since the late 1990s by academics including Berkes and FolkeBerkes, F. and Folke, C., (ed Colding, J.) (1998). ‚ÄúLinking Social and Ecological Systems: Management practices and social mechanisms for building resilience‚Äù. Cambridge University Press: 1, 33, 429, 433. and developed further in 2002 by Folke et al. As the concept of sustainable development has evolved beyond the 3 pillars of sustainable development to place greater political emphasis on economic development. This is a movement which causes wide concern in environmental and social forums and which Clive Hamilton describes as \\"the growth fetish\\".Hamilton, C. (2010). ‚ÄúRequiem for a Species: Why we Resist the Truth about Climate Change‚Äù. Earthscan. 32, 14. The purpose of ecological resilience that is proposed is ultimately about averting our extinction as Walker cites Holling in his paper: \\"[..] \\"resilience is concerned with [measuring] the probabilities of extinction‚Äù (1973, p. 20)\\".Walker, J. (2007). ‚ÄúThe Strange Evolution of Holling‚Äôs Resilience or The Resilience of Economics and the Eternal Return of Infinite Growth‚Äù. Submission to TfC e-Journal. 8 Becoming more apparent in academic writing is the significance of the environment and resilience in sustainable development. Folke et al state that the likelihood of sustaining development is raised by \\"Managing for resilience\\" whilst Perman et al. propose that safeguarding the environment to \\"deliver a set of services\\" should be a \\"necessary condition for an economy to be sustainable\\". = The flaw of the free market = The challenge of applying the concept of ecological resilience to the context of sustainable development is that it sits at odds with conventional economic ideology and policy making. Resilience questions the free market model within which global markets operate. Inherent to the successful operation of a free market is specialisation which is required to achieve efficiency and increase productivity. This very act of specialisation weakens resilience by permitting systems to become accustomed to and dependent upon their prevailing conditions. In the event of unanticipated shocks; this dependency reduces the ability of the system to adapt to these changes. Correspondingly; Perman et al. note that; \\"Some economic activities appear to reduce resilience, so that the level of disturbance to which the ecosystem can be subjected to without parametric change taking place is reduced\\". = Moving beyond sustainable development = Berkes and Folke table a set of principles to assist with \\"building resilience and sustainability\\" which consolidate approaches of adaptive management, local knowledge-based management practices and conditions for institutional learning and self-organisation. More recently, it has been suggested by Andrea Ross that the concept of sustainable development is no longer adequate in assisting policy development fit for today's global challenges and objectives. This is because the concept of sustainable development is \\"based on weak sustainability\\" which doesn't take account of the reality of \\"limits to earth's resilience\\". Ross draws on the impact of climate change on the global agenda as a fundamental factor in the \\"shift towards ecological sustainability\\" as an alternative approach to that of sustainable development. Because climate change is a major and growing driver of biodiversity loss, and that biodiversity and ecosystem functions and services, significantly contribute to climate change adaptation, mitigation and disaster risk reduction, proponents of ecosystem-based adaptation suggest that the resilience of vulnerable human populations and the ecosystem services upon which they depend are critical factors for sustainable development in a changing climate. In environmental policy Scientific research associated with resilience is beginning to play a role in influencing policy-making and subsequent environmental decision making. This occurs in a number of ways: *Observed resilience within specific ecosystems drives management practice. When resilience is observed to be low, or impact seems to be reaching the threshold, management response can be to alter human behavior to result in less adverse impact to the ecosystem. *Ecosystem resilience impacts upon the way that development is permitted/environmental decision making is undertaken, similar to the way that existing ecosystem health impacts upon what development is permitted. For instance, remnant vegetation in the states of Queensland and New South Wales are classified in terms of ecosystem health and abundance. Any impact that development has upon threatened ecosystems must consider the health and resilience of these ecosystems. This is governed by the Threatened Species Conservation Act 1995 in New South Wales and the Vegetation Management Act 1999 in Queensland. *International level initiatives aim at improving socio-ecological resilience worldwide through the cooperation and contributions of scientific and other experts. An example of such an initiative is the Millennium Ecosystem Assessment whose objective is \\"to assess the consequences of ecosystem change for human well-being and the scientific basis for action needed to enhance the conservation and sustainable use of those systems and their contribution to human well-being\\". Similarly, the United Nations Environment Programme aim is \\"to provide leadership and encourage partnership in caring for the environment by inspiring, informing, and enabling nations and peoples to improve their quality of life without compromising that of future generations. Environmental management in legislation Ecological resilience and the thresholds by which resilience is defined are closely interrelated in the way that they influence environmental policy-making, legislation and subsequently environmental management. The ability of ecosystems to recover from certain levels of environmental impact is not explicitly noted in legislation, however, because of ecosystem resilience, some levels of environmental impact associated with development are made permissible by environmental policy-making and ensuing legislation. Some examples of the consideration of ecosystem resilience within legislation include: *Environmental Planning and Assessment Act 1979 (NSW) - A key goal of the Environmental Assessment procedure is to determine whether proposed development will have a significant impact upon ecosystems. *Protection of the Environment (Operations) Act 1997 (NSW) - Pollution control is dependent upon keeping levels of pollutants emitted by industrial and other human activities below levels which would be harmful to the environment and its ecosystems. Environmental protection licenses are administered to maintain the environmental objectives of the POEO Act and breaches of license conditions can attract heavy penalties and in some cases criminal convictions. *Threatened Species Conservation Act 1995 (NSW) - This Act seeks to protect threatened species while balancing it with development.

After the dissolution of the USSR, the 98th Guards Airborne Division was split between Ukraine and the Russian Federation. In the spring of 1993, the 217th Guards Airborne Regiment was relocated to Ivanovo in Russia. The regiment's Battle Flag, Order of Kutuzov, and 55% of the supplies were also relocated. Current unit By the order of Minister of Defence of Ukraine the new Ukrainian airmobile brigade based on the elements of the Soviet 217th Guards Airborne Regiment was formed in Bolgrad in May 1993. By December 1, 1993, the brigade was finally formed as one of the units of the 1st Airmobile Division. From October 1995 until December 1999, 800 paratroopers from the brigade served as part of the 240th Special Battalion in former Yugoslavia. Later they served as peacekeepers in Kosovo. Between May and June 2002, the Brigade was relocated to the urban-type settlement Hvardiyske, Dnipropetrovsk Oblast. The brigade was given the honorable designation \\"Dnipropetrovsk\\", for their battle achievements and high level of professionalism. On July 16, 2002, Leonid Kuchma awarded the unit with its new Battle Flag. By the order of the Minister of Defence the Brigade was transferred from the 1st Airmobile Division to the 6th Army Corps on November 8, 2002. A company of the brigade was deployed to Crimea during the 2014 Crimean crisis. It became one of the few, if not the only, Ukrainian unit to leave Crimea as a unit, still bearing their arms. Two of its IFVs(Infantry Fighting Vehicle(s)) were captured by rebels during the War in Donbass. One of the vehicles was a BMD 1 and the other a BMD 2. Both are now used by the separatists.

It was established by Johanna Featherstone in 2002, emerging from The Red Room Radio Show, which broadcast on 89.7FM Eastside Radio from 2001. Red Room Poetry creates poetic projects and learning programs in collaboration with a spectrum of poets, schools, communities and partners for positive social impact. Its mission is to make poetry accessible to all, especially those who face the greatest barriers to creative opportunities. Poetic Learning Red Room Poetic Learning is Red Room Poetry's poetry education program. It sends contemporary Australian poets into primary and secondary schools all across Australia. It was launched in 2007 with support from the Keir Foundation and the Ian Potter Foundation, initially piloting in four NSW high schools. In 2008 it expanded into Victoria and in 2009-2010 moved further interstate to Norfolk Island and Queensland schools. Red Room Poetic Learning is now a national program, servicing schools everywhere in Australia. Red Room Poetic Learning collaborates with students, teachers and communities to deepen their encounters with poetry. Learning programs connect poets with students to unlock poetic ways of seeing, writing and responding. Red Room Poetry is committed to publishing these outcomes and providing a platform for young poets to share their work with wider audiences. Poetry Object A Croydon Public School student with her poetry object. Red Room Poetry Object is a free poetry writing competition inviting young writers and their teachers to submit poems about special and curious objects. It is open to students in Years 3-10 and teachers from Australia and New Zealand. In 2017, Poetry Object published over 3400 student and teacher poems from over 190 school communities. Migrant and refugee students benefit from the opportunity to positively express their story through poetry.http://www.dailytelegraph.com.au/newslocal/south-west/parkour-poet-tim- sinclair-and-red-room-company-inspire-students-at-canterbury-high-school/news- story/6dc04b3322a70ad3e097ac8d57ea1ce3 Retrieved 2017-09-04 As part of Red Room Poetry Object, each year six Australian poets have been commissioned to write new poems about their own talismanic objects. Unlocked Unlocked logo Unlocked is an educational arts program developed and run by The Red Room Company in collaboration with educational staff from NSW Correctional Centres, which 'unlocks' the potential of inmates through poetry. The initiative's goal is to encourage self-expression and reflection while improving inmates' literacy. Introduced in Sydney in 2010, the project has entered its third year. At correctional centres across NSW, Australian poets run intensive writing workshops, collaborating with students on every stage of the writing process: from the initial exercises and experimentations, through the editing and rewriting process, to recording, performing and publishing their work in a professionally designed print anthology. The project was developed in collaboration with Corrections NSW Audiovisual Unit and education staff, 2SER's Jailbreak radio show, Blood & Thunder Publishing Concern and Boccalatte. A participant at an Unlocked workshop in Balund-a * Current Unlocked Projects The most recent Unlocked project was held at the Balund-a Project, a residential diversionary programme for male and female offenders between 18 and 40. Indigenous poet Lionel Fogarty led the workshops, and the students responded with great enthusiasm to Lionel's work and stories. There was a particular interest in Lionel's use of language, his mixing of English and Bandjalang dialect. In October 2012 Red Room Company poets Lionel Fogarty and Nick Bryant-Smith will travel to South Coast Correctional Centre to run an intensive, three-day workshop. * Project Outcomes According to The Red Room Company, Unlocked offers a range of potential outcomes and benefits for the students involved. Through Unlocked, poets work with both with the vocational education providers working in NSW Correctional Centres, as well as education providers such as ACE Community Colleges, an Adult Education provider and Registered Training Organisation which runs accredited courses in the Balund-a Project. At the completion of each project, a limited-edition anthology of work created during the project is published. These publications are made available to inmates who participated in workshops, and is distributed among libraries in correctional centres around Australia. Through Unlocked, students can return to their community with recognised qualifications, as a part of the study that they have completed inside. In this way the value of the project is not only supporting students to come to terms with emotions, past experiences or relationships, but to build practical literacy and communication skills, and the confidence to apply them. Public Projects Red Room Poetry regularly runs major public creative projects whose goal is to commission new works by contemporary Australian poets, then publicise this new work as widely as possible. Past Projects include: *Pigeon Poetry - eight poets from across the country were commissioned to each write a poem that would be raced by thoroughbred pigeons on 3 August 2008. *Clubs & Socs - in 2011 contemporary poets were paired with clubs and societies from across Australia. Poets created new poetic works based on their experiences. * Sea Things - saw four new poems commissioned from poets in Hobart, Melbourne, Brisbane and Darwin, and from secondary school students in Perth, Darwin and Thursday Island, as the project charted the Sydney Hobart Yacht Race. From March - June 2011, an installation of the trips 'poetic cargo' was displayed in the window of the Australian Council for the Arts in Sydney. * Sun Herald 'Extra' Poems - in 2009 the Sun Herald asked The Red Room Company to collect poems from their archive to be featured over the summer. * Stacks - The Red Room Company‚Äôs poetry-in-libraries series in 2011, held in City of Sydney Libraries. Andy Quan, Judith Bishop, Toby Fitch and Eileen Chong hosted children's poetry workshops. * ATYP Workshops - The Red Room Company paired with the Australian theatre for young people to teach young actors how to read poetry. * The Poet's Life Works - featured four high-impact Australian poets in four events in various spaces around Sydney. * Dust Poems - in 2009 explored the words of truckies and their experiences of the road and commissioned three truck- driving poets and three professional poets, Brendan Ryan, Lindsay Tuggle, Judith Bishop who work in non-trucking industries. * Red Room Radio - individual poets were commissioned to write a poem for community radio broadcast and online access. * Nightwriting - encouraged people to use all their senses to explore poetic language. A poem-pod installation, designed by Camilla Lawson, was fitted with audio Braille and tactile alphabet versions of an original poem. The project premiered at the 2008 Sydney Writers' Festival. * Sustainable Sydney - in partnership with the City of Sydney council, and Art and About. Eight poets ran workshops in schools in inner Sydney. * Occasional Poetry - an installation of poems, dressmakers dummies, and related costumes at the 2007 Sydney Writers' Festival. * The Poetry Picture Show - a series of poems on the theme of film and the moving picture.

Music scores are divided into a brass caption score and a percussion caption score and reflect the level of musical execution by corps members. The two scores are added together to give the corps' overall music score. Visual scores are divided into a color guard caption score and a performance score and reflect the level of movement execution by corps members. The totals in these two categories are similarly added together for a corps' overall visual score. Effect scores reflect the overall impact of the show, both musically and visually. Both musical effect and visual effect scores are made up of a repertoire score and a show score. Musical effect and visual effect are scored separately, then added together to produce the corps' overall effect score. Finally, the effect, music, and visual scores are added together and any penalties are deducted from this total. The resulting number is the corps' final score for that event.

His plays are known for their theatricality, wild humor, and poetic realism, while his novels and films are darker and more naturalistic. As a novelist, he has been compared to Graham Greene, John Steinbeck, and Nelson Algren. Ben Gazzara‚Äôs performance in Milton‚Äôs play, Duet, received a Tony nomination. Another play, Skin, won the Neil Simon Playwrights Award. His theater piece, Murderers Are My Life, was nominated as best one-man show by the Valley Theater League of Los Angeles. His second novel, Paradise Road, was given the Mark Twain Journal award \\"for significant contribution to American literature.\\" Early years Milton was born during the Great Depression to a working class Jewish family in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. He's of Romanian descent with his grandparents having immigrated from a small village near Boto≈üani, Romania. His father, Si Milton, became a truck driver, then a yeast salesman, and eventually a bakery and restaurant owner. Milton's work as an apprentice baker contributed to his play, Bread, which debuted at The American Place Theater in New York and had a successful run at the Theater Dortmund in Dortmund, Germany. Duet which opened on Broadway in the mid-seventies also had productions in German at the Kreis Theater in Vienna, Austria. In the spring of 1996, it had its premiere in Germany at the D√ºsseldorfer Schauspielhaus. A new play, Catching a Cab, under the auspices of Gustav Kiepenheuer, had also been optioned for German production. Milton was an early member of the avant-garde Theatre Genesis, along with Sam Shepard, Leonard Melfi and Murray Mednick. He has had more than a dozen plays performed Off-Off-Broadway including The Interrogation Room, Halloween Mask, The Metaphysical Cop, and Scraping Bottom. Scraping Bottom, under the title of Born to Win, became the Czech director Ivan Passer's first American film, and starred George Segal, Karen Black and Paula Prentiss. Pauline Kael has characterized this title change as perhaps the most extreme in the history of American cinema. Other plays were Duet for Solo Voice and Bread at The American Place Theater and a revised version of Duet for Solo Voice, re-titled Duet, on Broadway with Ben Gazzara. Gazzara's performance earned him a Tony nomination. In Los Angeles, Skin, for which Milton won the Neil Simon Playwrights Award, ran for nearly a year at The Odyssey Theater. He has had six novels published: The Quarterback (Dell Publishing), Paradise Road (Atheneum), Kabbalah (Harcourt, Brace, Jovanovich), Skyline (G. P. Putnam's Sons), The Fat Lady Sings (iUniverse), and Iron City [White Whisker Books]. Paradise Road was given the Mark Twain Journal award \\"for significant contribution to American literature.\\" His plays Duet and Skin are also in print. Milton's short stories have appeared in The Southern California Anthology, The Pearl River Review, The Southern (Lafayette, Louisiana) Anthology, among others. His adaptation of David Hare's Knuckle was seen on PBS television. Other television work includes a stint as story editor on Starsky and Hutch and scripts for the John Houseman syndicated show, Tales of the Unexpected. He had written screenplays for directors, Peter Bogdanovich, Ivan Passer, Sidney Pollack, Dick Richards, and Irvin Kershner. Since 1977, he had been a Senior Lecturer in Drama and Adjunct Professor in the Master of Professional Writing Program at the University of Southern California. He also taught screenwriting in the cinema department. He had been a special lecturer at Goddard College and at CalArts, as well as consultant to the creative writing program at The University of South Alabama and literary consultant to Scott, Foresman Publishers, and Warner Books. He had conducted screenwriting seminars at the German Film and Television Academy in Berlin and the Duke University Film and Television Program. He was appointed to the advisory board of the Christopher Isherwood Foundation along with, among others, David Hockney, Michael York, John Schlesinger, and Armistead Maupin. For thirteen years, until 2004, he ran a writers' workshop on the Maximum Security Yard of the California Correctional Institution at Tehachapi where his class consisted of a dozen murderers. He mounted a one-man show, ‚ÄúMurderers Are My Life‚Äù, based on his prison experiences which ran for four months at The Two Roads Theater in Studio City, CA. It was also seen at The Schoolhouse Theater in Croton Falls, New York and The Studio Theater in Manhattan. It received a nomination as best one-man show by the Valley Theater League of Los Angeles.

California =Los Angeles alternate route= Alternate U.S. Route 66 was a designation to preserve the next-to-last routing of U.S. 66 from Pasadena, California to Los Angeles, California, when the signage for U.S. 66 was transferred to the Arroyo Seco Parkway (also known as the Pasadena Freeway, with alignment lasted from 1938 to 1964, when Alternate U.S. 66 was eliminated as well as Historic Arroyo Seco Parkway into SR 11, and became SR 110 in 1981. The routing from Pasadena to Los Angeles was west on Colorado Boulevard and then south on Figueroa Street. The end of the Pasadena Freeway then blended into Figueroa Street, and the alternate route rejoined its parent route. The routing along Figueroa Street and the portion along Colorado Boulevard between Linda Vista Avenue and Figueroa Street also bore the designation of State Route 11. =San Bernardino business loop= Business US 66 in San Bernardino, sometimes rendered \\"City\\" US 66 on contemporary maps, was a short business loop that existed in the city from the late 1940s until US 66 was decommissioned in California in 1964. Designated as Legislative Route Number 191, its former alignment continued east from the junction of US 66, former US 91 and former US 395 at Mount Vernon Avenue and 5th St, east along 5th Street and then north on E Street. E Street continued on to become modern Kendall Drive, rejoining the US 66 mainline at Cajon Boulevard near Devore. Part of this routing included the former alignment of State Route 18 prior to its truncation. In 1959, the routing was truncated to Palm Avenue with the construction of the Barstow Freeway. After 1964, the routing became State Route 206, which was decommissioned in 1991 and is no longer signed. Texas =Amarillo business loop= Business US 66 in Amarillo followed the original alignment of US 66 when the later alignment was moved to Amarillo Boulevard. It began at Amarillo Boulevard, turning south on Taylor Street (one way, the east-bound route was on Fillmore Street). At Sixth Street it turned west, rejoining the main route at Amarillo Boulevard on the west side of the city. Oklahoma =Clinton business loop= =Oklahoma City business loop= Business US 66 in Oklahoma City followed the older alignment of US 66 after the main route was moved to the interstates. The original highway turned south from Edmond going into Oklahoma City, but the main route was moved onto Interstate 35. The beginning of the business route was at Lincoln Boulevard (in a concurrency with U.S. Route 77), leaving the main route on Interstate 440 (now Interstate 44). At 23rd Street (in front of the State Capitol), the two routes formed a tri-plex with U.S. Route 270 and turned west. US 77 turned off the multiplex at Broadway. At May Avenue, the Business US 66/US 270 routes turned north (forming a quadplex with Oklahoma State Highway 3 and Oklahoma State Highway 74). At I-440/US 66, the Business US 66 designation ended; the main route (along with US 270) continued west on the 39th Expressway (now Oklahoma State Highway 66). =Tulsa business loop= Business US 66 in Tulsa was an older alignment of US 66 that was redesignated when US 66 was moved to Interstate 44. It followed 11th Street west west from I-44 to 12th St (it angles downtown onto 10th Street briefly, then re-aligns as 11th Street). It turned south at Southwest Boulevard, rejoining the main route at I-44. Missouri =Joplin alternate route= Alternate US 66 was an alternate route of U.S. Route 66 in the Joplin, Missouri area. It left the main route in Webb City by continuing west on Broadway (the main route turned south on Jefferson Street), angled off as MacArthur Boulevard, then turned south on Main Ave, passing through Airport Drive and into Joplin. It ended at Seventh Street in Joplin. Part of the road is now city street, the rest is Route 171 and Route 43. =Joplin bypass route= Bypass US 66 in Joplin, Missouri was a bypass route of U.S. Route 66. In the northern part of Joplin, US 66 headed on a zig-zag course towards the downtown area; Bypass US 66 continued south on Rangeline Road (then also U.S. Route 71, then turned west on Seventh Street (now Route 66). The road would eventually become the main route of US 66, with the older alignment becoming Business US 66. =Joplin business loop= Business US 66 in Joplin, Missouri was a business route of U.S. Route 66 and was the former alignment of the main road. It was created when the main route was moved to the bypass route of the highway. The road followed the now historic alignment of the highway (Zora Street, Florida Avenue, Utica Street, Euclid Street, St. Louis Avenue, Broadway, and Main Avenue), all of which (except Main) are now city streets. Main Avenue is part of Route 43. This road would later serve as part of U.S. Route 71 Business (Joplin), but this road no longer serves that path. =Webb City business loop= Business US 66 in Webb City, Missouri was a business route of U.S. Route 66. The main route, which had been routed down a concurrency with U.S. Route 71, now headed down a four lane expressway. A business route was created, following the older alignment through Carterville and continuing to downtown Webb City. At Main Street, it turned off the old route to rejoin to main route. =Carthage alternate route= U.S. Route 66 Alternate was a short one-mile (1.6 km) spur of U.S. Route 66. Its southeast to northwest alignment ran from US 66 just northeast of Carthage, Missouri to U.S. Route 71 at Kendricktown, Missouri. Alternate 66 became Route V in the early 1970s. =Springfield bypass route= Bypass US 66 in Springfield, Missouri was a short lived bypass created when Interstate 44 was built on the north side of the city and the main route was concurrent with I-44. It was located on Kearney Street and West Bypass and, as the city expanded across it, was redesignated Business US 66 when that route was moved from downtown. Much (but not all of the highway) is currently Route 744. =Springfield, MO business loop= Business US Highway 66 (also \\"City US 66\\" until 1960) was an old alignment of U.S. Route 66 in Springfield, Missouri. In 1948, US 66 was moved from downtown (it followed Glenstone Avenue, St. Louis Street, College Street, and Chestnut Expressway) onto a new alignment onto Kearney Street (now Route 744) and West Bypass and the old highway became the business route. With the completion of Interstate 44, Business I-44 was concurrent with it and US 66 was concurrent with I-44 (Kearney Street became, briefly, Bypass 66). By the late 1960s, Bypass 66 was deleted and the old bypass became the new Business 66 (the old Bus 66 was left as Business I-44 for a while, then turned over to the city). In 1970, Business 66 was done away with entirely. Alternate business loop Alternate Business US 66 was a second business alignment of U.S. Route 66 in Springfield, Missouri. Business US 66 turned south from Kearney Street down Glenstone to St. Louis Street and then west to Park Central Square. At Commercial Street, Alternate Business US 66 headed west to Boonville Avenue, then south to rejoin Business US 66 at the city square. =Lebanon business loop= Business US Highway 66 was an older alignment of US 66 in Lebanon, Missouri. It followed Elm Street through the city and later became Business Loop I-44. US 66 became part of Interstate 44. It existed in the 1960s. =Rolla business loop= Business US Highway 66 was an older alignment of US 66 in Rolla, Missouri. It followed Kingshighway and Bishop Avenue through the city and is now Business Loop I-44. US 66 had been moved and later became part of Interstate 44. It existed in the 1960s. =St. Louis bypass route= Bypass US 66 around the St. Louis area was the designation for the relocated U.S. Route 66, commissioned as a bypass in 1958. Bypass US 66 is now (roughly) Interstate 270 and Lindbergh Boulevard (U.S. Route 61/U.S. Route 67). Until 1969, when Business US 66 was returned to the US 66 designation, no non-special US 66 existed in the St. Louis area. In 1938, US 66 was moved on a bypass around the city of St. Louis. The original alignment of US 66 became the business route. In 1969, the business route, now joined with the East St. Louis business route was redesignated US 66, while Bypass US 66 was redesignated Interstate 270. =St. Louis optional route= =St. Louis business loop= Business US 66 in the St. Louis, Missouri area was actually one of two business routes in the entire metro St. Louis area. A separate Business US 66 existed in the East St. Louis, Illinois area. In 1939, US 66 was routed over the Chain of Rocks Bridge to have the route bypass the city. Non-special 66 continued west down, roughly, Interstate 270 to Lindbergh Boulevard, then south to rejoin the original alignment down Watson Road. The business route turned south on Riverview, Broadway, Florissant Ave, Tucker Boulevard (then 12th Street), then southwest on Gravois Road, then west- southwest on Chippewa Street (which becomes Watson Road in the suburbs). The road was originally designated \\"City\\" 66, but in 1960 it became \\"Business\\" 66, a trend seen on other city routes across the country. The East St. Louis Business 66 connected with the St. Louis Business 66 at the MacArthur Bridge connection with Gravois Road. By 1969, Business 66 returned (via the East St. Louis route) to being non-special US 66. Currently, Riverview, Broadway, Florissant, and Tucker are now city streets. Gravois Road is Route 30, and Chippewa Street and Watson Road are now Route 366. Illinois =East St. Louis business loop= Business US 66 in the East St. Louis, Illinois area followed the older main alignment of U.S. Highway 66 through St. Louis metropolitan area when US 66 was routed around the north and west sides of St. Louis. It followed Nameoki Road, Edwardsville Road, and 10th Street, eventually crossing the MacArthur Bridge to join (a different) Business US 66 in St. Louis. The route was created in 1938, and the designation was removed in 1969. The road is now predominantly Illinois State Route 203, and (in East St. Louis) a city street. =Springfield, IL business loop= U.S. Route 66 Business was the old alignment of U.S. Route 66 through Springfield, Illinois, United States after the bypass along Adlai Stevenson Drive and Dirksen Parkway opened ca. 1939.National Bridge Inventory It was originally designated U.S. Route 66 City, and changed to a business route ca. 1960. In the early 1960s a one-way pair was added; after that it came from the south on 6th Street and split into 6th and 5th Streets, turning east on Myrtle and Spruce Streets to reach 9th Street. It used 9th Street into Peoria Road to end at Dirksen Parkway north of Springfield.State of Illinois, 1971 Official Highway Map When US 66 was removed from Springfield ca. 1979, Interstate 55 Business was designated not on what had been US 66 but on former US 66 Business through downtown. This is now also marked as Historic US 66. =Lincoln business loop= =Bloomington business loop= =Joliet alternate route= Alternate US Highway 66 was designated in 1940 when a new alignment of Route 66 opened, passing through Plainfield, Illinois and bypassing Joliet. Alternate US 66 branched off the main route near Romeoville and headed south, finally rejoining the main route at Gardner. Its total length was about . The highway is now designated Illinois Route 53 after US 66 Alternate was eliminated in February 1967. The later \\"main\\" alignment of US 66 is near (and in some cases under) Interstate 55.

The judiciary of Colombia () is a branch of the State of Colombia that interprets and applies the laws of Colombia, to ensure equal justice under law, and to provide a mechanism for dispute resolution. The judiciary comprises a hierarchical system of courts presided over by judges, magistrates and other adjudicators. Colombia is a centralized state, thus there is only one jurisdiction (with the exception of special indigenous jurisdictions), which is functionally divided by subject matter into an ordinary, penal, administrative, disciplinary, constitutional and special jurisdictions (military, peace, and indigenous matters). The judiciary of Colombia, unlike most jurisdictions, does not have a single supreme entity to oversee the lower courts, but rather has four high courts, known in Colombia as the \\"High Courts\\", which are the supreme tribunals of decision in their respective fields. The four high courts are the Constitutional Court (head of the constitutional jurisdiction), the Supreme Court (head of the ordinary jurisdiction), the Council of State (head of the administrative jurisdiction), and the Superior Council of Judicature (head of the disciplinary jurisdiction). Though the courts are supposed to be equal, the Constitutional Court has a broad spectrum of judicial oversight which often allows it to rule on issues overseen by different jurisdictions and even to weigh in directly in the rulings of other high courts. High Courts =Constitutional Court= The Colombian Constitutional court is in charge of guarding the Colombian Constitution. The Constitutional court also oversees the Tutela (similar to an Amparo) which protect individuals against violations of fundamental rights as stated in the Article 86 of the Colombian Constitution. The Tutela can be filed against individuals, companies, the government itself and even judicial rulings. Thus the court can overturn rulings issued by other High Courts if it judges them to violate fundamental human rights. The Colombian Constitutional court also decides on the constitutionality of Laws, Presidential Decree deemed to have force of law and International Treaties. Unlike the constitutional oversight of the Supreme Court of the United States, laws might be challenged at any time by any citizen and are not decided in a case by case basis but are directly decided upon on abstract. In other words, the plaintiff does not have to demonstrate he has been harmed by the law or that he has any legitimate interest on the decision, all he has to do is to allege why he considers the law to be unconstitutional even if the consequences of said unconstitutionality have not yet been realized or are merely implicit. The mechanism by which the court hears unconstitutionally cases is the Public Action of Unconstitutionality which dates back to 1910. =Supreme Court= The Supreme Court is the highest judicial instance of the ordinary jurisdiction. It consists of 23 judges which are chosen by co√∂ption. The current magistrates fill themselves any vacants by choosing from a lists of ten candidates that are forwarded by the Council of Judicial Governance. This lists are integrated by the winners of public convocations that grade applicants by their merit. The Court is formed by 3 chambers, a civil-agrarian chamber made up by 7 judges, a labor chamber made up by 7 judges and a Penal chamber made up by 9 judges. The Court is located in Bogot√°. =Council of State of Colombia= The highest body of the Contentious Administrative Jurisdiction, it solves the processes that involve to the State and the matters, or the processes that involve to two State Entities ultimately; it also completes an advisory function because it is the body to which the Government should appeal before making certain decisions, it is not bound by its decision, but must consider the councils, verdict or opinion in certain matters. The Council knows of the unconstitutionality of any norm that the Constitutional Court is not competent to adjudicate, which are all other norms that do not have material force of law, such as Reglementary Presidential Decrees, Administrative Acts, City Ordinances, etc. = Superior Council of the Judiciary = Council of Government Judiciary () serves for the administration of the branch and also has the power to decide over conflicts of competence between courts. It is the highest disciplinary body of the judicial branch and serves as an Ethics Tribunal for Judges and lawyers alike.  Lower Courts  =Ordinary Superior tribunals= The ordinary jurisdiction is divided into judicial districts which function as appellate courts (Superior tribunals). Each district has a superior court, which hears appeals from and supervise the lower courts in the district. The court is composed of three judges which are appointed by the Supreme Court.

It was originally the yacht Caroline built for Eldridge R. Johnson and launched 18 July 1931. Caroline was at the time the second largest yacht and largest American built Diesel yacht. It was built with a laboratory as well as palatial quarters and was loaned and equipped by Johnson for the Johnson- Smithsonian Deep-Sea Expedition of 1933 that explored the Puerto Rico Trench. The yacht was sold in 1938 to William B. Leeds and renamed Moana replacing an earlier Leeds yacht of the same name. It was purchased by the US Navy in 1941 and commissioned as USS Hilo, first designated as Patrol Gunboat (PG) 58 and then functioning and designated as Motor Torpedo Boat Tender (AGP) 2 supporting the torpedo boats for the duration of World War II. Yacht Caroline Caroline was built in 1931 by Bath Iron Works, Bath, Maine at a cost of 1.5 million dollars for the Victor Talking Machine Company founder Eldridge R. Johnson. The yacht's keel was laid 1 September 1930 as Bath's hull number 141 with launch on 18 July 1931 and delivery to the owner on 28 September 1931. The yacht, replacing a smaller yacht of the same name, was named for Johnson's mother, Caroline Reeves Johnson, and christened by his grand niece, Caroline Fenimore Fitler, also named for his mother. On registration Caroline was assigned official number 231135 and the signal and radio call letters WDEC. =Description= The yacht was designed by Henry J. Gielow's company with unusually large owner's quarters, extending the full width amidships with two baths, seven guest staterooms, quarters for two maids and two valets, and a crew of forty. The guest staterooms, all with private bath, were aft with those on port and starboard sides connected by sliding doors enabling them to be connected into larger suites. On the main deck was a by living room with a fireplace forward. Aft was a partially sheltered deck with a lobby and elevator connecting the owner's quarters below and a laboratory on the deck above on the upper deck. Aft of that were a smoking room and by dining room with a dressing room and shower for owner and guests, quarters for the chief engineer, dining room for the maids and galley between smoking room and dining room. Captain and radio operators had quarters on the upper deck where there was also a radio room and a lounge and observation room as well as the laboratory. The pilot house and chart room occupied the bridge deck. Caroline had a waterline length with length overall, beam, draft of (Navy ) and displacement tonnage of 2,350. Registry information showed , length, breadth and depth of with a crew of forty-two. She was the largest Diesel powered yacht built in America and the second largest private yacht in America at that time.Paul Schatzkin, Defying Gravity: The Paraellel Universe of T. Townsend Brown, 2005-2006-2007-2008 ‚Äì Tanglewood Books, Chapter 30 ‚Äì The Caroline Power was provided by two Cooper-Bessemer 1,500-horsepower diesel engines driving two screws with a maximum speed of 14 knots. Fuel capacity was sufficient for a cruising range of . In addition the yacht had one of the largest Sperry Gyroscope Company gyroscopic-stabilizers built for a private vessel. The gyroscope wheel itself weighed spun by a 210-horsepower Diesel- electric motor at 13,000 revolutions a minute and taking one and a half hours to reach that maximum speed. The device was designed to counter five and a half degrees of roll. The total weight of the two engines and gyroscope was approximately Two 150-kilowatt and one 50-kilowatt diesel‚Äìelectric generating sets provided electrical power. A carbon dioxide fire extinguishing system was installed for fire protection. =History= Johnson offered the use of the Caroline for scientific research including a 1932 archeological expedition to South America and Easter Island.\\"Expedition Sails\\", THE NEW YORK SUN, THURSDAY, JANUARY 21, 1932 ‚Äì page 27 In October 1932 Johnson equipped and offered for use the yacht for what was expected to be a series of expeditions in cooperation with the Smithsonian Institution to be known as the Johnson- Smithsonian Deep-Sea Expedition. The first was to the Puerto Rico Trench embarking investigators from several disciplines and government agencies and institutions interested in oceanographic work. Those included the Naval Research Laboratory, Agriculture and Commerce Departments as well as The American Museum of Natural History, Carnegie Institution and the Oceanographic Institution of Woods Hole. The expedition, under the leadership of Dr. Paul Bartsch of the Smithsonian, sailed from New York on 21 January 1933. In addition to the scientific party Johnson and his son, E. R. Fenimore Johnson who had helped prepare the yacht, and invited guest went with the expedition. Aside from description and addition of new species to collections three lines of echo soundings were gathered across the trench with the Navy echo sounding device operated by US Navy seaman Thomas Townsend Brown and water samples were taken at various depths. E. R. Fenimore Johnson assisted with the sounding work and had his own interests in ocean research, equipping his own yacht, Elsie Fenimore for such work. Both he and Elsie Fenimore served in World War II in mine warfare work. Further expeditions did not take place due to the economic depression and the European situation. Caroline was engaged in pleasure cruising as well as science. A notable example was a 1935 cruise in which Douglas Fairbanks and Lady Ashley and other film personalities, departing at Tahiti, were Johnson's guests aboard on a cruise in which the yacht continued to Suva, the Solomon Islands, Japan, China, and the East Indies before continuing to Southampton. Johnson loved the Caroline and the Johnson Victrola Museum, Dover, Delaware, features a song written about the yacht played with 78-rpm records on authentic Victor Talking Machines. By March 1937, with the earlier CarolineThis yacht, official number 225885, was sold to John R. Brinkley, M.D. of Del Rio, Texas, renamed Doctor Brinkley which was purchased by the Navy to serve during World War II as . being sold to Joseph M. Shenck of Los Angeles, Johnson chartered his later Caroline for the winter cruising season. Yacht Moana In 1938 Caroline was advertised as Caroline II for sale and bought by William B. Leeds who named the yacht Moana, replacing a smaller yacht, (Official number 226065/KGCK), of the same name.On line references to celebrities such as Errol Flynn and Ernest Hemingway aboard Leeds' Moana predating 1938 refer to the smaller, earlier yacht. The same celebrities may be found in references to events after 1938 and those would be aboard ex-Caroline. World War II Pacific Theatre operations Moana was purchased by the Navy on 28 November 1941 and converted to Navy use at Craig Shipbuilding Co., Long Beach, California, she commissioned as USS Hilo (PG-58) on 11 June 1942, Lieutenant Commander F. A. Munroe in command. One of the first ships to be used as a motor torpedo boat tender, Hilo departed Long Beach, California, to load supplies at San Diego, California on 19 June and sailed for Pearl Harbor on 28 June. The ship arrived Pearl Harbor on 5 July 1942, and was immediately sent to Palmyra Island to tend to torpedo boat squadron 1B (consisting of PT-21, PT-23, PT-25, and PT-26). Hilo remained in the vicinity fueling and providing supplies to the boats then under training until returning to Pearl Harbor again on 4 October. She was soon underway, however, steaming by way of Palmyra Island to Canton Island, where she arrived on 29 October. There she took on passengers and proceeded to Funafuti, arriving on 2 November 1942 with Squadron 1B. =Tending torpedo boats= The ship remained at Funafuti until 25 November, tending torpedo boats and engaging in rescue operations as American forces prepared for the coming assault on the Gilberts and Marshalls. On 12 November the Hilo and other units from Funafuti rescued Eddie Rickenbacker and the crewmen of a crashed B-17 after they were adrift at sea in rubber boats for 21-days. She next sailed for Noumea, New Caledonia, arriving on 2 December, and from there escorted four PT boats to Cairns, Queensland, where she moored on 11 December. =Setting up her base in New Guinea= Hilo was then sent to set up the first torpedo boat base in New Guinea, at Milne Bay, arriving on 17 December. Commencing operations soon after their arrival, Hilos boats contributed to the hard- fought Buna-Gona campaign in New Guinea as allied forces began their return to the Philippines. The boats fired at Japanese ashore, destroyed barges loaded with men and supplies, and even fought submarines in support of the troops ashore. On 13 January 1943, her designation was changed to AGP-2. In February 1943, Hilo explored the coast for a suitable advance PT boat base, and by the 28th had established one at Kana Kope. The torpedo boats stationed there with Hilo soon had a chance to fight, as Japanese efforts to reinforce their Lae and Salamaua garrisons led to the Battle of the Bismarck Sea from 2‚Äì4 March. The tender remained at Kana Kope until late April, when she began to move up the New Guinea coast to various anchorages. As Hilos torpedo boats continued to take part in the successful New Guinea campaign, Hilo herself underwent many air raids and endured extremes of climate and disease before being relieved on 20 October. The tender sailed to Sydney, Australia, arriving on 13 November, and sailed again on 9 February 1944 for Milne Bay. =Moving her base to New Britain= Hilo again took up her tending duties in the New Guinea area and was transferred to Talasea, New Britain on 26 March. She remained there until 4 June tending two squadrons of torpedo boats, after which she shifted her operations to Mios Woendi and became a command ship for torpedo boat operations in the U.S. 7th Fleet her tender equipment removed. The ship remained there until 6 November. =Supporting PT-boat operations in the Philippines= With the invasion of the Philippines underway, Hilo sailed to Leyte Gulf, arriving on 12 November. During the next months the ships in the Gulf were under almost constant air attack. Hilo was nearly hit on 26 November as kamikaze attacked San Juanico Straits; one kamikaze crashed some ahead of the tender. Hilos gunners scored several kills during this period. Commander, Motor Torpedo Boat Squadrons, 7th Fleet, shifted his flag to Cyrene on 16 January, and for the next nine months Hilo was occupied with passenger voyages to various islands, including Mios Woendi and the Palaus. She departed Samar on 26 October 1945 for the United States via Eniwetok and Pearl Harbor. Hilo received four battle stars for service in World War II. Post-war decommissioning Hilo arrived on 1 December and was decommissioned on 3 March 1946. The ship entered the Suisun Bay National Defense Reserve Fleet on 30 June 1946 and was sold on 6 November 1947 by the United States Maritime Commission to Pillsbury & Martingnoni, San Francisco, California.

The Swiss Federal Aircraft Factory developed a design for a four-engined swept winged fighter following the end of the Second World War. During the test programme an unpowered glider was built and flown. A turbojet powered test aircraft, known as the Arbal√®te (\\"Crossbow\\"), also flew. The N-20 design was not produced. Both the single Aiguillon and Arbal√®te airframes survive and are on public display at the Flieger-Flab-Museum, D√ºbendorf; the glider test aircraft was destroyed in an accident. Design and development The aircraft was to be powered by four turbofan engines buried in the wings, with the bypass air feeding cold-air pipes each side of the engines, being routed through a combustion chamber where additional fuel could be burned as a form of reheat, or deflected though large slots on the upper and lower wings to act as aerodynamic flaps or thrust reversers. Two engines could be shut down in flight to increase range. It was planned that the N-20 would carry its armament in a detachable weapons bay, capable of carrying large loads of cannons, rockets or bombs.Haller 1962, p.203. SM-1 engine on display It was initially planned that the aircraft's engines would be designed and built by the Swiss company Sulzer. The initial engine choice was a small turbojet, the Sulzer D45, with a thrust of , which was abandoned in 1947. Only two prototype D45 engines were built in 1948. The first engine, D45.01 was used in a test rig between 1950 and 1951 and the second engine, D45.04 (of limited airworthiness) was used until 1955 in a test rig. The D45.04 is also part of the D√ºbendorf museum N-20 display. The Armstrong Siddeley Mamba turboprop was then chosen as the basis for the N-20's engines, with the propeller reduction gear replaced by a low pressure compressor.Haller 1962, p. 204. This powerplant was named Swiss Mamba SM-1; the conversion was carried out in 1948 by EFW, with only six engines built (four fitted to the N-20 with two spares). One of the spare engines is today part of the Swiss Museum of Transport, at the Flieger-Flab-Museum D√ºbendorf. =EFW N-20.01= Since Swiss industry still had no experience with the aircraft and aerodynamics of jet aircraft, several wind tunnel models were produced. In addition, a 3/5th scale wooden glider, the EFW N-20.01 was built to allow testing of the novel wing shape; this flew on 17 April 1948. The aircraft was equipped with a JATO solid rocket motor, which was able to be started independently to reach the necessary altitude for tests. The nose gear came from a de Havilland Vampire and the main landing gear from a Messerschmitt Bf 109; both were electromechanical retractable. The body was made from wood and fabric covered. The N-20.01 was destroyed in a landing accident on 1 July 1949 at Emmen air force base. =EFW N-20.02 Arbal√®te= N-20.02 Arbal√®te on display The glider had successfully proven the design and was followed by a similar sized powered test aircraft, the EFW N-20.02 Arbal√®te (\\"Crossbow\\"), powered by four 0.98 kN (220 lbf) Turbom√©ca Pim√©n√© turbojets mounted above and below the wings. This aircraft first flew on 16 November 1951. It proved to have good manoeuvrability and reached a maximum speed of 750 km/h (466 mph). =EFW N-20.10 Aiguillon= The full scale aircraft was estimated to have a maximum speed of 1,095 km/h (680 mph), but the initial converted Mamba, the SM-1, which was test-flown under a de Havilland Mosquito in 1948 and was the first turbofan to fly, did not generate adequate thrust. Considerable further work was required for the definitive two-shaft SM-5 engine, which was meant to generate 14.7 kN (3,300 lbf) thrust. The prototype was completed in 1952 and, fitted with four SM-1 engines, flew briefly during a taxi test on 8 April 1952 but development of the engine and the N-20 aircraft was cancelled soon afterwards. =EFW N-20.20 Harpon= During testing it was discovered that the engines would not produce the required thrust, so the N-20.20 project was started. The aircraft was similar to the N-20.10, but had one conventional engine, a Rolls-Royce Avon or Armstrong Siddeley Sapphire turbojet in each wing root. The wing was a little thinner and the main landing gear came a little closer to the fuselage because now there was no need to place the engines within the wing. The N 20:20 was never completed, although some wind tunnel models were manufactured.Cockpit Number 2 February 1984, pp. 40‚Äì43.

They are of significant historical importance, but have been replaced over time by transit telescopes, astrometry techniques, and satellites such as Hipparcos. There are two types of astronomical sextants, mural instruments and frame-based instruments. Mural sextants Remains of Ulugh Beg's mural sextant, Samarkand, Uzbekistan, 15th century. The first known mural sextant was constructed in Ray, Iran, by Abu-Mahmud al-Khujandi in 994. To measure the obliquity of the ecliptic, al-Khujandƒ´ invented a device that he called al- Fakhri sextant (al-suds al Fakhrƒ´), a reference to his patron, Buwayhid ruler, Fakhr al Dawla (976‚Äì997). This instrument was a sixty-degree arc on a wall aligned along a meridian arc (north-south line). Al Khujandi's instrument was larger than previous instruments; it had a radius of about twenty meters.Tekeli, Sevim (1958), 'Nasiruddin, Takiyuddin ve Tycho Brahe'nin Rasat Aletlerinin mukayesesi'. Ankara Universitesi Dil ve Tarih-Cografya Fak√ºltesi Dergesi, XVI, p. 4\\\\. The main improvement incorporated in al-Fakhri sextants over earlier instruments was bringing the precision of reading to seconds while older instruments could only be read in degrees and minutes. This was confirmed by al-Bir≈´ni, al-MarrƒÅkushƒ´ and al-KƒÅshƒ´. Al-Khujandƒ´ used his device to measure the sun's angle above the horizon at the summer and winter solstices; these two measurements allow computation of the latitude of the sextant's location and the obliquity of the ecliptic. Ulugh Beg constructed a Fakhri Sextant that had a radius of 40.4 meters, the largest instrument of its type in the 15th century. Housed in the Ulugh Beg Observatory, the sextant had a finely constructed arc with a staircase on either side to provide access for the assistants who performed the measurements. Framed sextants Tycho Brahe's sextant, used for measuring the angular distances between stars. A sextant based on a large metal frame had an advantage over a mural instrument in that it could be used at any orientation. This allows the measure of angular distances between astronomical bodies. These instruments differ substantially from a navigator's sextant in that the latter is a reflecting instrument. The navigator's sextant uses mirrors to bring the image of the sun, moon or a star to the horizon and measure the altitude of the object. Due to the use of the mirrors, the angle measured is twice the length of the instrument's arc. Hence, the navigator's sextant measures 120¬∞ on an arc with an included angle of 60¬∞. By comparison, the astronomical sextants are large and measure angles directly ‚Äî a 60¬∞ arc will measure at most 60¬∞. =Construction= These large sextants are made primarily of wood, brass or a combination of both materials. The frame is heavy enough to be stiff and provide reliable measures without flexural changes in the instrument compromising the quality of the observation. The frame is mounted on a support structure that holds it in position while in use. In some cases, the position of the sextant can be adjusted to allow measurements to be made with any instrument orientation. Owing to the size and weight of the instrument, attention was paid to balancing it so that it could be moved with ease. Observations were typically made with an alidade, though newer versions could use a telescope. In some cases, a system of counter-weights and pulleys were used to allow the observer to manipulate the instrument in spite of its size. =Usage= Johannes and Elisabetha Hevelius observing with the sextant. These instruments were used in much the same way as smaller instruments, with effort possibly scaled due to the size. Some of the instruments might have needed more than one person to operate. If the sextant is permanently fixed in position, only the position of the alidade or similar index need be determined. In that case, the observer moved the alidade until the object of interest is centered in the sights and then reads the graduations marked on the arc. For instruments that could be moved, the process was more complex. It was necessary to sight the object with two lines. The edge of the instrument would typically be supplied with sights and the instrument was aligned with one of the two objects of interest. The alidade was then aligned with the second object as well. Once each object was centred in one set of sights, the reading could be taken. This could be a challenge for a moving star observed with a very large instrument as a single person might not be able to confirm both sights with ease; an assistant was a great benefit. The illustration of the Hevelius instrument to the right shows how two persons would use such a sextant: his wife Elisabetha is aligning the instrument while Johannes sets the alidade. =Well-known framed sextants= *Taqi al-Din used a sextant for the determination of the equinoxes. * Tycho Brahe used a sextant for many of his stellar position measurements. * Johannes Hevelius used a sextant with a particularly ingenious alidade to provide stellar position measurements of great accuracy. * John Flamsteed, the first Astronomer Royal, used a sextant at the Royal Greenwich Observatory.

The line ran for from the Main Western line to the township of Newnes. Along the way, it passed through a tunnel now known as the Glowworm Tunnel, because it is famous for its glow-worms. The tunnel is now contained within the Wollemi National Park. Description and history The line was constructed and operated by the Commonwealth Oil Corporation for their Newnes Oil Shale mine. Surveying and construction was overseen by Henry Deane. The line opened in 1907 and closed in 1932. It was primarily intended to carry goods to and from the mine, but also provided passenger services. The New South Wales Division of Australian Railway Historical Society published The Shale Railways of New South Wales in 1974 which includes a detailed history of this line. Allan Watson, the Lessee of the old Newnes Hotel, has a comprehensive website here. The steep 1 in 25 (4%) gradients along the descent towards Newnes required a different type of steam locomotive. 4 Shay locomotives were imported from the Lima Locomotive Works in the USA. Although rather slow, their unique build which uses crankshafts to propel the wheels made them very suitable, and if a train had to stop on a steep uphill grade, the train could easily start again and keep moving. After the line closed, part of its route was used by a section of the pipeline that carried refined petroleum from the Glen Davis Shale Oil Works to Newnes Junction. In 1940-1941, the rails were lifted; most were shipped to North Africa for use as anti-tank traps and gun emplacement reinforcements but some of the bullhead rails were reused for structures and supports of the oil pipeline. Other iron fittings from the line were used as scrap for munitions.

For example, Minorities in Business Insider became part of Federal & Foundation Assistance Monitor, as did Youth Crime Alert and Workplace Discrimination Alert. Healthcare Disparities Report became part of Community Health Funding Report, as did Disabilities Funding Report and Substance Abuse Funding News. Other CD Publications news products include: Aging News Alert, Children and Youth Funding Report, Private Grants Alert, Native American Report, and Community Development Digest. In February 2011, the company's oldest publication, Housing Affairs Letter, celebrated its 50th anniversary. In December 2013, the Gerecht family relinquished ownership of the company, selling it to Eli Global Research of Durham, North Carolina. Today, the company operates as CD Publications Group, a division of Eli Global. Rogers continues to serve as its managing editor. =Acquisitions= In late 1996, LRP Publications (Hotsham, PA) sold Serving Elderly Clients, which CD Publications folded into the newly launched Senior Law Report. In late 1999, CD Pubs bought The Maturing Marketplace from Silver Spring-based Business Publishers, Inc., and folded it into Selling to Seniors, which at the time was edited by Allison Patterson. BPI then sold Federal Research Report in January 2001 (according to one report), which CD Pubs added to Federal Assistance Monitor. The company acquired Inside Housing from Housing Ink, also of Silver Spring, in mid-2001 and merged it into Housing Market Report, the report which also gained the readership of Construction News when that title was bought from Evans Publishing of Portland, Oregon, in December 2004. In the second half of 2004, CD Publications acquired Health Grants & Contracts Weekly from LRP Publications of Palm Beach Gardens, Florida, and folded it into the twice- monthly Community Health Funding Report. In Fall 2006, the company acquired Native American Report and Native American Law Report from Eli Research and combined them into Native American Report. It also acquired Child Protection Report from the same group. =Sales, cancellations, internal mergers= In late 2006, Managing Housing Letter was merged with Landlord Law Report (est. 1998) to form Landlord Law & Multi-housing Report. Around the same time, Child Protection Report was folded into Children & Youth Funding Report, following an attempt to promote the former publication on its own. In January 2007, Aid For Education Report, Disability Funding Report and Substance Abuse Funding News were converted to online-only publications in an attempt to lower costs and save them from cancellation. However, by mid year, DFN had been folded into SAF to create Substance Abuse & Disability Services Report, and AFE was folded into Federal Assistance Monitor (higher ed) and Children and Youth Funding Report (K-12). As part of the same deal in which the company acquired NAR and CPR, CD Publications sold Homeland Security Funding Report to Eli. In September 2010, however, the company reprised its coverage of security-related issues with the creation of Public Safety Funding Report. One year later, that publication was folded into Community Development Digest.

Practice Some younger men who were sealed by the law of adoption were called \\"sons\\" and took the surname of the older man, whom they called their \\"father\\". In the law of adoption, \\"the sons were to give to the fathers the benefit of their labor while the fathers offered their children not only some measure of security but counsel and direction in the world as well.\\" One sociological reason for the practice was because \\"[a]t this early stage in the church's history the membership was dominated by adult converts, whose new religious beliefs and westward migration with the Saints often estranged them from their birth families. Intra-church adoption in some measure compensated for this.\\" History =Early references to the \\"law of adoption\\"= The first known use of the term \\"law of adoption\\" within Mormon doctrine was by apostle Parley P. Pratt; however, the doctrine Pratt referred to was not a sealing ordinance, but rather the means whereby Mormons, through baptism, were said to obtain a birthright as an \\"adopted\\" son of God and a member of the heavenly kingdom. There is no surviving evidence that the \\"law of adoption\\" sealing practice was taught by Joseph Smith or his contemporaries prior to Smith's death in 1844. However, adoptions appeared on the records of the Nauvoo Temple in 1846, and scholars generally assume that the practice was instituted by Brigham Young. =Brigham Young= Brigham Young had been sealed by the law of adoption to Joseph Smith, and in January and early February 1846 (before leaving for the Rocky Mountains on 15 February 1846), Young was sealed to 38 young men by the law of adoption in the Nauvoo Temple. On February 23, 1847, Young \\"went to see Joseph\\" in a dream and Young said that he spoke with Smith about the law of adoption.Manuscript History of Brigham Young, February 23, 1847. On April 6, 1862, Young said of the law of adoption: \\"By this power men will be sealed to men back to Adam, completing and making perfect the priesthood from this day to the winding up scene.\\"Journal of Discourses, volume 9, page 269. It is reported by Young's grandson, Kimball Young (chairman of the Department of Sociology at Northwestern University) that Brigham Young stated in a letter that there will be a future time \\"when men would be sealed to men in the priesthood in a more solemn ordinance than that by which women were sealed to men, and in a room over that in which women were sealed to man.\\" =Wilford Woodruff= Wilford Woodruff, the fourth president of the LDS Church, stated in August 1896 that between 1843 and 1894 he \\"officiated in adopting 96 men to men\\".Wilford Woodruff's Journal 1833‚Äì1898, typescript, edited by Scott G. Kenney, 1985, Volume 9, page 408. Woodruff also stated that by 1885, he had \\"had 45 persons adopted to me\\".Wilford Woodruff‚Äôs Journal 1833‚Äì1898, typescript, edited by Scott G. Kenney, 1985, volume 8, p. 352. Woodruff recorded in his diary that when the sealing rooms of the St. George Temple were dedicated in January 1877, Woodruff‚Äîwho was the temple president‚Äîadopted two couples to Brigham Young.Diary of Wilford Woodruff, 22 March 1877. Of the seventeen LDS Church apostles who died in the faith prior to 1894, fourteen had persons adopted to them. =Problems= The practice fell into disrepute partly because \\"in a few cases it led to jealousy and conflict between sons for their adoptive father's attentions, and because it had in some other cases caused a scramble for status between potential sons seeking adoption by higher-ranking elders, and between elders by accumulating large numbers of adoptive sons\\". Another factor was that after the settlement of Utah Territory, \\"fewer members of the church arrived separated from their birth families (because they were born into the church)\\". =Placed in abeyance= In a church general conference address on April 8, 1894, Wilford Woodruff stated that \\"I have not felt satisfied, nor has any man since the Prophet Joseph Smith who has attended to the ordinance of adoption in the temples of our God. We have felt there was more to be revealed on this subject than we have received ‚Ä¶ and the duty that I want every man who presides over a Temple to see performed from this day henceforth, unless the Lord Almighty commands otherwise, is let every man be adopted to his father.\\" Thus, as of 1894, the practice of the law of adoption ceased in the LDS Church. Significance today There is no evidence to suggest that homosexual sex was involved as part of the original practice of the law of adoption in the 19th century.It has been speculated in gay magazines that the law of adoption was promulgated in order that 19th-century gay and bisexual Mormons would have a sexual outlet when polygamous Mormon males had monopolized the supply of available women. See \\"Another Look at History: Homosexuality on the American Frontier\\" by Jim Kepner, In Touch magazine, Number 16, February‚ÄìMarch 1975, pages 30-32 However, beginning in the 1970s, some members of Affirmation: Gay and Lesbian Mormons began to suggest that the leadership of the LDS Church should restore the law of adoption in order to allow same-sex couples to be sealed to each other in the temple in a kind of quasi-celestial marriage. It has been argued that this would preserve the primacy of heterosexual marriage but would allow an ecclesiastical equivalent of homosexual civil unions‚Äîa homosexual ecclesiastical union. The LDS Church did not respond directly to these suggestions, but continues to oppose homosexual behavior and same-sex marriage. The restoration of the law of adoption was implemented when some members of Affirmation in 1985 established the Restoration Church of Jesus Christ (commonly referred to as the \\"Gay Mormon Church\\") and the First Presidency of that church restored the law of adoption, citing it as the theological justification for their practice of homosexual celestial marriage.

These programs are designed to build strength and fitness through a variety of types of exercise. The activities and format may be loosely modeled on aspects of fitness training used in the military and the trainers themselves may be former military personnel. Indoor and outdoor boot camp workouts became popular in the United States in the late 1990s. Fitness boot camps as outdoor group fitness classes grew in popularity in the 2000s. These originated independently in Australia, the United States, the United Kingdom, and Canada.  History  Military forces have emphasized fitness since ancient times. In 1860, Archibald MacLaren opened a gymnasium at the University of Oxford, England and instituted a training regimen for 12 military officials at the university. This regimen was assimilated into the training of the British Army, which formed the Army Gymnastic Staff in 1860 and made sport an important part of military life. The term \\"boot\\" originates from U.S. Navy and Marine recruits in the Spanish‚ÄìAmerican War (1898) who wore leggings called boots; these recruits were trained in \\"boot\\" camps. Military-style training was used in the nineteenth century to rehabilitate civilian prisoners in the United States and for U.S. military prisoners during World War 2. Dr. Bill Orban developed the Royal Canadian Air Force Exercise Plans in 1961, a fitness plan for military personnel that sold 23 million copies to the public. U.S. Air Force Colonel Kenneth Cooper's wrote Aerobics in 1968 and a mass-market version The New Aerobics in 1979. These publications by Orban and Cooper helped to launch modern fitness culture. Correctional boot camps were used in New Zealand from 1971 to 1981 and in the United States since 1983. A recreational \\"Boot Camp Workout\\" audio compact cassette recorded by a U.S. Marine Corps drill instructor was released in 1984. Indoor \\"boot camp workouts\\" at health clubs around the U.S. were popular in 1998. Fitness boot camps as outdoor fitness group classes developed independently in Australia in 1991 (Original Bootcamp), the United States in the 1990s, the United Kingdom in 1999 (British Military Fitness), and Canada in 2001 (The Original Boot Camp). Outdoor group fitness classes such as these have been growing in popularity ever since and have become a distinct commercial market within the fitness industry. In the United States, the television series Boot Camp aired in 2001. In the United Kingdom, reality television program Celebrity Fit Club, which involved boot camp-style fitness, aired from 2002‚Äì2006. The series was brought over to the United States in 2005 as Celebrity Fit Club which aired until 2010.  Format  Boot camp training often commences with dynamic stretching and running, followed by a wide variety of interval training, including lifting weights/objects, pulling rubber TRX straps, pushups/situps, plyometrics, and various types of intense explosive routines. Sessions usually finish with yoga stretching. Many other exercises using weights and/or bodyweight, similar to CrossFit routines, are used to lose body fat, increase cardiovascular efficiency, increase strength, and help people get into a routine of regular exercise. Many programs offer nutrition advice as well. It is called \\"boot camp\\" because it trains groups of people, may be outdoors and may involve physical training similar to that used by the military or activities borrowed from military basic training. The term \\"boot camp\\" is currently used in the fitness industry to describe group fitness classes that promote fat loss, camaraderie, and team effort. They are designed to push people a little bit further than they would normally push themselves in the gym alone. Boot Camps are sometimes organized outdoors in parks using bodyweight exercises like push-ups, squats, suspension training and burpees, interspersed with running and competitive games. The idea is that everyone involved works at their own pace as they team up and work towards one goal, either in pairs, small teams of three or four, or even two teams head on. Boot camps provide social support for those taking part. This provides a different environment for those exercisers who get bored in a gym and so find it hard to develop a habit of exercise. Participants make friends and socialize as they exercise, although how strict the trainers or drill instructors in charge can be will depend on the company running the camp. Members of fitness boot camps are usually tested for fitness on the first day and then retested at the end of the camp, which usually runs for between 4 and 6 weeks. Fitness boot camps are often based on the military style of training, although that has started changing over the last few years. An advantage of a boot camp is that the large group dynamic will often help motivate the participants. A growing trend in fitness boot camps are the indoor locations which prove to be climate proof and provide a better workout environment for the members. Additionally, some camps include extracurricular fitness activities off-site. There are many other benefits of a fitness boot camp, which includes mental health. It has long been known that regular aerobic exercise can help to reduce high blood pressure, hypertension and combat stress. Part of this is due to the release of endorphins, which act as a mood elevator. Some \\"Holistic Bootcamps\\" provide the mental coaching required to sustain motivation after people leave the camp. Themed fitness bootcamps often consist of the use of one particular training implement to the exclusion of others. Kettlebells are the preferred tool for kettlebell fitness bootcamps run by RKC instructors and TRX suspension trainers are the preferred tools for TRX instructors. Boxing themed fitness bootcamps often use heavy bags. The use of themes varies widely between fitness bootcamps and their instructors according to the preferences between the instructor and the needs and likes of the clientele.

Description Reaching a maximum size of and , Acanthurus chirurgus gets its common name for the structures called \\"scalpels\\", which are found on either side of the caudal peduncle. The \\"scalpel\\" is used during fights with other doctorfish and as a defense mechanism against predators. Its coloration generally varies from blue-gray to dark brown. 10 to 12 vertical bars are always present, but often faint. The edges of the caudal, dorsal, and anal fins are blue. There is also a faint blue ring that can be seen encircling the \\"scalpel\\" on either side. There is a black morph, as well, but it is neither a subspecies nor a regional mutation. It has only been documented a limited number of times. Range and habitat The fish is typically found among rocky outcrops and coral reefs. Its distribution includes the Atlantic from Massachusetts to Brazil, and the tropical west coast of Africa. It has the largest distribution of its genus of 38 species.Acanthurus chirurgus (Bloch, 1787). Fishbase Behavior Acanthurus chirurgus spends its daylight hours grazing on algae and organic detritus. Its teeth are specially shaped for scraping algae and plant matter from rocks. Because it swallows its food whole, it has a gizzard-like organ in the intestine filled with particles of sand which help to grind food before it starts the digestive process. Spawning occurs during evening hours in a group event. Each egg is less than a millimeter in diameter and contains a small amount of oil for flotation. The translucent, plankton-like larvae hatch within 24 hours of fertilization. They are laterally compressed and diamond- shaped with large eyes and pectoral fins. Many body parts, such as scales and the dorsal and anal fins, do not develop until the larvae have reached 2‚Äì6 mm in length. The \\"scalpel\\" does not appear until they are about 13 mm long. As the \\"scalpel\\" grows, the anal and dorsal spines shrink. Once the fish reaches around 25 mm in length, it moves to the bottom where it continues to grow, eventually reaching sexual maturity in roughly nine months.

On October 14, 2005, the southern wing of Court Hall was renamed Bauer Hall in response to a generous donation of $10 million to the University by Robert and Virginia Bauer (Class of 1940 and ‚Äô42 respectively). On October 12th 2006, the middle wing of Court Hall was renamed Kay Hall, also in response to a donation of $10 million by Bill Kay (Class of 1951). Court-Kay-Bauer Halls, as well Mews Hall, were built as a part of the North Campus Housing Initiative, and are being renamed in order to fund construction of new upper-classmen residence halls on Cornell‚Äôs West Campus. The money generated from the renaming of Court Hall has been put towards the estimated $248 million development of West Campus. Bauer Hall is the section south of the bridge, Kay Hall is the section north of the bridge, and Court Hall is the section perpendicular to Kay Hall. Structure The CKB Community is a four-story building with a modern structure. The first floor of each of the three residences contains community space, in addition to housing one faculty- resident and the Residence Hall Director, while the top three floors are strictly residential. The three halls (Court, Kay and Bauer) are connected by a ‚Äúsky-bridge‚Äù which is enclosed on the second and third floors, and open to the elements on the fourth floor. Each residential floor houses 30 students and one Resident assistant (RA) for a total of 270 first-year students and 9 resident advisors. Court-Kay-Bauer has both single and double occupancy dorm rooms. Sustainability was a major concern of the architects of Court Hall. Their goal was to build a residence that could be environmentally responsible during both construction and post-construction. The result was a modern structure with extremely efficient insulation with a balance of window to wall space to maximize visibility during daytime hours. Court Hall, as well as Mews Hall and Appel Commons, require minimal lighting during the daytime due to the integration of large panel windows into their structure. The building is smoke-free. Single rooms are typically 8'0\\" x 13'0\\", while double rooms are typically 11'6\\" x 16'0\\". Facilities Cornell students often refer to the Court‚ÄìKay‚ÄìBauer Community as the ‚ÄúCourt-Resort‚Äù because, in comparison to many of Cornell‚Äôs other freshmen residence halls, Court Hall is modern, bright, cheerful, and climate controlled. CKB is the newest residence hall on North Campus. Floors are coed, while suites are not. Each single-sex open suite contains two double rooms, one single room, and a bathroom with one shower, one toilet, and two sinks. Each floor contains both a study lounge, and a recreation (social) lounge with a television and a kitchen. A typical room contains (per person) an extra-long twin bed, a desk, a desk lamp, a desk chair, a dresser, a bookcase, a waste basket, a closet and high-speed internet access. The Bauer Hall lounge on the first floor contains a Billiard table as well as a ping-pong table, while the Kay Hall lounge contains a piano and a large projection television. A sample room number would be 212A in which the first digit corresponds to the floor number, while the next two digits refer to the section of the building and the final letter representing a room within a suite of three. Community The first floor of Court, Kay and Bauer Halls includes a large kitchen, laundry facilities, vending machines, a bike storage room, and lounges designed for studying as well as leisure. The Community Action Board is a group of students, along with two Resident Advisors, that plans activities for the freshmen residents. Past activities include coffee house socials, ice cream socials, and movie nights. Traditions in the fledgling Court-Bauer Community are the Ice Cream Crawl, participation in Cornell's Relay for Life, the yearly induction of graduating seniors who lived in Court-Bauer during their first year, and weekly Creation Stations. Since its inception in 2001, Court Hall has been known to have an informal, friendly rivalry with Mews Hall.

Route description KY 237 begins at an intersection with KY 536 (Mount Zion Road) in Florence. The route heads to the northwest as Gunpowder Road, running along the east bank of the south fork of Gunpowder Creek to the community of Sugartit, where KY 237 intersects US 42/US 127. The road continues to the northwest as Pleasant Valley Road until it reaches Camp Ernst Road in Burlington. KY 237 turns north, running along Camp Ernst Road and passing through residential areas prior to intersecting KY 18 and becoming North Bend Road, the name KY 237 retains to its northern terminus. North of KY 18, KY 237 passes directly west of the Cincinnati-Northern Kentucky International Airport and intersects Interstate 275 northwest of the airport in Hebron. Past I-275, KY 237 heads northward through less populated areas before terminating at KY 8. Camp Ernst Middle School is located directly on this route(Camp Ernst Rd. portion.) Stephens Elementary School and North Pointe Elementary (North Bend Rd. portion) are both located directly along this route, while a collection of other Boone County schools (Conner High School, Conner Middle School, Goodridge Elementary School and Thornewilde Elementary) are located less than a mile off this route.

He was the Tampa's first mayor of \\"Latin\\" (specifically Italian) descent, having been born and raised in the immigrant neighborhood of Ybor City. Early life and career Nick Nuccio was the son of Sicilian immigrants who were among the first to populate Ybor City. As was common at the time, he left school after the 8th grade to help support his family, taking a job in the Tampa shipyards during World War I. After the war, Nuccio dabbled in real estate and insurance, then became a clerk in the Ybor City post office.Nick Chillura Nuccio - 47th and 49th Mayor of Tampa In 1929, Nuccio successfully ran for a seat on the Tampa City Council as a representative from Ybor City. He was reelected several times before moving on to the Hillsborough County Commission in 1937, a post he held continuously until 1956. While serving as chairman of the county commission, Nuccio found a novel method of increasing his local name recognition. A strong proponent of neighborhood improvements, Nuccio managed to get the words \\"Nick C. Nuccio, County Commissioner\\" stamped on every public works project he had approved. For several subsequent decades, his name was visible on sidewalks, park benches, seawalls, and virtually every other piece of concrete laid by Hillsborough County during his long tenure.1959: The natural vs. the athlete Statue of Nick Nuccio in Ybor City Mayor =Unsuccessful run= By the mid-1950s, Nuccio had built up substantial support in Tampa, especially among Latin voters in Ybor City and West Tampa, and decided to run for mayor. In 1955, he challenged incumbent Curtis Hixon, who had been in office since 1943. Hixon easily defeated Nuccio, winning reelection after national newspaper coverage alleged that Nuccio had close ties to organized crime. Hixon died in 1956 before finishing the term, and Nuccio ran for the office again against interim mayor J.L. Young. Although the Tampa Tribune again endorsed Nuccio's opponent, Nuccio won in an extremely close runoff election (50.1% to 49.9%) to become Tampa's first \\"Latin\\" mayor. =First term= While in the mayor's office, Nuccio continued his enthusiasm for public works projects and strove to keep his neighborhood constituents happy by personally helping to solve problems, believing that government's role was to \\"have a positive influence in people's lives.\\" Nuccio successfully pushed for the construction of many libraries, bridges, fire and police stations, public pools, and parks (most notably Lowry Park Zoo), among other projects, many of which are still in use today.Hillsborough: Tampa honors Nuccio Nuccio was also known for his unconventional governing style and unusual daily schedule. He regularly ate a breakfast of toasted Cuban bread and Caf√© con leche at a small cafe in West Tampa, sometimes moving on to another cafe in Ybor City later in the morning. Constituents were welcome to sit and talk with the mayor about their issues in English, Spanish, or Italian, and they often left with a promise of help from the city. These conversations could continue into lunchtime, which Nuccio usually ate in his own home, often bringing home visitors to share his wife's home-cooked meal. After lunch, Nuccio often enjoyed a short nap at home, after which the mayor would finally arrive at his downtown office, where he would stay late into the evening. =Second Term= Nuccio was immensely popular among the Latin residents of Tampa but was equally disliked by others in Tampa's \\"anglo\\" community. During his 1959 reelection campaign, challenger Julian Lane depicted him as an old-fashioned machine-era politician and easily defeated the incumbent with a pledge of \\"honest government\\" and \\"sound business practices\\". Racial unrest and problems with flooding along the Hillsborough River had damaged Lane's popularity by 1963, when he sought a second term. Nuccio came out of retirement for an electoral rematch and won a close election to regain the mayor's office. Times had changed by the late 1960s. Nuccio's personal political style was not as effective in what was Tampa's first mass-media election campaign, and he lost his 1967 reelection bid to the much younger and more media-savvy Dick Greco, Jr., another native of Ybor City whom Nuccio had long regarded as a political prot√©g√©. In 1971, Nuccio again ran against Greco for the mayor's office but was again defeated.Greco vs. Nuccio  Cigar City Magazine Despite these losses, Nuccio was still extremely popular in Tampa's Latin community in retirement. He died in 1989, and a large bronze statue of the former mayor holding his trademark hat and large Tampa cigar was dedicated in Ybor City's Centennial Park in 1999.

History Simon & Schuster had published her first book Under the Sea Wind in 1941; it was reviewed favorably but it sold poorly. Carson initially planned to call the sequel Return to the Sea, and began writing in 1948, just after hiring Marie Rodell as her literary agent.Lear, Rachel Carson, chapter 6 Carson began by writing a single chapter (what would be \\"The Birth of an Island\\") along with a detailed outline, which Rodell used to pitch the book to publishers. During research for the book, Carson met with a number of oceanographers to discuss current research. Carson and Rodell had little initial success with magazines as outlets for the islands chapter, nor for a second chapter titled \\"Another Beachhead.\\" In April 1949, with about a third of the chapters complete, Rodell began trying to find a publisher for the entire book. By June she had arranged a contract with Oxford University Press that promised completion of the manuscript by March 1, 1950. Carson continued to write and research through 1949 and into 1950, despite unexpected health and financial difficulties. In part the research involved a trip aboard a U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service ship, Albatross III. After revising the completion date, Carson completed the manuscript in June 1950. By that time, several periodicals (The New Yorker, Science Digest, and The Yale Review) were interested in publishing some of the chapters.Lear, Rachel Carson, chapter 7 Nine of fourteen chapters were serialized in The New Yorker beginning on June 2, 1951, and the book was published on July 2 by Oxford University Press. The serialization created a very large popular response, and the book was the subject of the feature review in The New York Times Book Review the day before publication. One chapter (\\"The Birth of an Island\\") was published in The Yale Review; it won the George Westinghouse Science Writing prize from the American Association for the Advancement of Science.Lear, Rachel Carson, chapter 8 Critical reception After the book's release, Carson was inundated with an unexpected volume of fan mail and media attention. She was soon the object of attention from \\"the literary crowd,\\" and because of a subsequent condensation in Reader's Digest, a broad general audience as well.

Christian House, is a house designed by Frank Lloyd Wright located in West Lafayette, Indiana. The home is an example of the Usonian homes that Wright designed. Samara was built from 1954 to 1956 and was still occupied by the original owner, John E. Christian, until he died on July 12, 2015. \\\\- \\\\- History The lounge features extensive built-ins and bright colors. In 1950 John and Kay Christian decided to build a home near Purdue University where they both worked, John as a pharmaceutical chemistry professor and Kay as the social director for the university. After much discussion, they decided that Wright was the architect who suited the ideals for their home. Not knowing how to proceed, John phoned Wright directly at his office and was surprisingly able to speak directly to the famed architect. Over the next six years they worked together both with meetings in West Lafayette, Indiana and at Taliesin, Wright's summer home in Spring Green, Wisconsin. The home was named after the samara, which Wright spotted on the property during his first visit. He worked a stylized design of chevron-shaped leaves throughout the design of the home including the clerestory windows, dining chairs and the living room rug. These designs, nicknamed The Winged Seed, are located on the perforated upper windows and were also used on the Bachman-Wilson Usonian home. The house was built to entertain the family's college students; the living room was designed for 50 people. It featured a long couch and room for sitting on the stairs. The Christian family maintains the home according to the exacting specifications of its architect. As in many of the homes he designed, Wright specified or designed the entire environment, including the furniture, linens and landscaping. The Christians were not initially able to purchase all of the specified custom details; however, they made an agreement with Wright to continue adding to the home as their budget allowed. The color palette of furniture and design details is brighter and more saturated than other examples of Wright's architecture. This was prompted by Kay Christian who requested brighter colors against Wright's wishes. Wright was finally convinced by his wife, Olgivanna Lloyd Wright, who insisted that she would help the Christians with the color design. The result was a palette of vibrant lime green, magenta, and purple combined with more subdued shades of orange, yellow, and beige (see image at left). The home was designated as a National Historic Landmark in 2015. The nomination form for the home provides a very detailed overview of the home with pictures and floor plans. It was featured in a mid-2015 exhibit at the Portsmouth Art and Cultural Center. In 2020 $1 million in grants was acquired to make repairs. https://www.jconline.com/story/news/2020/09/15/1-million-going-repair-frank- lloyd-wright-house-west-lafayette/3474239001/ See also *List of National Historic Landmarks in Indiana References * Storrer, William Allin.

The primary source for his career is Gregory of Tours. Clovis I had asked Chararic for assistance in his war against Syagrius in 486, but Chararic held back, standing off to the side and awaiting the outcome before choosing whom he would support.The Cambridge Medieval History, Vol. 2, (Henry Melvill Gwatkin et al, eds.), Macmillan, 1913, p. 110 When Clovis finally turned against Chararic, he trapped and captured him and his son. They were imprisoned and tonsured; Chararic was ordained a priest and his son a deacon. According to Gregory, when Chararic complained to his son of their dishonour, his son replied with a remark suggesting that they allow their hair to grow long. This conversation was reported to Clovis, who consequently had them killed and annexed their kingdom and treasure.Gregory of Tours, II.41 Ian Wood notes it is surprising that Clovis waited over twenty years to deal with his rivals like Chararic, writing, \\"Clovis ought to have eradicated Frankish opposition earlier in his reign.\\" However, the fact that he had Chararic tonsured clearly points to some time after Clovis' own conversion to Christianity, which Wood dates to soon after Clovis' victory over the Alemanni which was officially done in 496 A.D. Wood concludes, \\"If Gregory's ordering of events here is right, and there are no means of testing this part of his account, then the last years of Clovis' reign were concerned with the internal power politics of the Franks.\\"Wood, The Merovingian Kingdoms (London: Longman, 1994), p. 49 Other Frankish kings Clovis removed from power at this time, according to Gregory of Tours, include Ragnachar, who had supported Clovis against Syagrius, and Ragnachar's two brothers.Gregory of Tours, II.40 Before he deposed Chararic, Clovis had persuaded Chlodoric of Strassburg to assassinate his father Sigismund the lame, then had Chlodoric killed. After all these murders Gregory tells us that Clovis lamented that he was left with no family, implying that amongst these casualties were close relatives.Gregory of Tours, II.42  References  Sources *Gregory of Tours.

Wraparound was initially developed in the 1980s as a means for maintaining youth with the most serious emotional and behavioral problems in their home and community. During the wraparound process, a team of individuals who are relevant to the well-being of the child or youth (e.g., family members, other natural supports, service providers, and agency representatives) collaboratively develop an individualized plan of care, implement this plan, and evaluate success over time. The wraparound plan typically includes formal services and interventions, together with community services and interpersonal support and assistance provided by friends, kin, and other people drawn from the family's social networks. The team convenes frequently to measure the plan's components against relevant indicators of success. Plan components and strategies are revised when outcomes are not being achieved. The process of engaging the family, convening the team, developing the plan, implementing the plan, and transitioning the youth out of formal wraparound is typically facilitated by a trained care manager or ‚Äúwraparound facilitator,‚Äù sometimes with the assistance of a family support worker. The wraparound process, and the plan itself, is designed to be culturally competent, strengths based, and organized around family members‚Äô own perceptions of needs, goals, and likelihood of success of specific strategies.  History  Wraparound was initially developed in the 1980s, in recent years, however, it has been applied within many child-serving settings as a way to improve outcomes for children and adolescents with serious emotional disturbance, autism spectrum disorders and behavioral disorders. For example, it has been used as a means to facilitate permanency outcomes for youth involved in the child welfare system, to reduce recidivism for youths involved in the juvenile justice system, and to improve academic success for youths in the special educational system. During the wraparound process, a team of individuals who are relevant to the well-being of the child or youth (e.g., family members and other natural supports, service providers, and agency representatives) collaboratively develop an individualized plan of care, implement this plan, and evaluate success over time. The wraparound plan typically includes formal services and interventions, together with community services and interpersonal support and assistance provided by friends, kin, and other people drawn from the family's social networks. The team convenes frequently to measure the plan's components against relevant indicators of success. Plan components and strategies are revised when outcomes are not being achieved. The process of engaging the family, convening the team, developing the plan, implementing the plan, and transitioning the youth out of formal wraparound is typically facilitated by a trained care manager or ‚Äúwraparound facilitator,‚Äù sometimes with the assistance of a family support worker. The wraparound process, and the plan itself, is designed to be culturally competent, strengths based, and organized around family members‚Äô own perceptions of needs, goals, and likelihood of success of specific strategies. Wraparound has been implemented nationally for over 20 years and presented as a promising practice in many publications. However, specification and consistent implementation of the model has occurred only in the past few years. In some states, wraparound refers to in-home behavioral support services. The wraparound process, however, as recently specified, is conceived of a four phase process: engagement and team preparation, initial plan development, plan implementation, and transition. The full description of the activities that typically take place in each of these phases can be found in ‚ÄúPhases and Activities of the Wraparound Process,‚Äù a document available on the website of the National Wraparound Initiative.  Implementation essentials  Wraparound is intended to ensure that youth with complex needs (and multiple agency involvement) benefit from a coordinated care planning process that produces a single plan of care that cuts across all agencies and providers. Wraparound plans and wraparound teams require access to flexible resources and a well-developed array of services and supports in the community. As a result, wraparound implementation requires that the child-serving system is supportive of wraparound. Some of the key types of community and system supports include: *Community partnership: Key stakeholder groups, including agencies, providers, and representatives of youths and families have joined together in a collaborative effort to plan and implement wraparound. *Collaborative action: Stakeholders involved in the wraparound effort take concrete steps to translate the wraparound philosophy into concrete policies, practices and achievements. *Fiscal Policies: The community has developed fiscal strategies to support the wraparound effort and to better meet the needs of children and youth participating in the wraparound effort *Access to needed supports and services: The community has developed mechanisms for ensuring access to the services and supports that wraparound teams need to fully implement their plans. *Human Resource Development and Support: The system supports wraparound staff and partner agency staff to work in a manner that allows full implementation of the wraparound model. *Accountability. The community has implemented mechanisms to monitor wraparound fidelity, service quality, and outcomes, and to oversee the quality and development of the overall wraparound effort. In addition to system supports, the wraparound process requires skilled facilitators and family support partners who have the right working conditions to do their jobs. As a result, the lead agency responsible for implementing the wraparound process for families must support implementation in several key ways, including maintaining adequately low caseload sizes; ensuring that primary staff receive comprehensive training and skill development; supporting wraparound team efforts to get necessary members to attend meetings and participate collaboratively; and making timely decisions regarding funding for strategies developed by teams to meet families‚Äô unique needs.  Services that are often made available to support implementation  * Mobile therapy services Intensive psychotherapy sessions provided by a master's level therapist. These services are provided to the child and the family in non-clinical, community settings such as the home, school, or a community setting. * Behavioral specialist consulting A specialized service provided by a master's-level clinician trained in behavior strategies. The consultant works with the family, school, and others to develop a behavioral modification plan specific to each child. * Therapeutic staff support One-on- one assistance to children and families while implementing the child's individual treatment plan in the home, school or community. Support staff are supervised by the BSC. * Psychological evaluations Psychological testing service provides a comprehensive assessment of intellectual and personality functioning as an adjunct to treatment or to assist in making a differential diagnostic and treatment plan. Assessment includes but is not limited to personality, intelligence, developmental, vocational, disability and bariatric testing.  Program evaluation and evidence for effectiveness  The wraparound process has been implemented widely across the United States and internationally because of the documentation of its successful use in several communities, its alignment with the value base for systems of care, and its resonance with families and family advocates. However, the formal wraparound research base has been slow to develop because of several reasons: (1) its status as a care management process rather than a focal treatment for a specific disorder; (2) its grassroots development rather than development by a single research team; and (3) its individualized nature, in that the identified needs and specific strategies for each family participating in wraparound should be unique. Thus, at the current juncture, there is some consensus that the research base on wraparound is largely positive but that more rigorous evaluation is needed (Farmer, Dorsey, & Mustillo, (2004)). At the same time, the research base on wraparound continues to expand and evolve: * To date, positive results have been found from three published experimental studies, six published quasi-experimental studies, and numerous pre-post longitudinal studies. * The wraparound process has been cited as a promising practice in Surgeon General‚Äôs reports on both youth violence and mental health. * Since the wraparound practice model has been more fully specified, four random assignment control studies have been begun in four different locations, all with a consistent practice model and training and coaching model. Fidelity measures aligned with the wraparound model described above are also now available and in use in all the above studies. A review of outcomes studies as of 2002 is provided in Burchard, Bruns, & Burchard (2002), and is currently being updated. Other reviews and information are available at the National Wraparound Initiative website (see, for example, Suter & Bruns, 2008, at http://www.rtc.pdx.edu/NWI-book/pgChapter3.shtml). A summary table of published wraparound evaluation studies is provided at the end of this entry.  Resources  The wraparound process is not proprietary. The website of the National Wraparound Initiative includes a description of the practice model, as well as many implementation resources compiled from trainers, technical assistance providers, and program sites nationally. The NWI website also includes a list of consultants and trainers that communities and organizations may wish to access. More comprehensive examples of how wraparound has been implemented in schools can be found at the Illinois Positive Behavioral Support network website, and in Eber (2003). Information about implementation and fidelity measures for wraparound can be found at the Wraparound Evaluation and Research Team's website at. Pennsylvania's Department of Public Welfare has adopted this methodology for at risk youth.http://www.dpw.state.pa.us/ServicesPrograms/Autism/AutismRsrc/003676342.htm =Training and technical assistance= Many communities and programs have been trained and coached by experts on the wraparound process to successfully implement the wraparound process. Typical curricula include initial 4 day training sessions for staff (e.g., facilitators and parent partners) followed by shadowing of experienced staff, and in-vivo coaching. Supervisors also receive a series of human resource development activities so they can collect data about staff performance and support staff over the long term via intensive group and individual supervision, as well as ongoing coaching. =High Fidelity Wraparound= High Fidelity Wraparound utilizes a specific model of the wraparound concept. There are several different models which have been created, but they all demonstrate fidelity towards specific principles of the concept. For instance, the National Wraparound Implementation Center model of High Fidelity Wraparound specifies phases to the process of intervention with a family. It has a specific theory of change as well as a set of ten principles (family voice and choice, collaboration, team based, natural supports, community based, cultural competence, individualized services, persistence, strengths based, and outcomes based).https://www.nwic.org/ Service providers are evaluated for their fidelity to a specific model through credentialing of documents, meetings, and demonstration of concepts. The fidelity demonstrates best practices for interventions with families.  Summary of Published Controlled Studies of the Wraparound Process  STUDY 1: Randomized control study (18 months) of youth in child welfare custody in Florida: 54 in wraparound vs. 78 in standard practice foster care. References: Clark, Lee, Prange, & McDonald, 1996; Clark et al., 1998. RESULTS: Significantly fewer placement changes for youths in the wraparound program, fewer days on runaway, fewer days incarcerated (for subset of incarcerated youths), and older youths were significantly more likely to be in a permanency plan at follow-up. No group differences were found on rate of placement changes, days absent, or days suspended. No differences on internalizing problems, but boys in wraparound showed significantly greater improvement on externalizing problems than the comparison group. Taken together, the findings provided moderate evidence for better outcomes for the wraparound program; however, differences appear somewhat limited to boys and externalizing problems. STUDY 2: Matched comparison study (18 months) of youth in child welfare custody in Nevada: 33 in wraparound vs. 32 receiving MH services as usual References: Bruns, Rast, Walker, Bosworth, & Peterson, 2006; Rast, Bruns, Brown, Peterson, & Mears (in submission). RESULTS: After 18 months, 27 of the 33 youth (approximately 82%) who received wraparound moved to less restrictive environments, compared to only 12 of the 32 comparison group youth (approximately 38%), and family members were identified to provide care for 11 of the 33 youth in the wraparound group compared to only six in the comparison group. Mean CAFAS scores for youth in wraparound decreased significantly across all waves of data collection (6, 12, 18 months) in comparison to the traditional services group. More positive outcomes were also found for the wraparound cohort on school attendance, school disciplinary actions, and grade point averages. No significant differences were found in favor of the comparison group. STUDY 3: Randomized control study (18 months) of ‚Äúat risk‚Äù and juvenile justice involved (adjudicated) youth in Ohio: 73 in wraparound vs. 68 in conventional services Reference: Carney & Buttell, 2003. RESULTS: Study supported the hypothesis that youth who received wraparound services were less likely to engage in subsequent at-risk and delinquent behavior. The youth who received wraparound services did not miss school unexcused, get expelled or suspended from school, run away from home, or get picked up by the police as frequently as the youth who received the juvenile court conventional services. There were, however, no significant differences, in formal criminal offenses. STUDY 4: Matched comparison study (>2 years) of youth involved in juvenile justice and receiving MH services: 110 youth in wraparound vs. 98 in conventional MH services Reference: Pullmann, Kerbs, Koroloff, Veach-White, Gaylor, & Sieler, 2006. RESULTS: Youths in the comparison group were three times more likely to commit a felony offense than youths in the wraparound group. Among youth in the wraparound program, 72% served detention ‚Äúat some point in the 790 day post identification window‚Äù (p. 388), while all youth in the comparison group served detention. And of youth in the Connections program who did serve detention, they did so significantly less often than their peers. Connections youth also took three times longer to recidivate than those in the comparison group. According to the authors, a previous study by Pullman and colleagues showed ‚Äúsignificant improvement on standardized measures of behavioral and emotional problems, increases in behavioral and emotional strengths, and improved functioning at home at school, and in the community‚Äù (p. 388) among Connections youth. STUDY 5: Randomized control study (12 months) of youths referred to out-of-home placements for serious mental health problems in New York State: 27 to family centered intensive case management (wraparound) vs. 15 to treatment foster care. References: Evans, Armstrong, & Kuppinger, 1996; Evans, Armstrong, Kuppinger, Huz, & McNulty,1998 RESULTS: Significant group differences were found in favor of the case management/ wraparound program for behavioral and mood functioning. No differences were found, however, with respect to behavior problems (internalizing and externalizing), family cohesiveness, or self-esteem. No differences found in favor of the TFC group. Overall, small sample size plus loss of data on many of the outcome measures resulted in the study having very low power to detect differences between groups. STUDY 6: Quasi-experimental (6 months) study in Department of Defense demonstration site of youths with serious mental health issues: 71 in wraparound group vs. 40 in comparison group (study refusers/ineligible youths). Reference: Bickman, Smith, Lambert, & Andrade, 2003 RESULTS: Findings included higher utilization of ‚Äúwraparound services‚Äù (e.g., case management, in-home supports, and nontraditional services) for the demonstration group, higher costs for the demonstration group (primarily due to this group remaining in treatment longer), and no consistent differences between the groups on outcome measures (e.g., behavior, functioning, caregiver strain, perceived social support, family environment). Limitations of this study include the short time span (6 months) and whether the demonstration project truly followed the wraparound process. Authors stated the ‚Äúwrap‚Äù condition had access to informal services and flexible funding, but authors did not assess ‚Äúwrapness‚Äù and stated that, ‚Äúthere is no evidence that the content or the quality of the services were different for the Wraparound children.‚Äù (p. 151) STUDY 7: Quasi-experimental (24 months) study of youths with serious mental health issues in urban Baltimore: 45 returned or diverted from residential care to wraparound vs. 24 comparison. Reference: Hyde, Burchard, & Woodworth, 1996. RESULTS: Primary outcome was a single rating that combined several indicators: restrictiveness of youth living situation, school attendance, job/job training attendance, and serious problem behaviors. Youths received ratings of ‚Äúgood‚Äù if they were living in regular community placements, attending school and/or working for the majority of the week, and had fewer than three days of serious behavior problems during the course of previous month. At 2-year follow-up, 47% of the wraparound groups received a rating of good, compared to 8% of youths in traditional MH services. Limitations of the study include study attrition and group non-equivalence at baseline. STUDY 8: Quasi-experimental (multiple-baseline case study) of four youths referred to wraparound because of serious mental health issues in rural Michigan. Reference: Myaard, Crawford, Jackson, & Alessi (2000). RESULTS: The multiple baseline case study design was used to evaluate the impact of wraparound by assessing whether outcome change occurred with (and only with) the introduction of wraparound at different points in time. The authors tracked occurrence of five behaviors (compliance, peer interactions, physical aggression, alcohol and drug use, and extreme verbal abuse) for each of the youths. Participants began receiving wraparound after 12, 15, 19, and 22 weeks. For all four participants, on all five behaviors, dramatic improvements occurred immediately following the introduction of wraparound.

It took over one hundred years for Islam to become the majority religion.Malcolm (1994), pp. 51‚Äî55 Muslims paid much lower taxes and enjoyed widespread benefits while Christians were second-class citizens. Background Several factors appear to have been behind this process. Most important was that Christianity had relatively shallow roots in Bosnia prior the Ottoman domination. Bosnia lacked a strong Christian church organization to command a strong following‚Äîthe result of a scarcity of priests and competition among the Orthodox and Roman Catholic Churches and schismatic Bosnian Church, which collapsed shortly before the Ottomans arrived. This left most people religiously unengaged and receptive to the appeal of Islam‚Äôs institutions. This receptiveness was aided by the development among many people of a kind of folk Christianity centered on various practices and ceremonies that was adaptable to a form of folk Islam popular at the time of the invasion.Fine (2002) p. 6; Friedman (1996), pp. 16‚Äî18; Malcolm (1994) pp. 41‚Äî42; Sugar (1977) pp. 52‚Äî53 One theory as to why conversion to Islam was more prevalent in Bosnia than other places in the Balkans is that the Bosnian church practiced bogomilism. Bogomilism was regarded as a major dualistic heresy by the Catholic church and against whom Pope John XXII even launched a Crusade in 1325. Thus many adherents of the Bosnian church were more receptive to conversion to Islam. In fact, in the Bogomilian tradition, there were several practices that resembled Islam: they rejected the veneration of the Virgin Mary, repudiated the Cross as a religious symbol, they considered it as idolatry to bow down before religious images, relics or saints, and even prayed five times a day (reciting the Lord's Prayer.)Arnold (1913) p. 198‚Äî200 This theory is supported by some historians, including Sir Thomas Arnold, but other historians consider it an oversimplification. It is pointed out that Bosnians of all Christian denominations converted to Islam, including from the Catholic and Orthodox churches, not just those from the Bosnian church. Additionally, much of the population of Bosnia did not belong to the Bosnian church.Malcolm (1994) Chapter 3 Finally, under Ottoman rule there was significant religious conversion in many directions: many Catholics converted to the Orthodox church and vice versa. According to scholar Fine, the reason why conversion to Islam was more prevalent in Bosnia (and Albania) as opposed to other areas under Ottoman rule is because these areas had multiple competing churches, none of which were dominant. Thus Bosnians were less devoted Christians than other Balkanites. Economic and social gain was also an incentive to become a Muslim: conversion to Islam conferred economic and social status. Under the feudal system imposed by the Ottomans, only those who converted to Islam could acquire and inherit land and property, which accorded them political rights, a status usually denied to non-Muslims. A number of Christian nobles, however, were able to retain their estates early on in the Ottoman rule by fighting on behalf of the Empire, suggesting that holding on to their property was not a major incentive for early conversions to Islam. At a lower socioeconomic level, most new converts to Islam were able to turn their holdings into freehold farms. At the bottom of the socioeconomic ladder were the serfs, who constituted the majority of the population and were predominantly Christians. In addition, only Muslims could hold positions in the Ottoman state apparatus, which conferred special privileges and a much higher standard of living. Muslims also enjoyed legal privileges: Christians could not sue Muslims and their testimony could not be used against Muslims in court.; ; ; . The gradual conversion to Islam proceeded at different rates in various areas and among different groups. Conversion to Islam was more rapid in urban areas, which were centers of learning and of the Ottoman administration, than in the countryside. Merchants found it advantageous to convert to Islam because they gained greater freedom of movement and state protection for their goods as Muslims. Many professional soldiers also converted to Islam to ensure more rapid promotion. By the 17th century a majority of the population of Bosnia was Muslim. The various advantages and privileges that were reserved for Muslims and the large number of conversions they encouraged among the native population led to the emergence over time of a largely local Muslim ruling class that dominated political and economic power in Bosnia and Herzegovina. In the later Ottoman period, Bosnia attracted Muslim refugees from lands that were reconquered by Christian powers (mainly Croatia, Hungary and Slovenia). Some converted to Islam as a way to escape the dev≈üirme tribute (whereby the son of Christian family would be taken for military service). At the same time, some Muslim families preferred to have their sons conscripted (e.g. into the Janissary) as that gave them a chance to go to school and advance professionally.

It is his debut as a screenwriter and director. The film premiered on January 24, 2007 at the 2007 Sundance Film Festival and opened in limited release in North America on September 14, 2007. The film stars Michael Douglas as a mentally ill man who believes he has discovered buried treasure and Evan Rachel Wood as his weary daughter. Plot 16-year-old Miranda has been abandoned by her mother, and has dropped out of school. She is supporting herself as an employee at McDonald's while her father, Charlie, resides in a mental institution. When Charlie is released and sent back to their home, Miranda finds the relatively peaceful existence she's built for herself completely disrupted. Charlie has become obsessed with the notion that the long-lost treasure of Spanish explorer Father Juan Florismarte Torres is buried somewhere near their suburban California house in the Santa Clarita Valley. Armed with a metal detector and a stack of treasure-hunting books, Charlie soon finds reason to believe that the gold resides underneath the local Costco, and encourages Miranda to get a job there so that they can plan a way to excavate after hours. Initially skeptical, Miranda soon finds herself joining in Charlie's questionable antics in an effort to give him one last shot at accomplishing his dreams. After becoming involved with some swingers, Miranda then helps Charlie break into the Costco. Once inside, they drill through the floor and then into a very smelly underground river. Charlie steals some scuba diving equipment, dives into the river, and then imaginably finds the gold. He leaves Miranda a tag and tells her not to lose it. When the police arrives at the Costco, Charlie is seen to carry a small but heavy chest, hiding from the police. He then jumps into the river again, where he pursues further, sees a bright light and swims towards it. Miranda's voice from the off says that his body was never found, although Charlie is seen still alive swimming in the river after that. The next day, Miranda visits Costco and finds the product the tag belongs to, a dishwasher, buys it and brings it to the beach in her old car. When Miranda opens the dishwasher, she is seen bathed in a golden glow and a slow smile spreads across her face, a strong indication that Charlie has cached the gold inside the dishwasher, although the gold is never actually shown to the viewer. Hearing a commotion on the beach, she finds naked Chinese men coming ashore.

He turned down one offer to finance the film's production because he refused to shoot it in Albuquerque. According to Michael Douglas, King of California was filmed in only 31 days. Mike Cahill said Douglas became interested in the project simply by virtue of having been sent the script. Co- star Evan Rachel Wood remarked that Douglas frequently made the cast and crew roll over laughing at film sessions ‚Äì so much so that entire scenes had to be reshot. Release The film premiered on January 24, 2007 in Sundance Film Festival and on September 14, 2007 in United States. =Box office= At the end of box office run, King of California grossed of $268,461 in North America and $759,238 in other territories, for a worldwide total of $1,027,699.

On Metacritic, the film had an average score of 63 out of 100, based on 22 reviews, indicating \\"generally favorable reviews\\". New York Times film critic Stephen Holden described King of California as \\"a sequel of sorts\\" to One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest (1975), noting the similarity between the characters of Charlie and Randle McMurphy (played by Jack Nicholson) in the two films. Praising Michael Douglas' acting as \\"his strongest screen performance since Wonder Boys,\\" Holden concludes that King of California \\"is really a Don Quixote-like fable about nonconformity and pursuing your impossible dream to the very end.\\" Ted Fry of The Seattle Times also extolled Michael Douglas' acting as \\"one of his stronger performances.\\" Fry summed up his review calling King of California \\"a strong effort by first time writer/director Mike Cahill that will keep you bemused for its idiosyncratic voice.\\" =Home media= King of California was released on DVD in the U.K. in early June 2008.

From 1921 to 1927 he worked with Ludwig Prandtl at the \\"Aerodynamische Versuchsanstalt\\" in G√∂ttingen, witnessing a legendary period in the development of modern fluid dynamics. He received his PhD from ETH Zurich in 1927.  Academic career  After completing his PhD, Ackeret worked at Escher Wyss AG in Zurich as Chief Engineer of Hydraulics, where he applied, with great success, modern aerodynamics to the design of turbines. He became a professor of Aerodynamics at ETH Zurich in 1931 where Wernher von Braun was one of his students.  Research  Ackeret was an expert on gas turbines and was known for his research on propellors and on high-speed propulsion problems. When he was at ETH Zurich, he actively participated in the solution of practical engineering problems, such as the design of variable-pitch propellers for ships and airplanes. His most important invention was the gas turbine with a closed circuit. He made the invention together with C. Keller. Ackeret also contributed significantly to research in supersonic aerodynamics.

This is achieved by directing network traffic from hosts located on the same subnet but at different locations to an upstream gateway device. This provides security at Layer 2 since no traffic is able to pass directly between the hosts. MACFF is suitable for Ethernet networks where a layer 2 bridging device, known as an Ethernet Access Node (EAN), connects Access Routers to their clients. MACFF is configured on the EANs. MACFF is described in RFC 4562, MAC-Forced Forwarding: A Method for Subscriber Separation on an Ethernet Access Network. Allied Telesis switches implement MACFF using DHCP snooping to maintain a database of the hosts that appear on each switch port. When a host tries to access the network through a switch port, DHCP snooping checks the host‚Äôs IP address against the database to ensure that the host is valid. MACFF then uses DHCP snooping to check whether the host has a gateway Access Router. If it does, MACFF uses a form of Proxy ARP to reply to any ARP requests, giving the router's MAC address. This forces the host to send all traffic to the router, even traffic destined to a host in the same subnet as the source. The router receives the traffic and makes forwarding decisions based on a set of forwarding rules, typically a QoS policy or a set of filters.

Some possible places of origin are: * Pompeyo Falc√≥, a Roman consul * a Scandinavian prince, who arrived in Spain about 1080 * a prince of Sulcia, called Falc√≥n, who ruled the island of Candia, near Venice, Italy and who married a daughter of King Camirto of Dacia A possible beginning of the patronymic derivation of Falcon is Saint Falc√≥n, who died in 1147, and is attributed with the popularization of the given name. Another is the Italian surname Falc√≥ and Falc√≥ne, which could easily have become Falc√≥n in Spain. In the coastal area of Languedoc, Girona and Ibiza there are areas known as Falc√≥, which may account for the surname in Catalonia, Balears and Valencia. By 1500, several Languedoc families using the name Faucon came from a Falconi family from Florence, Italy. Among the oldest of Valencia's historical Falcons is Micer Rodrigo Falcon recorded in 1441 as the Chancellery of Aragon. He obtained ownership of the plaza of vice-chancellor in 1460. His nephew was the famous doctor of law, Micer Damian Andres Falcon, noted to be \\"of much eloquent in speech\\".\\"Diccionario hispano\\" www.family-crests.org (Spanish) In British records, the name was brought into England during the Norman Invasion of 1066. The name Faukonarii is mentioned who worked at Carnarvon Castle in 1282, earning 6d per day in the summer, and 5d in the winter. In 1273, Richard le Faulconer was recorded in Huntingdonshire and William Falconer was documented during the reign of Edward III. In the Yorkshire Poll Tax of 1379, a Geoffrey Faulconer was listed. In some cases this name may have also been an occupational name for a man who worked the 16th-century piece of artillery named after the bird of prey.\\"Falcon Coat of Arms / Falcon Family Crest\\" www.4crests.com Historical migrations The Falcon surname from which most of the bearers in the southern US and the Caribbean descend comes from cities in the regions of Extremadura and Andalusia, in Spain. In 1508, Diego Falcon, originally from Montehermoso, Extremadura, Spain, left for Gran Canaria shortly after it was conquered by the Spanish. He lived on the island with his wife Maria Dominquez and his daughter Leonor. He was captain of the Spanish military infantry there and royal mayor of Teror, Gran Canaria. Almost all Falcon families which trace back to the Gran Canaria, including Cuba, Florida, Louisiana and Venezuela are descendant from Diego. Marcos Alonzo Garza Y del Arcon Falcon was born around 1560 in Lepe, Andalusia, Spain. serving the military and married in 1585 to Juana de Trevi√±o from a prominent Mexico City military family. His assignments took the family to Durango and Zacatecas where his duties were supervising the mining of silver and gold.

Located on an estuary of the Ciliwung River, on the northwestern part of Java, the area has long sustained human settlement. Historical evidence from Jakarta dates back to the 4th century CE, when it was a Hindu settlement and port. The city has been sequentially claimed by the Indianized kingdom of Tarumanegara, the Hindu Kingdom of Sunda, the Muslim Sultanate of Banten, and by Dutch, Japanese and Indonesian administrations. The Dutch East Indies built up the area before it was taken during World War II by the Empire of Japan and finally became independent as part of Indonesia. Jakarta has been known by several names. It was called Sunda Kelapa during the Kingdom of Sunda period and Jayakarta, Djajakarta or Jacatra during the short period of the Banten Sultanate. Thereafter, Jakarta evolved in three stages. The \\"old city\\", close to the sea in the north, developed between 1619 and 1799 during the era of the VOC. The \\"new city\\" to the south evolved between 1809 and 1942 after the Dutch government took over control of Batavia from the failed VOC whose charter expired in 1799. The third was the development of modern Jakarta since the proclamation of independence in 1945. Under the Dutch, it was known as Batavia (1619‚Äì1945), and was Djakarta (in Dutch) or Jakarta, during the Japanese occupation and the modern period.See also Perfected Spelling System as well as Wikipedia:WikiProject Indonesia/Naming conventionsLesson: Old Indonesian Spellings. StudyIndonesian. Retrieved on 2013-07-16. For a more detailed history of Jakarta before the proclamation of Indonesian independence, see Batavia, Dutch East Indies. Early kingdoms (4th century AD) The coastal area and port of Jakarta in northern West Java has been the location of human settlement since the 4th century BCE Buni culture. The earliest historical record discovered in Jakarta is the Tugu inscription, which was discovered in Tugu sub-district, North Jakarta. It is among the oldest inscriptions in Indonesian history. The area was part of the Indianized kingdom of Tarumanagara. In AD 397, King Purnawarman established Sunda Pura, located on the northern coast of West Java, as the new capital city for the kingdom. The capital of Tarumanagara kingdom was most probably located somewhere between Tugu sub-district North Jakarta and Bekasi Regency West Java. Purnawarman left seven memorial stones across the area, including the present-day Banten and West Java provinces, consisting of inscriptions bearing his name. Kingdom of Sunda (669‚Äì1527) Padr√£o of Sunda Kalapa (1522), a stone pillar sealing the Sunda‚ÄìPortuguese treaty, Indonesian National Museum, Jakarta. After the power of Tarumanagara declined, its territories became part of the Kingdom of Sunda. According to the Chinese source, Chu-fan-chi, written by Chou Ju-kua in the early 13th Century, the Sumatra-based kingdom of Srivijaya ruled Sumatra, the Malay peninsula, and western Java (known as Sunda). The port of Sunda was described as strategic and thriving, with pepper from Sunda renowned for its supreme quality. The people of the area worked in agriculture and their houses were built on wooden piles. One of the ports at the mouth of a river was renamed Sunda Kelapa or Kalapa (Coconut of Sunda), as written in Hindu Bujangga Manik, manuscripts from a monk's lontar and one of the precious remnants of Old Sundanese literature.Bujangga Manik Manuscript which is now located at the Bodleian Library of Oxford University in England, and travel records by Prince Bujangga Manik.() The port served Pakuan Pajajaran (present day Bogor), the capital of the Sunda Kingdom. By the fourteenth century, Sunda Kelapa became a major trading port for the kingdom. Accounts of 16th century European explorers make mention of a city called Kalapa, which apparently served as the primary port of a Hindu kingdom of Sunda. In 1522, the Portuguese secured Luso Sundanese padr√£o, a political and economic agreement with the Sunda Kingdom, the authority of the port. In exchange for military assistance against the threat of the rising Islamic Javan Sultanate of Demak, Prabu Surawisesa, king of Sunda at that time, granted them free access to the pepper trade. Portuguese who were in the service of the sovereign made their homes in Sunda Kelapa. Banten Sultanate (1527‚Äì1619) Jayakarta in 1605 prior the establishment of Batavia. To prevent Portuguese gaining a foothold on Java, Fatahillah, on behalf of the Demak attacked the Portuguese in Sunda Kelapa in 1527 and succeeded in conquering the harbour on 22 June, after which Sunda Kelapa was renamed Jayakarta. Later, the port became a part of the Banten Sultanate, located west from Jayakarta. By the late 16th century, Jayakarta was under the rule of the Sultanate of Banten. Prince Jayawikarta, a follower of the Sultan of Banten, established a settlement on the west banks of the Ciliwung River, erecting a military post to control the port at the mouth of the river. Dutch Batavia (1610-1942) =Dutch East India Company (1610‚Äì1800)= Dutch mercantile activity to East Indies commenced in 1595. Over the next 25 years there was contention between the Dutch and British on the one hand, and between the Sultanate of Banten and Prince Jayawikarta on the other. In 1602, the Dutch government granted a monopoly on Asian trade to the Dutch East India Company ( (VOC); literally United East Indian Company).Drakeley S. The History of Indonesia. Greenwood, 2005. de Vries J, van der Woude A. The First Modern Economy. Success, Failure, and Perseverance of the Dutch Economy, 1500‚Äì1815. Cambridge University Press, 1997. In 1603, the first permanent Dutch trading post in Indonesia was established in Bantam, West Java. In 1610, Prince Jayawikarta granted permission to Dutch merchants to build a wooden godown and houses on the east bank of the Ciliwung River, opposite to Jayakarta. This outpost was established in 1611.Ricklefs MC. A History of Modern Indonesia since c.1200. MacMillan, 2nd edition, 1991ISBN 0333576896 Batavia in 1682 The rivalry was ultimately resolved in 1619, when the Dutch established a closer relationship with Banten and militarily intervened at Jayakarta, where they assumed control of the port after destroying the existing city. The new city built on the site was officially named as Batavia on January 18, 1621, from which the Dutch East Indies eventually ruled the entire region. Batavia under VOC control was essentially a Company Town, under the authority of a governor-general in Batavia and a board of directors in Amsterdam that served the Dutch merchants in the region, predominantly the spice trade between Europe and the Moluccas. The administrative center of this new town is the Batavia Castle. During the era of the VOC, Batavia was centered on the so-called Benedenstad or \\"Lower City\\". It consisted of the walled Kota, the older harbor at Sunda Kelapa, and the Chinese quarter at Glodok. In the middle of 18th century, Batavia also included the outskirts area along the canal of the Molenvliet (now Jalan Gajah Mada and Jalan Hayam Wuruk), the Noordwijk (now Jalan Juanda), the Rijswijk (now Jalan Veteran), along Gunung Sahari, and Jacatraweg (Jalan Pangeran Jayakarta). Also included were the markets at Tanah Abang and Senen, Jakarta's oldest markets. Batavia was under VOC control until the Company went bankrupt and its charter expired in 1799. = Dutch East Indies (1800‚Äì1942) = Map of Batavia in 1897 After the Vereenigde Oost-Indische Compagnie (VOC) went bankrupt and was dissolved in 1800, the Batavian Republic nationalized its debts and possessions, expanding all of the VOC's territorial claims into a fully-fledged colony named the Dutch East Indies. Batavia evolved from the site of the company's regional headquarters into the capital of the colony. The city gradually expanded to the south. During the period, administrative buildings were relocated to the area then known as Weltevreden, e.g. south of the Koningsplein, the Waterlooplein and Rijswijk (Jalan Veteran). The area, then known as Weltevreden, which include the Koningsplein, Rijswijk, Noordwijk, Tanah Abang, Kebon Sirih, and Prapatan became a popular residential, entertainment and commercial district for the European colonial elite. The name Weltevreden lingered until 1931 when it officially became known as Batavia Centrum (Central Batavia). The period also saw development of the Pasar Baru market in the 1820s, the completion of Tanjung Priok port in 1886, the development of Menteng and Gondangdia garden city in the 1910s, and the inclusion of Meester Cornelis (now Jatinegara) into Jakarta in 1935. Japanese occupation (1942‚Äì1945) Sketch of the Japanese entry into Batavia On 5 March 1942, Batavia fell to the Japanese. The Dutch formally surrendered to the Japanese occupation forces on 9 March 1942, and rule of the colony was transferred to Japan. The city was renamed Jakarta (officially „Ç∏„É£„Ç´„É´„ÇøÁâπÂà•Â∏Ç Jakaruta tokubetsu-shi, Special Municipality of Jakarta, in accordance with the special status that was assigned to the city). To strengthen its position in Indonesia, the Japanese government issued Act No. 42 1942 as part of the \\"Restoration of the Regional Administration System\\". This act divided Java into several Syuu (\\"Resident Administration\\" or Karesidenan) that were each led by a Bupati (Regent). Each Syuu was divided into several Shi (\\"Municipality\\" or Stad Gemeente) that were led by Wedanas (\\"District Heads\\"). Below a Wedana was a Wedana Assistant (\\"Sub-district Head\\"), who, in turn, oversaw a Lurah (\\"Village Unit Head\\"), who, in turn, was responsible over a Kepala Kampung (\\"Kampung Chief\\"). A schichoo (\\"Mayor\\") was superior to all of these officials, following the law created by the Guisenken (\\"Head of the Japanese Imperial Administration\\"). The effect of this system was a \\"one-man rule\\" structure with no councils or representative bodies. The first schichoo of Jakarta was Tsukamoto and the last was Hasegawa. The economic situation and the physical condition of Indonesian cities deteriorated during the occupation, including Jakarta. Beautiful colonial buildings and hotels were converted into military barracks. Many buildings were vandalized, as metal was needed for the war, and many iron statues from the Dutch colonial period were taken away by the Japanese troops. Among the destroyed colonial landmarks during the Japanese occupation were the statue of Jan Pieterszoon Coen at Waterlooplein. In 1943, the Japanese Imperial administration slightly revised the administration of Jakarta by adding a special counseling body. This agency was composed of twelve local Javanese leaders who were regarded as loyal to the Japanese; among them were Suwiryo (who became the vice for Jakarta's schichoo) and Dahlan Abdullah. National revolution era (1945‚Äì1949) After the collapse of Japan in 1945, the area went through a period of transition and upheaval during the Indonesian national struggle for independence. During the Japanese occupation and from the perspective of the Indonesian nationalists who declared independence on 17 August 1945, the city was renamed Jakarta. After the war, the Dutch name Batavia was internationally recognized until full Indonesian independence was achieved on 27 December 1949 and Jakarta was officially proclaimed the national capital of Indonesia. Following the surrender of the Japanese, Indonesia declared its independence on 17 August 1945. The proclamation was enacted at Jalan Pegangsaan Timur No. 56 (now Jalan Proklamasi), Central Jakarta, with Suwiryo acting as the committee chairman. Suwiryo was recognised as the first mayor of Jakarta Tokubetsu Shi. The position was soon altered to Pemerintah Nasional Kota Jakarta (\\"Jakarta City National Administration\\"). On 19 September 1945, Sukarno held his Indonesian independence and anti-colonialism/imperialism speech, during Rapat Akbar or grand meeting at Lapangan Ikada, now the Merdeka Square. The grand meeting would start a period of national revolution in Indonesia.Lapangan Merdeka / Monas. Merdeka Square page on official website of Jakarta. On 29 September 1945, Anglo-Dutch troops arrived in Jakarta to disarm and repatriate the Japanese garrison. They also planned on reasserting control over the colony. On November 21, 1945, Suwiryo and his assistants were arrested by members of the Netherlands Indies Civil Administration. On 4 January 1946, Indonesian Republicans withdrew from Ally-occupied Jakarta and established the capital in Yogyakarta. War was not apparent in Jakarta and urban development continued in the city as the Dutch tried to re-establish themselves. In 1947, the Dutch succeeded in implementing a set of planning regulations for urban development‚Äîthe SSO/SVV (Stadsvormings-ordonantie/Stadsvormings- verordening)‚Äîthat had been devised prior to the war. Batavia was planned to expand with an addition of a new satellite city 8 kilometers south of the Koningsplein. This 730 ha area would become the Kebayoran satellite city, the first urban planning in Indonesia after the World War II. On 27 December 1949, the Dutch recognised Indonesia as an independent country and sovereign federal state under the name of \\"Republic of the United States of Indonesia\\". At this time, the Jakarta City Administration was led by Mayor Sastro Mulyono. Transition into a capital of an independent nation (1950s) =Expansion of city's boundary= After the recognition of Indonesian sovereignty on 27 December 1949, in March 1950, Jakarta was increased in size from 182 square kilometres to 530 square kilometres. Despite the dramatic increase in size, impact on the city's population was minimal: population of Jakarta was 1,340,625 in 1949 to 1,432,085 in 1950 to 1,661,125 in 1951. The new districts added to Jakarta at the time was sparsely populated and rural. Kebayoran Baru was still a satellite city of Jakarta and located outside the boundaries of Jakarta. The construction of thoroughfares such as Jalan Thamrin and Jalan Sudirman had been underway since 1949 and would only be opened in 1953. =City development= Glodok commercial area. The area of Kota and Glodok remained Jakarta's central business and banking district during the 1950s. Jakarta in the 1950s was more or less similar with the colonial period: banking districts were still centered in Kota around Kali Besar and Jalan Pintu Besar Utara. Chinese business hub were centered at Glodok, especially Pintu Kecil. The colonial Pasar Baru, Pasar Senen and Glodok were still the busiest markets in Jakarta. The European shopping and leisure districts were still centered at Harmoni Junction. Most colonial hotels retained their Dutch names, e.g. Hotel des Indes or Hotel Duta Indonesia, Hotel der Nederlanden or Hotel Dharma Nirmala, and Hotel des Galeries. Kemayoran airport handled both domestic and international flights. Jakarta's urban area in 1950 were enclosed within the city's railway network. Areas beyond the railway lines remained empty, e.g. Tomang and Grogol to the west, Pluit and swampy Ancol to the north. Areas to the east and northeast, e.g. the area between Jalan Gunung Sahari and Tanjung Priok remained rural (with the exception of the Kemayoran Airport). Kali Sunter (Sunter River) was in the countryside and would not be developed as residential area until the 1970s. Among new suburbs developed during the 1950s were Grogol, Tanah Tinggi, Bendungan Hilir and Pejompongan; mostly to provide housing for civic workers. Despite the slow city development, the beginning of the 1950s saw construction of infrastructure that would lay a foundation for the explosive growth of Jakarta in the 1960s. Jalan Thamrin and Jalan Sudirman were built between 1949 and 1953 to connect Central Jakarta with Kebayoran Baru. These projects are usually collaboration between Dutch and Indonesia. The first buildings that were constructed along the Thamrin-Sudirman were Bank Indonesia headquarters (1958-1962), Hotel Indonesia (1959-1962), and the Welcome Monument. AT that time, Jalan Sudirman was largely rural and devoid of any buildings until the 1970s, with the exception of Gelora Bung Karno sports complex. =Taking over Dutch assets= After recognition of Indonesian sovereignty on 27 December 1949, transition from Dutch to Indonesian leadership occurred immediately as Dutch residences and properties were taken over by the Indonesian government. Among the notable buildings conversion were: *Governor-general's palace on Jalan Merdeka Utara became Istana Merdeka presidential palace. *The Concordia military social club building on Jalan Lapangan Banteng Timur became the national parliament until early 1965. *The Volksraad (People's Council) at Jalan Pejambon, that had earlier been the military commander's residence, became the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. *The Binnenlands Bestuur administrative corps headquarters on Jalan Medan Merdeka Utara became the Ministry of Home Affairs. *The Ministry of Finance was moved to the grand Witte Huis on Jalan Lapangan Banteng Timur. *The Jakarta City Council chambers on Jalan Medan Merdeka Selatan remained the home of the Jakarta City Council, with the exception that the council was all Indonesian and under the leadership of an Indonesian mayor. The rank \\"mayor\\" would become governor in 1960. *The old STOVIA medical school became the faculty of medicine at the newly created University of Indonesia. *Colonial ANETA news agency on Jalan Antara was taken over by Indonesian owners and management between 1951 and 1955 as a forerunner of present government owned news agency, ANTARA. Despite the numerous departments converted into Indonesian control, from the economic perspective, the transition was much slower. The Dutch still owned key sectors of Indonesian economy during most of the 1950s, including banking, oil and shipping. Only in late 1957, the nationalization of Dutch assets would begin, partly triggered by the anger over the refusal of the Netherlands to transfer sovereignty of Irian Jaya to Indonesia. By 1960, almost all Dutch assets in Indonesia had been taken over and Dutch citizens were expelled from Indonesia. =Expulsion of the Dutch and population boom= Expulsion of the Dutch caused tremendous social change in Jakarta. In the middle of 1952, 48,280 foreigners (excluding Chinese) were living in Jakarta, of which 90.2% were Dutch. By the end of 1950s, only a few hundred of the Dutch stayed in Jakarta. The 1960s was regarded as a decade when foreigners were no longer a common sight on the streets of Jakarta. The departure of the Dutch also caused a massive migration of the rural population into Jakarta, in response to a perception that the city was the place for economic opportunities. The kampung areas in Jakarta swelled as a result. There were house shortages, as well the lack of schools, medical services, water and electricity. In 1951 and 1952, 25 hectares of land was opened for housing at Grogol, 25 hectares at Tanah Tinggi (just south of Kemayoran Airport) and 25 hectares at Pejompongan. Another 15 hectares at Pejompongan were set for a water purification plant. The 730 hectare satellite city of Kebayoran Baru, which was conceived by the Dutch in the 1930s, remained the most important housing development in Jakarta in the 1950s. =Infrastructure= 1950s saw the boom of the informal becak. Jakarta's tram system, which began in 1869 as horse-drawn trams, and would be developed up until the electric trams from 1899, would face competition with buses and faces financial issues. President Sukarno didn't believe trams was an effective system for Jakarta, and so gradually he began to stop the operation of the trams. By April 1960, tramlines only operated from Senen and Kramat to Jatinegara. By 1962, the tramway disappeared from Jakarta. The 1950s was known as the decade where the informal becak can be found extensively in Jakarta. Introduced to Jakarta in the 1930s, the number of becak soared in late 1940s, which occurred at the same time with the wave of immigration into Jakarta to find employment. 31,000 becaks were registered in 1953. =Proposal to relocate the capital= In the mid-1950s, driven by a sense of corruption and disproportionate government expenditure in Jakarta, there were proposals to relocate the capital. Those in support included Takdir Alisjahbana, who was unflattering in his depiction of the city. However, by 1957, these proposals were abandoned. Instead, the city's boundaries were expanded, and it became the Daerah Khusus Ibukota (DKI, Special Capital Territory), one of the provinces of Indonesia. Sukarno's nationalistic projects (1960-1965) =Monumental projects= One of the most monumental projects launched by Sukarno was the demolition of government buildings in Merdeka Square to make way for the National Monument. Dramatic changes in Jakarta's skyline occurred during the period between 1960-1965 when President Sukarno, also an architect and an urban planner, personally drove the city into a modern capital that would not only be the pride of the Indonesian nation, but would also be a \\"beacon\\" of a powerful new nation. The short period would give Jakarta many of its most famous modernist landmarks and monuments. Sukarno had already transitioned the country to \\"Guided Democracy\\" between 1957 and 1959, which greatly increased his own political power. Sukarno's great power allowed him to award the 1962 Asian Games to Indonesia, with Jakarta as the host city. The event was used as a trigger to complete new landmarks in Jakarta, and so the first half of the 1960s saw large government-funded projects that were undertaken with openly nationalistic architecture. By working on the optimistic monumental projects, Sukarno hoped to put the newly independent nation's pride on international display. Sukarno filled Jakarta with numbers of monuments. Numbers of monumental projects were conceived, planned and initiated during his administration. Some of the notable monumental projects of Sukarno during the first half of the 1960s were: Semanggi \\"clover-leaf\\" highway interchange, a broad avenue in Central Jakarta (Jalan M.H. Thamrin and Jalan Jenderal Sudirman), and Jalan Gatot Subroto; a broad by-pass connecting Tanjung Priok harbour with Halim Airport (Jalan Jenderal Ahmad Yani); four high-rise hotels, including Hotel Indonesia; a new parliament building; a stadium; Sarinah Department Store; the development of Ancol on the north coast of Jakarta to become Jakarta's main recreation complex; the largest mosque in Southeast Asia; and the widening of Jalan Thamrin and Jalan Sudirman ahead of the 1962 Asian Games. Most of Jakarta's monuments were initiated during the first half of the 1960s e.g. the National Monument, Selamat Datang Monument, Pemuda Monument at Senayan, Irian Jaya Liberation Monument at Lapangan Banteng, and the Dirgantara Monument at Pancoran. During the first half of the 1960s, government projects in Jakarta was so intense to the extent that Jakarta's citizens struggled to find cement and building materials for their own use. =New suburbs= In early 1960s, increasing use of cars allow city development outside the constrain of railway network. Several suburbs began to be developed very far from the city center. Few of such developments were Grogol to the west, which was developed as a flood-proof residential area in the 1950s but was immediately flooded in February 1960; several housings to the west of Kemayoran Airport; and new housing developments on the west of Jalan Gajah Mada (Tanah Sereal, Krukut, Krendang and Duri) and on the east of Jalan Hayam Wuruk (Mangga Besar and Sawah Besar). Several residential projects that were developed in the 1950s began to took shape in the 1960s, among them are Pejompongan (land opened in 1952), Bendungan Hilir, Setiabudi to the east of Jalan Sudirman, Tanah Tinggi (designated in 1951) and Rawa Sari (now Cempaka Putih Timur, designated in 1952). =Fall of Sukarno= Istiqlal Mosque was one of the many delayed projects of Sukarno in Jakarta. The period of monumental projects came to an immediate halt after the September 30 Movement in 1965. The incident would begin Sukarno's downfall from power. As a result, Jakarta's skyline was scarred with unfinished steel and concrete structures. A book Djakarta Through the Ages published in 1969 by the Jakarta City Government claimed: \\"Djakarta is dotted with steel skeletons and the concrete shells of unfinished buildings. There is no money to finish them. Who is able to finish and utilize these buildings?\\" Among the delayed projects of Sukarno in Jakarta were Wisma Nusantara, a 30-storey office tower meant to be the tallest in Southeast Asia but was abandoned as an unfinished steel structure from 1966 to 1971; the Istiqlal Mosque, started in 1961 but not completed until 1978; the National Parliament building, started in 1965 and completed in stages up until 1983; the Hotel Borobudur which started in 1963 but to be opened in 1974; and the Balai Sarbini and Veteran's Building complex approved in 1965 but was opened in 1973. Rise of Ali Sadikin (1966 ‚Äì late 1970s) =Improvement in infrastructure= In 1966, Ali Sadikin was elected as governor of Jakarta. He would serve as a governor of Jakarta from 1966‚Äì1977, Jakarta's longest-serving governor. Instead of focusing on monumental projects, Ali Sadikin focused his policy towards providing the basic needs of Jakarta's rapidly expanding population. Kampung improvement programs were one of his best-known projects. He repaired and build roads, provided public transport, better sanitation, health services and educational opportunities for the poor.s Among the roads that were constructed during the 1970s were Jalan Tomang Raya, which was built as a continuation of Jalan Kyai Caringin and which crossed over Jalan Letnan Jenderal S. Parman into Tanjung Duren and the new housing estate of Kebon Jeruk. At that time, the continuation of Jalan Tomang Raya was known as Jalan Arjuna, a relatively modest road which by the 1990s would be developed into the Jakarta-Tangerang- Merak toll road. Another road built in the 1970s was Jalan H R Rasuna Said. When completed, Rasuna Said, Sudirman, and Gatot Subroto formed the Golden Triangle of Jakarta, the where business, financial, and diplomatic heart of Jakarta. During this period, the first buildings appeared on Jalan Sudirman north of the Semanggi. Despite the success of the program, which won the Aga Khan Award for architecture in 1980, it was discontinued for its over-emphasis upon the improvement of only physical infrastructure. Sadikin was also responsible for rehabilitating public services, banning rickshaws, and clearing out \\"slum dwellers\\" and \\"street peddlers\\". =Completion of delayed projects= The 1970s saw the completion of projects that were begun in the 1960s by Sukarno. The early 1970s saw Jalan Thamrin become a major thoroughfare with buildings higher than 5 storeys. Jalan Sudirman was still relatively empty, except for the Gelora Bung Karno sports complex and some housing at Bendungan Hilir and Setiabudi. Monuments such as the Irian Jaya Liberation Monument, the Prince Diponegoro Monument, the Heroes Monument, and the Dirgantara Monument were completed in the early 1970s. During the late 1970s, Ancol, another project proposed by Sukarno in the early 1960s, was already well-established as the Ancol Dreamland recreational area with its Bina Ria beach, a golf course, swimming pools, an oceanarium, Putri Duyung Cottage, Hotel Horison and its casinos, a drive-in theater, and new housing developments on both sides. =Jakarta Fairs and other entertainments= In 1968, the Jakarta Fairs were initiated at Medan Merdeka, and the Taman Ismail Marzuki cultural center at Cikini was opened. Taman Ria Remaja (Youth Recreation Park) was opened in the 1970s next to the Gelora Bung Karno. =Decline of Kemayoran Airport= By 1974, a redeveloped Halim Perdanakusuma Airport became the international airport, with Kemayoran becoming a domestic- only airport. During the late 1970s, some housing west of Kemayoran Airport, such as the grid-like housing development of Pademangan, started to grow closer to the western edge of Kemayoran Airport. Economic growth (late 1970s ‚Äì 1980s) Early on during Ali Sadikin's years as governor, Suharto was elected president of Indonesia in 1967. He decided to promote foreign investment in Indonesia. Ali Sadikin ensured that Jakarta's infrastructure was able to support business opportunities and boost economic growth with the construction of the Jakarta Convention Center (1974) and several hotel projects. The 1970s saw a hotel building boom with the opening of nine major hotels: Hotel Kartika Plaza (1972), President Hotel (1973), Hotel Borobudur (1974), Hotel Ambassador/Aryaduta (1974), Hotel Sahid Jaya (1974), Hotel Kartika Chandra (1974), the Hilton Hotel (1976), Hotel Sari Pan Pacific (1976) and Mandarin Hotel (1978), as well as the extension of Hotel Indonesia in 1974. The 1970s also witnessed the redevelopment of Jakarta's two oldest markets: Pasar Senen and Pasar Tanah Abang. The Aldiron Plaza shopping center (now Blok M Square), considered to be the precursor of Jakarta's shopping malls, was opened in the mid-1970s. The situation in the 1970s encouraged the emergence of a large number of private housing projects, but government housing schemes were also implemented to cope with the growth of the urban population. 1980s‚Äìpresent 2019 Indonesian protests and riots During the 1980s, smaller land sites were acquired for high-rise projects, while larger parcels of land were subdivided for low-key projects, such as the building of new shophouses. This period also saw the removal of kampongs from the inner- city areas and the destruction of many historical buildings. One infamous case was the demolition of the Society of Harmonie and the subsequent construction of a parking lot. The period between the late-1980s and the mid-1990s saw a massive increase in foreign investment as Jakarta became the focus of a real estate boom. The investment of overseas capital into joint-venture property and construction projects with local developers brought many foreign architects into Indonesia. However, unlike the Dutch architects of the 1930s, many of these expatriate architects were unfamiliar with the tropics, while their local partners had received similarly Modernist architectural training. As a result, downtown areas in Jakarta gradually resembled those of the large Western cities; and often at a high environmental cost: high-rise buildings consume huge amounts of energy in terms of air-conditioning and other services. The economic boom period of Jakarta ended abruptly in the 1997 Asian financial crisis and many projects were left abandoned. The city became a center of violence, protest, and political maneuvering, as long-time president, Suharto, began to lose his grip on power. Tensions reached a peak in May 1998, when four students were shot dead at Trisakti University by security forces; four days of riots ensued, resulting in damage to, or destruction of, an estimated 6,000 buildings, and the loss of 1,200 lives. The Chinese of the Glodok district were severely affected during the riot period and accounts of rape and murder later emerged. In the following years, including several terms of ineffective Presidents, Jakarta was a center of popular protest and national political instability, including several Jemaah Islamiyah-connected bombings. Since the turn of the century, the people of Jakarta have witnessed a period of political stability and prosperity, along with another construction boom.

He was the eldest son of Lieutenant-General Sir William Erskine, 1st Baronet and his second wife, Frances. He succeeded to the baronetcy on his father's death in 1795.H. M. Stephens, ‚ÄòErskine, Sir William, second baronet (1770‚Äì1813)‚Äô, rev. Roger T. Stearn, Oxford Dictionary of National Biography, Oxford University Press, 2004 accessed 30 May 2008  Early career  Erskine was commissioned into the 23rd foot 1785, and transferred to the 5th Dragoons as a lieutenant in 1787, and in 1791 became captain of the 15th King's Light Dragoons (the unit his father had served in with distinction) on 23 February 1791. His first active service was in Flanders 1793‚Äì95, during the French Revolutionary Wars, when he acted as aide-de-camp to his father. In 1794 he was made lieutenant-colonel. and fought at the Battle of Villers-en-Cauchies, where a handful of English and Austrian cavalry routed a much larger force of French infantry and cavalry.Chandler, p 142 On his father's death in 1795, Erskine became baronet. He represented Fife in Parliament in 1796 and 1802‚Äì1805. Despite being \\"blind as a beetle\\", according to a fellow officer, in 1808, Erskine received promotion to major general. When he heard Erskine was being shipped to Portugal, Wellington complained that he \\"generally understood him to be a madman.\\" The administrators of the army at Horse Guards responded that, \\"No doubt he is sometimes a little mad, but in his lucid intervals he is an uncommonly clever fellow; and I trust he will have no fit during the campaign, though he looked a little wild as he embarked.\\"Glover, p 146  Peninsular War  During the 1811 campaign in Portugal, Erskine took over the command of the famous Light Division in the absence of Robert Craufurd. He soon developed a reputation for rashness. Wellington wrote, \\"It is impossible to trust to his judgment in any critical case.\\"Glover, p 347 While pursuing Marshal Andre Massena's retreating French army, several sharp actions were fought at Pombal, Redinha, Casal Novo and Foz do Arouce between the Light Division and Marshal Michel Ney's rearguard. At Casal Novo on 14 March 1811, Erskine advanced his men along the main road in fog without proper scouts. When the fog suddenly cleared, his leading elements found themselves facing elements of Jean Marchand's division deployed in line with artillery support. This carelessness cost the Light Division 155 killed and wounded, while Marchand lost only 55 men.Smith, p 356 At the Battle of Sabugal, the fog and Erskine's bungling saved General Jean Reynier's isolated French corps from destruction. Wellington assigned Erskine with the Light Division and some cavalry to cut in behind Reynier's open left flank while four divisions attacked in front. The hapless Erskine, who was very nearsighted, issued a set of foolish orders then promptly got lost in the fog with the cavalry.Glover, p 146-7 The leaderless Light Division covered itself with glory in the subsequent action, but the French escaped from Wellington's trap. During the Battle of Fuentes de Onoro, Erskine's 5th and Alexander Campbell's 6th Divisions covered the Siege of Almeida. After the French relief army was turned back, the French garrison slipped out of the fortress in the night and marched straight through the blockading force to freedom. On this occasion, an exasperated Wellington said, \\"I have never been so distressed by any military event as by the escape of even a man of them.\\"Glover, p 156 This time Erskine was only one of several officers who blundered. Aware that he could not dismiss Erskine because of the man's political influence, Wellington tried to place Erskine in positions where he could do little damage.Oman, p 151 From 19 June 1811, Erskine led four mounted regiments in the newly organized 2nd Cavalry Division in Rowland Hill's corps. He soon relinquished command, but reassumed his post on 8 April 1812.Oman, p 352, 359 Soon after, he was declared insane and cashiered. He took his own life in Lisbon in 1813 by jumping out of a window, reportedly with the last words, \\"Now why did I do that?\\".  References  * Chandler, David, Dictionary of the Napoleonic Wars.

It was first recorded in 1943 by the Queen's Hall Light Orchestra conducted by the composer. In an abridged form, it came to prominence in Australia: first as the signature tune for radio broadcasts of proceedings from the Parliament of Australia; and then as the signature tune for radio and television news broadcasts by the Australian Broadcasting Commission (ABC). It was first used for this purpose on 1 January 1952. The Majestic Fanfare replaced a short version of Advance Australia Fair that had been in use throughout World War II. Further shortening of what was already regarded as a significant national song (it would in 1984 become Australia‚Äôs official National Anthem) was regarded as somewhat sacrilegious, while shortening the apolitical Majestic Fanfare was deemed less contentious. The tune as used by the ABC exists in two formats: an 18-second version that was used for many years, and a 9-second abridged version that was usually used thereafter (although the 18-second version is still played on regional radio and on extended bulletins, such as the daily 7.45am Local Radio bulletins). On television, Majestic Fanfare was updated in 1982 to celebrate the ABC's 50th anniversary. In 1985, when ABC's evening news bulletin was replaced by The National, Majestic Fanfare was replaced by Alan Hawkshaw's Best Endeavours, then also used by Britain's Channel 4 News bulletins.75 Years of the ABC timeline In 1987, when ABC TV News was relaunched, Majestic Fanfare did not return. Since then, two Australian-composed tunes have been used. The first titled ABC TV News Theme was written in 1987 by Sydney composers Tony Ansell and Peter Wall. It was used for 19 years. The current ABC TV News theme, composed by Martin Armiger and introduced on Australia Day 2005, incorporates some prominent elements of the original Majestic Fanfare.\\"ABC Launches a new look 7pm TV news\\" - ABC Media ReleaseABC hasn't changed its tune, says composer - Sydney Morning Herald Originally, it was planned that the new 2005 theme would replace Majestic Fanfare on radio bulletins as well, but the plan did not proceed. A radio news inquiry later that year recommended that Majestic Fanfare should be either replaced or updated.Brassed off at the ABC - The Australian In 1988, in accordance with the recommendation, and also to help celebrate the Australian Bicentenary, the ABC commissioned the Australian composer Richard Mills to re-orchestrate the tune in a more modern, Australian idiom. His arrangement was recorded by the Sydney Symphony Orchestra under Stuart Challender, at the Sydney Opera House. In the early 2000s, Mills' original pencil-written manuscript for the full and two abridged versions of the theme was donated to the music library of the University of Melbourne.University of Melbourne Library entry for the ABC News theme Majestic Fanfare in the Mills arrangement is still used for radio news broadcasts.

LASMO had entered Libya in 1990 with the Korean consortium named PEDCO and carried out the initial exploration programme of geological fieldwork, 2500 km of seismic acquisition and the drilling of four wildcat wells that led to two oil discoveries in 1993-94. This initial success ensured the viability of further exploration in the area and therefore the pursuit of the Elephant Prospect. The LASMO-PEDCO exploration team had identified the Elephant feature on its extensive seismic database and negotiated with the Libyan NOC to extend the concession area to include the entire prospect.

He was elected to the South Australian House of Assembly from the electorate of Elizabeth in the 1973 South Australian election, when he was 28. In state parliament Duncan served as 41st Attorney-General of South Australia from 1975 until 1979, and then as Minister for Health until the defeat of the Corcoran Labor government at the 1979 election. He resigned from state politics in 1984, sparking an Elizabeth by-election, to contest the seat of Makin in the 1984 Australian election, which he held at every election until defeated when Labor lost office federally in 1996. Duncan was Minister for Land Transport and Infrastructure Support for the last half of 1987 and Minister for Employment and Education Services for over three years from 1988 to 1990. After leaving the ministry in 1990, he became Parliamentary Secretary to the Attorney-General in December 1991, a post he held until Labor lost office. Duncan had a business career after politics, which became a source of controversy when he was charged in September 2007 with 'making an untrue statement in application for a Commonwealth grant and with dishonestly causing loss to a Commonwealth entity'.

A mural instrument is an angle measuring device mounted on or built into a wall. For astronomical purposes, these walls were oriented so they lie precisely on the meridian. A mural instrument that measured angles from 0 to 90 degrees was called a mural quadrant. They were utilized as astronomical devices in ancient Egypt and ancient Greece. Edmond Halley, due to the lack of an assistant and only one vertical wire in his transit, confined himself to the use of a mural quadrant built by George Graham after its erection in 1725 at the Royal Observatory, Greenwich. Bradley's first observation with that quadrant was made on 15 June 1742.Robert Grant, History of Physical Astronomy from The Earliest Ages to the Nineteenth Century (1852) pp. 483-484. The mural quadrant has been called the \\"quintessential instrument\\" of 18th century (i.e 1700s) observatories. It rose to prominence in the field of positional astronomy at this time. Construction Bird Mural Quadrant was for many years the main instrument of the Mannheim Observatory in Germany, shown here installed. Many older mural quadrants have been constructed by marking directly on the wall surfaces. More recent instruments were made with a frame that was constructed with precision and mounted permanently on the wall. The arc is marked with divisions, almost always in degrees and fractions of a degree. In the oldest instruments, an indicator is placed at the centre of the arc. An observer can move a device with a second indicator along the arc until the line of sight from the movable device's indicator through the indicator at the centre of the arc aligns with the astronomical object. The angle is then read, yielding the elevation or altitude of the object. In smaller instruments, an alidade could be used. More modern mural instruments would use a telescope with a reticle eyepiece to observe the object. Many mural quadrants were constructed, giving the observer the ability to measure a 90¬∞ range of elevation. There were also mural sextants that read 60¬∞. Mural quadrants of the 17th century were noted for their expense, with Flamsteed's costing 120 pounds (1689), and Edmund Halley's costing over 200 pounds (1725). 120 pounds of 1689 converted to the 2019 U.S. dollars can be estimated at over 30,000 USD, and 200 pounds of 1725 to over 50,000 USD. The large fixed quadrants were more expensive than a typical portable quadrant, with a Bird 2-foot quadrant costing 70 guineas. Usage In order to measure the position of, for example, a star, the observer needs a sidereal clock in addition to the mural instrument. With the clock measuring time, a star of interest is observed with the instrument until it crosses an indicator showing that it is transiting the meridian. At this instant, the time on the clock is recorded as well as the angular elevation of the star. This yields the position in the coordinates of the instrument. If the instrument's arc is not marked relative to the celestial equator, then the elevation is corrected for the difference, resulting in the star's declination. If the sidereal clock is precisely synchronized with the stars, the time yields the right ascension directly.Sidereal Time Famous mural instruments Ulugh Beg's mural sextant, constructed in Samarkand, Uzbekistan during the 15th century. *A mural sextant was constructed in Ray, Iran, by Abu-Mahmud al-Khujandi in 994. *Ulugh Beg constructed the \\"Fakhri Sextant\\" in Samarkand that had a radius of 40 meters.Ulugh Beg, Dictionary of Scientific Biography.

This memorial marked the tragedy and the burial site of a group of medical students from the King Edward VII College of Medicine, who were killed during the Second World War in Singapore. In 2005, the memorial, along with eight other historic sites of SGH, was incorporated as part of the Outram Campus Heritage Trail that allow visitors to explore the important historical landmarks that are closely linked with the history of medical education in Singapore.Singapore General Hospital, \\"Outram Campus Heritage Trail Guide\\". History =Etymology= Built in 1882, the Singapore General Hospital used to occupy the site of a Sepoy Camp (Sepoy is from the Hindi \\"Sipahi\\" for \\"Indian troops\\") of the British East India Company. As a result, the hospital grounds is known to the Chinese to this day as sipai poh, meaning \\"Sepoy plain\\" in the Hokkien dialect.Savage, \\"Sepoy Lines\\", pp. 346‚Äì347. Located nearby was the Outram Prison (now demolished), which was the site of the public executions of the 1915 Singapore Mutiny. =College of Medicine= The College of Medicine Building along College Road in Outram The College of Medicine Building, formerly known as King Edward VII College of Medicine, was opened on 15 February 1926 by Sir Laurence Nunns Guillemard, then Governor of the Straits Settlements and Patron of the College.\\"College of Medicine Building\\" ‚Äì Information obtained from on-site heritage plaque The College had been the seat of medical education in Singapore. The building was designed by Major P.H. Keys, who also designed the Fullerton Building in 1928. The architectural design of the building is reminiscent of classical Greek monuments such as the Acropolis in Athens. There are 12 columns of the Roman Doric order, bas relief of a Roman eagle and sculptures depicting the teaching and practice of medicine. =King Edward VII Hall= Built in 1957, King Edward Hall comprises a main block and two four- storey buildings serving as a hostel for medical students. Many leading doctors and dentists from Singapore and Malaysia such as Professor E. S. Monteiro, Dr Benjamin Henry Sheares (2nd President of Singapore), and Dr Mahathir bin Mohamad (4th Prime Minister of Malaysia) have passed through the hall and forged lifelong friendship during their stay here. =Double tragedy= On the morning of 14 February 1942, Yoong Tat Sin, a fourth-year medical student, was fatally injured by Japanese shelling while on duty at the Tan Tock Seng Hospital along Balestier Road. He was rushed to the Outram Road General Hospital for an emergency operation, but he died soon after.Major Yap, \\"Singapore General Hospital ‚Äì Student Tragedy\\", pp. 72‚Äì74. That same evening, his fellow friends, about 25 students from the medical and dental faculties of the College of Medicine decided to give Yoong a proper burial within the grounds of the hospital. One of the five trenches dug out earlier for air raid purposes was converted into a grave for Yoong. As the grave was being prepared, they were spotted by Japanese gunners which began pouring a heavy barrage of shells at the defenceless students. Some quick-footed students managed to flee to safety towards the College building. However, those left behind only had time to leap into the trenches and Yoong's grave. As a result, 11 of the students were killed, three were wounded and only two managed to escape injury in the aftermath. Those who were killed instantaneously were given a burial on the morning of 16 February, a day after the surrender of Singapore to the Japanese, in the trenches where they fell. =In Memoriam= The military casualties at SGH were commemorated by name that was inscribed on the Singapore Civil Hospital Grave Memorial at the Kranji War Cemetery today After the war, the British Colonial Government erected a memorial to commemorate the British soldiers and civilian war dead along College Road near the spot where the slain students were killed. The memorial consists of a painted wooden cross affixed to a pyramidal granite base. The words inscribed at the base of the cross reads: Together with the slain students, the Commonwealth military casualties were buried in a mass grave site on the hospital grounds (beneath the memorial) due to the intense shelling and lack of burial space in the last days before the fall of Singapore.Bose, \\"The Civil Hospital Grave Memorial\\", p. 15. On 22 October 1948, Dr G. V. Allen, the principal of the Medical College then, unveiled a War Memorial Plaque, In Memoriam, in the presence of the governor of Singapore, Sir Franklin Gimson. The plaque, inscribed with the names of ten men and a woman, is dedicated to the eleven slain students and was hung in Harrower Hall. Built in 1931, Harrower Hall (now the Orthopaedic Surgery Department) was first home to the students' lounge of the Medical School. Over the years, the memorial plaque moved twice before finally resting in the foyer of the College of Medicine Building, close to the burial grounds of the slain students.

The recording appeared on the duo's second album, Big Bambu, released in 1972. It was re- released as a single in 1973 and climbed to No. 24 on the Billboard Hot 100 in early 1974 The picture sleeve for the record was illustrated by Paul Gruwell. Synopsis The title character is an exceedingly prissy nun substitute teacher (played by Cheech Marin) teaching in a parochial school (\\"Our Lady of 115th Street\\") classroom of exceedingly irreverent, noisy teenage boys (all played by Cheech and Tommy Chong through overdubbing). She attempts to teach the class, but the boys totally ignore her. She then tries to get the students' attention by speaking increasingly loudly, to no avail. When she finally screams, \\"SHUT UP!\\" at the top of her lungs, in startling contrast to her usually placid manner, dead silence ensues. She follows this with a once again prissy \\"Thank you\\". This becomes a running joke throughout the skit. Sister Mary Elephant announces that she is the substitute for their regular teacher, Sister Rosetta Stone, who has sent her love and the artwork she is making: fingerpaintings and dustcloths, indicating that she has likely been institutionalized. After introducing herself, the class erupts in laughter upon hearing her name, prompting a repetition of the \\"SHUT UP!\\"/\\"Thank you\\" routine. Sister Mary Elephant then asks a student to give her his knife. He complies, but not quite the way she had in mind (it is heard flying and sticking in the wall with a twang). She responds with another prissy \\"Thank you\\". She continues to try to teach the class, during which they continue talking, necessitating further repetitions of her screaming. Sister Mary Elephant tells the class that they will read their previously assigned essays on \\"How I Spent My Summer Vacation\\". She chooses one boy (Chong), who stands up and reads in a monotone voice how on the first day he woke up, went downtown to look for a job, then hung out in front of the drugstore. Another student (Voiced by Cheech) asks if it's the one on 13th but to no answer. Chong repeatedly describes this same daily routine verbatim for each day of his vacation as well. Sister Mary tries to get the student to stop reading, but he ignores her and continues, finally noting that on the third day he got a job keeping people from hanging out in front of the drugstore. Sister Mary beseeches the boy to \\"SHUT UP!\\" before he can continue any further. A student (Chong) had started asking to \\"go to the can\\", and does so repeatedly during the students reading but is ignored entirely by Sister Mary. Several times the sound of flatulence is heard implying he has diarrhea or the students making fart sounds. Sister Mary Elephant then reads from a book of excessively flowery poetry. The class responds with their usual razzing then fall silent except for scattered snoring after a few verses. In a variation on the running joke, she screams for the class to \\"WAKE UP!\\" The sketch ends here with Chong declaring \\"I gotta go to the can, man.\\" The humor derives from the fact that every time Sister Mary shouts SHUT UP she amplifies so much she sounds like an elephant trumpeting. Sergeant Stadanko The character of Sister Mary Elephant reappeared in a later Cheech and Chong skit, \\"Sergeant Stadanko\\", on their Los Cochinos album. The nun introduces the titular narcotics officer (Chong) as a guest speaker. Her rowdy classroom immediately falls silent at the mention of Stadanko's profession. Later one student (Cheech) rats out another student, Billy (Chong), to Stadanko for selling him oregano packaged as marijuana. The students begin fighting and Sister Mary beseeches Stadanko to intervene. Stadanko sheepishly informs her that he will call the police. The two skits are segued together on Cheech & Chong's Greatest Hit. Legacy The \\"SHUT UP!\\" portion is used as a sound bite on Imus in the Morning.

The album was recorded at the Star-Club in Hamburg, Germany on April 5, 1964. It is regarded by many music journalists as one of the greatest rock and roll albums ever, noted for its hard-hitting energy and Lewis' wild stage presence.Peter Checksfield, \\"Jerry Lee Lewis. The Greatest Live Show on Earth\\", Record Collector, #188 - April 1995, p. 79. The album appears in the book 1001 Albums You Must Hear Before You Die. Recording Live at the Star Club was produced by Siggi Loch, who was head of the jazz department at Philips Records. In Joe Bonomo's book Lost And Found, Loch states that \\"...I realized that there were all of these young, mainly British, bands who were playing Chuck Berry and other white American rock & rollers, their big heroes...And I went to the owner and made a proposal to start recording bands at the Star-Club, which I did.\\" According to Loch the recording setup was uncomplicated, with microphones placed as close to the instruments as possible with a stereo mike placed in the audience to capture the ambience. The results were sonically astonishing, with Bonomo observing that \\"Detractors complain of the album's crashing noisiness, the lack of subtlety with which Jerry Lee revisits the songs, the fact that the piano is mixed too loudly, but what is certain is that Siggi Loch on this spring evening captured something brutally honest about the Killer, about the primal and timeless center of the very best rock & roll...\\" Sixteen songs were recorded over two sets, the first set comprising \\"Down The Line,\\" \\"You Win Again,\\" \\"High School Confidential,\\" \\"Your Cheatin' Heart,\\" \\"Great Balls of Fire,\\" \\"What'd I Say (Parts 1 & 2), and \\"Mean Woman Blues.\\" The second set featured \\"Good Golly Miss Molly,\\" \\"Matchbox,\\" \\"Money,\\" \\"Whole Lotta Shakin' Goin' On,\\" \\"Lewis Boogie,\\" \\"Hound Dog,\\" \\"Long Tall Sally\\" and \\"I'm On Fire.\\" Joe Bonomo, Jerry Lee Lewis: Lost and Found (Continuum Books, 2009), by Joe Bonomo. \\"Down The Line,\\" omitted on the original LP due to a sound fault at the beginning, was released on French Mercury single Les Rois du Rock, Vol. 8 : Jerry Lee Lewis and included on later CD and LP releases of Bear Family Records. The tapes for \\"You Win Again\\" and \\"I'm On Fire\\" are believed to have been lost. For decades the album was available only in Europe due to legal constraints. In 2014, Lewis told biographer Rick Bragg \\"Oh, man, that was a big monster record\\" but that the record company \\"never paid me a penny.\\" Speaking to Patrick Doyle of Rolling Stone in 2014, Lewis remained proud that he \\"stuck with rock & roll when the rest of them didn't, I kept the ball rollin' with that.\\" Reception Live at the Star Club, Hamburg is generally regarded as one of the greatest live rock and roll albums ever made. Recorded during his \\"wilderness years\\" following the fallout surrounding his 1958 marriage to his thirteen-year-old first cousin once removed Myra, the album showcases Lewis's phenomenal skills as a pianist and singer, which had been honed by relentless touring. In a 5-out-of-5 stars review, Milo Miles raved in Rolling Stone that \\"Live At The Star Club, Hamburg is not an album, it's a crime scene: Jerry Lee Lewis slaughters his rivals in a thirteen-song set that feels like one long convulsion. Recorded April 5th, 1964, this is the earliest and most feral of Lewis' concert releases from his wilderness years ...\\".Miles, Milo (June 6, 2002).

The album was included in Mojo's \\"The 67 Lost Albums You Must Own!\\" - \\"[A]n unbelievably seismic document of rock 'n' roll so demonic and primal it can barely keep its stage suit on.... It's up there with James Brown's great live albums.\\"Mojo, 3/01/2004, p. 52. AllMusic said of the album: \\"Words cannot describe - cannot contain - the performance captured on Live at the Star Club, Hamburg, an album that contains the very essence of rock & roll...Live at the Star Club is extraordinary - the purest, hardest rock & roll ever committed to record...He sounds possessed, hitting the keys so hard it sounds like they'll break, and rocking harder than anybody had before or since. Compared to this, thrash metal sounds tame, the Stooges sound constrained, hardcore punk seems neutered, and the Sex Pistols sound like wimps. Rock & roll is about the fire in the performance, and nothing sounds as fiery as this; nothing hits as hard or sounds as loud, either. It is no stretch to call this the greatest live album ever, nor is it a stretch to call it the greatest rock & roll album ever recorded.
