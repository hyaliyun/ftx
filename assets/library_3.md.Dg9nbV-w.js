It enrolled among its members men and women who were early or seasoned in their career. Founding In 1885, a few ambitious Indiana writers agitated the idea of a society of writers. The pioneers in the movement were Marie Louise Andrews, J. C. Ochiltree, Dr. James Newton Matthews, Richard Lew Dawson and Dr. W. H. Taylor. These writers were all contributors to the Indianapolis Herald in the winter of 1885-6, and the idea of a writers‚Äô association was made public through its columns. The matter was also discussed in correspondence, with the result that a call was finally made to all writers whose addresses could be obtained, and it appeared in the Chicago Current of April 3, 1886: \\"To the Literary Profession: A call is hereby extended to all writers of verse and general literature. and especially to the writers of the Wabash Valley and the adjacent states to meet in convention in June 1886 at the city of Terre Haute or Indianapolis, Indiana.\\" The call also stated that the objects of the meeting were ‚Äúto form an association of the literary profession for mutual strength, profit and acquaintance; to discuss the methods of composition, and all topics pertaining to the advancement of literature in America; to produce and publish a representative volume of the western authors from the miscellaneous poems, stories and sketches read during this convention or festival.‚Äù The response to this call indicated Indianapolis as the preferred meeting-place. Hence, on June 30, 1886, in Plymouth Church, in that city, 75 writers met, and over 100 poems and stories were read as their contribution to the occasion. With much enthusiasm, prominent writers appeared at the public gathering, and the Association was inaugurated. Maurice Thompson, the poet, was the first president of the Association, and James Whitcomb Riley was on the executive committee. Thompson was also the second president, and the roll of chief executives during the first 11 years was made up of Hon. Benjamin Stratton Parker, Dr. John Clark Ridpath, Hon. Cyrus Finley McNutt, Dr. Taylor, Hon. Thomas B. Redding, Prof. A. W. Butler and Dr. William Henry Venable. History Three volumes of the annual meetings of the Association were issued, covering the meetings up to 1892, and representing collections of verse and prose. All the annual conventions through that time, with the exception of one, were held at Winona Park, an assembly area near Warsaw, Indiana, somewhat on the Chautauqua plan. This place became regarded by the Association as home, and, when convened there, the sessions were better attended than elsewhere. Indiana furnished the greatest number of members to the Association, but there were many representatives from Ohio, Illinois, and Kentucky, as well as Missouri, Michigan, Kansas, California, Nebraska, Colorado, South Dakota, and Wisconsin; Canada was also represented. The Western Association of Writers meant much to the Indiana literary. The annual meetings at Winona Lake were not expensive affairs. The railroads gave reduced rates, the hotels furnish accommodations at the assembly ground, and there were facilities for camping. The annual meeting was the centerpiece of all literary workers in the last days of June and the first ones of July. It was the simplest of meetings; there was no banqueting, no reveling, and no alcohol. To the initiated, this method of celebrating a literary festival was full of significance. The papers read at subsequent meetings of the Association were, to one not before in attendance at the meetings, quite strong, showing remarkable facility of expression, besides a high degree of scholarship and critical ability. The general expression of the older members, however, would tend to the idea that the meeting of 1896 was not above the average in the quality of the papers presented. Notable people With the election of Dr. Venable of Cincinnati to the presidency of the Association in 1895, the Ohio interest became stronger and a new element was introduced. The majority of the men and women in the body were too broad-minded to wish the organization to remain sectional. The greatest step in the direction of universalism was taken, however, when Venable enrolled for the Association a list of the best writers of Southern Ohio, they being in full accord with his ideas of the development of a broad literary culture and an individual interest in all efforts to promote literary interest in the Midwest. Prof. Amos W. Butler of Brookville, Indiana was better known to the scientific world than to the literary. He wrote on the topics connected with literature as well as anthropology, zoology and associated subjects. The Hon. William Cumback was an Indiana politician, orator, forceful writer, and a notable lyceum speaker. A wise counselor and a warm supporter of the Association, a large volume of his lectures and addresses, edited by Dr. Ridpath, were published. Dr. Ridpath, the historian and for many years, president of DePauw University, was known among scholars throughout the world, his books and articles including ‚ÄúPopular History of the United States,\\" ‚ÄúCyclopedia of Universal History,\\" \\" History of Races,\\" ‚Äú Life of James G. Blaine,‚Äù ‚Äú Life and Works of Gladstone.\\" James Whitcomb Riley, co-founder and poet, published the following books: \\"The Lesson and Other Poems,‚Äù ‚ÄúThe Cabin in the Clearing,‚Äù \\"Hoosier Bards,‚Äù and \\"Rhymes of Our Neighborhood.‚Äú Instead of presenting one of his own poems at an Association meeting, Parker read a production by a young African-American, Paul Dunbar, whom the Association discovered when they held a meeting in Dayton, Ohio, and whose work William Dean Howells included in some columns in Harper's Weekly. Gen. Lew Wallace, soldier, scholar, statesman, diplomat, and novelist was a strong supporter of the Association. A man who contributed much to the success of the Association was Dr. James Newton Matthews, of Mason, Illinois, a co-founder and one of the most popular writers of the west. Various other writers were supporters and members of the Association, and these included Dr. David Starr Jordan, Eugene F. Ware, W. W. Pfrimmer, of Kentland. Indiana, who was often elected to some position on the official board, and Captain Lee O. Harris, editor of Home and School. Judge Alfred Ellison, of Anderson, Indiana, Judge D. P. Baldwin, and Joseph S. Reed, of Sullivan, Indiana were also pioneer friends of the Association, along with Col. Coates Kinney, of Norwood, Ohio, Soule Smith, of Lexington, Kentucky, Lawrence Mendenhall, of Cincinnati, John Uri Lloyd, author of ‚ÄúEtidorhpa,\\" Dr. Lawrence C. Carr, of Cincinnati, R. Ellsworth Call, a scholar and authority on college affairs, Dr. John M. Crawford, counsel to St. Petersburg, and F. F. Oldham, of Queen City, Ohio. Of the number of women in the Association, perhaps the most successful and best known were Mary Hartwell Catherwood, of Hoopeston, Illinois, Alice Williams Brotherton, the Cincinnati poetess, Idael Makeever of Nebraska, and Bessie Woolford, called the ‚ÄúPoet of the Ohio River\\". Among the names of women writers on the list of members of the Association were Mary Elizabeth Caldwell Zedtwitz, Mrs. E. S. Thompson, Ida May Davis, Hannah E. Davis, Evaleen Stem, Minnie Thomas Boyce, Elizabeth Hiatt Gregory, Elora Steams Venter, Lulia C. Aldrich, of Wauseon, Eva Best, of Dayton, May Wright Sewall, of Indianapolis, and M.

He ruled Guria, a small state in southwestern Georgia, as a client of Mamia IV Dadiani, Prince of Mingrelia, who had deposed Giorgi II Gurieli. Vakhtang was one of the sponsors of the Shemokmedi Monastery, Guria's principal cathedral.  Biography  The ancestry of Vakhtang Gurieli is poorly documented. Prince Vakhushti's chronicle, one of the principal sources on Georgia's early modern history, refers to him as being \\"of a Gurieli stock\\", without elucidating his parentage. Contemporary documents suggest Vakhtang might have been a son of Rostom Gurieli and brother of Giorgi II Gurieli, a genealogy accepted in mainstream Georgian scholarship. On the other hand, the historian Cyril Toumanoff regarded him as a son of Giorgi II Gurieli. Vakhtang was installed as prince-regnant of Guria by the neighboring ruler, Mamia IV Dadiani, Prince of Mingrelia, who had invaded Guria and expelled his brother-in-law Giorgi II Gurieli in 1583. Prior to his accession, Vakhtang was in possession of the canton of Kobuleti. Giorgi Gurieli fled to Constantinople to solicit the Ottoman support. He was in the Ottoman- controlled town of Gonio in 1587, when Vakhtang died, enabling Giorgi to reclaim Guria with the help of the Ottoman government. Vakhtang was buried at the Transfiguration Church in the Shemokmedi Monastery, which he had built.

She was viewed as a supporter of the Maoists and driven from Jagdapur by anti- Moaists and authorities. Career Subramaniam is a contributor to the news website Scroll.In. She has been reporting on human rights issues in Bastar, Chhattisgarh. Her reports contained information on abuses committed by the police and security personnel, sexual violence against women, the illegal jailing of minors, the shutdown of schools, extrajudicial killings and threats against journalists. She was the subject of harassment from police and men in the community. Malini Subramaniam formerly lived in her Bastar home with her family. Throughout her career she has been interrogated, followed, and harassed by police and members of a pro-police vigilante group. On the evening of February 7, 2016, a group of approximately twenty individuals congregated in front of Subramaniam's home with a goal to pin her neighbors against her and to provoke them to join in on the attacks. The next morning, February 8, 2016, her home was attacked by a group associated with Samajik Ekta Manch, who are anti-Maoists. They threw stones at her home and car windows shattering the glass of her car. She attempted to gain help through a police investigation but was essentially ignored. On February 18, 2016, Subramaniam and her family were forced to leave her home by eviction notice. It is believed that her landlord was threatened to do so. Through all of the struggle Subramaniam refuses to give up and plans to go back to Bastar whenever the time is right. Context The harassment of Malini Subramaniam is part of a larger attack on activists, lawyers and journalists standing up against abuses committed by police in the Bastar District. One politician called journalists \\"presstitudes\\" to feed into the negative climate around 2016. Investigations have been ongoing in the region pertaining to human rights because of a long going confrontation between government forces and Maoist rebels trying to take over the region. The India Today news channel conducted one investigation that tied police together with Samajik Ekta Manch. Police pressure journalists to serve as information delivers and jail those of report badly on them. Several journalists have been killed in this area for reporting on critical content. The anti-Maoist organization Samajik Ekta Manch was banned April 15, 2016, as a result of activities like those directed at Subramaniam Reactions The members of the Network of Women in Media, India, strongly expressed their disdain of the attack on Subramaniam. Joel Simon, CPJ executive director, expressed his reasoning behind honoring Subramaiam with the International Press Freedom Award. He recognized her for risking her life to report to society and global community the critical news events happening around her. Awards In 2016, Subramaniam won an International Press Freedom Award from the Committee to Protect Journalists. She won the 2017 Oxfam Novib/PEN Award for Freedom of Expression.

The caravans of Rahian-e Noor typically travel to war zones around the time of Nowruz - the Iranian New Year - and during summer vacation. History Rahian-e Noor was established in 1997 by the student branch of the Basij; its name was selected by military organizations of the Iranian Islamic Revolution. Supreme Leader of Iran Ayatollah Khamenei visited the Iranian war zone in 1999 and 2002 to support the movement. In 2005, he ordered the creation of a Sepah subdivision entitled the Foundation for the Preservation and Publication of Sacred Defense Works and Values to officially support the caravans. \\"Shade Of Earth\\" is a series by photography Abbas Kowsari; it has been compared Robert Fisk's book The Great War for Civilisation, which discussed the Iran-Iraq War and described public conditions of and reactions to the conflict. Kowsari's series portrays the hundreds of thousands of Iranian visitors during Rahian-e Noor, many of whom lost family in the war.  War tourism Tourist observation of Iranian defenses of the Iran-Iraq War - known by Iranians as the Sacred Defence - is a key component of Iran's tourism industry. The memorial purportedly seeks to educate native and foreign tourists while they visit the war zones, although some regard it as a propaganda effort. Some tourism researchers attribute visitor interest to nostalgia and cultural factors. Reception During the 2010 Rahian-e Noor, Ayatollah Khamenei praised the event in a speech, saying, \\"Iranians should never forget about the sensitive, historical and honourable time of the Sacred Defence because it was a priceless experience\\". Graves of soldiers at the Hoveyzeh In recent years, the memorial has included seminars promoting anti- Green movement and anti-sedition positions; this, in addition to multiple accidents resulting in tourist deaths, has led to heavy criticism by some activists. The memorial ended with no road accidents in 2013 while according to the Brigadier general Eskandar Momeni, chief of traffic Police, Khuzestan Province were among the top five with most road accidents in the same year. Central headquarters of Rahian-e Noor took some actions to reduce the accidents among them prohibition of buses moving at night, devising rest places for drivers and participants, putting emphasis on using buses with high technical status and use of Emdad Yavar system.

The building was constructed for the storage of tithes payable to the church authorities of the Priory Church of St Mary . Following the Dissolution of the Monasteries in the 16th century, the barn was used for a variety of functions, including a theatre in the 17th century and a discotheque in the 20th century. By 2002, the barn was in a state of considerable dilapidation and was again taken into the ownership of the Priory Church, which, following a major reconstruction, operates an exhibition space in the building.

Originally constructed in 1845, the church was initially used as a seminary for the community, and later became part of the university in 1859. Contemporarily, it is the central place of worship and head of the university's campus ministry, which also has various associated chapels across the university's three campuses. History =Establishment= The Fordham University Church was originally built in 1845 as a seminary chapel and parish church for the surrounding community of Old Fordham Village in The Bronx. In 1859, the university was purchased by the Jesuits, and the church was absorbed by the university (then St. John's College). It contains the altar from the Old St. Patrick's Cathedral, as well as stained glass windows given to the university by King Louis Philippe I of France. The windows are particularly notable for their connection to a workshop in Sevres, France, where the earliest stages of the Gothic Revival took place. The six windows in the nave of the University Church depict the Four Evangelists, St. Peter, and St. Paul. Adjacent to the church is the Fordham University Cemetery, where the university's original nineteenth- century Jesuits, diocesan seminarians, students, and workers are interred; the original cemetery had been located on property that now belongs to the New York Botanical Garden, and the graves were relocated to their current location in 1890. =Campus ministry= The University Church is the central place of worship for Fordham's campus ministry; however, there are numerous chapels associated with the church on the Rose Hill campus, including the Blue Chapel in Keating Hall, the Sacred Heart Chapel in Dealy Hall, and the St. Robert Bellarmine Chapel at Spillman Hall.

Known for her distinctly contemporary style and use of dyed and woven hemp fibre, an unconventional material for sculpting, she had a career spawning over four decades from the 1970s to the 2000s. Mukherjee's body of work is a part of public collections at, among others, the Museum of Modern Art, Oxford, the National Gallery of Modern Art, New Delhi, and the Stedelijk Museum, Amsterdam. Early Life and Education  Mukherjee was born in 1949, in Bombay, India to artists Benode Behari Mukherjee and Leela Mukherjee.Dalmia, and Datta, and Sambrini, and Jakimowicz, and Datta (1997) Indian Contemporary Art Post-Independence. p.206 The only child to her parents, she was brought up in the North-Indian hill town of Dehradun, where she attended Welham Girls' School, and spent her summer vacations in Santiniketan. Mukherjee went to study Bachelor of Fine Arts (Painting) at Maharaja Sayajirao University of Baroda. Thereafter, she did a Post Diploma in Mural Design form the same university under the Indian artist K.G. Subramanyan who was also a member of the Fine Arts Faculty at the university. Her studies included working Italian Fresco and other conventional techniques. She worked with natural fibers as a medium for mural.  Career  Mukherjee's first solo exhibition was held at Sridharani Art Gallery in New Delhi in 1972. It featured warped, woven forms in dyed natural fibersa series of works that brought her recognition. She named her sculptures after deities of fertility and were seen as sensual and suggestive. Mukherjee received a British Council Scholarship for Sculpture in 1971 that sent her to the West Surrey College of Art and Design, where she pursued her tied-fiber works till 1978. While most of Mukherjee's early work was characterized by the use natural hemp fiber, she also ventured into working extensively with ceramic and bronze later in her career. Mukherjee was invited to the Museum of Modern Art, Oxford to hold an exhibition conducted by David Elliott in 1994. The same exhibition further traveled to other cities in the United Kingdom over the course of the next few months. Mukherjee later participated in an international workshop that was held Netherlands in 1996. In 2019, the Metropolitan Museum of Art hosted a posthumous retrospective of Mukherjee's oeuvre titled \\"Phenomenal Nature: Mrinalini Mukherjee.\\" In her review of the exhibition, art critic Nageen Shaikh observes: \\"Perhaps the principal lesson that historians, critics, and viewers acquire with an astounding retrospective like Mukherjee‚Äôs is how art can resist being viewed as delineated under a methodical Western canon. Her massive oeuvre is not fully representational, neither completely abstract. It learns from her native history and tradition, while educating us in new ways to engage with subtleties of her work.\\" Technique and style Mukherjee was influenced by traditional Indian and historic European sculpture, folk art, modern design, local crafts and textiles. Knotting was one of her main techniques; she worked intuitively and never worked based on sketches, models or preparatory drawings. The authors of Indian Contemporary Art Post-Independence dubbed Mukherjee as a \\"unique voice in contemporary Indian art\\", and remarked \\"The sculptures knotted painstakingly with hemp ropes in earthy or rich glowing colours evoke a fecund world of burgeoning life, lush vegetation, iconic figures.\\" Acknowledging the note of sexuality manifested in the \\"phallic forms\\", they added \\"the mysterious folds and orifices, the intricate curves and drapes. There is a sensuous, tactile quality to her work which exercises a compelling hold on the viewer.\\"Dalmia, and Datta, and Sambrini, and Jakimowicz, and Datta (1997) Indian Contemporary Art Post-Independence Mukherjee studied under K. G. Subramanyan, and derived heavily from his artistry. Sonal Khullar writing on Subramanyan's influence on her wrote in Worldly Affliations Mukherjee a former student, \\"[...] use jute, wood, rope, and cow dung to create environments at once magical and mundane. Their inventiveness with visual language and investments in ordinary materials are a legacy of Subramanyan's teaching, writing and art-making.\\"Khullar (2015) Worldly Affiliations: Artistic Practice, National Identity, and Modernism in India, 1930‚Äì1990. p.134 Art historian and independent curator Deepak Ananth also ascribed Mukherjee's predilection for modest, earthly materials to her influence from Subramanyan, and in turn from the history of Indian artisanal craft. In an essay entitled \\"The Knots are Many But the Thread is One\\", Ananth wrote, \\"As if in harmony with the vegetable realm from which her medium is derived, the leading metaphor of Mukherjee's work comes from the organic life of plants. Improvising upon a motif or image that serves as her starting point the work's gradual unfolding itself becomes analogous to the stirring into maturation of a sapling.\\"  Influences  In the context of the pedagogy professed by K G Subramanyan, Mukherjee's decision to work in a material traditionally associated with her craft rather than \\"high art\\" reflects her teacher's conscious attempts to overcome what they considered to be a staple polarity in Modernism, not least in view of the extreme richness and continuing actuality of traditional artisanal skills in India and the sheer versatility of popular vernacular idioms.

He was especially active in the fields of entomology, ornithology and herpetology. He was employed at the Compagnie des Canons du Midi and he was a founder member of the Soci√©t√© d'histoire naturelle de Toulouse in 1866. Natural History Work He was interested in the beetles, of which he had a collection, gathered during his professional activities. He switched his principal interes to the Hymenoptera and the Orthoptera once he had retired. He often collected in the company of V. Mayet and one of his brothers. The main areas where he collected were around Toulouse and Beziers but once a year he spent a month in the area of the Etang de Vendres. He published the Catalogue des Col√©opt√®res du Languedoc, esp√®ces observ√©es dans quelques r√©gions de cette province, notamment √† Toulouse, B√©ziers in six papers between 1869 and 1882, with a simultaneous complete publication of this work. The second edition, published in 1897, contained biogeographic information for the longhorn beetles which was not contained in the first edition. After his death Marquet's nephew gave his collection of reptiles to the Toulouse Museum.

He is best known as author of Historia del Carlismo (1939), for half a century a key reference work on history of Carlism and today considered the classic lecture of Traditionalist historiography. He is also acknowledged as member of the Spanish consular service, briefly editor of a daily El Correo de Guip√∫zcoa and a Carlist militant himself. Family and youth rural Navarre, 1898 The Oyarzun family originated from Valle de Atez, an area in Prepirineos of Northern Navarre. Ethnically Basque a certain Juan Miguel Oyarzun, recorded in Olag√ºe in 1809, was illiterate, Jes√∫s Aldaba, El juramento de 1809: fuente para el estudio de alfabetizaci√≥n en Navarre y Gipuzkoa, [in:] Antzina 6 (2011), p. 13 Rom√°n's ancestors formed part of the agricultural working class, holding plots around the hamlet of Olag√ºe. His father, Juan Miguel Oyarzun Seminario (1856-1908),El Eco de Navarra 07.03.08, available here ran a petty rural merchant business; though in the 1890s struggling when transporting goods on his mules across the hostile terrain,compare account of him getting trapped with his mules in snow- covered mountains and getting rescued by Guardia Civil, El Aralar 16.01.95, available here in the early 20th century he was already operating a few shops.Rom√°n Oyarzun, Pretendientes al trono de Espa√±a, Madrid 1965, p. 83. Upon death he was noted as \\"persona muy apreciada en Navarra\\", El Eco de Navarra 04.03.08, available here He married a local girl, Patricia Oyarzun; nothing is known either about her family or about a possible kinship between the two. The couple settled in Olag√ºe; it is not clear how many children they had, apart from Rom√°n the other two known are Martina and Victoriano.El Eco de Navarra 07.03.08, available here It seems that they were brought up in a fervently Catholic, militant ambience, perhaps flavored by Integrism; in the early 1890s the parents and children alike are recorded as signing up various letters, e.g. protesting reported mistreatment of the Pope, and printed later in an Integrist newspaper El Siglo Futuro.El Siglo Futuro 07.02.90, available here Rom√°n Oyarzun (1908) None of the sources consulted offers any information on early education of Rom√°n. Already during his childhood he developed a knack for letters; in 1893 he sent a contribution to the Pamplonese daily El Pensamiento Navarro. Signed \\"U.E.\\",for \\"el estiudante\\" it was published and the author was invited to contribute more before his identity was finally revealed.El Siglo Futuro 06.02.36, available here In 1902 he was recorded as excellent student at the Pamplona Instituto Provincial, which might suggest that following bachillerato he trained to be a teacher.El Eco de Navarra 10.06.02, available here, El Eco de Navarra 11.06.02, available here At unspecified time he commenced university studies at Universidad Central in Madrid.

During his academic years he clearly sided with the latter and was noted as member of Juventud Carlista.El tradicionalista 06.08.05, available here When back in Pamplona he engaged in party initiatives; apparently considered an erudite, he was entrusted with delivering addresses to local audience, e.g. during opening of a new city c√≠rculo in 1906.El Correo Espa√±ol 03.08.06, available here In early 1908 Oyarzun moved to San Sebasti√°nEl Eco de Navarra 03.12.08, available here to join the staff of El Correo de Guip√∫zcoa, an 1898-founded daily owned by one of the Carlist Vascongadas leaders, Jos√© Pascual de Li√±√°n.B. de Artagan [Reynaldo Brea], Pr√≠ncipe her√≥ico y soldados leales, Barcelona 1912 , p. 187.

As a lawyer he defended himself and though initially the odds were against him,one of the jury members told later Oyarzun: \\"Despu√©s del discurso del fiscal, que ha sido tremendo, todos los del jurado est√°bamos decididos a condenarle a usted, pero cuando usted contest√≥ con tanto br√≠o, con tanta sinceridad y con tanta fuerza persuasiva, hemos decidido votar por la absoluci√≥n\\", Oyarzun 1965, p. 80 he was finally absolved.Oyarzun 1965, p. 80, El tradicionalista 20.02.09, available here Two years later he resigned from editorial duties quoting family issues and returned to Pamplona.following the death of his father he had to take care of the family business, which boiled down to closing \\"varios negocios\\", Oyarzun 1965, p. 83 Don Jaime, 1911 In 1910 the Vascongadas party tycoon, T√≠rso de Ol√°zabal, first advised and then \\"almost forced\\" Oyarzun to visit the exiled Carlist king, Don Jaime, in his Frohsdorf residence.Oyarzun 19656, p. 83 The purpose quoted was to gather information for a booklet,El Norte 13.09.10, available here though it is also possible that following earlier resignations of Juan V√°zquez de Mella and Antero Samaniego,Juan V√°zquez de Mella served in 1909-1910; Antero Samaniego y Mart√≠nez Fort√∫n was nominated in May 1910, Agust√≠n Fern√°ndez Escudero, El marqu√©s de Cerralbo (1845-1922): biograf√≠a politica [PhD thesis Complutense], Madrid 2012, p. 424 Don Jaime was looking for their successor as his personal secretary. Oyarzun spent some 2 monthsOyarzun 1965, p. 90. According to the press notes Oyarzun left Pamplona for Frohsdorf on September 13, 1910; and on December 9, 1910 he was already back in San Sebasti√°n, compare El Eco de Navarra 09.12.10, available here with his king as unpaid \\"secretario interino\\"El Norte 27.09.10, available here and according to his own account they went together very well,having spent with Don Jaime \\"una larga temporada\\", Oyarzun 1965, p. 90 discussing even Don Jaime's matters of the heart.according to Oyarzun at that time Don Jaime was strongly attracted to a very young Borb√≥n-Parma princess; instead, Oyarzun advised him to focus rather on her older sister Zita, later to marry to the Austrian heir Karl Habsburg, Oyarzun 1965, p. 84. The anonymous \\"young princess\\" could have been only Maria Antonia, born 1895; she has never married and became a Benedictine nun His king offered Oyarzun the permanent job but he declined; the reason quoted was that already engaged with a fianc√©, he was willing to marry.Oyarzun 1965, p. 84 The stay in Austria produced onlyin terms of political importance Ouyarzun‚Äôs stay in Frohsdorf seems irrelevant. The work which deals in detail with the Carlist history of the period in question, and specifically discusses growing hostility between Don Jaime and de Mella, does not mention Oyarzun a single time, compare Juan Ram√≥n de Andr√©s Mart√≠n, El cisma mellista. Historia de una ambici√≥n pol√≠tica, Madrid 2000, few correspondence pieces to Navarrese press, saluting Don Jaime as the king who \\"pregunta por su Patria, √° la que no puede ver, como se pregunta la madre que vive lejos y que est√° en peligro de muerte\\".\\"un R... que trabaja por Espa√±a, que escribe √° Espa√±a para preguntar por ella, que pregunta por su Patria, √° la que no puede ver, como se pregunta la madre que vive lejos y que est√° en peligro de muerte\\", El Correo Espa√±ol 28.09.10, available here Oyarzun's return to Navarre was hastened by news of Mondrag√≥n Carlists awaiting trial; Don Jaime asked Oyarzun to defend them in court, which he later did successfully.Oyarzun 1965, pp. 84-85 However, at that point Oyarzun's political engagements were abruptly put on hold. In the 1910s he entered consular service and was assigned abroad, in the 1920s he dedicated himself to business and in the 1930s he resumed his foreign engagements; there is no information on his political or politics-related activities during the period until the mid-1930s.Oyarzun prided himself on doing one thing at a time. In 1944 he wrote: \\"En cada √©poca de mi vida me he dedicado a lina, gola actividad (creo que con marcada y por todos reconocido √©xito), entregando a ella todo mi ser, acaso con excesivo ardor y entusiasmo.

He set up a company, named Alpha S.A., which dealt in import and sales of specialized machinery; it opened premises at prestigious locations in Madrid, but also in Barcelona, Valencia, Bilbao, Cadiz, Zaragoza and Vigo.El Sol 11.12.19, available here Initially the business covered a wide range of products for domestic use, office purposes,like mimeographs, La Voz 06.04.22, available here food productionespecially wine and olive production, ABC 29.05.21, available here and agriculture, mostly small and mid-size tools though at times ranging up to tractors.Heraldo de Madrid 21.05.21, available here By the early 1920s the company operated already as Rom√°n Oyarzun y C√≠a.

Asked to sign a declaration of loyalty he refused, in his August 2 statement noting that such an act would violate his conscience, especially given the government was dominated \\"por elementos revolucionarios, comunistas y socialistas revolucionarios\\".the full text reads: \\"Contestando pregunta telegr√°fica Vuecencia de que me da traslado escelent√≠simo se√±or Ministro de Espa√±a en Viena, oblig√°ndome a hacer una declaraci√≥n pol√≠tica contra lo prescrito art√≠culo cuarenta y uno Constituci√≥n vigente y haciendo uso derecho hallarme en desacuerdo con pol√≠tica seguida por Gobierno actual, cada d√≠a m√°s influido y dominado por elementos revolucionarios, comunistas y socialistas revolucionarios, a quienes considereo enemigos de Religi√≥n, Patria y Libertad.

The account contains some picturesque episodes, e.g. the group navigating across Vienna trying to find the Danube. It also seems to suggest that Oyarzun, never a distinguished party member, enjoyed prestigious position among key Carlist politicians, e.g. he made sure that Berasain did not go off limits when taking voice. During the entire trip Oyarzun was accompanied by his son, also Roman Oyarzun, who partially served as a driver In December 1936 Oyarzun published a press article titled Una idea: Requet√© y Fascio; most authors claim it advanced an idea of a union between the Carlists and the Falangists,this is the view advanced in Mercedes Pe√±alba Sotorr√≠o, Entre la boina roja y la camisa azul, Estella 2013, , pp. 23, 118, Martin Blinkhorn, Carlism and Crisis in Spain, Cambridge 1975 [re-printed with no re-edition in 2008], , pp. 281-281, Stanley G. Payne, Fascism in Spain, 1923‚Äì1977, Madison 1999, , pp. 260-261, Maximiliano Garcia Venero, Historia de la Unificacion, Madrid 1970, p. 80. The article was published on December 19 in El Pensamiento Navarro. He claimed that differences between both organizations were secondary (red/black colours, \\"comrade\\" way of addressing, uniforms), but also that, \\"both forces are rooted in the people; both nourish their ranks from the masses; in neither of them do great plutocratic interests hold privileged status or positions of command... Both forces are believers and put their trust in God\\". His article is at times viewed as \\"probablemente la primera manifestaci√≥n de una posibilidad unificadora concertada por mutuo acuerdo de las dos organizaciones\\" though few maintain that it rather highlighted the differences.the opinion advanced in Juan Carlos Pe√±as Bernaldo de Quir√≥s, El Carlismo, la Rep√∫blica y la Guerra Civil (1936-1937). De la conspiraci√≥n a la unificaci√≥n, Madrid 1996, , p. 246. The author highlights differences as pointed out in the article: Falange and fascism are foreign imports, the fascist idea is socially indebted to sindicalism and the ugetistas, for the Falangists Carlism is a reactionary and archaic force, hence unity between the two is not possible. On the other hand, what seems more promising was that CEDA and Renovacion Espa√±ola were approaching Carlism Until some time in 1937 he believed in birth of a foral corporative regime,Xos√©-M.

Pero, lo que es a√∫n m√°s grave, la desorientaci√≥n que reina en las altas esferas sobre qui√©n deba serlo y, sobre todo. C√≥mo hay que proclamarlo, es aterradora. Ello encierra una gran responsabilidad para el regente y para su delegado, quienes, en conciencia, no pueden seguir inhibi√©ndose, como lo han hecho hasta ahora, ante la necesidad urgente, urgent√≠sima, de dar una soluci√≥n al problema que es capital dentro del partido.\\" also \\"Esta demora inexplicable e injustificada en la proclamaci√≥n de pretendiente o rey ha tra√≠do como consecuencia una gran confusi√≥n y desasosiego en las filas carlistas y una floraci√≥n de candidatos para todos los gustos y para no pocas ambiciones\\", Oyarzun 1965, pp. 103-104 He refrained from taking an active stand and withdrewrarely giving lectures, e.g. in the Barcelona Ateneo on Cabrera, La Vanguardua 27.11.55, available here into his Pamplona privacy,he later claimed that in case of dissent with the main party line, he preferred to withdraw to the back row and stay silent instead of fuelling dissidency, Oyarzun 1965, p. 9 limiting himself to the observer's role.\\"Yo, desde hace largo tiempo, no ambiciono nada en pol√≠tica. Me limito a ser mero observador y, a ratos, historiador\\", Oyarzun 1965, p. 13 Over time he started to consider himself sort of an appendix to an extinguished idea, as he declared the Carlist dynasty finished and Carlism \\"reduced into debris and ashes\\".\\"Yo no soy aut√©ntico [Carlist] ni mucho menos [than Rodezno and the like], y, si me apur√°is, dir√© que dudo de que sea un carlista ortodoxo (para los de mentalidad anquilosada, soy demasiado avanzado en ciertas disciplinas pol√≠ticas y lo fui siempre), pero jam√°s he pensado en erigirme en representante del antiguo y glorioso partido, convertido hoy en escombros y cenizas, por culpa de unos y de otros de los que le han dirigido en las √∫ltimas d√©cadas o lustros\\", Oyarzun 1965, p. 90 Priding himself on cool matter-of-fact analysis, he considered the monarchist idea in decline\\"en nuestra modesta opini√≥n, ninguno re√∫ne las dos legitimidades, la de origen y la de ejercicio, que exigen ahora los tratadistas, tanto de la rama carlista como los del Movimiento\\", also \\"El trono espa√±ol est√° vacante: se dir√≠a que es res nullius, en espera de que se apropie de √©l o se siente en √©l aquel que tenga m√°s arrestos para conquistarlo, o m√°s altos apoyos para coronarse como rey. Pero seguimos pensando que las perspectivas no son muy halag√ºe√±as para los mon√°rquicos espa√±oles\\", Oyarzun 1965, pp. 113-114 with the throne vacant and no appropriate candidate,Oyarzun dismissed Don Juan as descendant of Francisco de Paula, considered illegitimate son of Godoy and de-legimised by the C√°diz cortes already. He considered dynastic rights of Don Javier at least \\"highly dubious\\" and those of the octavista claimants, starting with Don Carlos P√≠o, made up. Full lecture in Oyarzun 1965 yet in 1965 he bothered to publish a work intended to counter the Juanista propaganda.the early 1960s was the period when the Alfonsist prince Juan Carlos and the Carlist one Carlos Hugo seemed very close when racing to the throne. In 1964 Francisco Melgar published El noble final de la escisi√≥n din√°stica, the work which advanced the cause of the former by claiming that Don Juan, the father of Juan Carlos, was the legitimate Carlist heir. Immediately afterwards Oyarzun commenced work on his Pretendientes, completed in January 1965. On its 125 pages Melgar is omnipresent as a counterpoint of reference, noted 38 times, his concepts and suggestions systematically repudiated and ridiculed. Oyarzun often referred to his 2-month period with Don Jaime to dismiss some of Melgar‚Äôs claims, compare Oyarzun 1965, p. 86-7. However, Oyarzun firmly dismissed also the claims of Carlos Hugo and somewhat less firmly those of his father, Don Javier At least in terms of would-be monarchy he seemed entirely put up with the prospect of Franco's personal decision.the work ends with the chapter dedicated to Franco‚Äôs decree of March 31, 1947. When discussing it, Oyarzun claims that any pretender was doomed \\"si el r√©gimen que acaudillo Francisco Franco Bahamonde no le abre el camino y le marca la ruta que ha de seguir para conseguir ser coronado\\", Oyarzun 1965, p. 116 He did not engage in Francoist propaganda, yet by Traditionalists he was considered a Francoist and an ex-Carlist.a 1965 statement of a Carlist network named Junta de defensa read that \\"Sr. Oyarzun, que adem√°s de diplom√°tico al servicio del r√©gimen imperante, es franquista, con lo cual ha dejado de ser carlista\\", C√©sar Alcal√°, D. Mauricio de Sivatte. Una biograf√≠a pol√≠tica (1901-1980), Barcelona 2001, , p. 171. Also in 1965 a Carlist activist targeted Oyarzun with the remark that \\"la gran mayor√≠a de los del 18 de julio, nos hemos casado, y nuestros hijos siguen engrosando, y a mucha honra, las filas de la Comuni√≥n Carlista\\", Francisco Javier Caspistegui Gorasurreta, Entre la ideolog√≠a y lo cotidiano: la familia en el carlismo y el tradicionalismo (1940-1975), [in:] Vasconia: cuadernos de historia-geograf√≠a 28 (1999),p. 52. By some historians he is considered a \\"unificated\\" Carlist, Antonio Morales Moya, Ideolog√≠as y Movimientos Pol√≠ticos, vol. 4, Madrid 2001, , p. 89 Historian a Carlist, a boy, a pottok and a dog, 1872 A trained historian,since his curriculum at law and letters included history, Oyarzun 1965, p. 82 until his late 50s Oyarzun did not try his hand in the field. The first incursion into the area was a 1935 translation from English, Campa√±a de doce meses en Navarra y las Provincias Vascongadas con el general Zumalac√°rregui.Roman Oyarzun, Campa√±a de doce meses en Navarra y las Provincias Vascongadas con el general Zumalacarregui, Madrid 1935, a translation of Charles Frederick Henningsen, The Most Striking Events of a Twelvemonth‚Äôs Campaign with Zumalacarregui in Navarre and the Basque Provinces, London 1836 During the Civil War he wrote Historia del Carlismo, first published in 1939, considered his opus magnum and re-published in 1944, 1954, 1965, 1969, 2008 and 2013. Vida de Ram√≥n Cabrera y las guerras carlistas, a study on the Carlist commander from the First Carlist War, went into print in 1961, in 1964 followed by similarly formatted work focusing on a far less known military, El alav√©s D. Bruno de Villarreal, teniente general carlista. Pretendientes al trono de Espa√±a (1965) was a political pamphlet rather than a historiographic work,\\"aparecida en el marco de pol√©mica sobre la sucesi√≥n del general Franco entre juanistas, octavistas y javieristas\\", Jos√© Ram√≥n Barreiro Fern√°ndez, O liberalismo nos seus contextos: un estado da cuesti√≥n, Santiago de Compostela 2008, , p. 38 while Nacimiento, vida, muerte y resurrecci√≥n de los sacerdotes obreros (1966)Rom√°n Oyarzun, Nacimiento, vida, muerte y resurecci√≥n de los sacerdotes obreros, Madrid 1966 appeared as a somewhat unexpected glossa to Vaticanum II, a discussion of socially minded French and Spanish priests of the early 20th century, the phenomenon Oyarzun witnessedthe first part of the work was an historical account from France of the early 20th century, the second was polemics with Michel de Saint Pierre, Los nuevos curas, Madrid 1965, all related to the person of Georges Michonneau. Oyarzun distinguished between two antecedents of worker-priests and dismissed the Integrist one, speaking in favor of \\"una Iglesia abierta al mundo\\", Francisco Javier Caspistegui Gorasurreta, El naufragio de las ortodoxias. El carlismo, 1962‚Äì1977, Pamplona 1997; , p. 103 and sympathized withcompare Oyarzun‚Äôs 1906 address, El Correo Espa√±ol 03.08.06, available here himself. The work which earned Oyarzun name in the Spanish historiography is his History of Carlism. Though historiographic and especially political literature on Carlism had already been massive, the only precedent work attempting an overall history of the movement was Historia de la guerra civil y de los partidos liberal y carlista by Antonio Pirala Criado. The study was first published in 1858 and prolonged systematically in following editions, the last one of 1906 covering the period up to the 1870s; it is usually considered a high-quality,Jos√© Ram√≥n Urquijo Goitia, Fueros, lengua y pol√≠tica. La historia como instrumento de lucha pol√≠tica en el Pa√≠s Vasco actual, [in:] Hispania. Revista Espa√±ola de Historia LXIX/232 (2009), p. 522 fairly non-partisan account.Bego√±a Urig√ºen, Or√≠genes y evoluci√≥n de la derecha espa√±ola: el neo-catolicismo, Madrid 1986, , p. 46. For an earlier and different view, charging Pirala with a Liberal bias, see ABC 18.08.39, available here Oyarzun's proposal, originally to be titled Compendio de Historia del Carlismo,Oyarzun 1944, p. 495 immediately replaced outdated Pirala's work as the first reference book on history of Carlism, the position it would occupy itself for the next half of a century. Once completed the author did not re-edit the work for further releases; except minor changes, the 1939 and the 1969 versions almost do not differ.the 1944 edition contained few bibliographical improvements compared to the 1939 one. It also contained a new section titled Autocr√≠tica y cr√≠tica de los cr√≠ticos, dropped in subsequent editions Carlist standard Historia del Carlismo is structured in 33 chapters and covers the period from the 1830s to the 1930s. Its focus is clearly on military history, as the two Carlist wars are covered in 23 chapters; in comparison, the 60-year-long period after 1876 is treated in 4 chapters.Oyarzun was perfectly aware of the segmentation and kept defending it: \\"dedico 425 p√°ginas a las guerras y 175 a la lucha legal o pac√≠fica, y no llegan a 12 las que tratan de las escisiones integrista y mellista. Cualquier lector libre de prejuicios convendr√° conmigo en que la proporci√≥n es justa\\", Oyarzun 1944, p. 503, also El Correo Catalan 14.03.40. In Oyarzun's Historia, account of both wars constitutes some 75% of the volume; for Canal 2000 (adjusted to cover the period up to 1936 only) the figure is 31% Belligerent threads aside Oyarzun is concerned primarily with politics, much attention dedicated also to personalities and some to the doctrine; social transformations and economic issues are generally treated marginally. Since the author ignores non-Carlist Traditionalism the book tends to emphasize the dynastic question as the backbone of Carlism, especially that with the death of Alfonso Carlos he considers the Carlist history to be over. Like most synthetic works Historia does not contain references to sources, which might be a problem given at times it is referenced as a source itself. Except the epilogue narration is generally far from zealous style, and represents a midpoint between somewhat bombastic Oyarzun's pieces from the 1900s and his embittered, skepticism-ridden writings from the 1960s.compare his style of 1906, El Correo Espa√±ol 28.09.10, available here, and this of Pretendientes, published in 1966 Reception and legacy Historia del Carlismo Already during the Republic days Oyarzun's translation was received rather well.ABC 07.04.35, available here Later monographs on Cabrera and Villareal were acclaimedABC 03.12.61, available here and the former rewarded.ABC 03.12.61, available here Historia del Carlismo was welcome by scholarsABC 18.08.39, available here, La Vanguardia 11.02.40, available here and the public alike as certified by numerous re-editions, especially that the narrative ended conveniently in 1936 and did not pose a challenge to the official Francoist propaganda. Until the 1990s it remained the key concise volume on Carlist history, with an alternative offered only by massive and detailed series of Melchor Ferrer, appearing between the early 1940s and the late 1970s.Melchor Ferrer, Historia del tradicionalismo espa√±ol, vols. 1-30, Seville 1941-1979 As a primary source of scholarly reference Oyarzun's synthesis was replaced as late as in the late 20th century, by the 1990-1992 works of Clementefirst was a sketchy booklet by Josep Carles Clemente, El Carlismo: historia de una disidencia social (1833-1976), Madrid 1990, , followed by a more thorough Historia general del carlismo, Madrid 1992, and especially by the 2000 work of Canal.Jordi Canal, El carlismo, Madrid 2000, Until today it remains a must-have bibliographic entry of every work dealing with the Carlist history until the Civil War; a 2008 PhD dissertation declared it \\"the main reference work\\"\\"amely a mai napig a carlismo t√∂rt√©net√©vel foglalkoz√≥ szerz≈ëk legfontosabb referenciam≈±ve\\", Edina Pol√°cska, Karlista emigr√°ci√≥ Franciaorsz√°gban (1872‚Äì1876) [PhD dissertation University of Szeged], Szeged 2008, p. 10 and indeed another one of 2012 referred it 45 times.see Fern√°ndez Escudero 2012 Until recently, it was counted among \\" cl√°sicas obras\\",Eloy Fern√°ndez Clemente, Arag√≥n contempor√°neo: 1833-1936, Zaragoza 1975, , p. 132 acknowledged as \\"una obra a un tiempo de corte cl√°sico y moderno\\",also \\"muy veraz y equilibrado, de amplia informaci√≥n, de excelente desarrollo narrativo y claro juicio\\", ABC 26.07.69, available here \\"obra cl√°sica sobre la historia del carlismo\\",Historia del Carlismo de Rom√°n Oyarzun, [in:] Religi√≥n en Libertad service 14.05.10, available here \\"sintesis ya cl√°sica\\"Enrique F. Area Sacrist√°n, La incidiencia de los Nacionalismos excluyentes en la Profesionalizaci√≥n de las Fuerzas Armadas [PhD thesis Salamanca], Salamanca 2009, p. 297. Since the late 20th century the general reception of Historia del Carlismo has changed. It is now typically placed within \\"Traditionalist historiography\\", which usually though not alwaysfor exceptions compare e.g. \\"historiador carlista que conoc√≠a profundamente el alma del tradicionalismo\\", Ram√≥n Mar√≠a Rod√≥n Guinjoan, Invierno, primavera y oto√±o del carlismo (1939-1976) [PhD thesis Universitat Abat Oliba CEU], Barcelona 2015, pp. 54-55, \\"[Oyarzun belongs] do czo≈Ç√≥wki historyk√≥w karlistowskich\\", Jacek Bartyzel, Nic bez Boga, nic wbrew tradycji, Radzymin 2015, , pp. 18, 176 serves as a euphemism for bias and partiality.the classic case is Canal 2000, p. 26; the author presents Oyarzun as \\"en su vertiente tradicionalista\\". He groups works on Carlism into \\"traditionalist\\", \\"neo-traditionalist\\", \\"neo- Carlist\\" and \\"scholarly\\" rubrics, placing his own writings in the last one, pp. 402-426 Denied the credit of \\"objective or professional historiographic attention\\"Raymond Grew (ed.), Crises of Political Development in Europe and the United States, Princeton 1979, , p. 217 and \\"histoire critique\\",Pierre Villar, Histoire contemporaine de l‚ÄôEspagne, [in:] Revue historique 75 (1951), p. 303 the work is considered \\"‚Äûun breviario de partido\\",Urquijo Goitia 2009, p. 522 \\"propaganda carlista\\",Daniel Rivadulla Barrientos, Jes√∫s Ra√∫l Navarro Garc√≠a, Mar√≠a Teresa Berruezo, El exilio espa√±ol en Am√©rica en el siglo XIX, Madrid 1992, , p. 405 \\"prosa partidista\\",Jos√© Carlos Clemente, Carlos Hugo de Borb√≥n Parma: Historia de una Disidencia, Madrid 2001, , p. 23 \\"very partisan\\",Alice L.

The division was soon transferred back to the 9th Army, with which it retreated into the Caucasus after the start of the German summer offensive, Case Blue, in June. The 296th suffered heavy losses during the retreat, and on 5 August was disbanded.

The division spent the rest of the war as part of the 12th Rifle Corps or the 13th Rifle Corps, under which it guarded the Turkish and Iranian borders. In May 1945, the 296th was part of the 12th Rifle Corps. In September, when the corps became part of the Tbilisi Military District, the 296th was stationed at Poti.

Historical background In June 1940, France was invaded and occupied by Nazi troops. Taking this opportunity, in September of that year, Japanese imperialists invaded the Indochina peninsula then colonised by France. From here, Vietnam was dominated by two foreign powers, the French and the Japanese. The Vietnamese appear to have expected Japanese support for the uprising, given the fact that the Japanese had been aiding most other Southeast Asian nations with the hope that they would support the plan for the Greater East Asia Co- Prosperity Sphere. Instead the Vietnamese denounced the Japanese as traitors for not helping them to achieve independence from French colonial rule. With the anti-French sentiment and the imitation of the Bac Son revolutionary, many South Vietnamese provinces revolted against the French and Japanese. In Southern Indochina, the French had to deal with claims from Thailand which, backed by the Japanese, demanded territories situated to the Northwest of Cambodia's Tonle Sap and on the right bank of the Mekong River in Laos. Units of Vietnamese troops were sent to the front to fight the Thais. Some of these units stationed in Saigon decided to rebel against being sent to the front. This plan was part of the program of the Party Committee for Cochin-China which from June 1940 on had actively prepared for an uprising. A plan of action was worked out with the aim of combining the actions of military units in revolt with those of worker and peasant organizations throughout Cochin- China. As it so happened, the French did not go to war with Thailand, and thus they could devote their whole strength against the insurgents and easily decimated the South Vietnamese ICP\\". With this, it can be said that the insurgents who carried out the uprising had initially believed that Thailand would involve themselves in the conflict, causing a distraction to the French, which would help them, unfortunately for them, this would not happen. Preparation In March 1940, the Standing Committee of the Party, headed by Mr. V√µ VƒÉn T·∫ßn, drafted the outline to prepare for sporadic activities in the anti-French movement, and then prepared for armed uprising. Besides, many demonstrations were held during that time. Self-defense forces and guerrillas which directly led by V√µ VƒÉn T·∫ßn, Phan ƒêƒÉng L∆∞u were formed in big factories in Saigon such as Ba Son, FACI, pier, Cho Quan lamp, In rural areas, most communes had a squadron or even a guerrilla platoon. Popular discontent was on the rise in the South and provided, at least momentarily, an opportunity for the ICP to release its frustration at the events since the previous September. At the root of the unrest in the South was economics. High taxes, a fall in the price of rice, and an increase in unemployment all served to cut the standard of living for the average Vietnamese. Throughout the spring and summer of 1940, peasant riots against French conscription for military service along the Cambodian-Thai border, where the threat of war was high. Peasant protests against conscription took place in several towns and villages throughout the delta. As the wave of discontent in the South rose, the Party's Regional Committee for Cochin China attempted to ride the crest, concentrating its propaganda on peasants and newly drafted Vietnamese troops. Since the restoration of the Party apparatus in Cochin China in the early 1930s, the regional Party organization under the direction of Stalin School graduate Tran Van Giau had possessed a unique degree of autonomy and under Giau's autocratic leadership was somewhat inclined toward making decisions independent of the national party leadership. Now, with almost all members of the ICP central Committee in the South in jail, regional leaders took matters in their own hands and began to plan for a general uprising in response to the decisions reached at the Sixth Plenum the previous November. After the French surrender to Nazi Germany in June, they hastily convened an expanded Party conference in My Tho, deep in the heart of the Mekong delta and agreed to initiate preparations for the insurrection. By autumn, half the indigenous troops in Cochin China were allegedly sympathetic to the Communists, with ICP sources estimating that up to 30 percent of the entire population of the colony was on its side. All blacksmiths produced weapons day by day in order to provide ammunition to army. The anti-war movement, combating the soldiers with the slogan \\"no soldier, no penny for imperial war\\" took place the people and soldiers community. Due to good military service, most of the 15,000 Vietnamese soldiers in the French army stationed in Saigon were willing to co- ordinate the uprising.D∆∞∆°ng Trung Qu·ªëc, 2001, Vi·ªát Nam nh·ªØng s·ª± ki·ªán l·ªãch s·ª≠ (1919‚Äì1945), H√† N·ªôi, Nh√† xu·∫•t b·∫£n Gi√°o d·ª•c Development Party leaders in Cochin China, however, were understandably hoping to seek support for the uprising from revolutionary elements elsewhere in the country, and in October they sent Phan ƒêƒÉng L∆∞u, representative of the Central Committee of the Indochinese Communist Party, to consult with members of the ICP Regional Committee for Tonkin. North Vietnamese delegates had not been able to attend the Sixth Plenum in November 1939 and were thus not well informed about the Central Committee's plans to move toward a general insurrection against French colonial rule. Several members of the regional committee, including Truong Cinh, Hoang Van Thu, and Hoang Quoc Viet met with Phan Dang Luu in early November in a suburb of Hanoi. The meeting took place in the immediate aftermath of the abortive revolt in Bac Son, and its decisions reflected an understandable ambivalence about the possibilities of armed uprising. The session reaffirmed the decision of the Sixth Plenum to begin preparations for a future armed uprising against French power, and it affirmed the contention that, if conditions were favorable, a local uprising could be launched in one area of the country even if Vietnamese society as a whole was not in a revolutionary situation. But it condemned what it considered the mistakes committed at Bac Son. The local leadership at Bac Son, it claimed, did not know how to establish revolutionary power, did not know how to conduct propaganda activities and develop revolutionary strength, and, when the battle was over, did not know how to retreat. The decision to abandon the cities for the countryside was termed an error that weakened the Party's urban base. Then, it said, the Party had lost an opportunity to launch a general uprising after French surrendered in June 1940. Finally, it criticized the new united front as vaguely defined and not sufficiently focused on the worker-peasant alliance. Looking to the future, the plenum concluded that Vietnam was not yet in a directly revolutionary situation, but that the revolution could break out in the form of local uprising where conditions were appropriate, leading the way toward a general uprising that would result in a seizure of power in the country as a whole. In perpetration for that moment, the Committee members called for the conservation of the remnants of the Bac Son forces, which were to be reorganized as guerrilla units, and for a revolutionary base in the Viet Bac to wait for the appropriate moment to launch an uprising. Given the judgments above, it is not surprising that the meeting suspected that conditions for an armed uprising were lacking in the South. Local forces were too small, and units in the Center and the North were in no position to give adequate support. So Phan Dang Luu was informed that an uprising in Cochin China should be postponed until the Central Committee could send a representative to check on the national situation and provide proper leadership. If the uprising should fail in spite of such preparations, the rebels must be prepared to make an orderly retreat and transform the defeated forces into guerrilla units. The meeting also took steps to reconstitute the ICP Central Committee, which had become nearly defunct as the result of the recent arrest of most of its members in the South. Acting on the authority of the one remaining member, Phan Dang Luu, those in attendance named themselves a new provisional central committee with Truong Cinh serving temporarily as general secretary until new elections could be held. This November meeting of the Regional Committee of Tonkin is thus known in Party histories as the Seventh Plenum of the ICP. Immediately after the meeting, Phan Dang Luu returned to Cochin China to give his colleagues the bad news that their comrades in Tonkin did not favor a general uprising. But on the evening of 22 November he was arrested by French police at the railway station in Saigon. Advised in advance of the revolt, the French declared martial law and disarmed all indigenous troops in the area. In the Mekong delta, however, the Regional Committee was growing increasingly restive. With 15,000 in the uprising organization and the rebellious troops increasingly impatient for action, the Regional Committee now decided that it could wait no longer for the return of Phan Dang Luu and decided to schedule the outbreak for the night of 22‚Äì23 November. the uprising was concentrated on several district and provincial capitals throughout the Mekong delta. French military posts were to be attacked, communications links cut, and revolutionary power established at the village level. Attacks took place as scheduled in such delta towns as Soc Trang, Bac Lieu, Tan An, Vinh Long and Can Tho, as well as in rural areas along the edge of the Plain of Reeds. In some areas, the masses seized power, formed revolutionary tribunals to punish class enemies, and raised flags in the name of the National United Front. These were plans for an attack on Saigon as well, but the French prevented disturbances by confiscating weapons and blocking entrances to the city. The course of the insurrection can be divided into three periods. The first period was from 22 to 30 November which was the most intense period of the insurgency. The second was from 30 to 13 December when the insurrection spread to the region of the inter-provincial committee of Long Xuyen and to Rach Gia and Bac Lieu. The final period from 12 to 31 December is centered on the Poulo-Obi incident in Bac Lieu The revolutionary governments were existed in very short time, the longest one in My Tho was about 49 days. French colonialists vehemently oppressed, seeking to destroy the revolutionary government. It was during this uprising that the flag of North Vietnam was raised at Cao Lanh in the western delta. The revolt began in the Plaine des Joncs in the western delta and none of the northern provinces were affected. The slogans of the uprising included \\"Land to the Tillers, Freedom for the workers and independence for Vietnam\\". One of the leaders of the uprising was a man who later became the father of the trade union movement in Vietnam, Tran Quoc Buu. Buu was the founder of the CVT. = The 22‚Äì30 November Period = The most intense fighting occurred simultaneously on 22 and 23 November 1940 in Gia Dinh, Cholon, My Tho and Can Tho, which were centres of inter-provincial committees of the ICP. The attacks started at 10 pm on 22 November. The success of the insurrection in Gia Dinh My Tho and Can Tho on 22 and 23 November persuaded ICP insurgents in other provinces to fight. As a result, from 23 November, the insurrection spread to many provinces, even though by that time the government had started to retaliate by using all its force to suppress the rebellion. These included aerial bombardment and the leveling of many villages. However, the government was not able to stop the uprising in the provinces. Village notables were the main targets of the attacks because they were representatives of the colonial administration of the village level. Even though their administrative power was very limited, they were still the liaison between the colonial administration and the peasants. = The 30 November-13 December period = This was the period where the insurrection in Gia Dinh, My Tho and Can Tho became less intense and the ICP was on the defensive but when fighting broke out in the inter-provincial region of Long Xuyen. Communist insurgents in that region were in disarray due to the repressive measures of the government, and were not able to rise at the same time as their comrades in other areas even though they received the insurrection order on 22 November. The ICP in this region lost a good opportunity, given that the Inter-Provincial Committee of Long Xuyen was very active in preparing the insurrection. The Long Xuyen Committee ordered its party members to manufacture arms and ammunition in September, and that in October it asked the Cochin China Committee to send instructors to teach tactics to the guerrilla groups newly formed by the Committee. Moreover, the Far West region had serious peasants problems in the second half of the 1930s which would have been an important factor if the ICP were to win over the masses should the insurrection have taken place as originally planned. The main targets were the three town centres and their suburbs. Strategic targets such as post offices, police stations and ferries were included in the attack plans. Due to bad communications between party members and the arrest of important members of the party, the provinces of Rach Gia and Bac Lieu remained calm during this period, even though Rach Gia was the first province able to form an insurrection group, in September 1940, Ben Tre also saw only small-scale fighting during this period. = The 13‚Äì31 December Period = The high point of this period was the attack on Poulo Obi lighthouse in Ca Mau district on 13 and 14 December which cost the life of M Olivier, A French lighthouse keeper. By the second half of December, the insurrection had lost momentum and was dying down. In most areas the ICP had to retreat, and the insurgents were only able to distribute tracts or threaten village notables but no serious attacks were undertaken. In Gia Dinh, as well as in Tan An and the Plain of Reeds, the insurgents had to retreat to the dense forests to avoid being hunted down by the authorities. According to a French report, by mid-December, the government was able to control the situation. Thousands of villages who had fled during the insurrection started to return to their homes. Schools reopened and confidence in the French authorities among the Vietnamese was gradually revived. By the end of the year, the insurrection had completely died down. = Class distinction during the uprising = The picture of solidarity between the revolutionaries and the rich peasants is contradicted by another account of the period, that the revolutionaries destroyed the crops of some rich peasants and well-off middle peasants who possessed a lot of land. A poor peasant whose resentment of the wealthier classes in his village still burned bright in 1971 said that in the pre-1945 period village officials had to be at least middle peasants, and that middle peasants were allied to the landlords and with the hamlet and village te or officials. Village officials were not without their own influence and support against the insurrection, but it was usually not enough to stem the tide. In the market town of Tan Hiep, the village chief had gathered 200 villagers to support the soldiers in the post against the large crown of peasants insurrectionists sweeping through the area. When the crowd approached, however, the villagers all fled, leaving the village officials and militia to cope with the situation. As during the \\"Vietnam War\\" period, loyalty to the authority structure did not always extend to defending it to the death, and there was often an asymmetry of commitment between the followers of the opposing sides. The class categories mentioned in later accounts by witnesses of the 1940 Cochinchina Uprising and the August 1945 revolution were assigned only later, during the land reform after 1945. several interview sources assert that there was little or no awareness of class labels at this time, but only a general awareness of a great divide between the minority of the rich and the majority of the poor in their province. The social and economic dominance of a small number of large landholders and the very high percentage of the rural population who were poor and landless peasants make it easy to see why the simple rich-poor categorization of provincial society was prevalent at the time. It is also clear, however, that almost all observers of these events had little difficulty in retrospectively identifying the different socioeconomic positions of the protagonists of social conflict in the 1930s in terms of the more highly differentiated class categories of a later period, even though the exact designations and terminology may have been applied retrospectively. The seems to have been a case of a new analytic framework so exactly fitting the reality of the times that it seemed always to have been true. Everyone knew, for example, that landlords were people who owned more land than was necessary to support their families, and that they did not work the land but rented it out. Rich peasants were a less distinct category but it was generally understood that they were in essence small landlords who owned less land but still more than they needed for bare survival, who farmed what they could themselves but hired laborers or rented what they could not work to tenants. Middle peasants were self-sufficient owner-cultivators who owned just enough land to support their families, and who worked it themselves. Poor peasants may have owned a bit of land but not enough to support a family. Typically, they were tenants who rented a specified piece of land from one of the large landholders. Very poor peasants were landless peasants who worked as occasional hired laborers, usually in a depressed labor market. Although these class categories were more elaborately defined during the subsequent land reform period, they were simple and serviceable ways to describe the social reality of the 1930s and 1940s and were used consistently by both interviewees and written sources. The French response was swift. In Saigon an attempted uprising was quelled in a day; in the delta, unrest dragged on and was finally put down in early December. Unlike their counterparts in the Viet Bac, the rebels were unable to preserve their forces by retreating to isolated areas, and their defeat signaled the temporary collapse of the Party in Cochin China.  Aftermath  The Communist movement in the south was gravely set back after the suppression of the 1940 uprising, an upsurge of the Hoa Hao movement taking advantage of the new situation. Surviving Communists then purged their own ranks, condemning several to death on the accusation of being double agents. Much later, on the seventeenth anniversary of the uprising, the former chairman of the Viet Minh Committee of the south, Tran Van Giau, cited the November 1940 example as a warning to militants to bide their time against Diem's repressions, least a premature uprising in the south be crushed in 1957 as in 1940 The principal reasons for these failures were that the communists had insufficient men and arms and that the colonial police and security services had broken into the party's communications networks. The repression was directed by the governor of Indochina, Rivoal and his inspector of political and administrative affairs, Brasey, whose chief aide was Nguyen Van Tam. Some 50 people were guillotined, including Nguyen Thi Minh Khai, the sister in law of Vo Nguyen Giap. In the face of defeat, the province insurrection leadership made three decisions. First, put all the people captured during the uprising of trial right away. The intention was to scare them but release them, recognizing that if they were badly mistreated, they-or their friends, allies and family-would later seek revenge which would not be advantageous for the revolution. There should be no repeat of the public execution of Constable Trau in 1930. A People's Court was set up, with prosecutors chosen from among the peasants and Party members overseeing the proceedings. All those detained were released after warnings not to repress the revolution if they did return to work for the French. The second decision made by the province leadership was to break open the rice granaries and distribute the rice to the needy. The peasants needed little encouragement In Nhi Binh village, they seized the granaries of Nguyen Thanh Long, a large landlord and Doc Phu Mau in Ngu Hiep, as well as other smaller landlords. It took the peasants three days to cart away the contents of Doc Phu Mau's granary. In Long Trung village, the granary of Ho Khai Khoa was spared because his son aligned himself with the revolution. The third decision of the province leadership was to order the insurrection participants to retreat back into clandestiny, hide their weapons and wait for an order from the Central Committee for a second uprising. Jennings has called the French reaction to the uprising \\"repressive\\" and has also used terms such as \\"repressive\\" and \\"brutal\\", highlighting how serious the uprising was to the French. Interestingly enough, he also suggests that the event was important in highlighting the need for rural reform as he credits the uprising to the \\"diminishing prestige of conservative pro-French patriarchs.\\" The Cochinchina Uprising was a traumatic event but it did not leave as big a mark on My Tho as might have been expected. The event does not feature prominently in revolutionary historiography because it was judged to be a rash and premature act, taken without authorization from the Party's top leadership. It did, of course, result in the temporary breakup of the small band of clandestine organizers. Despite the reports of hundreds or even thousands of participants, and the temporary immobilization of the French authority in much of My Tho province, it seems that the number of core activists was relatively small.

Background Jobar is a suburb of Syria's capital city Damascus. The suburb is located approximately northeast of the Damascus city center. Attack On 24 August 2013, a group of Syrian Army soldiers were clearing buildings from opposition forces in Jobar. Around 11:00, the intensity of the shooting from the opposition side subsided and the soldiers believed the rebels were retreating. Then, an improvised explosive device detonated with a low noise about 10 meters from them. The IED reportedly released \\"a very badly smelling gas\\". 10 soldiers were injured and evacuated to the nearest medical point where they were treated with intravenous fluids and oxygen before being sent to Martyr Yusuf Al Azmah Military Hospital for further treatment. Four of them were severely affected. Another 20 soldiers came later with similar symptoms, but they were in stable condition and could, after some time, be sent back to their units. All patients received \\"atropine, HI-6, steroids, oxygen therapy and fluids treatment.\\" Aftermath The UN mission received soil samples from the impact site and remnants of two IEDs allegedly used to disperse the chemical agent. The soil samples tested positive for sarin. However, the UN mission \\"could not verify the chain of custody for this sampling and subsequent analysis\\". On 30 August 2013, the UN mission visited the affected soldiers at a military hospital.

Located adjacent to the Central Silk Board office complex near BTM Layout at the intersection of Hosur Road and Outer Ring Road, the junction is known for its bottleneck traffic congestion as it is one of the busiest intersections in India. Problem The Silk Board junction acts as a gateway to the two important IT clusters in Bangalore‚Äìthe Outer Ring Road cluster (Marathahalli, Whitefield and Bellandur) towards the east and Electronic City to the south. The proximity to these two major hubs in the city, known as the \\"IT capital of India\\", has led to bottleneck of vehicular movement at the junction. According to a study conducted by Consortium of Traffic Engineers and Safety Trainers in 2017, the average speed of vehicles at the junction during peak hours is , the lowest in the city. This junction also features among the seven worst traffic bottlenecks in India, a list compiled by Ola Cabs as part of a study. The junction is also one of the two most polluted areas in the city (the other being Whitefield), according to Karnataka State Pollution Control Board's survey in 2016, recording high levels of residual suspended particulate matter well above the national permissible limit; the high pollution level has been attributed to the traffic congestion at the junction. Action Complex of the Central Silk Board office In 2014, the Silk Board junction bus stop was moved away from the junction towards HSR Layout in order to ensure free vehicular movement. In 2016, the Government of Karnataka and Bangalore Development Authority gave the go-ahead to a controlled access road from the Silk Board junction to K. R. Puram Outer Ring Road at a cost of 121 crore. In 2017, a flyover near Padmanabhanagar, which will be part of a signal-free corridor from Nayandahalli junction to Silk Board junction, was inaugurated. In January 2017, the Outer Ring Road Namma Metro line from Silk Board junction to K. R. Puram proposed by BMRCL, estimated to cost 4,202 crore, was approved by the government. The interchange station at Silk Board would cost approximately 900 crore, and would require acquisition of two acres of land of the Central Silk Board office and quarter acre each on either side of the road. BMRCL also announced the construction of a long road-cum-rail flyover between Ragigudda and Silk Board junction. The flyover will be built above the ground while the metro line is planned to be constructed from the surface, making it the first Metro project in which metrorail would run above a flyover.

Its first formation was formed in the summer of 1941 and destroyed during Case Blue, the German summer offensive towards Stalingrad, in 1942. Reformed in the summer of 1943, the division's second formation fought in combat for the rest of the war before being disbanded postwar.  History  = First Formation = The division began forming on 2 July 1941 at Lubny in the Kharkov Military District. Its basic order of battle included the 1055th, 1057th, and the 1059th Rifle Regiments, as well as the 824th Artillery Regiment. On 12 August, the 297th was assigned to the Southwestern Front's 38th Army. In early September, the division absorbed elements of the Kremenchug Militia Division, from which it may have received mountain and infantry reconnaissance companies. The division escaped from the Kiev pocket, and after October 1941 became part of the 21st Army, fighting in the Kursk-Belgorod area. During the 21st Army's attack in the Second Battle of Kharkov, the 297th was in a secondary sector. The division and its army were able to avoid being destroyed in the Kharkov pocket but were weakened. In June, the 297th was forced to retreat by the German summer offensive, Case Blue, but suffered heavy losses and was disbanded on 15 July. = Second Formation = The division was reformed on 25 July 1943 from the 253rd Rifle Brigade, part of the Southwestern Front's 33rd Rifle Corps, and included the same basic order of battle as the previous division. The 33rd Corps was assigned to the 8th Guards Army soon after. In late August, the division was transferred to the 3rd Guards Army but in October returned to the 8th Guards Army. In November the 33rd Rifle Corps and the 297th were sent into the 3rd Ukrainian Front reserve. In early 1944 the division became part of the 7th Guards Army, but was withdrawn to the reserve again in March, this time in the 2nd Ukrainian Front. In April the 297th became part of the 27th Guards Rifle Corps, which became part of the 27th Army in May. From June to September the corps was in the front reserve. Beginning in late fall, the 297th fought in the Siege of Budapest, during which it was transferred back and forth between front reserves and various armies. Between October 1944 and March 1945, the division served in the 53rd Army and the 7th Guards Army, and in the 37th Rifle Corps and the 18th Guards Rifle Corps in front reserves. The 297th fought in the Vienna Offensive, at the beginning of which it was assigned to the 46th Army's 68th Rifle Corps. The division was disbanded between 1945 and 1946 in the Odessa Military District or the Tauric Military District.

The symbol was first \\"perceived\\" and drawn by Slava Dzhana√Øty, an architect and painter who also undertook the restoration of the Rekom Temple (an important Ossetian shrine) after an accidental fire destroyed it in 1995. Assianism (, Assianstvo) or Scythian Neopaganism is a modern Pagan religion based on the traditional folk religious beliefs of the Ossetians, modern descendants of the Scythians of the Alan tribes, believed to be a continuation of the ancient Scythian religion. The religion is known as \\"Assianism\\" among its Russian adherents (\\"Assianism\\" means the religion of the \\"As\\" or \\"Os\\"‚Äîan ancient name of the Alans, from which the Greeks possibly drew the name of \\"Asia\\", which is preserved in the Russian and Georgian-derived name \\"Ossetians\\"), and as Uatsdin (–£–∞—Ü–¥–∏–Ω) or √Üts√¶g Din (√Ü—Ü√¶–≥ –î–∏–Ω; both meaning \\"True Faith\\") or √Üss Din (√Ü—Å—Å –î–∏–Ω, Ossetian-language rendering of \\"Assianism\\") by Ossetians in their own language. It started to be revived in a conscious and organised way in the 1980s, as an ethnic religion among the Ossetians. The religion has been incorporated by some organisations, chiefly in North Ossetia‚ÄìAlania within Russia, but is also present in South Ossetia, and in Ukraine. Some Russians have embraced Assianism by virtue of the fact that most of the ancient Scythians were assimilated by the East Slavs, and therefore modern Russians may reclaim Scythian culture. Among Russians, Assianism is advocated as a religion for all Slavs, Indo-Europeans, or even as a worldwide spiritual heritage. The Nart sagas are central to the religion, and exponents of the movement have drawn theological exegeses from them. Etymology The revival of Ossetian folk religion as an organised religious movement was initially accorded the formal name √Üts√¶g Din (√Ü—Ü√¶–≥ –î–∏–Ω, \\"True Faith\\") in the 1980s by a group of nationalist intellectuals who in the early 1990s constituted the sacerdotal Styr Nykhas (\\"Great Council\\"). √Üts√¶g, meaning \\"truthful\\", is the name of the foundational kinship in the Nart sagas, while din corresponds to the Avestan daena, meaning divine \\"understanding\\" or \\"conscience\\", and today \\"religion\\". Fearing that the concept of √Üts√¶g Din carried implications of universal truth that might offend Christians and Muslims, the Ossetian linguist Tamerlan Kambolov coined the alternative term Uatsdin (–£–∞—Ü–¥–∏–Ω) in 2010, which has become the most common name for the religion in Ossetian. Daurbek Makeyev, the most known exponent of the movement, has preferred to name it √Üss Din (√Ü—Å—Å –î–∏–Ω), meaning the \\"religion of the √Üss\\", \\"As\\" or \\"Os\\", an alternative ancient name of the Alans, preserved in the Russian and Georgian name \\"Ossetians\\", and root from which the ancient Greeks likely drew the term \\"Asia\\". In his Russian-language writings Makeyev has used the Russian variation Assianstvo (–ê—Å—Å–∏–∞–Ω—Å—Ç–≤–æ), \\"Assianism\\". Ruslan Kurchiev, president of the Styr Nykhas in 2019, prefers to define Assianism as a \\"culture\\" rather than a \\"religion\\", claiming that what it champions are rituals and values which are encapsulated in the Ossetian tradition. History Khozy Dzuar Temple in Tapankau, Alagirsky District, North Ossetia‚ÄìAlania. =From the ancient Scythians to the modern Ossetians= The Scythians were a large group of Iranian (linguistically Eastern Iranian) nomadic tribes who populated the Eurasian Steppe during the first millennium BCE, from Eastern Europe to western China. Their name \\"Scythians\\" comes from Greek, Œ£Œ∫œçŒ∏ŒøŒπ Skuthoi, meaning the \\"archers\\", a skill for which they were known and feared. They left a rich cultural legacy, particularly in the form of gold jewellery, frequently found in the \\"kurgan\\" burials associated with them. They practised the ancient Iranian religion. A group of Scythian tribes, the Sarmatians, known as the Alans (i.e. \\"Aryans\\", through a common internal consonant shift, i.e. \\"Iranians\\") from the first century onwards, migrated into Europe. Allied with the Germanic Goths, the Alans penetrated west into France, Italy, Spain, and other territories under the Roman Empire. The Romans tried to manage the threat by hiring them as mercenaries in the cavalry, or, particularly in France, by buying them off as landed gentry. Many toponyms in France, such as Alainville, Alaincourt, Alen√ßon, and others, testify that they were territorial possessions of Alan families. Alan equestrian culture formed the basis of Medieval chivalry, and thus had a significant role in the development of Western European culture. While most of the Scythians assimilated into other ethnic groups by the Middle Ages, the Alans of the Caucasus maintained a distinct identity and continued to dominate the area, so that the Byzantine Empire recognised them as an independent allied kingdom. Through their relations with the Byzantines and missionaries from Georgia in the south, the Alan aristocracy adopted Eastern Orthodox Christianity during the tenth century. This, however, had little effect on the general Alan population, so that the thirteenth-century Flemish traveller William of Rubruck reported that \\"they knew nothing (of Christianity) apart from the name of Christ\\". The Ossetians are the sole modern population culturally and linguistically descending from the Alans, and they have preserved beliefs and rituals likely dating back to Scythian religion, even though through waves of partial syncretisation with Christianity. After the conquests of the Mongol Empire in the Caucasus during the mid-thirteenth century, contacts between the Alans and Eastern Orthodox religious authorities ceased completely, and their superficial Christianisation was stopped. There is evidence that between the fourteenth and the seventeenth century, shrines which were apparently built in honour of Christian saints were converted to indigenous Pagan use. The Russian Empire's expansion in the Caucasus by the end of the eighteenth century brought with itself Russian Orthodox missionaries who sought to \\"re- Christianise\\" the Ossetians. Their efforts had had limited success by the time when they were completely obliterated by the Russian Revolution of 1917, which introduced the peoples of the Caucasus into the rapid processes of industrialisation, modernisation and urbanisation of the Soviet Union. =Between the traditional and the new religion= The Ossetian people are today split between two states: North Ossetia‚ÄìAlania, a constituent federal republic within Russia, and the neighbouring only partially recognised state of South Ossetia. The incipient collapse of the Soviet Union in the 1980s triggered projects of identity-building among many of its constituent nations. In Ossetia, as in other nations, this involved the recovery of an \\"authentic national religion\\" harkening back to pre-Christian times. Ossetian nationalism also played a role, powered by ethnic conflicts for lands and resources with neighbouring peoples in North Ossetia, and for independence in South Ossetia, a territory historically part of Georgia, whose status as an independent entity is a matter of international controversy (cf. the 2008 Russo-Georgian War). According to Victor Shnirelman, in the Ossetian case certain traditions had survived with unbroken continuity and were revived in rural areas. This contrasts, and interacts, with an urban and more intellectual movement which elaborated a systematic revived religion associated with ethnic nationalism and with the opposition to both Russian and Georgian Orthodox Christianity, perceived as foreign, and to Islam, professed by the neighbouring Turkic and Caucasian ethnic groups and by a small minority of Ossetians. According to the scholar Sergey Shtyrkov, intellectual projects for the elaboration of an \\"ethnic religion\\" for the Ossetians date back to the early twentieth century, and it was with the Soviet atheist anti-religious \\"furious fight against Ossetian Paganism\\" in the 1950s that the idea appealed once again to Ossetian intellectuals. According to him it was Soviet anti-religious activism that drove ancient local practices from the sphere of \\"ethnic tradition\\" into the sphere of \\"religion\\" in the minds of the Ossetian people. The scholar Richard Foltz reconstructs the development of Ossetian religion through seven phases: 1. An original Scythian Paganism; 2. a first wave of Christianisation under Byzantine and Georgian influence from the tenth to the thirteenth century; 3. a \\"re-Paganization\\" during the fourteenth and fifteenth century following the Mongol invasions and the disruption of the contacts with the Byzantines; 4. a partial re-Christianisation during the sixteenth and seventeenth century conducted by Georgian missionaries; 5. a further re-Christianisation conducted by Russian missionaries beginning in the late eighteenth century; 6. enforced state atheism during the Soviet Union from 1921 to 1991; and 7. a resurgence of \\"traditional Ossetian religion\\" since the 1980s‚Äì1990s. According to Foltz, the narrative of the contemporary promoters of Scythian Neopaganism is that the religiosity of the Ossetians maintained a strong underlying continuity while absorbing and adapting superficial influences from Christianity, and to a lesser extent from Islam and neighbouring Caucasian traditions, superficial influences which may be easily stripped away to reveal its essential, distinct \\"Iranian character\\". Since the fall of the Soviet Union, Ossetian politicians have been outspokenly supportive of Scythian Assianism. During the 1990s, after the clashes between Ossetians and Georgians in 1991‚Äì1992, a field besides a sacred grove 30 kilometres to the west of North Ossetia‚ÄìAlania's capital Vladikavkaz, where the Ossetian hero Khetag was said to have taken refuge from his enemies, was dedicated by the government as a holy site. Since 1994, sacrifices are held at the site with the participation of government officials and community leaders, with activities supervised by the sacerdotal Great Council (Styr Nykhas). The ceremony is dedicated to the most important deity, Uastyrdzhi, said to have saved Khetag from his pursuers. Government participation is also seen at the ceremonies organised at the Rekom Temple in Tsey, Alagirsky District, North Ossetia‚ÄìAlania. Writings The Nart sagas are regarded as the \\"holy writings\\" of Assianism, from which some exegetes of the movement, such as Daurbek Makeyev, have drawn theological doctrines. The scholar Richard Foltz defines the Narts a \\"typical Indo-European heroic epic\\". According to Makeyev, who according to Foltz takes an essentialist perspective, \\"the framework [i.e., the rituals that actualise the content of the books] is changeable\\" and yet \\"the meaning is eternal\\", and \\"the ultimate divine reality is light\\", reflecting a theme shared by all Iranian religions. According to the scholar Sergey Shtyrkov, the Assian exegetes have created \\"their own dogma and theological system\\", through etymology and comparison with other Indo-Iranian traditions. Foltz finds this effort to elaborate theological doctrines from traditional texts comparable to similar efforts found in Germanic Heathenry and modern Hellenism. The artist and architect Slava Dzhana√Øty has published many books on the Ossetian folk religion, emphasising its philosophical aspects in contrast to the more practical leaning of Makeyev's writings. Theology and cosmology Statue of Uastyrdzhi in Alagirsky District, North Ossetia‚ÄìAlania. =God and its triune manifestations= Assianism contemplates the worship of a supreme God, Xwytsau (–•—É—ã—Ü–∞—É), who is the creator of the universe and of all beings. The supreme God may be called upon by a multiplicity of epithets, including simply \\"Styr Xwytsau\\" (–°—Ç—ã—Ä –•—É—ã—Ü–∞—É), meaning \\"Great God\\", but also \\"Dunesk√¶n√¶g\\" (–î—É–Ω–µ—Å–∫√¶–Ω√¶–≥), \\"Creator of the Universe\\", \\"Mesk√¶n√¶g Xwytsau\\" (–ú–µ—Å–∫–∞–µ–Ω–∞–µ–≥ –•—É—ã—Ü–∞—É) and \\"Xwytsauty Xwytsau\\" (–•—É—ã—Ü–∞—É—Ç—Ç—ã –•—É—ã—Ü–∞—É), meaning \\"God of the Gods\\". Assian theology affirms that God is within every creature, and in men it manifests as reason and right action. Lesser gods and spirits, including the most important of them, Uastyrdzhi, are worshipped as intermediaries of Xwytsau. Assian theology is monistic, although God unfolds in triads. The fundamental triad is that of God‚Äìmatter‚Äìspirit: * Xwytsau / Xuitsau (–•—É—ã—Ü–∞—É, \\"Heaven\\") ‚Äî is the supreme God of the universe, the source of it and of the highest wisdom attainable by men, creator and patron of worlds, without either image or form, ineffable and omnipresent; * Iwag / Iuag (–ò—É–∞–≥) or Iu√¶g (–ò—É√¶–≥) ‚Äî is the substance-matter of everything, both uncreated and created worlds; * Ud (–£–¥) ‚Äî is the universal self, that is attained by an individual soul when it identifies with Mon (–ú–æ–Ω), the universal mind-spirit, i.e. God's manifestation; ultimately, Mon and Ud are the same, and they are Xwytsau's manifestation. On the plane of the phenomenon, God's universal mind-spirit further manifests as the triad of: * Uas / Was (–£–∞—Å) ‚Äî the good-spell or good- word, the order of God, which produces well-being in reality; * Uastyrdzhi / Wastyrji (–£–∞—Å—Ç—ã—Ä–¥–∂–∏) ‚Äî the good-spell incarnated in men, who are bearers of divine reason, enlightened consciousnesses, awareness of God; in other words, Uastyrdzhi is the archetype of the perfected man, follower of the order of God; * Duagi / dwagi (–¥—É–∞–≥–∏; pl. –¥–∞—É–¥–∂—ã—Ç√¶ ‚Üí daudzhyt√¶ / daujyt√¶), otherwise called –∞ss (—Å—Å, pl. –∞—Å–æ–≤ ‚Üí asov; cf. the Germanic ese) ‚Äî gods, divine entities endowed with right and measure, which continuously mould the world alternating forms according to the order of God; the most important among them are the arvon daujita (–∞—Ä–≤–æ–Ω –¥–∞—É–¥–∂–∏—Ç–∞), the seven divine forces of the seven planets. Another distinction is established between the three cosmological states of: * Zedy (–∑—ç–¥—ã, pl. –∑–∞–¥—Ç√¶ ‚Üí zadt√¶) ‚Äî forces which live according to the order of God, and thus are worthy of veneration; * Uayugi (—É–∞–π—É–≥–∏, pl. —É–∞–π–≥—É—ã—Ç√¶ / —É–∞–π–≥—É—ã—Ç–∞ ‚Üí uayguyt√¶ / uayguyta) ‚Äî degenerate parasitic forces which distance from enlightenment, violating the order of God; in mankind they are the cause of passions, fears, pride and nervous diseases; * Dalimon (–î–∞–ª–∏–º–æ–Ω) or D√¶limon (–î√¶–ª–∏–º–æ–Ω) ‚Äî the lowest possible state of mind when it identifies with brute matter, chaos. =The seven deities= √Üfsati, the Ossetian god of wild animals and patron of hunters, in the Ossetian mountains. Like other ancient Iranian religions, the ancient Scythian religion contemplated seven deities (–∞—Ä–≤–æ–Ω –¥–∞—É–¥–∂–∏—Ç–∞, arvon daujita), each of which associated to a planet and to certain natural phenomena. Herodotus attested the seven Scythian gods as: Papaios (corresponding to Zeus), the sky god; Tabiti (Hestia), the hearth goddess (today called Safa); Api (Gaia), the earth goddess; Oitosyros (Apollo), the sun god; Argimpasa (Aphrodite), the fertility goddess; and \\"Herakles\\" and \\"Ares\\" for whom Herodotus did not provide the Scythian name. In ancient Ossetian, the seven days of the week were still named after the seven deities. According to Foltz, \\"Ares\\" was probably Mithra, and the modern Uastyrdzhi; he was widely worshipped through altars in the form of a sword planted in a pile of stones or brushwood, a cult perhaps reflected in the Arthurian legend of the sword in the stone, likely brought to Britain by Alan regiments settled there by the Romans in the first century. The cult of the sword continued among the Alans as late as the first century CE. Herodotus also mentioned an eighth deity worshipped among the Royal Scythians, Thagimasidas, the water god, equated with Poseidon. The modern Ossetians have preserved the sevenfold-eighthfold structure, though the deities have changed as have their names, which in some cases are adaptations of the names of Christian saints: Uastyrdzhi (whose name derives from \\"Saint George\\"), the god of contracts and war (the Iranian Mithra); Uatsilla (\\"Saint Elijah\\"), the thunder god; Tutyr (Saint \\"Theodore\\"), the protector of wolves; F√¶lv√¶ra (maybe the conflation of \\"Florus and Laurus\\"), the protector of livestock; Kurdal√¶gon, the blacksmith god (the Iranian Kaveh, Kawa); Donbettyr, the water god; Mikaelgabyrta (conflation of \\"Michael and Gabriel\\"), the fertility and underworld god; and √Üfsati, the hunt god. =Ethics= According to Assian doctrines, human nature is the same as the nature of all being. Mankind is a microcosm within a macrocosm, or broader context, and the same is true for all other beings. The universe is kept in harmony by Uas (the good-word), the order of God, the foundation of divine reason and nobility. The deities (daujita) form the world according to this universal law, while demons (uayguyta) are those entities which act disrupting the good contexts of the deities, and are the causes of illness and death. These positive and negative forces also influence humanity's consciousness: A man may take the side of either deities or demons, and this choice will shape this man's life and action. If a man is able to subdue passions, not putting exclusively egoistic material motives in his actions, he becomes open to the Uas, or its receptacle (—É–∞—Å–¥–∞–Ω, uasdan; good-spell receptacle), a wise noble who perceives the order of God and higher spirits and receives their energy, acting like them by producing good, truth and beauty. On the contrary, if a man's actions are driven by egoistic material ends, Dalimon and demons own him and he becomes a source of evil, lie and ugliness. Practices =Rites= The Ossetian calendar has many days dedicated to ceremonies, some of which are performed within the household and others at outdoors sacred spaces. There are sixty fixed celebrations throughout the year. Household ceremonies are centred around the hearth chain (safa) which upholds a cauldron, over a fire (the holy element in Indo-Iranian religions). Communal ceremonies are held at sacred groves or exposed mountaintops. According to Shtyrkov, the modern Assian movement tries \\"to create a unified ritual system, every tiny element of which has a theological motivation\\". Ossetian traditional rituals consist in holding a feast (fyng or kuvyn) in honour of a particular deity. The ceremony is led by a \\"holy man\\" (dzuary l√¶g), who invokes the deity through the offering of a \\"toast\\", kuyvd, which also means \\"prayer\\", towards the sky. Beer is the substance usually offered in libation, though it may be substituted by any type of strong liquor. During the ceremony other toasts are made to the other deities, and three ceremonial pies (ualibakh) are consumed along with meat from an animal sacrificed for the ritual. Communal ceremonies may be accompanied by a circular dance called simd. A distinctive version of the simd has one circle of dancers standing on the shoulders of another circle of dancers. The Narts tell that the simd was invented by the hero Soslan. =Shrines and temples= Rekom Temple in Tsey, Alagirsky District, North Ossetia‚ÄìAlania. Ossetian deities are associated with natural phenomena, and communal ceremonies are usually held at natural shrines, which are often provided with a temple built in wood or stone. The journalist Alan Mamiev observed that \\"Ossetians pray in nature\\" and \\"every family has its own shrine on their land\\". Slava Dzhana√Øty, who projected the reconstruction the Rekom Temple, an important Ossetian shrine in Tsey, Alagirsky District, North Ossetia‚ÄìAlania, destroyed by an accidental fire in 1995, observed that: Ruslan Kuchiev, the president of the Styr Nykhas in 2019, said: In the Digor region of western Ossetia there is a temple dedicated to the cosmological seven deities. Relations with other philosophies and religions =With Eurasianism= In 2009, at the Center for Conservative Research of Moscow State University, a conference was held about the role of Ossetians in Russian history led by the Eurasianist philosopher Aleksandr Dugin. Among participants there was Daurbek Makeyev, the head of the Ats√¶t√¶ religious organisation of Assianism. On that occasion, Dugin praised the revitalisation of Ossetian culture for it having preserved a pristine Indo-European heritage. He discussed the importance of Scythian culture in the development of broader Eurasia, recognising that Scythian culture had an enormous impact on the development of Finno-Ugric, Turkic and Slavic cultures, and despite this European scholars have paid little attention to it so far. Makeyev declared that the Ats√¶t√¶ organisation was founded for fostering traditional Ossetian religion, but also to share the heritage of Assianism with other peoples, because \\"what was preserved in Ossetia is not [merely] Ossetian, but is a worldwide heritage\\". Russian Assian resources present the religion as a universal truth \\"addressed to the whole world\\". =With Christianity= Scythian Assian leaders, notably Daurbek Makeyev, have articulated strong positions against Christianity, criticising it for its alien origins, its Jewish origins, and criticising the corruption of the Russian Orthodox Church. In 2002 and 2007 works he states that the Christian religion breaks the connection of a nation with its own spirit, thus dooming this nation to degeneration and death: At the same time, Makeyev criticises Christianity for its anti-environmentalist essence, which stems from a theology which separates God from nature, and the sacred from the profane. In a 2019 speech he affirmed: The movement of Scythian Assianism has attracted strong hostility and complaints from Christian and Islamic authorities. The Russian Orthodox archbishop Leonid in Moscow sought to silence Makeyev by trying to ban his books as \\"extremist literature\\", calling on his personal contacts when he was a general in the Federal Security Service. The Russian Orthodox Church has also been trying to have the Rekom Temple destroyed and a church built in its place, but without success so far. Demography and institutions Ynglists in Omsk, Omsk Oblast practising the Scythian ritual of the sword planted in brushwood. The movement of Scythian Assianism is present in both North Ossetia‚ÄìAlania and South Ossetia, though it is more widespread in the former. Some categories particularly well represented among the believers are the military, hunters, and sportsmen, attracted by the heroic ethics of the Narts, but also intellectuals and artists. According to Shtyrkov, the movement \\"occupies a visible place in the social landscape of the republic\\". Scythian Assianism is also popular in Russia and Ukraine among Cossacks, especially those who claim a Scythian identity to distinguish themselves from Slavs. Some of them identify within the category of Rodnovery, the general \\"Slavic Native Faith\\". According to Foltz, the movement has become so widespread among the Ossetians that its success is \\"unrivalled\\" among all Neopagan religious movements. =Russia= * Dzuary L√¶gt√¶ (–î–∑—É–∞—Ä—ã –õ√¶–≥—Ç√¶) ‚Äî an organisation for the coordination of the Ossetian clergy established in 2016 in Vladikavkaz, North Ossetia‚ÄìAlania, on the initiative of the public organisation Yudzinad (–ò—É–¥–∑–∏–Ω–∞–¥); * Ats√¶t√¶ (–ê—Ü√¶—Ç√¶) ‚Äî an organisation registered in 2009 in the city of Mozdok, North Ossetia‚ÄìAlania; * √Üts√¶g Din (√Ü—Ü√¶–≥ –î–∏–Ω) ‚Äî an organisation registered in Vladikavkaz in 2009 and related to the Ats√¶t√¶ community; * Styr Nykhas (\\"Great Council\\") ‚Äî established in 1993 in North Ossetia‚ÄìAlania. =Ukraine= * North Caucasian Scythian Regional Fire See also * Slavic Rodnovery * Germanic Heathenism * Armenian Hetanism * Ynglism * Iranian religions Citations =References= =Sources=   External links * Ats√¶t√¶ ‚Äî Ossetian website Modern Pagan traditions European shamanism Neopaganism in Russia Neopaganism in Ukraine Scythians Iranian religions Ossetian culture ","title":"Assianism"},{"id":"53730039","text":"Dom Edmondus Bernardini, born Augusto was an Italian Abbot of the Common Observance, he became general-abbot of the Common Observance between 1937 and 1950.

Such apps are compiled in the Android-native APK file format which allows easy redistribution of apps to end-users. Most apps are distributed through Google's Play Store but many alternative software repositories, or app stores, exist. Alternative app stores use the \\"Unknown Sources\\" option of Android devices to install APK files directly via the Android Package Manager.  Google Play Store  The Google Play Store (originally the Android Market), operated and developed by Google, serves as the official app store for the Android, allowing users to download apps developed with the Android software development kit (SDK) and published through Google. The store offers both free and paid apps. Apps exploiting hardware capabilities of a device can be targeted to users of devices with specific hardware components, such as a motion sensor (for motion-dependent games) or a front-facing camera (for online video calling). The Google Play store had over 50 billion app downloads in 2013 and has reached over 2.96 million apps published in 2020. Although bundled with most Android devices, the Play Store is only available on devices that are certified within the \\"Android Compatibility Program\\". As a result, manufacturers of so-called \\"custom ROMs\\", i .e. modified versions of Android, are not allowed to bundle Google apps, including the Play Store, with their software. Compatibility can be restored by installing the Google apps from another source, such as OpenGApps, or using alternative app stores.  Manufacturer app stores  In addition to some manufacturers not creating certified compatible versions of Android, some manufacturers have decided to bundle their own app stores, either in addition to the Play Store or as a replacement. Such app stores include: * Samsung Galaxy Store, which is installed on Samsung mobile devices alongside the Play Store. In India, the Samsung Galaxy store is being powered by Indus App Bazaar and is offering a localized experience in 12 Indian languages to all its users. * Amazon Appstore, which is installed instead of the Play Store on Amazon's Fire Phone and Kindle Fire. The Amazon Appstore can also be installed on other Android devices by downloading it from the Amazon website. * Huawei AppGallery * Xiaomi Mi GetApps * OPPO App Market * VIVO App Store  Third-party app stores  App stores that do not rely on pre- installation by the manufacturer are an alternate option for finding Android applications. Apps offered through third-party app stores or websites, created by parties not affiliated with the device or operating system (OS), are also third-party apps. Such stores include: * Aptoide *modsroom * F-Droid * GetJar * HappyMod * slide ME * FreeRoid.com * Mobogenie Market * Itch.io * Uptodown. This form of app store is often used by web developers to distribute apps that are not allowed in the Google Play Store; this may be due to an app allowing users wider access to the app-system, or offering apps for \\"niche users\\" who choose to use only free and open-source software (F-Droid) or prefer to play indie games (Itch.io). Moreover, there are alternative stores that serve to distribute \\"hacked\\" versions of paid apps, for no cost.  Reasons to use alternative app stores  Some users prefer using alternative app stores to avoid using Google services as part of their philosophy. Alternative app stores may also be easier to navigate for users, allowing them to find specific apps quicker, due to different search algorithms or the user interface design implemented for displaying available apps. However, users preferring to utilize either, third-party app stores or the Google Play store, cannot be certain that the apps they are installing have been checked for malware or computer viruses. In addition, alternative app stores may be used for downloading android applications due to limited availability of full‚ÄìGoogle Play functionality. For example, users in China are not able to purchase apps from the Google Play Store, in turn, limiting their options for app purchasing to alternative app stores, such as, AppChina and Wandoujia.

It is a sequel to the 1941 film Quax the Crash Pilot. Plot The year is circa 1932, and the initial setting is Bavaria, Germany. The novice aviator Otto Groschenb√ºgel, nicknamed Quax (see the previous film Quax the Crash Pilot), has advanced to become a professional flying instructor at the Flying School of Bergried. Although by nature a congenial fellow, he decides to adopt an authoritarian manner when learning of his pupils' unruly womanising. However his stern lectures that women have no place on an aerodrome are undermined when his friend Marianne unexpectedly visits him, and even more so when two female trainee pilots are assigned to him. Soon, the flying school's chief instructor announces that the Europaflug contest (an air rallye from Germany via Spain to Africa and back) is scheduled to start from Bergried, and Quax together with one male and the two female trainee pilots take part, by which time Quax is finally persuaded of the women's flying abilities. En route in Spain they indulge in local dances and merriment and Quax casts off his disciplinarian persona. In Africa, the team crash their two planes and are discovered by natives. Quax is obliged to marry the tribal chief's daughter Banani, and they take part in an African ritual dance. Finally a rescue plane arrives and returns the aviators to their home country. Production Both the precursor film Quax the Crash Pilot and the sequel Quax in Africa are based on books written by Dr. Herrmann Grote (1904‚Äì1980). The first book carried the same title Quax der Bruchpilot as the first film and was published in 1936, while the second book was originally published under the title Quax auf Abwegen [Quax off track] before being republished as Quax in Afrika. The film was shot from July 1943 to January 1944, but was not released during the war. In 1945 it was banned by the Allied occupation authorities and, although it was distributed in Sweden in 1947, did not get a full West German release until 1953. Some scenes were shot at an airfield near the Bavarian town of Kempten while parts of Brandenburg doubled for the African scenes. The film's sets were designed by Willi Herrmann. Although the female lead from the previous film Karin Himboldt appears again, the principal romantic interest is now played by R√ºhmann's real-life wife Hertha Feiler.

Constructed in the Dravidian style of architecture, the temple is believed to have been built by the Medieval Cholas, with later contributions from Vijayanagar kings. The temple covers an area of and has a historical grain storage container. Ranganatha Perumal is believed to have appeared to king Mahabali and the Azhwars. Six daily rituals and a dozen yearly festivals are held at the temple, of which the chariot festival, celebrated during the Tamil month of Chittirai (March‚ÄìApril), is the most prominent. The temple is open from 6 am to 7:30 pm. The temple is maintained and administered by the Hindu Religious and Endowment Board of the Government of Tamil Nadu. Legend As per Hindu legend, a demon king named Somukan stole all the Vedas from the Devas and all the sages were worried. They appealed to Vishnu, who appeared as Ranganatha at this place to emerge from water to rescue the scriptures. He is also believed to have advised Brahma at this place. As per another legend, a king named Surakeerthi who was childless worshipped Vishnu at this place to get children. Chandra, the moon god, lost all his glow on account of a curse he incurred. The celestial deities advised him to worship Vishnu at this place. He established a tank and worshipped Ranganatha with the holy waters and believed to have been relieved off his curse. The temple tank, Chandra Pushkarani, is believed to be the tank he established. The celestial deities wanted Vishnu to show them his true form during a night time. Pleased by their devotion, Vishnu is believed to have appeared in Rangantha form and give darshan permanently. Architecture of Adhirangam Ranganathaswamy Temple The historical granary The temple has a flat rajagopuram, the gateway tower and is surrounded by tall granite walls. The temple covers an area of and has two precincts. The presiding deity, Ranganatha Perumal, has an imposing image measuring made of mooligai silai(idol made with herbs) and is seen in reclining posture in the sanctum. The five headed snake Adisesha is sported as an umbrella for the presiding deity made of stucco. The sanctum also houses the image of Sridevi near his head and Bhudevi near his foot. The festival deity, Rangarajan along with his consorts Sridevi and Bhudevi are also housed in the sanctum. There is a mace made of silver located near the arm and the image of Garuda seen in praying posture is located near the foot of the presiding deity. The images of Azhwars are housed in the hall preceding the sanctum. The central shrine is approached from the gopuram axially through a four pillared mani mandapam and pillared halls of mukha mandapam and artha mandapam. The shrine of Ranganayaki, the consort of Ranganathar is located in a shrine parallel to the sanctum. The temple has a historical grain storage container made of brick located in the south east corner of the temple. The granary is one of its kind as in other temples like Srirangam, Jambukeswarar Temple at Tiruvanaikaval and Palaivananathar Temple at Papanasam. It is believed that farmers in the region store their grains in the temple, which also accommodates contributions of the donors to the temple. There are shrines of Kodandarama, Hanuman and Krishna around the sanctum. The shrine of Ranganayagi has sculpted pillars made in Vijayanagara style. There is a huge foot of Vishnu is seen around the western side in the first precinct. In modern times, the temple is maintained and administered by the Hindu Religious and Charitable Endowments Department of the Government of Tamil Nadu. Festivals and religious practices The temple priests perform the pooja (rituals) during festivals and on a daily basis. As at other Vishnu temples of Tamil Nadu, the priests belong to the Vaishnavaite community, a Brahmin sub-caste. The temple rituals are performed six times a day: Ushathkalam at 7 a.m., Kalasanthi at 8:00 a.m., Uchikalam at 12:00 p.m., Sayarakshai at 6:00 p.m., Irandamkalam at 7:00 p.m. and Ardha Jamam at 10:00 p.m. Each ritual has three steps: alangaram (decoration), neivethanam (food offering) and deepa aradanai (waving of lamps) for both Ranganatha Perumal and Ranganayagi. During the last step of worship, nagaswaram (pipe instrument) and tavil (percussion instrument) are played, religious instructions in the Vedas (sacred text) are recited by priests, and worshippers prostrate themselves in front of the temple mast. There are weekly, monthly and fortnightly rituals performed in the temple. The image of the presiding deity is made of stucco and hence sacred ablutions are not performed for it. The temple follows Vaikasana Agama. The festivals associated with Vishnu like Vaikunta Ekadasi, Krishna Janmashtami, Ramanavami and Adi Pooram are celebrated in the temple. The prime temple festival, the Brahmotsavam, has been suspended for many years on account of poor patronage. Religious significance The temple is considered as Periya Perumal temple, meaning the image of presiding Ranganathar is larger than the one found at Ranganathar Temple at Srirangam. The temple finds mention in the Sanskrit work Skanda Purana. As per the temple records, the temple is believed to be older than the Ranganathaswamy temple at Srirangam and hence came to be known as Adhi Rangam, meaning the original Rangam. Following the legend of Moon gaining his sheen, the temple tank where Chandra obtained his sheen back is called Chandrapushkarani, otherwise the Thenpennai River. The Ranga Vimanam given to Vibhishana and was installed in Srirangam temple, is believed to have been formed naturally in this temple. The Ranga vimanam in the temple is in the form of Om, is believed to be an amalgamated form of Saivism. The festive deity is taken to a hill named Maiyanoor, located away from the temple. It is believed that Kedilam River was formed in the hill when Garuda scratched the hill with his beak.

At least 45 people were reported killed and 126 injured. Amaq News Agency said the attacks were carried out by a security detachment of the ISIS. Background In February 2017, ISIS called for attacks on Christians, and during the Sinai insurgency, hundreds of Christians fled their homes in the North Sinai after a \\"concerted campaign of assassination and intimidation\\". The bombings occurred under President (and former general) Abdel Fattah el-Sisi who has emphasized national security during his rule, and who recently returned from a trip to the United States to visit President Donald Trump, a trip widely regarded as successful and as a confirmation of the US administration's support for Sisi's fight against ISIS. Bombing After bombing in Alexandria On Palm Sunday, 9 April 2017, an explosive device was detonated inside St. George's Church in the Nile Delta city of Tanta. According to eyewitnesses, as they were attending the Divine Liturgy, a man in a brown jacket rapidly charged toward the altar before detonating an explosive belt. This man, Mahmoud Mohamed Ali Hussein, is believed to have been in charge of both church bombings in Tanta and Alexandria. Video footage showed people assembled at the church, chanting the liturgy. The video rapidly changed to bars, as screams of terror and crying were heard in the background. A preliminary report by the prosecution determined that the bomb contained TNT, as well as large amounts of metallic screws and highly flammable substances. Later at Saint Mark's Coptic Orthodox Cathedral in Alexandria, historical seat of the Coptic papacy, another device exploded near the cathedral's gates. The incident occurred minutes after Pope Tawadros II left the church to follow the developments of the Tanta bombing. The pope escaped unharmed. Conflicting reports emerged over the identity of the perpetrator. Egyptian television published a photo of a man who was stopped and interrogated near the entrance. The suspect reportedly detonated a suicide belt when members of the security force, assigned to this church, tried to arrest him. Other camera footage, however, showed a different man trying to pass through the metal detectors at the entrance, a few seconds before the bomb went off. Casualties The bombing in Alexandria killed 17 people and injured 48. In Tanta, 30 people were killed and 78 injured. Aftermath In Tanta, security forces sealed off all the streets leading to the church and set up emergency checkpoints, allowing bomb disposal experts to examine the church and cars parked in its surroundings for any remaining explosives. Egypt's interior minister, Magdy Abdel Ghaffar, Prosecutor-General, Nabil Sadek, and other government officials arrived at the scene shortly after the bombing. Forensic experts identified an unknown severed head as a possible suspect in the attack. Tanta's residents, who were demonstrating nearby, physically assaulted Major General Hossam el-Din Khalifa, head of the Gharbia's Security Directorate. Khalifa, along with other heads of security, were dismissed later that day by Abdel Ghaffar. Three other explosive devices were dismantled by police. Two of them were left by an unknown individual in front of Sidi Abdel Rahim Mosque in Tanta, which contains a Sufi shrine. The other was in Alexandria's Coll√®ge Saint Marc. =State of emergency= On the same day, Egyptian President Abdel Fattah el-Sisi announced that a three-month state of emergency would be imposed. The attack was seen as underscoring the failure of Egypt's intelligence agencies to \\"anticipate a coordinated wave of attacks\\" and the difficulty of stopping suicide attacks, despite the \\"largely unfettered powers\\" of the President el-Sisi and his imprisonment and exiling of \\"thousands of political opponents\\". The three-month state of emergency must be approved by the Parliament of Egypt. Following its approval, President El- Sisi will have the authority to increase the powers of the police in arrests, surveillance, and seizures. Responsibility An online statement via the Amaq News Agency said, \\"A security detachment of the Islamic State carried out the attacks against the two churches in the cities of Tanta and Alexandria\\". The two Egyptian suicide bombers were named Abu Ishaq Al-Masri and Abu Al- Baraa Al-Masri. The group previously said the Islamic State was responsible for the December 2016 Botroseya Church bombing at St. Peter and St. Paul's Church in Cairo, which killed 29 people and injured 47 others. =Identification= On 12 April 2017, Egyptian Interior Ministry identified Mahmud Hassan Mubarak Abdullah from the Arab Al Ashraf tribe, born in 1986 in Qena Governorate, as the bomber who had carried out the attack outside Saint Mark's church in Alexandria by comparing the DNA of remains found at the site of the bombing with the DNA of runaway suspects. A day later, Egyptian authorities identified the second bomber as Mamduh Amin Mohammed Baghdadi also from Al Ashraf tribe, born in 1977 in Qena Governorate.  Reactions  = Domestic = The Egyptian President Abdel Fattah el-Sisi summoned the national security council, and said that those wounded could receive medical care at military hospitals. The following day, president el-Sisi declared a three- month state of emergency across the country. The Egyptian Council of Churches, through its secretary-general, priest Rifaat Fathy, expressed its condolences to the victims' relatives and to Pope Tawadros II, and announced its support to Sisi's swift response to the events and to the counter-terrorism efforts of the country's security apparatus. The head of Al-Azhar, Egypt's leading center for the study of Sunni Islam, Sheikh Ahmed el-Tayeb, denounced the deadly attacks, calling them a \\"despicable terrorist bombing that targeted the lives of innocents.\\" Following the attacks, Muslims gathering inside mosques to donate blood for victims. Egyptians also showed solidarity with the victims by using a hashtag on social media that translates to \\"your terrorism brings us together.\\" = International = The governments of Armenia, Australia, Canada, China, Colombia, Cyprus, France, Germany, Greece, Hungary, India, Indonesia, Iran, Iraq, Israel, Japan, Jordan, Lebanon, Malaysia, Morocco, Pakistan, Poland,Andrzej Duda Twitter 9 April 2017 Romania, Russia, Saudi Arabia,arabnews.com.

It premiered on BBC One and BBC One HD on 29 July 2017. \\"One\\" is a fly on the wall episode following an hour in Holby City Hospital's emergency department (ED) with additional focus on sister Lisa \\"Duffy\\" Duffin (Cathy Shipton) mentoring two work experience girls and paramedic Jez Andrews (Lloyd Everitt) grieving the death of a baby. \\"One\\" pays homage to Casualty and the NHS; executive producer Oliver Kent stated that it recognises the efforts of the NHS, while actress Amanda Mealing said it showcases the challenges faced by the NHS. Producers began planning \\"One\\" in 2016, with an idea of producing a live episode. After this was ruled out due to technical difficulties, Unwin settled on an episode filmed in one take. Crew members questioned whether it would be possible, while there was a mixed response from cast members. Most of the cast are trained in theatre so relied on their training for filming, whereas the crew did not have this luxury and found the experience scary. Filming took place in early April 2017. Cast rehearsed the script in twelve sections, before piecing the sections together and filming it twice every day. \\"One\\" was filmed in one take using one mobile camera, which covers 360-degree shots. 35 radio microphones and 6 booms were hidden into the set, while 26 actors wore body microphones. Multiple methods for capturing film and sound used in regular episodes had to be changed for \\"One\\". To capture the entirety of the serial's set, a camera operator was lifted down a 17 feet drop in a harness while recording a scene. The production team wore medical scrubs on- set in case they were caught on camera. The episode was promoted through promotional trailers, a Twitter hashtag and a countdown on social media. Within a 28-day period, 6.57 million viewers watched the episode. \\"One\\" received a mixed response from viewers and television critics alike. Some viewers criticised the camera movement in the episode, stating that they felt \\"disoriented\\" watching it. Alison Graham of the Radio Times called the episode a \\"bold piece of television\\" while Jessica Ransom of What's on TV felt the episode highlighted the disorderly nature of an ED. The Daily Telegraph critic Michael Hogan gave the episode a mixed review, opining that although the episode was directed and performed well, the script was poor and \\"needed some doctoring of its own\\".  Plot  Paramedics Jez Andrews (Lloyd Everitt) and Iain Dean (Michael Stevenson) are called to a house fire. Jez is inside and searches for casualties in the house. He finds none and pulls Sun-Mi (Aewia Huillet) from the burning building. Iain and Jez take Sun-Mi to the ambulance. Sun-Mi pulls her oxygen mask from her face and tells Jez her baby is inside the house. Jez prepares to rush back in, but the house explodes before he can get in. Jez and Iain drive to the emergency department; they encounter a male who has come off his motorbike after colliding with a car. They request another ambulance and continue to the ED. As the pair arrive, sister Lisa \\"Duffy\\" Duffin (Cathy Shipton) greets two schoolgirls: Diamond Whittaker (Georgia Sandle) and Chloe Robinson (Kassius Nelson). Duffy is tasked with acting as Diamond and Chloe‚Äôs mentor. Sun-Mi is taken into Resus to be treated by consultant Connie Beauchamp (Amanda Mealing) and nurses Charlie Fairhead (Derek Thompson) and Robyn Miller (Amanda Henderson). Duffy tells Diamond and Chloe to wait outside Resus, but Diamond ignores Duffy‚Äôs instructions and walks in. When Duffy finds the pair in Resus, she gives them a warning but is then called over to treat Sun-Mi. Duffy hands Chloe and Diamond over to Charlie to look after them. As Jez is collecting a drink from the vending machine, he receives news from nurse Jacob Masters (Charles Venn) that Sun- Mi‚Äôs baby was found and taken out of the house; Jez is ecstatic. Consultants Dylan Keogh (William Beck) and Elle Gardner (Jaye Griffiths) work together to treat patient Dougie Cox (Sule Rimi) in Resus. Charlie asks a nurse to look after Diamond and Chloe, who are then passed onto Jacob, and then passed over to Iain. In the staff room, Jacob reveals to Iain in front of Diamond and Chloe that Sun-Mi‚Äôs baby died in the house fire. When Jez walks in the staff room, Diamond apologises to Jez, who is heartbroken upon learning Sun-Mi‚Äôs baby died. Andrew Sully (Gordon Kennedy), Sun-Mi‚Äôs husband, is devastated by his and his wife‚Äôs loss. He later learns that Dougie was behind the fire after throwing a petrol bomb through the window. Duffy finds Diamond and Chloe filing paperwork in Jacob‚Äôs office. Registrar Lily Chao (Crystal Yu) asks Duffy, Chloe and Diamond for a selfie. Chloe reveals to Lily and Duffy she wants to be a nurse. Duffy takes Chloe and Diamond to the front of the ED, as she explains why she chose to become a nurse and make a difference to people‚Äôs lives.

An image of the regular cast ‚Äî minus Tony Marshall, who portrays Noel Garcia ‚Äî was shared at the conclusion of filming, suggesting those cast members would feature in \\"One\\". Marshall is the only cast member not to appear in the episode; his absence is explained as Noel being ill. The concept of special guest characters Chloe Robinson and Diamond Whittaker, two teenage girls on work experience at the hospital, were announced on 5 April 2017. Former Hollyoaks star Kassius Nelson was cast in the role of Chloe, while Georgia Sandle was cast as Diamond. Nine additional guest characters were introduced for the episode, including: Sun- Mi, a Korean woman injured in the house fire, portrayed by Aewia Huillet, and her husband Andrew Sully, portrayed by Gordon Kennedy; arsonist Dougie Cox, portrayed by Sule Rimi, and his nephew Chrissie Cox, portrayed by Dajay Brown; Dougie's partner, Di Hawkins, portrayed by former Coronation Street actress, Jenny Platt; father and daughter Jerry Kennedy and Candice-Marie Kennedy, portrayed by Trevor Cooper and Jenna Boyd respectively; elderly patient Rose Thomas, portrayed by Pameli Benham; and musician Anthony Cleaver, portrayed by Harry Lovell-Jones.  Production  = Conception and development = \\"One\\" is written by the show's co-creator Paul Unwin, who has not written regularly for the serial since its second series. Jon Sen directed the episode, while Erika Hossington served as the series producer and Oliver Kent acted as the executive producer for his final episode. Hossington and Simon Harper, Kent's successor as executive producer, were overjoyed by Unwin's return. Hossington enjoyed the episode's script. Unwin and Sen felt privileged to be involved in \\"One\\"; Sen called the episode a \\"once-in-a-lifetime opportunity\\" and \\"an amazing bit of film-making\\". \\"One\\" is a fly on the wall episode exploring life at the emergency department (ED) of Holby City Hospital, the setting for Casualty. Specifically, the episode focuses on Sister Lisa \\"Duffy\\" Duffin (Cathy Shipton) mentoring two girls, Chloe and Diamond, who are on work experience in the ED as they decide whether to pursue a career in medicine. Duncan Lindsay, writing for the Metro, reported that the events of the episode would challenge Duffy both \\"emotionally and professionally\\". The episode sees an increased focus on the ED's nursing staff, which Shipton described as \\"a lovely echo back to the show‚Äôs origins\\". She liked the additional focus since the nurses \\"soak everything up in emergencies\\". Shipton felt \\"One\\" reflects original Casualty producer Geraint Morris' aim to portray nurses as being at the front of emergency departments. At the beginning of the episode, Diamond is portrayed as a stuck-up young girl who wants to become a consultant, while Chloe is displayed as worried and agitated, struggling with her surroundings. Shipton stated that the characters' personalities change during the course of the episode: Diamond is taught to be more respectful, whereas Chloe's confidence grows and she decides to spend more time in the ED. \\"One\\" is billed as \\"unique\\", \\"extraordinary\\", \\"pioneering\\" and \\"ambitious\\". Shipton called it \\"classic Casualty\\" and described it as \\"Casualty bumped into Mike Leigh bumped into a living art installation\\". A BBC Online reporter branded the episode the serial's \\"most challenging episode yet\\". Cast member Amanda Mealing (Connie Beauchamp) described \\"One\\" as \\"a love letter to the NHS\\". She added that since the complex format featured in \\"One\\" is not often used, the episode would be \\"exciting and new\\". Hossington similarly thought the episode is complex and alternative, adding that \\"One\\" would excite fans of the show because it is unattempted. Mealing's co-star Crystal Yu called the episode \\"different and magical\\" and branded it \\"an amazing experience\\". Unwin used \\"One\\" as an opportunity to pay homage to Casualty and the NHS. Kent believed that the episode recognises what \\"the heroes of the NHS really do\\", while Sen opined that \\"One\\" is the greatest way of the audience being able to witness the NHS. Mealing explained that \\"One\\" should symbolise the drama and outstanding efforts of the NHS. She believed that the episode demonstrates \\"the numerous pressures and obstacles\\" tackled by the NHS, as well as the efforts and dedication needed to run an emergency department. On the episode, Mealing commented, \\"It starts with a bang and the excitement and high drama continue right to the end.\\" Sen said that \\"One\\" features emotional scenes when characters' personalities are challenged by emergency situations. Planning for \\"One\\" began in 2016, with show bosses keen to attempt something new. Shipton stated that an obvious suggestion is a live episode, but accepted that it was out of the show's capabilities. Hossington later explained that the show cannot transmit live because it goes through several post-production procedures which would not be possible if they transmitted live. She told Sophie Dainty of Digital Spy that the show would not appear or sound like the regular show. After discovering the 2015 film Victoria, Unwin considered an episode filmed in one take. In September 2016, Unwin informed Shipton of his plans to write a one-shot episode to conclude the thirty-first series. The idea was met with apprehension from Shipton, who believed it was a joke. However, Hossington thought Unwin's plans created a nice way to conclude the series as it varies to regular episodes. Lead sound recordist Tim Hunt was approached with the idea in June 2016, although he was apprehensive about it and spent the following summer questioning whether it could be achieved. Hunt understood that \\"One\\" would need to be filmed using a wide shot angle, which he believed would create problems as \\"you see everything\\". Plans for the episode started to circulate in the media in August 2016 when Hossington and Kent promised that Casualty would complete \\"[their] version of a live episode at some point\\". When rumours began circulating on-set, plans for the episode were confirmed to the cast. At the 22nd National Television Awards in January 2017, Hossington hinted to Shipton that she would feature prominently in the episode. The actress later found an unreleased script for the episode, which she stole to read. After reading the script, her confidence in the episode grew. Jaye Griffiths, who portrays Elle Gardner in the drama, struggled to understand the concept of the episode. In August 2016, Casualty actor William Beck expressed an interest in filming a live episode, which left him in disagreement with his co-star Jaye Griffiths as she did not want to film a live episode. Griffiths later stated that she struggled to \\"grasp\\" the concept of the episode initially. Conversely, Yu was pleased to be involved in the episode and Shipton found the experience \\"exciting and nerve-wracking\\". Mealing admitted in an interview with Catrin Carrucan of The Daily Express that she was apprehensive about creating \\"One\\" because she believed the cast would have limited rehearsal time as they already work with a \\"really tight schedule\\". The majority of the cast were trained in theatre so were able to rely on their training for the episode. Shipton stated that the crew found the experience scary in comparison as they are usually able to \\"stop and start\\" production. The actress also mentioned that the cast could improvise if they botch their lines. Shipton previously performed in a one-woman show, which prepared her for the episode. This helped calm her nerves as she felt if she botched her lines, it would reflect real life. However, to help her concentrate, Shipton called her co-stars by their character names on and off set. Yu's character Lily Chao appears halfway through \\"One\\" so she hoped that she would not botch her lines, especially since she has much medical jargon to say. = Filming = \\"One\\" was filmed at Roath Lock Studios, located in Cardiff, where the serial has been produced since 2011. Show filming is located at Roath Lock Studios, Cardiff, where it has taken place since 2011. Production for the episode took place over two weeks, beginning on 3 April 2017 and ending on 13 April 2017. Guest actors were invited to visit the studios throughout the week before filming so that they could familiarise themselves with their surroundings. Cast began rehearsing in the first week of production. To help this process, the script for \\"One\\" was split into twelve sections for individual rehearsal. Across the first week, cast and crew began to compile sections together. Hossington said that after rehearsing the first half of the episode, there was a positive atmosphere on-set. During rehearsals, press and media were invited to observe and for a guided tour around the set while speaking to the crew. A recorded dress rehearsal took place on 8 April. Hossington and Sen thought it would be \\"a complete and utter shambles\\" but confessed it went well and felt it looked good to an audience. Filming commenced in the final week of production; it was recorded twice every day and the best take was selected at the conclusion of filming. Production for \\"One\\" took longer than for regular episodes as the cast had to \\"meticulously rehearse\\" their scenes. Filming also took longer because if any mistakes were made, they had to restart the take. The pre-title sequence, which features a house explosion, was filmed separately to the rest of filming for practical reasons, although Shipton stated that everything after the opening sequence is \\"48 minutes of continuous filming\\". The explosion was also filmed in one take and at a similar time to studio filming. Julian Spencer, the episode's stunt coordinator, found the explosion sequence challenging due to the one-shot element, although he thought it went well and said that it was \\"raw\\". Neighbours to the house used for filming the explosion were warned about possible \\"disturbance\\" during filming beforehand and the two houses facing the stunt house had their windows covered to avoid debris from the explosion breaking them. Eyewitnesses to the explosion said that film-makers made the explosion appear \\"authentic\\". Sen labelled the stunt \\"a big explosive ‚àí in every sense of the word ‚àí beginning\\". The show's production team wanted to capture all of the show's set, using it similarly to a stage, and decided to include a scene where Duffy, Chloe and Diamond walk upstairs to the pharmacy. To achieve this scene, camera operator Scott Milton was asked to walk backwards upstairs, before being attached to a harness and asked to \\"step out over a ledge 17 feet above the ground\\". Sen suggested the idea and despite his colleagues believing he was \\"insane\\", he included it at what he said was a \\"pivotal moment\\". Milton admitted that the adrenalin rush associated with the stunt made it \\"electric\\". Shipton described the situation as hazardous. Mealing explained that Sen did not want the episode to be \\"safe\\" and insisted on performing this scene. She commented, \\"The possible limits of doing a one- shot have not contained anyone's ambitions.\\" Mealing stated that from a technical point of view, the episode contrasts to a regular episode. She explained that while the audience only sees her character Connie walking down a corridor, she is actually walking towards 40 members of the production team, including a camera operator, who are walking backward. Stevenson said that \\"One\\" uses an alternative method as \\"everything is in the moment\\", which increases the pace of filming and therefore, the episode. On the quick-paced nature of the episode, cast member Derek Thompson quipped, \\"Characters come through the door, put on a pair of skates and then, they are danced off.\\" The show's production team were dressed in medical scrubs so that if they were caught on camera, they would look like a background character. One member of the sound department opted to wear a stethoscope so they could disguise themselves; Hossington praised their dedication, while Sen believed that it \\"added to the sanctification\\". Hossington explained that they were \\"very careful\\" to ensure that everyone was dressed accordingly, while Sen revealed that there was \\"a massive amount of excitement\\" about being able to dress in the scrubs. During the episode, Chloe is shown vomiting, which raised challenges for the production team. Sen explained that in a regular episode, a cut would be inserted where the actor would place fake vomit, often chicken soup disguised by the art department, in their mouth before 'vomitting' and cutting to another scene, where the fake vomit is consequently cleaned up. However, in this episode, they could not use any cuts and as Nelson is a vegan, they could not use chicken soup as fake vomit. Sen described these as \\"little challenges\\". Shipton believed she would be exhausted, yet \\"exhilarated\\" after filming the episode, which would make her hysterical approximately three days after the end of filming. She later said that she was \\"in a state of numb disbelief and excitement\\" after filming the episode, stating that she is proud of the achievement. She added that she woke the following morning wanting to film the episode again. Yu also found the filming exhausting and spent most of the following weekend asleep. Michael Stevenson, who portrays Iain Dean, enjoyed the filming of the episode, praising the show's production team for their work behind the scenes. He also thought the episode showcased the show's production team for being \\"the very tight company that we are\\". Shipton praised Sen's motivational techniques and the morale between the cast and crew. Mealing praised each person associated with \\"One\\" for their work, opining they did so with \\"great pride, belief and perspiration\\". She also specifically praised the crew, who she said \\"must be absolutely awesome\\" if they are able to create such an episode, while Hossington believed that the episode would not be completed to a greater standard if a different cast and crew created it. Unwin opined that the episode is a \\"fantastic achievement\\", created by a \\"remarkable\\" cast, crew and production team. On the result of filming the episode, Mealing commented, \\"It brought cast and crew together in the best possible way. Everyone relished the opportunity to step up their game.\\" Similarly, Hossington said that the episode positively impacted the cast and crew as they felt they \\"achieved something\\".  Camera and sound  The episode was filmed in one take using one mobile camera, which was required to be cable free and able to film inside a moving ambulance. The show's ambulance station set was transformed into a crew control room and 35 radio microphones and 6 booms were hidden and disguised into the set. The episode features 360-degree shots to cover a wider range of the scenes. Two booms were used in exterior scenes and Hunt explained that the second boom is used \\"to solve any shadows on a 360 shot\\". A normal episode features one production sound mixer, two boom operators and an assistant; for \\"One\\", a second production sound mixer and two further boom operators were introduced. Brad Bower covered the roles of one of production sound mixer and the assistant, which required him to support cast and crew during rehearsals, adjust gains, disguise on-set microphones, and supervise the recording machines during takes. Hunt wanted to \\"match the sound of conventional Casualty episodes\\", although he was unable to create this in the way it is achieved in a regular episode so was forced to use radio microphones instead. In addition to this, 26 actors wore a body microphone and one actor wore two body microphones and a transmitter, which Hunt said allowed the actor to \\"cover the dynamics of his performance\\". Sen explained that the strategy to sound was not the same to regular episodes because background actors are normally asked to mime to assist with the cuts, whereas in this episode there was no cuts. Kent said that from a technical aspect, \\"One\\" is \\"the most enormous challenge\\". Hossington said that the technical aspects of the episode were the focus of production. The role of camera operator was shared between two people due to the weight of the camera and the \\"incredible act of concentration\\" needed for the position as it is easy to get tired. Sen wanted a shot going above the patient, which he found was a good opportunity to exchange the camera between the two operators. The camera is handed to Milton, the second cameraman, as it moves over the patient. The camera is later handed back to the original camera operator, who receives the camera during a fight scene in the ED staff room. Sen praised the camera operators and opined that their work was \\"seamless\\". A heated viewfinder was purchased for the camera as the regular viewfinder became misty easily, stopping the ability to film. Hossington explained that as a heated viewfinder had not been used on-set before, they were unsure how much battery capacity it would use. Sen worked with the show's cinematographers to achieve the best camera angles and perfect the scenes. Yu called this \\"exciting\\" and compared it to \\"watching a master- plan coming together\\". Hossington thought that a challenge of the ambulance ride sequence was the positioning of the director of photography. The director is required to control the iris of the camera by \\"opening and closing\\" it using a control, which is unable to communicate with the iris through metal. Hossington said that it was easier to navigate the director and the iris controls during the pre-titles stunt and the majority of the episode, which is set in the hospital, than in the ambulance because there was not enough space for the director to be in the ambulance as well as to several other members of the production team. Hossington believed that the demanding nature of the ambulance journey would be astounding to the audience as it appeared to be \\"seamless\\". A fake wall was created in the ambulance surrounding the passenger seat so that a member of the production team could position themselves while not being seen on camera. Sen explained that he was determined not to allow \\"the technical stuff dictate how we were doing it\\". For his role, guest actor Harry Lovell-Jones had to repeatedly drum against a chair using drumsticks. Hossington and Sen found this difficult to achieve with sound as they were concerned it may be \\"interfering\\" or \\"obscured\\" and questioned \\"whether there was too much, [or] too little\\" drumming. So that a constant drumming could be heard during scenes in the reception area, microphones were hidden in the ceiling panels and underneath Lovell-Jones' seat. Hossington believed that she and Sen had spent the equivalent to a day discussing the sound of the drumsticks. Hossington also revealed that the drumsticks were originally rubber to avoid creating masses of noise, but were instead swapped for sticks made from balsa wood so that they could be snapped. She also expressed worry with the snapping of the drumsticks, so was thankful that nothing went wrong. = Promotion and broadcast = At the time of the episode's announcement, the episode was scheduled for Summer 2017. Sarah Ellis of Inside Soap later revealed \\"One\\" would air in July, and the episode broadcast in the United Kingdom on 29 July 2017 on BBC One. A trailer for \\"One\\" was released on 15 July 2017, two weeks before its premiere. Another trailer for the \\"One\\" was released on 26 July 2017 featuring short clips from the episode to the pace of a heartbeat. The show's social media team created the Twitter hashtag \\"#CasualtyOne\\" for the episode to increase the episode's media profile, and in the buildup to the episode airing, they created a countdown to the episode's broadcast.  Reception  = Ratings = \\"One\\" received an overnight rating of 5.2 million viewers, which is the highest rated episode of 29 July 2017 and the serial's highest rating since 2015. After seven days, the ratings rose to 6.27 million viewers, which is an increase of 790,000 viewers from the previous episode. After 28 days, the ratings rose to 6.57 million viewers, which is an overall increase of 900,000 viewers from the previous episode. \\"One\\" is the second most-watched programme on BBC One in the week of broadcast and the eighth most-watched programme on BBC One in July 2017. = Critical analysis = Reilly (What's on TV) called the episode \\"mesmerising\\", while Catrin Carrucan (The Daily Express) described the episode as \\"dramatic\\". Joseph Gamp of Metro labelled the episode \\"daring\\" and \\"ambitious\\". Charles Venn, who portrays Jacob Masters, praised cast members' \\"sublime\\" performance in \\"One\\". Many viewers complained on Twitter about the camera movements, which they claimed made them \\"queasy\\", \\"disoriented\\" and \\"dizzy\\", as well as some sound complications. Other viewers praised the episode, with viewers' comments including, \\"Excellent episode. Realistically creating the often frenetic and stressful situations in an ED\\" and \\"Blimey. Casualty is a work of art tonight.\\" While some viewers expressed their enjoyment about the house explosion at the beginning of the episode, comparing it to \\"stock footage\\" from Game of Thrones, and others criticised the decision to film the whole episode in one-shot. Metro polled its readers on their reaction to the episode: 45% of readers enjoyed \\"One\\", but preferred the regular format; 33% of readers found the episode \\"great\\"; and 22% of readers did not like the episode and agreed that it was \\"really disorientating and dull\\". Alison Graham, writing for the Radio Times, described \\"One\\" as a \\"bold piece of television\\" and praised the show for \\"shaking things up a bit\\" for the series finale and for displaying \\"the chaos of a front-line service\\". She also called the off-screen death of the child \\"tragic\\". Graham also opined that the \\"frenetic\\" atmosphere in the episode made her feel \\"seasick\\" as the camera followed a character before \\"swiftly changing paths to latch on to another\\". Helen McWilliams of Break A Leg enjoyed the episode, which she branded \\"a gamble that paid off\\" and a \\"history making episode\\". She believed \\"One\\" had an alternative \\"feel, ambience and atmosphere\\" to other episodes. She praised the performances of Shipton and Everitt and said that Everitt \\"knocked his performance out of the park in extreme circumstances\\", while Shipton created \\"one of the performances of her career\\". McWilliams believed that Noel's absence reminded the audience that all ED staff are \\"integral cogs\\" within the department. The reviewer also called Chloe and Diamond \\"a fantastic addition to the chaos\\" and believed their clashing personalities were realistic, hoping for the characters to return in the future. Michael Hogan of The Daily Telegraph awarded \\"One\\" a score of 3 out of 5, calling the episode a \\"bold project\\" and the house explosion \\"spectacular\\". He said that the death of the baby provided \\"One\\" with an \\"emotional heart\\", while the fly-on-the-wall theme created \\"intensity and realism\\" within the episode. He praised the decision to have Shipton and Thompson lead the episode. The reviewer also opined that some speeches from the characters \\"didn‚Äôt quite work\\" and found the explanations during the episode \\"jarring\\". Sue Haasler, writing for the blog Pauseliveaction, liked \\"One\\" and stated that she forgot it was filmed in one take, which is a \\"testament\\" to the cast. She enjoyed the \\"seamless\\" approach and the decision for crew to wear medical scrubs. Haasler said that the choreography is \\"nothing short of incredible\\" and believed that Unwin and Sen \\"brilliantly thought out\\" the episode and injected \\"dynamics and pace\\" into it. By the end of the episode, Haasler was \\"emotional\\" and glad that the episode was created as \\"a love letter to the NHS\\". Jessica Ransom of What's on TV praised the episode and found it \\"impressive\\" that there were no mistakes. She said the episode highlighted the \\"ever chaotic trauma\\" and a \\"particularly explosive day\\" in the ED. Ransom also opined that Chloe and Diamond were \\"meddlesome\\".

Cluskey (ca. 1808‚Äì1871) was an American architect active from the 1830s to the start of the Civil War, and therefore he is recognized as an antebellum architect. He is reputed to be the initiator of the Greek Revival‚Äìstyle in the south, and his commissions, both public and private, can still be seen in Augusta, Milledgeville and Savannah, Georgia. Early life Born in Ireland, Charles Blaney Cluskey emigrated to the United States in 1827, landing in New York City, where he trained with the architectural firm Town and Davis. He moved to Savannah in 1829, where he did his first solo- commission, the Hermitage Plantation house, in 1830, now demolished. Career The Old Medical College (later Georgia Health Sciences University), built in 1837, was Cluskey's first major commission and the first example of the Greek revival style that would be his trademark. The Old Medical College is considered \\"one of his masterpieces\\". It is based on the Villa Capra \\"La Rotonda\\". In 1839 he completed the Governor's Mansion, also based on the Villa Capra, and the main building for Oglethorpe University in 1840. The National Register nomination document for his Governor's Mansion asserts that: \\"His works gained recognition because they were a direct departure from the more conservative designs of rectangular shapes that had been generally used in domestic architecture,\\" and that the building is \\"without question, his most perfect example of the Greek Revival house. In the 1840 and 50s, Cluskey moved to private commissions in Savannah, three houses still existing in what is now the Savannah Historic District.

The company specializes in the design and manufacture of light aircraft in the form of kits for amateur construction. Bob Wolstenholme is the president and CEO of Evolution Aircraft. History In July 2016 Lancair announced it would sell off the older Lancair lines of aircraft to concentrate on the Lancair Evolution instead. Eldredge, who was Lancair's Director of Business Development, indicated that at one time Lancair's products had been unique in the market, but only the Evolution design now occupied that customer niche and thus it made sense to concentrate on that aircraft type. He stated, \\"there is nothing in the market that can compete with the Evolution\\" and \\"unless something drastically changes with the market, after the first of the year, we will be ramping up to one every two weeks.\\" The company had been making 10% of its revenue from supporting the older, out of production designs with parts. Due to the complexity of the Evolution aircraft design, it is not a traditional kit aircraft, that is normally built in a garage. Instead, the kit was designed to be built in professional facilities that assist the amateur builder, including the factory facility and commercial aircraft shops. This focus on using available space at the factory for builder assistance, plus lower sales of the older models, meant there was a good business case for selling off the older designs and freeing space for Evolution completions. In February 2017 the assets, including the intellectual property for the older designs, were sold to Mark and Conrad Huffstutler, who moved the production of those models to Uvalde, Texas and now operate the company as Lancair International, LLC. With the sale of the older aircraft lines, Lancair changed its name to Evolution Aircraft and remained in its existing Redmond facility. The company issued a statement on 5 October 2017 indicting that they were going through a restructuring and had laid off 22 of its 49 employees on 3 October 2017. Company president and CEO Kevin Eldredge resigned and Bob Wolstenholme assumed that role. The Aircraft Owners and Pilots Association reported on 19 October 2017 that the company was apparently out of business, citing inability to obtain product liability insurance following a fatal accident. On 20 October 2017 Aero News Network (ANN) reported that the company was not answering customer or media inquires and that \\"its future is cloudy\\". That same day local radio station KBND reported that the company was still in business, seeking a buyer and that AOPA's report that it had closed was incorrect. On 26 October 2017 ANN reported that the company was \\"for sale. And while reports last week of the company being closed appeared to be premature, the kit maker is certainly struggling\\" and seeking a buyer. ANN reported also that the company had been unable to obtain insurance due to high-profile accidents. On 4 November 2017 the company indicated in an interview in The Bend Bulletin, that they were still in limited operations, \\"focused on fulfilling customer commitments\\" and were seeking investors.

Style The novel is told in the third person through an omniscient narrator. Particularly in ¬ßI, events are often related out of chronological order, with clear date markers in chapter headings. The reader is frequently in possession of more information about events than the protagonists themselves. The work is rich in metatextual literary allusions. For example, the banker Haraldur R√∫riksson (himself a cipher for the real-life Bj√∂rg√≥lfur Gu√∞mundsson), takes his patronym from the legendary viking founder of Kievan Rus'; the novel features a newspaper editor called T√≥mas Dav√≠√∞sson, which name √ûr√°inn himself used as a pen-name in his 1987 Tungum√°l fuglanna;√ölfhildur Dagsd√≥ttir. ‚ÄûDau√∞ans √≥vissi t√≠mi.‚Äú B√≥kmenntir.is, November 2014. http://bokmenntir.is/desktopdefault.aspx/tabid-3409/5648_read-21237/ . and the bank robbers √ûorgeir and √ûorm√≥√∞ur are based on the eponymous foster- brothers of the medieval Icelandic F√≥stbr√¶√∞ra saga.Hlynur P√°ll P√°lsson. ‚ÄûSamt√≠minn er lyginni l√≠kastur.‚Äú Fr√©ttabla√∞i√∞, 4 December 2004, p. 92, http://timarit.is/view_page_init.jsp?issId=265058&pageId;=3744725‚ü®=is&q;=Dau%F0ans%20%F3vissi%20t%EDmi. The book states that the troubling Russian connections of Haraldur R√∫riksson can be read about in the journal EuroCapital, in a transparent allusion to an article in Euromoney.Peter Lee, \`Landsbanki's New Masters Take Control', Euromoney, vol. 33 issue 403 (November 2002), pp. 34--47. In the estimation of Hlynur P√°ll P√°lsson, the novel also stands out for its 'choice gallery of characters. A great many characters are introduced into the story without confusing the reader, because behind each stands characterisation and wry stories which make each one unique'.'En r√∫s√≠nan √≠ pylsuendanum er √°n efa kostulegt pers√≥nugaller√≠i√∞.

Summary The novel is divided into three sections: * I Vegur √≥ttans ('the road of fear') (pp. 13‚Äì90, chs 1-20) * II Vegur dau√∞ans ('the road of death') (pp. 91‚Äì358, chs 21-82) * III Vegur dygg√∞arinnar ('the road of virtue') (359-71, chs 83-85) ¬ßI focuses on recounting the career of Haraldur R√∫riksson from 1986 to 2004. In a story paralleling the real-life Hafskip-affair, Haraldur attempts to establish a shipping company, Farskip, to compete with the dominant company, Gufuskipaf√©lagi√∞ (a cipher for Eimskip), but is bankrupted by the dubious actions of his competitors. He takes up the invitation of a one-time employee, Magn√∫s Valgar√∞sson, and an associate of his, Cameron Stout, to go into the alcopop business in post-communist St Petersburg. Rumours are reported that Haraldur defrauded his associates of their shares in the business just before it became enormously profitable and he successfully sells it to a major European brewery. This story parallels Bj√∂rg√≥lfur Gu√∞mundsson's role in establishing Bravo Brewery and later selling it to Heineken. By 2004, through the privatisation of Iceland's banking system, Haraldur has been able to buy his old creditor, the √ûj√≥√∞bankinn (a cipher for Landsbanki), and avenge past shame by buying the Gufuskipaf√©lagi√∞, via his holding company JOB Global Holdings (an allusion to the real-life Bj√∂rg√≥lfur's Samson ehf.). ¬ßI also introduces us to Haraldur's best friend, R√∫nar; two boys in a violent foster-home, √ûorgeirr and √û√≥rm√≥√∞ur; a would-be priest turned detective, V√≠kingur; and two eastern European psychopaths, the Czech Petra Vlkova and the Russian Vasil√≠ Basmanov, who become a couple and begin working for St Petersburg's pre-eminent oligarch, Mikhail Moisejevitsj Lev√≠tan (founding, it later emerges, a security company-cum-protection racket called Opritsjnina Group). ¬ßII comprises the bulk of the novel, intertwining accounts of two murder investigations headed by V√≠kingur. # √ûorgeir has convinced √ûorm√≥√∞ur to join him in robbing a branch of the √ûj√≥√∞banki. Characteristically of these rather comical characters, the robbery goes badly, and √ûorgeir kills a passerby and his dog with his sawn-off shotgun, and accidentally injures √ûorm√≥√∞ur in the process. The two flee to √ûorgeir's house, but a neighbour recognises that √ûorgeir may be one of the robbers and informs the police. √ûorgeir takes √ûorm√≥√∞ur to hospital in Selfoss, where √ûorm√≥√∞ur receives treatment and pretends to have been on a several-week alcoholic bender and to remember nothing about the cause of his injury. Back at home, √ûorgeir is ambushed by V√≠kingur and the V√≠kingasveitin, opens fire, and is killed. It emerges that had √ûorgeir sold either his Cadillac or his shotgun, he could have gained legally more money that he even dreamed of winning through the bank robbery. By the end of the novel, it does not appear that the police have enough evidence to charge √ûorm√≥√∞ur. # Shortly after the foster brothers' robbery, the body of Haraldur's best friend R√∫nar is discovered in R√∫nar's home. R√∫nar's dog has also been killed, and its head placed on R√∫nar's decapitated body, with the letter O written in blood above R√∫nar's corpse. His head is missing. The police have little evidence to go on, but suspect Eastern European organised crime, linking the handling of R√∫nar's body with the Oprichnina. A nightwatchman at the √ûj√≥√∞banki headquarters later finds the head in Haraldur's private freezer there. Haraldur eventually explains that he found it placed in his car, presumably as a threat. The reader is privy to a meeting between Mikhail Moisejevitsj Lev√≠tan and Haraldur in which it becomes clear that Mikhail directed Petra and Vasil√≠ to kill R√∫nar in order to cow Haraldur into acceding to his wishes. Haraldur tips off the police that Petra and Vasil√≠ are the killers and that they are in Iceland. The reader also learns that Petra lost a lot of money when shares in a DNA research company VikingDNA (a cipher for deCODE genetics) collapsed and has decided to seek recompense from the director, L√°rus J√≥hannsson (corresponding to K√°ri Stef√°nsson). V√≠kingur and the V√≠kingasveitin make a helicopter raid on the island where Petra and Vasil√≠ have met L√°rus. The criminals are killed in a gunfight and the news successfully covered up. ¬ßIII is a coda in which Haraldur's old business associate Magn√∫s Valgar√∞sson, dying of cancer, confidentially confesses to V√≠kingur that he was the indirect cause of R√∫nar's death. Lacking the resources to prosecute Haraldur for defrauding him but still seeking some kind of justice, he had the idea of transferring his ownership of the shares in the old alcopop company to Mikhail Moisejevitsj Lev√≠tan, in the knowledge that Mikhail would not fail to do what was necessary to win for himself the billions owed to Magn√∫s. Mikhail had, however, gone further than Magn√∫s had reckoned on.

During his days at Harvard, Wilson was playfully known as \\"Tex\\", a nickname that stayed with him for life. In New York, Wilson was a contributor to The Dial along with many influential literary persons of the time. Career Wilson was active in the New York, NY, Lime Rock, CT, Newport, RI, Gloucester, MA, and Rockport, MA art scenes between the 1930s ‚Äì 1972. Wilson painted post-modern artwork utilizing the name Pico Miran in his Gloucester, Massachusetts studio, taught portraiture at the Rockport Art Association in Rockport, Massachusetts under the name Winslow Wilson, and painted seascapes as Winslow Wilson in his Rockport, Massachusetts studio. Wilson was strongly influenced by his time at Harvard and World War I. In addition to a tragic event in Boston which resulted in the death of one of Wilson‚Äôs friends in 1912, there is evidence that Wilson encountered trauma during World War I. According to family sources, Wilson was an Army Air Force gunner who parachuted from his plane during the War and was stranded hanging in a tree for several days before being rescued. Art became a vehicle through which Wilson found solace. His Post-Modern artwork is replete with images of industrial and nuclear effects upon the common man, and those who knew him confirm that he was consumed with the concept of a nuclear holocaust. Growing up in rural Texas, to a life in Boston and New York, friendships with intellectuals, Wilson‚Äôs writings reveal a man who held his craft and opinions in high regard. Understanding that Wilson eschewed family relationships while fully immersing himself as a bit of an artistic recluse, provides an insight into the life of this artist. Desolato Bay Wilson painted seascapes in his Rockport, Massachusetts studio. His seascapes were exhibited at Vose Gallery in Boston. In a letter dated January 24, 1991, Robert C. Vose Jr., of Vose Gallery, confirmed that the gallery ‚Äúdid give {Wilson} an exhibition in our galleries in Boston‚Äù and stated ‚ÄúWe thought of {the paintings} of excellent quality, and much in the spirit of Frederick Waugh‚Äù. Eleanor Roosevelt chaired a one-man art show held in New York City entitled \\"Paintings of the Sea\\". On June 4, 1951, the First Lady, Eleanor Roosevelt ‚Äúblogged‚Äù in her My Day report, that she had visited this exhibit, and she reported: ‚ÄúIn certain ones the light made one think of tropical climates; in others the shores of Maine seemed to stand out. More often the sky and the sea were stormy, but the light was nearly always breaking through. Let us hope that out of this turbulent period in history the light will break through for all human beings‚Äù. Gloucester Under the pseudonym of Pico Miran painted in his Gloucester studio. Upon occasion, he would have a visitor, however the room in which he painted was never open. His post-modern art, or as he referred to it as \\"super-realistic\\", is replete with political and religious tones, and is highly reflective of the nuclear and mechanical themes of the period. thumb Wilson was a member of the Rockport Art Association from 1946 through 1972, and for many of those years he taught portraiture. His portraits have included local Gloucester residents and friends. Human Conception of God (God, Ape, Swine) Following Wilson‚Äôs death in 1974, his long-term companion, Jane Grey (an accomplished portrait artist), gifted his paintings to his only son, Horace Peter Wilson. Those paintings remained stored in Kansas City until 2012, at which time the paintings were distributed to Wilson‚Äôs grandchildren. In 2014, Dave Rich, a Gloucester native, stated in a correspondence with Peter Anastas: ‚Äú...would take an interest in the precocious postmodernism of Pico Miran. His value lies in his theorizing postmodernity, and making the first forays into postmodern visual art ‚Äî the seascapes were a virtuoso performance; Winslow was no less a character than Pico or Tex. In that sense he was a performance artist. A kind of Andy Kaufman who took personae and masks to the extreme. On this conceptual level, if explained as such, Wilson ought to be recovered; and could be recovered by an astute and enterprising curator.‚Äù The paintings are in the process of being professionally restored and framed, and efforts are underway to showcase Wilson‚Äôs paintings. A website exists with the roots of a biography about the artist, currently being documented and researched by Claudia Wilson Howard in conjunction with interested parties across the United States.

Known for his research in solid state physics, Jain was an elected fellow of the Indian National Science Academy and National Academy of Sciences, India. In 1966, the Council of Scientific and Industrial Research, the apex agency of the Government of India for scientific research, awarded him the Shanti Swarup Bhatnagar Prize for Science and Technology, one of the highest Indian science awards for his contributions to physical sciences.  Biography  IIT Delhi S. C. Jain, born on 5 December 1926 in Saharanpur in the Indian state of Uttar Pradesh, earned an MSc degree in physics in 1949 and followed it up with a PhD in solid state physics from Delhi University in 1955, carrying out his research at the National Physical Laboratory, Delhi under Kariamanickam Srinivasa Krishnan. Subsequently, he moved to the UK to take up the position of a faculty member at University of Leeds and worked there until 1958. On his return to India, he joined the Indian Institute of Technology, Delhi where he served as the head of the department of physics from 1965 to 1968 and as the dean of faculty of science from 1966 to 1969. Concurrently, he worked at his alma mater, the National Physical Laboratory, and held the position of a deputy director during 1965‚Äì69, and as the director of Solid State Physics Laboratory (SSPL) during the period 1969‚Äì74. While heading the SSPL, he also held the directorship of the Defence Research and Development Organization (DRDO). In between, he did visiting professor assignments at University of Illinois, Atomic Energy Research Establishment and Imperial College of London (1975‚Äì77). Jain died on 10 December 2009, at the age of 83.  Legacy  During his doctoral studies, Jain assisted his mentor, K. S. Krishnan, the co- discoverer of the Raman Effect, on the thermal conductivity of solids. It was during this time, the duo developed a methodology for the measurement of thermal conductivity in solids at high temperatures which was published by them in an article, Thermionic Constants of Metals and Semiconductors. II. Metals of the First Transition Group in 1952 in Proceedings of the Royal Society of London. Series A, Mathematical and Physical Sciences and later explained further by way of another article, Determination of thermal conductivities at high temperatures in British Journal of Applied Physics in 1954. The measurement protocol later came to be known as the \\"Jain-Krishnan Method\\". Polar crystals, thin films and semiconductor devices are some of the other areas he worked on and he was credited with developing experimental techniques in these disciplines which are in use around the world. He also contributed to the development of electronic equipment for the military. His studies have been documented by way of a number of articles and he published four books viz. Recent advances in semiconductors: theory and technology, Nonmetallic crystals, Germanium-silicon strained layers and heterostructures, and Electronic absorption and internal and external vibrational data of atomic and molecular ions doped in alkali halide crystals. Jain was the director of the International Advanced School on Theory and Technology of Semiconductors, an Indian Institute of Technology Delhi (IIT Delhi) program held in April 1968. He chaired the international conference on science and technology of non-metallic crystals held at IIT Delhi in January 1969 and was associated with International Union of Pure and Applied Physics as a member of its solid state commission. He was also a member of the editorial boards of journals such as Radiation Effects and Defects in Solids, Crystal Lattice Defects and Amorphous Materials and Journal of Nonmetals and was a senior member of the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers.

It touched down 150 m (490 ft) short of the runway, breaking the left wing and catching fire. Of the 126 people on board the aircraft, 29 survived.  Aircraft  The aircraft involved in the accident was a Tupolev Tu-104B, registered CCCP-42405 to the West Siberia Civil Aviation Directorate, a division of Aeroflot. At the time of the accident the aircraft operated 19,489 flight hours and sustained 9,929 pressurization cycles.  Crew  The crew of the fatal flight took over in Novosibirsk. A total of eight crew members were aboard the flight, of which five were from the cockpit crew. The cockpit crew consisted of: * A. V. Ovchinnikov serving as pilot in command * A. A. Pinchuk serving as co-pilot * G.P. Guslyakov serving as flight engineer * I. V. Shchepkin serving as navigator * V. I. Bolotin serving as radio operator Flight attendants G. K. Eselevich, L. B. Shokin and A. N. Sorokin served as the cabin crew.  Synopsis  The Odessa-Kyiv-Chelyabinsk-Novosibirsk part of the route was carried out by a different aircraft, Tu-104B registered CCCP-42402; as well as a different crew. At the stopover in Novosibirsk at Tolmachevo Airport, a new crew and aircraft took on the route. At 04:34 local time (01:34 Moscow time) the airliner departed Novosibirsk for Irkutsk. After takeoff the flight maintained an altitude of 10,000 meters. In Irkutsk, the sky was completely covered with stratus clouds with a ceiling of 150 meters, mild north-easterly winds were present, and visibility was at 1500 meters. The crew was instructed to proceed on the final approach on a bearing of 116¬∞. At 08:10 local time (03:10 Moscow time) the air traffic controller gave flight 1912 permission to begin descent. At 08:29:35 the crew received a landing instructions and permission to descend to an altitude of 400 meters. The flight crew responded that they heard the information and would begin approach with the ILS. In response, the air traffic controller reported weather conditions to the flight. At 08:31:52 the flight was on approach 17 kilometers from the runway. At first, the aircraft stayed on the correct trajectory; but when the aircraft was eight kilometers from the runway, the air traffic controller warned the flight that it was straying to the left. At 08:33:45 local time, when the flight was just seven kilometers from the runway, the air traffic controller warned that they were close to missing the glide slope. In response, the flight crew notified the controller that the landing gear had been released and they were ready to land. At 08:33:58 received permission to land; the crew confirmed they received the information. At 08:34:18 the crew reported they were near the non-directional beacon. The controller again warned the flight of the slight deviation to the left. The recommended instrument approach speed for the Tu-104 is 300 km/h, but it is very likely that the aircraft's instruments overstated the speed, causing the misinformed crew tried to reduce speed. In reality, the aircraft's speed was around 270‚Äì275 km/h, causing a left bank and a lateral deviation of 30 meters. At 08:34:47 the aircraft passed the non-directional beacon at an altitude of 85 meters. Due to flying 25‚Äì30 km/h less than the recommended speed, the aircraft reached a critical angle of attack. At 08:35:00 with a vertical speed of approximately 8‚Äì10 m/s, the TU-104 hit the right landing gear on the runway 154 meters from the base of the runway; milliseconds later the left landing gear, then the front gear, stuck the runway. Shortly thereafter the left wing of the plane broke, fuel leaking from the broken left tanks ignited. The plane skidded on the runway, causing the fuselage to break into pieces. The wreckage of the plane was strewn over an area of 500 meters. 97 people perished in the crash; the captain, the co-pilot, the flight engineer, a flight attendant, as well as 73 adult passengers and 20 children. 36 of the deaths were from carbon monoxide poisoning.  Causes  The flight was on an approach speed far below the recommended parameters. The instruments most likely gave inaccurate readings, causing the crew to reduce speed before touching the runway led to a hard landing. Examination of the airspeed indicators showed that the indicators themselves were functional, but flight tests showed that changes cabin pressure affected the pressure in the full-pressure pipeline of the speed indicator used by the co-pilot and the navigator; resulting in an overstatement of the speed ranging from 17 to 80 km/h. While simulating the flight to determine the cause of the erroneous indications, the depressurization happened approximately three minutes after turning off the cabin pressurization. The probability of such events occurring during descent was supposed to be 0.000001%. The investigation cited the three primary causes of the accident as follows: See also *Aeroflot Flight 964, also a Tupolev Tu-104, crashed on approach experiencing similar artificial horizon failure. *Aeroflot Flight 2415, instrument failure of Tu-104 causing crash shortly after takeoff. *Aeroflot Flight 3932, another Tupolev Tu-104, crashed shortly after takeoff experiencing similar artificial horizon failure.

In general, the human urine or mixed waste is collected and stored for a period of time, before being applied either directly or passed through a biofilter before reaching the plants. As a form of organic hydroponics, anthroponics combines elements of both hydroponics and aquaponics systems. Lettuce (Lactuca sativa) grown in three similar anthroponic systems  History  While human waste has historically been used as a fertilizer, its use in soilless systems is a recent field of research.

Citrullus lanatus seeds as a urine catalyst for anthroponic use. Hemmaodlat, Malm√∂, Sweden The sterilized and volatilized liquid is then passed through a biofilter where nitrifying bacteria convert the ammonia to nitrate, a more plant available form of nitrogen. Given the constituents of urine and the daily amount produced per person, it is estimated that one human adult could produce almost 3 kg of lettuce from the volume of urine excreted daily. Wood ash has also been used to supplement urine when cultivating cucumbers, as they require more nutrients than those found in urine.S√°nchez, Henrique (2016). Wood ash as a nutrient supplement for Cucumis Sativus in an anthroponics system. Hemmaodlat, Malm√∂, Sweden.  Hydroponic subsystem  After the biofilter, the water is transported to the hydroponic component where the plants are located, and where they will absorb the nutrients, cleaning the water before it returns to the biofilter. Almost all techniques used in hydroponics and aquaponics are also applicable to anthroponics. These include: Deep water culture, Nutrient film technique, and Media beds.  Advantages  Image describing the inputs and outputs of a mineral soiless cultivation (hydroponics) and a urine based soiless cultivation (anthroponics) Urine based solutions in hydroponics research seem to have been developed out of sustainability concerns with current mineral based hydroponic solutions. Mineral based commercial nutrient solutions are resource intensive and energy demanding, while also producing a lot of waste. The activities involved in its production include: mining, ore treatment, chemical processing, and transportation, which result in the required nutrients for the final solution. The whole process requires fossil fuels, electricity, chemicals, and water, while producing the nutrient solution, but also mining waste, greenhouse gases, and wastewater. By comparison, using urine as the nutrient source requires the collection of urine, electricity, some nutrient salts, and water, while producing no waste, limited greenhouse gases, and the final nutrient solution.  Disadvantages  Some disadvantages concerning the use of urine as the nutrient source in an hydroponics system include strict laws concerning the use of human waste in food crops,EC, (2016) Sewage Sludge.

SU(3) The choice of the SU(3)F as the underlying family symmetry beyond the Standard Model appears related to the following issues: *(i) It provides a natural explanation of the number three of observed quark-lepton families; *(ii) Its local nature conforms with the other local symmetries of the Standard Model, such as the weak isospin symmetry SU(2)W or color symmetry SU(3)C; *(iii) Its chiral nature, according to which both left-handed and right-handed fermions are proposed to be fundamental triplets of the SU(3)F symmetry, provides the hierarchical mass spectrum of quark-lepton families as a result of a spontaneous symmetry breaking; *(iv) It admits a natural unification with conventional Grand unified theories (GUTs) in a direct product form, such as SU(5)‚äóSU(3)F, SO(10)‚äóSU(3)F or E(6)‚äóSU(3)F, and also as a subgroup of the extended (family unified) SU(8) or E(8) GUTs; *(v) It has a straightforward extension to the supersymmetric Standard Model and GUTs. With these natural criteria accepted, other family symmetry candidates have turned out to be at least partially discriminated. Applications Among the applications of the SU(3)F symmetry, the most interesting ones are the realistic description of the quark and lepton masses and mixings, neutrino masses and oscillations, rare processes etc. with a natural suppression of all dangerous flavor- changing transitions. The special sector of applications is related to a newly described type of topological defects - flavored cosmic strings and monopoles appearing during the spontaneous violation of the SU(3)F which may be considered as possible candidates for the cold dark matter in the Universe.

Dartford Heath is classified as lowland heath and is one of only two substantial heathland blocks remaining in Kent. The heath supports a number of rare plants and invertebrates, as well as reptiles, including the common lizard and slow-worm, and rabbits. History Prehistoric barrows, and Stone Age and Bronze Age artefacts have been discovered on Dartford Heath in some abundance. The heath has been important to local people since medieval times as common land; it therefore escaped enclosure during the late 18th and early 19th centuries, however during this period the heath was owned by the Tredegars and it was heavily excavated for granite, chalk and other natural resources. Many pits and holes were observed in the 1830s, some \\"[15 or 20] fathoms deep. At the mouth and thence downward they were narrow, like the tunnel of a chimney or the passage of a well, but at the bottom enlarged; and some had several rooms or partitions, strongly vaulted and supported with pillars of chalk\\". Sir Charles Morgan Robinson Morgan (1792‚Äì1875), 1st Baron Tredegar, owner of Dartford Heath They were believed to have originally been dug for the removal of chalk, which was used in building, and in fertilising agricultural land. In his History and Antiquities of Dartford, John Dunkin quoted historian Edward Hasted, ‚Äúon the authority of Tacitus‚Äù, that it was ‚Äúmost probable that some of them were used as secret hiding places by our Saxon ancestors, for their wives, children, and goods, in times of civil war or foreign invasion‚Äù. He added that (by 1844) ‚Äúmost of [the holes] are now stopped up, and thus accidents which heretofore occurred both to man and beast, are prevented‚Äù. Dunkin noted that the 1st Baron Tredegar, the lord of the manor and owner of the heath, had restricted the public‚Äôs right of way, though his tenants were allowed to graze cattle there. In 1832 a special Court Baron was held to temporarily grant to the church wardens of Dartford, in trust, some acres of common waste land on the heath for the employment (by himself) of local poor persons, and to affirm that for, much of the remainder of the heath, the public should be given right of common. However, extensive granite, chalk and turf extractions continued until the Law of Property Act 1925 severely restricted the right of lords of the manor to deface common lands as they saw fit; at which time Courtenay Morgan, 1st Viscount Tredegar, sold the heath to Dartford Urban District Council and much of the excavation works in the area ceased. Large dips and mounds are still visible as a result of this work and its associated industries. In the 19th century, towards the north of the heath, a series of parallel mounds known as the Glory Bumps were left after the extraction of clay for use in brickworks. The first recorded local cricket match took place at Bowman's Lodge in 1723; and the Society of Royal Kentish Bowman, whose members included the future King George IV, met here between 1785 and 1802. The nearby area is still known as Bowmans. Soldiers were stationed on Dartford Heath in 1779-80, and again during World War Two when a Royal Artillery anti-aircraft regiment was stationed there - the camp's tarmac roads are still in evidence. Present day Footpath leading from Old Bexley Lane into a south-western corner of the heath. Since 1925 the heath has largely maintained its shape and character, except for the areas destroyed by the building of the first Dartford bypass (Princes Road), circa 1930, and the A2 dual carriageway in 1973, which cut off Leyton Cross and the southernmost parts of the heath from the north. The heath contains three ponds (Donkey Pond, Woodland Pond and North Pond), though they have occasionally dried up in recent years, and a variety of habitats: including acid grassland, broadleaved semi-natural woodland (including oak, birch, hawthorn), heather and gorse, as well as open grassland. Dartford Heath is used as a local recreation area, particularly for cyclists and dog walkers, but can be adversely affected by proximity to the local refuse and recycling centre on Old Rochester Way, which sometimes leaves windblown rubbish along nearby roads. Management is required to maintain the heath's traditional horticulture. Efforts are centred around reduction of scrub encroachment, fire prevention, and trials to re-instate heath vegetation. The site is in a Countryside Commission stewardship scheme. While skateboarding and other pastimes have long been banned, the heath was for some 80 years a designated model aircraft flying area. However permission was revoked in 2003 after a teenager died from head injuries when she was accidentally struck by a plane. A small visitors' car park is situated on Heath Lane (Upper).

He was the son and successor of Bindu.  Biography  Khorasan, Transoxiana and Tokharistan Tughshada was born in ca. 681‚Äîa few months later, during the Muslim conquest of Transoxiana, Bindu was killed by the Umayyad general Salm ibn Ziyad. Tughshada, who was a few months old, then succeeded him. However, the kingdom was in reality controlled by Tughshada's mother, who is only known by her title of Khatun, and is celebrated in the local historical tradition for her wisdom and capable management. She is reported to have held court daily, \\"inquired into the affairs of state and issued orders and prohibitions,\\" while at a distance stood \\"two hundred youths from the landowners and the princes ready for service, girded with gold belts and bearing swords.\\" In 676 she dispatched a contingent to aid an Arab assault on Samarqand. Coin of Khunuk In 706, a civil war erupted in Bukhara and its surrounding cities and towns; the ruler of the nearby Wardana, known as the Wardan Khudah, had seized most of the principality, while a Sogdian magnate named Khunuk Khudah, managed to rally the nobles of Bukhara around him and declared himself as the Bukhar Khudah. At the same time, the new Umayyad governor of Khurasan, Qutayba ibn Muslim, had captured Paykand, a city near Bukhara. The city soon revolted, and the Arabs responded by sacking the city. The brutality of the sack of Paykand shocked the Sogdian world, and led the nobles of Bukhara under Khunuk to make an alliance with the Wardan Khudah. However, during the fighting between the Arabs and Sogdians, the Wardan Khudah was killed, which probably constituted a heavy blow to the Bukhara-Wardana alliance. Bukhara was shortly after captured by Qutayba, who imposed a tribute of 200,000 dirhams, and installed an Arab garrison to secure against rebellion. During the same time, another Sogdian king named Tarkhun, who was the ruler of Samarkand, acknowledged the authority of the Umayyad Caliphate. After having settled an affair in Tokharistan, Qutayba restored Bukhara to the young Tughshada, and the faction of Khunuk including himself were executed. Later, in 712/3, in order spread Islam in Bukhara, Qutayba built a mosque in the city's citadel, and even encouraged the natives to convert by paying them to attend the prayers. However, Islamization proceeded very slowly, and the rulers of Bukhara would remain Zoroastrian until their downfall. Tughshada, however, still tried to achieve independence from the Umayyad Caliphate, and in 718, along with Tarkhun's successor Gurak, Narayana, the king of Kumadh, and Tish, the king of Chaghaniyan, he sent an embassy to the Tang dynasty of China, where they asked for aid against the Arabs. In ca. 728, an anti-Arab revolt erupted in Bukhara, which was suppressed one year later. Tughshada was assassinated by two angry dehqan nobles in 739, and was succeeded by his son Qutayba, who was named in honour of the Umayyad general.

Opening The railway opened on 15 July 1885. It was part of a network of local railways in the Twente and Achterhoek regions, built by the Geldersch-Overijsselsche Spoorweg Maatschappij (GOLS). The line between Winterswijk and Zevenaar is the last of these railway lines which are still in regular use. Modernisation On 31 August 2015 a 700 metre extension of double track around Wehl was put into use to improve reliability on the line. In the summer of 2019, the track between Zevenaar and Didam became double track. The speed of the line between Zevenaar and Didam increased from 100 km/h to 120 km/h. The speed of the line between Didam and Wehl also increased from 100 km/h to 130 km/h. Usage =Train services= When the line opened there were just a few passenger trains per day between Winterswijk and Zevenaar. More trains operated between Zevenaar and Doetinchem, which continued to Ruurlo. From 1918 the train service was more frequent and most service operated to and from Arnhem. At the end of the 1930s, there was a train service between Arnhem and Winterswijk every two hours. Between Arnhem and Doetinchem there were extra services operated, meaning there was an hourly service. The train from Doetinchem to Arnhem continued to Ede and Amersfoort operating via the Nijkerk‚ÄìEde-Wageningen railway. This service ceased at the start of World War II. In 1947 an hourly service was introduced between Arnhem and Winterswijk and a few years later peak hour extra services started between Arnhem and Doetinchem. These extra services quickly expanded to operate the whole day. In the 1970s when the regular timetable was introduced across the Netherlands, the service between Arnhem and Doetinchem became a half-hourly frequency. Half-hourly services later also started on Saturdays and since 1995 on Sundays too. In 1999, Syntus took over the train services between Doetinchem and Winterswijk, with trains operating half-hourly except on Sunday mornings and early afternoons when an hourly service was offered. Until 2001 passengers to/from Arnhem had to change trains in Doetinchem, but from then on there was a through service available again between Arnhem, Doetinchem and Winterswijk. From 2001 to 2003, Syntus operated extra peak hour trains between Arnhem and Zevenaar and from 2003 these were extended to Doetinchem. In 2012 the train services were taken over by Arriva and Breng. On Monday to Friday they operate a quarter-hourly service between Arnhem and Doetinchem. Arriva operate the services between Arnhem and Winterswijk. Breng operate the services between Arnhem and Doetinchem, which only operate Monday to Friday. =Train types= Steam trains operated for a long time between Arnhem and Winterswijk. The train service from Amersfoort to Doetinchem introduced in 1937 was operated by diesel multiple units. During and after World War II only steam trains operated on the line. In the early 1950s new DE 3 units were introduced. By 1955 all services on the line were operated by Plan X trains. From 1963 some of the train services were operated by Plan U and DE 5 diesel multiple units. Locomotives with coaching stock took over the peak hour trains between Arnhem and Winterswijk from 1972 and remained in service until the summer of 1987. In the summer of 1983 and winter of 1984/85 these train services were operated by three Plan X units coupled together. From 1987 Plan U operated all services on the line. From the summer of 1996 new DM'90 diesel multiple units were tested in service between Arnhem and Doetinchem and later in the year also to Winterswijk. Once Syntus took over services on the line from 1999 most trains were operated by LINT trains as well as DM'90 units. Since 9 December 2012, when Arriva and Breng took over the services Stadler GTW diesel multiple units have been operated on the line.

During the visit, Equatorial Guinea signed the TEAM 9 agreement with India. The High Commission of India in Lagos, Nigeria was concurrently accredited to Equatorial Guinea from 2005 until 2008, when the accreditation was transferred to the Embassy of India in Luanda, Angola. India Ambassador to Angola and Equatorial Guinea A.R. Ghanashyam presented his credentials in March 2008, and held discussions with the President and Foreign Minister. Both the President and Foreign Minister expressed their desire to visit India to improve bilateral cooperation. The Foreign Minister also requested India's assistance to provide English language training to 80 Equatorial Guineans. The Government of Equatorial Guinea also proposed draft agreements to establish a Joint Commission and for a General Cooperation Agreement. Minister of State for IT & Telecom Sachin Pilot visited Equatorial Guinea as the Prime Minister's Special Envoy and officially invited President Teodoro Obiang Nguema Mbasogo to attend the second India Africa Summit. President Mbasogo, who was serving as the Chairman of the African Union at the time, and Indian Prime Minister Manmohan Singh co-chaired the Summit in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia. Joint Secretary (West Africa) in the MEA Rajinder Bhagat headed an Indian delegation to the 19th Ordinary Session of the Executive Council of the African Union in Malabo. India attended the Summit, which was chaired by Equatorial Guinea, as an observer. India also sent a delegation to serve as observers at the council's 25th Ordinary Session in Malabo. Minister of State for AYUSH Shripad Yesso Naik visited Equatorial Guinea on 25 August 2015 as the Prime Minister's Special Envoy and officially invited President Mbasogo to attend the third India Africa Summit. He also met with the Foreign Minister. The invitation resulted in first ever visit by an Equatorial Guinean President to India, when Mbasogo led a high level delegation to attend the Summit in New Delhi in October 2015. He held bilateral talks with Prime Minister Narendra Modi on 28 October. In October 2015, India approved Equatorial Guinea's request to open a diplomatic mission in New Delhi. The embassy was operational in October 2019.  Trade  Bilateral trade between Equatorial Guinea and India grew from US$4.87 million in 2006‚Äì07 to $764.39 million in 2014‚Äì15. India exported $15.01 million worth of goods to Equatorial Guinea, and imported $749.38 million in 2014‚Äì15. Between the 1998‚Äì99 and 2002-03 fiscal years, India made no imports from Equatorial Guinea between 1998 and 2002, and from 2003 to 2005. Indian imports from the country in 2002-03 and 2005-06 fiscal years was negligible. The main commodities exported by India to Equatorial Guinea are fish, crustaceans, and iron and steel. The major commodities imported by India from Equatorial Guinea are crude oil and oil derivatives, seeds, medicinal plants, ore, slag and ash, wood and wood articles, natural or cultured pearls, stones, and imitation jewelry. ONGC Videsh Ltd signed an agreement with the Government of Equatorial Guinea for cooperation in oil and gas sector on 21 January 2016, on the sidelines of the 4th India-Africa Hydrocarbons Summit in New Delhi.

Foreign aid  In 2005, the EXIM Bank of India had extended a line of credit (LOC) worth $15 million to establish a potable drinking water project in Equatorial Guinea in 2005. However, the LOC was cancelled in June 2012 after the Equatorial Guinean Government failed to prepare relevant documents and fulfill other required formalities to obtain an LOC within the specified time period. India offered to establish 5 Centers on Geoinformatic Applications for Rural Development in Africa at the second India Africa Forum Summit, one of which would be located in Equatorial Guinea. The Government of Equatorial Guinea approved the construction of the Center in July 2012.

In 1795, he was cited in the divorce case of William Townshend Mullins and his second wife, Frances. In politics In 1818, Dottin, a Tory, entered Parliament for the rotten borough of Gatton. He failed to be elected in 1820 at Southampton, despite heavy expenditure. In 1826 he was returned there unopposed, and again in 1830. In 1831, he did not stand, for health reasons. Re-elected in 1835, in a contested election, he remained in Parliament until he retired in 1841.

This represented an increase of 7 seats and 1 additional ward when compared to 2012. Each ward elected either 3 or 4 members, using the STV electoral system. The election saw the Scottish National Party overtake Labour as the largest party on the council. Despite The SNP winning the most seats and most votes, North Lanarkshire is run by a minority Labour administration. Labour leader Jim Logue was appointed Leader of the Council with the support of Conservative and Independent councillors. Election result Note: \\"Votes\\" are the first preference votes.

Early life James Martin was born ca. 1760 in Ballymena, County Antrim, Ireland. He had a wife and son in Exeter and had worked in England for seven years when, at Exeter Assizes on 20 March 1786, he was sentenced to transportation for seven years for stealing eleven screw bolts and other goods, valued at 11 shillings, from Powderham Castle. He was held on the Dunkirk hulk for almost a year. His official report from Dunkirk hulk was that he was \\"tolerably decent and orderly\\". On 11 March 1787, Martin was placed upon the Charlotte and sent to New South Wales as part of the First Fleet. Martin was a useful tradesman in Sydney. Escape from New South Wales On the night of 28 March 1791, Martin, William and Mary Bryant and their children Charlotte and Emanuel , James Cox, William Allen, Samuel Bird, Samuel Broom, Nathaniel Lillie, and William Morton stole the colony's fishing boat, and rowed out of Sydney Harbour and into the Pacific Ocean. During the voyage back to England, William, Charlotte, and Emanuel Bryant, James Cox, Samuel Bird, and William Morton died. The survivors, rather than being prosecuted on the capital charge of returning from transportation, were instead ordered on 5 July 1792 to serve out the remainder of their respective sentences of transportation in Newgate gaol. The lawyer and biographer James Boswell interceded with the government on their behalf, and on 2 May 1793 Mary Bryant was given an unconditional pardon, and the four men were discharged from Newgate by proclamation on 3 November 1793. Martin's fate after being released is unknown. =Portrayals= Martin was portrayed by John Ewart in the 1963 Australian Broadcasting Commission serial, The Hungry Ones. The Memorandoms As well as being the only extant first- hand account of this famous escape, Memorandoms by James Martin is the earliest Australian convict narrative. The original manuscript is part of the vast manuscript archive of the philosopher Jeremy Bentham, held by University College London Library's Special Collections. The Memorandoms was first discovered by the Bentham scholar Charles Blount in the 1930s, who published a short edition, limited to 150 copies. A second edition of eleven pages, by Victor Crittenden, was published in 1991. A new edition, Memorandoms by James Martin: An Astonishing Escape from Early New South Wales, edited by Tim Causer, was published in open access in 2017 by UCL Press. This new edition makes available, for the first time and for free, facsimiles of the original manuscript alongside an annotated transcript, and features a scholarly introduction which puts the escape in context, and challenges many of the myths and legends which have grown around the Bryant party's escape.

It contains one of the 10 nature reserves in the Eider-Treene Depression in the western part of the German state of Schleswig-Holstein. Since 1976, an area of 190.1 hectares has been protected as a nature reserve. The koog is part of the municipality of Delve in the county of Dithmarschen. The nature reserve is distinguished by areas of fen with reed beds and meadows of large and small sedge. The many, small, open waterbodies with an extensive irrigation ditch system form an important habitat, especially for birds. Originally, the region was exploded to the tidal influence of the Eider and was used especially for harvesting thatch. At that time, there was a saying :Wenn Du wullt warrn in't Bett ni natt, denn kumm nan'n Delv un koop Di Dack! (\\"If you really don't want to be wet in bed, then come to Delve and cut [thatch for] your roof\\"). Even today, parts of the koog are used to harvest thatch. When, in 1936, the groundwater level of the region became lower, dykes were built around it and the area was irrigated so thatch harvesting was not endangered; as a result, it became a refuge for animals and plants that live in wet, fenland areas. Extensive areas of reedbed and rare plants such as cottongrass and various species of sedge exist. The Delver Koog is one of the most important stopover sites for the hen harrier, as well as waders, gulls, and wet meadow birds that rest here during their migration. In addition, reed buntings, Savi's warbler, various reed warblers, great bitterns, and marsh harriers live in Delver Koog.

Sequences were taken from the material Lord Beaverbrook had stored in the Imperial War Museum (in London, England), and purchases or loans of other wartime footage were negotiated with foreign governments, newsreel companies and film production houses throughout the world. A total of some two million reels of film was collected and finally reduced to 10 reels, with a running time of an hour-and-a-half.

He also involved himself in political journalism and newspaper publishing. Most of the twelve Nazi years he spent in political exile, based initially in Prague. Shortly after the fall of France and the establishment of a puppet state (Vichy France) in the southern half of the country he established himself in the \\"Hotel de Berne\\" in Marseilles where, by the time he was himself forced to flee to Portugal in March 1941, it has been estimated that he rescued \\"at least 600 people\\" ‚Äì refugees from Nazi Germany forced to flee for reasons of race and / or politics ‚Äì by organising identity papers, visas, tickets and cash.  Life  = Social democratic childhood = Fritz Heine was born in Hanover, his parents' only child. His mother, always delicate, died from Consumption during the First World War when he was just twelve. His father, Friedrich Heine, was an organ builder who had, like his brothers, joined the Social Democratic Party (\\"Sozialdemokratische Partei Deutschlands\\" / SPD) in its early days. Socialist political ideas were therefore part of Fritz Heine's childhood. Initially he underwent a conventional Protestant upbringing, but when he was thirteen he rejected Protestantism. His father did not try to prevent this, although much later, looking back, Heine suggested that his act of teenage rebellion must have embarrassed his father whose work, as a builder of organs, necessarily involved churches and churchmen. After his mother died his father remarried: his second wife was a distant cousin who had been widowed on 4 August 1914 when her first husband had poisoned himself in order to avoid having to fight in the war that had been launched a week earlier. = Party worker = Heine underwent a commercial training and worked between 1923 and 1925 as a sales representative and / or marketing assistant for a printing machine manufacturer. He had already, when aged just 18, joined the SPD in 1922, and in 1925 he volunteered to work in Berlin, an hour by train to the east of Hanover, for the party national executive. By this time he had moved on from his work selling printing machines and was supporting himself as a journalist for a Hanover regional sports-newspaper. After six months as a volunteer trainee with the party he was given a job as a joint- secretary, working for the party treasurer. Early on, however, he was transferred to work as an editorial assistant on Vorw√§rts (\\"Onwards\\" / \\"Forwards\\"), the party newspaper. = Resisting the Nazis = As the political temperature increased during the later 1920s, from 1928 Franz Heine began to create a propaganda and publicity department for the party. Although one or two local party branches were involved informally in this type of activity, there was, prior to 1928, no national department undertaking it. In 1929 he is described as the Technical Head of the Publicity Department (\\"Technischer Leiter der Werbeabteilung\\"). Work included monitoring of newspaper coverage, along with producing pamphlets and posters. He was also involved in the early use for party political publicity of sound film. The accelerating growth in support for the populist demagoguery and street violence following the Wall Street crash and the ensuing economic depression failed to put an end to his political work. In 1932 Heine was placed on Probation for defamation of a Nazi politician. The political tide continued to flow strongly against moderate politics: in January 1933 the Nazis took power and lost little time in transforming Germany into a one-party dictatorship. Formally the ban on the SPD was implemented only in June 1933, but by that time the authorities had already been implementing a succession of measures to put an end to political activity ‚Äì other than on behalf of the Nazi Party. After initially working \\"underground\\" against the Nazi regime, in May 1933 the Vorw√§rts (\\"Onwards\\" / \\"Forwards\\") production team, including Heine was obliged to flee to Prague, still, for historical reasons, till 1945 a multi-cultural city where German was widely spoken. They travelled armed, and each carrying several hundred Marks of party funds in cash, leaving the safe in the party headquarters empty except for worthless inflation-era bank notes. = Exile in Prague = From his Prague basis Heine was active in resistance work as secretary with the Sopade, the exiled SPD leadership group based in the city between 1933 and 1938. Serving between 1933 and 1936, with particular responsibilities in respect of publication and propaganda matters and on co-ordination of party resistance activity within Germany, he organised couriers, who risked their lives using false identities to maintain links between the Sopade leaders in Prague and party supporters still in Germany. Early on he himself also undertook approximately ten missions between Prague and Germany, using a false passport. Although the methods used to transport party propaganda material from Prague to Germany became ever more sophisticated, and included the use of microfilms hidden in canisters disguised as toothpaste containers, the Gestapo became ever more adept at identifying and intercepting it, and at cutting off funding to the Prague group. In 1936 the propaganda activities of the Sopade operation in Prague had to be suspended. Working conditions became increasingly difficult. German envoys appeared 29 times at the Foreign Ministry in Prague to deliver increasingly menacing protests against the activities of the exiled SPD and the publication, since 1933 from Prague, of the party newspaper Vorw√§rts. In Summer 1937 the Czechoslovak president, Edvard Bene≈°, felt himself forced to give out an ultimatum: either the Sopade group must put an end to all political and publication activity or they would have to leave Czechoslovakia completely. However, in March 1938 a solution appeared when L√©on Blum, who was sympathetic to any left-wing political exiles from Nazi Germany, returned to power as Prime Minister of France and offered the Vorw√§rts team unconditional. Heine received his French entry visa on 20 April 1938 and arrived two days later in Paris to be greeted with the news that back in Germany he had been stripped of his citizenship. Working conditions in Paris were difficult, both because money was desperately short and because hardly anyone there spoke German, but a small print-shop was procured, with difficulty, on the outskirts of the city, and production of Vorw√§rts resumed, although it is not clear whether, by now, it was circulated beyond the community of German political exiles in France. Meanwhile, during the summer of 1938 Germany progressively annexed the frontier regions around the western half of Czechoslovakia under an arrangement sanctioned in September 1938 by the governments of France and Britain. In 1939 Fritz Heine was co-opted into the leadership team of the Paris-based exiled SPD. = Exile in Paris = War broke out in September 1939 and a couple of weeks later Otto Wels, leader of the exiled Paris based party, died. The situation became ever more confused. At this stage Heine remained a liberty. Nevertheless, by now even in France political refugees were becoming increasingly closely monitored, required to report to the local prefecture each week. The precise intended purpose of this remained vague, but one effect was to ensure that the authorities had up to date records of where they lived. Heine's name was included on a list held at the Interior Ministry of \\"Known international anti- fascists\\". In May 1940 German armies invaded France and, more rapidly than almost anyone in Paris had anticipated, overran the northern half of the country. Heine was now, like hundreds of other political refugees from Nazi Germany, interned. After a few days in the internment camp an announcement was made over the tannoy inviting inmates to volunteer for work as unarmed military assistants. Heine volunteered for work that was thought to involve digging trenches. Later he was set to work building huts and walls for a military encampment ten miles or so outside Paris. However, with the German army advancing rapidly and the French army retreating during May and June 1940, military organisation was in short supply as it affected the volunteer military assistants. Heine and others managed to escape after a few weeks and joined the hundreds of thousands streaming south out of Paris in order to get away from the German armies approaching from the north. = Refugee escape organiser in Marseilles = He settled in Marseilles, which was in the so- called Free zone of France, still at least notionally autonomous in 1940, but ruled by the P√©tain government which was sympathetic to the Nazi cause as were many, though by no means all, the government officials whom it employed. In Marseilles he worked with the journalist Varian Fry, originally from New York City, to organise the Emergency Rescue Committee, which concerned itself with arranging paperwork to facilitate emigration of those at risk from the Nazis. In retrospect the \\"Emergency Rescue Committee\\" has come to be celebrated as an organisation for rescuing Jewish persecution victims, and many of those it helped were indeed Jewish, but the defining criterion for those rescued was the extent to which they were at risk from the Nazis. High-profile anti-Nazi journalists and political activists were deemed at great risk even if they were not Jewish, and were helped accordingly. Germans who had been deprived of citizenship ‚Äì such as Heine himself ‚Äì were technically stateless and for that reason at particular risk of arrest. It was in any event a matter for the US authorities to determine who should be helped. The French authorities would grudgingly issue exit visas only if applicants were already in possession of entry visas ‚Äì visitor visas ‚Äì for the United States, and the Spanish authorities would not permit transit to Portugal (from where refugees, provided their paperwork was in order, might escape by sea) unless they had valid paperwork from both the US and French authorities. Some of the details of Heine's work in Marseilles remain unclear. Refugees who had arrived without any passport were issued simply with a green refugee identity document (\\"titre de voyage\\"): holders had particular difficulties obtaining further travel documents, and forged documents of varying levels of quality became widely used. One detail which Heine himself later recalled involved a number of \\"stateless\\" refugees who were particularly young and fit. Heine was able to work with a former employee of the Lithuanian consulate who had retained the necessary equipment and expertise to produce forged Lithuanian passports, whereby 20 or 30 people were able to cross the Pyrenees on foot and satisfy the authorities that their papers were in order. This arrangement had to be ended after a refugee with a genuine Lithuanian passport was stopped and arrested by Spanish frontier officials because his passport differed significantly from the forged Lithuanian passports to which officials had become accustomed. In the middle of January 1941 it became known that Heine's name was included on a list provided to the French authorities by the Germans of people who should be handed over to them under the terms of Clause 19 in the armistice which had ended hostilities between the French and German armies back in June 1940. He was then at heightened risk of arrest and set about organising his own escape. Before he left he set in train a plan to smuggle Rudolf Breitscheid and Rudolf Hilferding, two senior and by now elderly party politicians, out of Marseilles by hiding them on a ship. However, Breitscheid and Hilferding, despite being in possession of US entry visas organised under the auspices of the \\"Emergency Rescue Committee\\", still did not have legitimate identity documents and, according to one version, refused to leave without them. They believed they would be able to leave by other means: both were arrested and later killed by the Nazis. = Escape to London = Having made his way across Spain Heine stayed for several months with Quakers in Lisbon before he was able to travel to London, where he arrived in June 1941, transported in what he later described as a \\"convoy of thirty steam ships\\". In August 1942 he joined what is described as the \\"Political Intelligence Department\\", a department of the British intelligence and security services. It is known that in 1943 he and a colleague were sent for three of four months to Algiers where twenty or thirty thousand of German soldiers were being held in prisoner of war camps, each accommodating between 3,000 and 6,000 internees following the surrender, in May 1943, of the Afrika Korps. According to one source he was mandated \\"to interview German prisoners of war in an attempt to assess the morale of the Wehrmacht and understand the generation of Germans educated in Hitler's schools\\". According to his own account his slightly more modest brief was to try and identify any anti-Nazi prisoners of war who might be separated out and taken to Britain and enjoy, possibly, better conditions in captivity while being helpful to the allied war objectives. The circumstances did not encourage prisoners to confess to being Nazi opponents, however, since in Algieria they were being accommodated in camps where their own German officers were being used by the British to supervise them and keep them in order. Under these conditions those who admitted to being opposed to Hitler, despite being held as British prisoners of war, were at risk of being tortured, and in a few cases murdered, on the orders of the German Nazi officers mandated to supervise them. In London Heine also willingly accepted an invitation in 1942 to work under the auspices of the BBC in London for a German language radio station, which listeners were intended to believe was operated by German opposition activists from somewhere within Germany. His job was to read the German newspapers and news agency reports which, somehow, the British were able to obtain and provide to him on the morning of their publication. From these he was able to provide recommendations on how the German sources might be incorporated into radio news transmissions in such a way as to serve the propaganda objectives of the allied cause. By the time he reached London, after eight years as an activist political exile, Heine's anti-Nazi credentials could not be doubted, but relations with the British political establishment were nonetheless not entirely without friction. German anti-Nazis could not accept the assumption that the entire German nation was guilty of Nazi crimes. They disagreed ‚Äì like many thoughtful British observers ‚Äì with the industrial scale bombing of German civilians in Hamburg, Dresden and numerous smaller cities: they opposed the idea of dismembering Germany industrially and politically after the Nazi defeat. Following the abrupt switch in military alliances of 1941 there was, furthermore, a marked lack of sympathy in London for the reservations that many German political refugees, including Heine, continued to nurture about Stalin and the exiled German Communists, also a very significant presence in London during the war. By 1944 it was becoming apparent that Nazi Germany would lose the war, and Heine had already had plenty of opportunity to contemplate what should happen to the country and to the Nazis when that happened. War ended in May 1945. The victorious governments had already agreed among themselves major frontier changes affecting approximately the eastern third of the country, and the division of what remained into military zones of occupation, but there was very little agreement between them as to how the military occupation should be implemented, nor ‚Äì other than in respect of the Nazi leaders ‚Äì what should be done with the surviving Germans. Heine's home city had in large part been destroyed by aerial bombing, but what remained of it was part of the British military occupation zone. He and his wife were keen to return home as soon as the war ended and help with the urgent physical and political reconstruction that would clearly need to be undertaken, but this was not a priority for British officialdom and at this stage they were was prevented from returning home. However, a general election took place in Britain in July 1945 and a new government came to power under the leadership of Clement Attlee. Richard Crossman, who had invited Heine to work for the BBC in 1942, was now a British Labour Party Member of Parliament and there was cautious reason to believe that the new British government would be more willing to let Heine return to Germany than its predecessor. He was in the end permitted to return on 4 October 1945, together with Erich Ollenhauer and Erwin Schoettle fellow members of the exiled party executive committee. The British even flew them in, on a military plane. However, permission was given to stay in Germany for just a three-day stay, after which they were required to leave again. The purpose of the visit was to attend the Wennigser Conference, remembered subsequently as the first post-war SPD party conference, held just outside Hanover. The conference served as the basis for the party's reconstruction under the direction of the concentration camp survivor Kurt Schumacher in the British, United States and French occupation zones. (The situation in the Soviet occupation zone, where SPD members were already facing pressure from the occupation authorities to agree to a merger with the Communists was more complicated.Dietrich Staritz, Die Gr√ºndung der DDR. 2nd edition 1987, ,) = British occupation zone = In February 1946 Heine was allowed to return permanently to the British occupation zone. The party hierarchy was initially informally established: in practice Erich Ollenhauer became deputy to the party leader, Kurt Schumacher, while Heine was put in charge of party publicity and propaganda, a position in which he was one of the closest political confidants of Schumacher and Ollenhauer. At the party conference held at Hanover on 8‚Äì11 May 1946 Heine was elected a member of the national party executive and the leadership relationships were formalised. To the public Fritz Heine, as press chief, was the public face of the SPD. With Germany under occupation, relations with the occupying power were of crucial importance, and Heine, his English language skills honed by his years in London, became the \\"Contact man\\" with the United States Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) on behalf both of the SPD and of the German Trade Union Confederation (\\"Deutscher Gewerkschaftsbund\\" / DGB). Behind the scenes he was a powerful member of the party leadership team. Hans-Jochen Vogel, looking back many years later, asserted wryly that for many years almost nothing happened in the party if Fritz Heine declared himself opposed to it.\\"Lange Jahre ist wohl kaum etwas gegen den erkl√§rten Widerstand von Fritz Heine geschehen\\" = West Germany and national elections = The Berlin siege of 1948/49 and the accompanying disagreements between western powers and the Soviet Union over the Currency reform of June 1948 forced western governments to recognise the reality of Germany's political (and increasingly social and economic) division: in May 1949 the British, United States and French occupation zones were merged and relaunched as the US-sponsored German Federal Republic (West Germany). After a decade and a half without democratic elections, the first West German general election was held in August 1949. Fritz Heine had been in London for the British general election in July 1945 and was confident that in Germany the SPD would be able to win free and fair national elections. His confidence was repeatedly confounded during the 1950s. The electoral battles were massively uneven for various reasons. The election plans of the SPD, drawn up under the leadership of Kurt Schumacher, had pre- supposed free elections across Germany, but with the launch of a separate West Germany a couple of months before the general election, the possibility of any free elections that included the Soviet occupation zone (after October 1949 relaunched as the German Democratic Republic) disappeared. Traditionally much of the SPD's strongest support had come from Berlin and various other major industrial cities in central Germany that were now excluded from the West German electoral process. Strongly pro-American, the canny former mayor of Cologne, Konrad Adenauer, was able to form a winning coalition of centrist and moderate right wing factions within and around the new Christian Democratic Union (CDU party). The Americans unambiguously backed the CDU, and much of the West German press was also uncompromisingly mistrustful of the SPD. The West German capital, Bonn, was close to Adenauer's political home base and natural CDU territory. The SPD was hugely outspent by the CDU in the election campaign, according to one source in a ratio of more than 100:1. During the 1950s Adenauer and his respected finance minister Ludwig Erhard steered the country through the years of a so-called \\"economic miracle\\" that owed nothing to socialist precepts, and was a stark contrast to Germany's economic experiences ‚Äì still powerfully alive in the minds of older voters ‚Äì after the First World War. West Germany's economic growth in the 1950s was powerfully underpinned by millions of refugees \\"ethnically cleansed\\" from the former eastern territories of Germany and economic migrants from the Soviet occupation zone / East Germany.Pertti Ahonen, After the expulsion: West Germany and Eastern Europe, 1945‚Äì1990, Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2003, p. 274. . Socialism, conflated in plenty of minds with the impact of the Soviet Union's foreign policy, was out of fashion in West Germany, while Fritz Heine was the hapless party election strategist who presided over electoral defeats for the SPD in 1949, 1953 and 1957. After Schumacher's death in August 1952 the party leadership passed to Erich Ollenhauer. Ollenhauer's political instincts were notably more consensual than Schumacher's. Nevertheless, in West German national elections in 1953 and 1957 the SPD's share of the vote never increased much beyond 30% of the total. The leadership team around Erich Ollenhauer were on the receiving end of intense criticism from party loyalists after the 1957 election defeat. In the immediate term Ollenhauer was to some extent protected from criticism while he remained party leader, and it was his chief electoral strategist, Fritz Heine, who became the most high-profile political casualty. Early in 1958 the party's \\"best dressed comrade\\" resigned from his position in the leadership team, and failed to gain re-election to its national executive committee at the party conference held in Stuttgart during May of that year. = Party press = In June 1958 Heine now became director of \\"Konzentrations GmbH\\", a newspaper holding company with a complicated co-operatively based ownership that comprised the bulk of the Social Democratic Party's media empire, at that time a substantial commercial enterprise. In the 1950s the party's daily press had a daily circulation in the region of one and a half million copies ‚Äì some years more, which was reflected in an annual income of around 140 Million Marks. With a wide palette of regionally based daily newspapers such as the Berlin Telegraf, the Hannoversche Presse and the Dortmund based Westf√§lische Rundschau, the party's newspaper division employed around 15,000 people. Heines objective for the party's newspaper \\"Imperium\\" was that their newspapers should be \\"popular, good, social democratic mass-market newspapers\\" (\\"popul√§re, gute, sozialdemokratische Volkszeitung\\") but as society grew more prosperous sales began to falter. There are suggestions that there was a little too much \\"top down\\" political news and slightly too little sports news and news from the street corner. As West Germany became more entrepreneurial, the SPD newspapers did not. Advertisers tended increasingly to favour publications with a less transparently political agenda. Helmut Schmidt would later characterise the decline of the Social Democrat press as self-inflicted: \\"The newspapers were fundamentally unattractive to any reader who was not a socialist to the bones and who did not see it as a patriotic duty to subscribe to a Social Democratic newspaper\\".(\\"Die Zeitungen waren absolut unattraktiv f√ºr jeden Leser, der nicht ein eingefleischter Sozi war und es f√ºr seine vaterl√§ndische Pflicht hielt, seine sozialdemokratische Tageszeitung zu halten.\\") The party's media empire came to the 1950s with a great history that became more burdensome and less inflexible through the 1950s and the 1960s. Fritz Heine cannot be blamed for all the problems he inherited, and it is not clear that anyone else had the vision and ability to steer the business to a more nimble and durable future. But it is apparent that he was in charge during a period of decline from which, conspicuously, it failed to recover. He retired from the top job at \\"Konzentrations GmbH\\" in 1974, the year of his seventieth birthday.

Freeman (born April 27, 1962) is a U.S. historian and tenured Professor of History and American Studies at Yale University. Having researched Alexander Hamilton both independently and collaboratively with mentors and peers for more than forty years, she is regarded as \\"a leading expert\\" on his life and legacy. Freeman has published two books as well as articles and op-eds in newspapers including The New York Times, magazines such as The Atlantic and Slate and numerous academic journals referencing this notable U.S. founding father. In addition to her many public lectures on Hamilton, outside of her regular student curriculum at Yale, her talks on the topics of political partisanship and violence in the pre-Civil War Congress have appeared on CSPAN In 2005 she was rated one of the \\"Top Young Historians\\" in the U.S. Early life and education Freeman was born in the New York City borough of Queens in 1962 and is a 1984 graduate of Pomona College and received both her MA (1993) and PhD (1998) in American History from University of Virginia where her doctoral advisor was Jefferson scholar Peter S. Onuf. Prior to graduate school, Freeman was a public historian, delivering lectures at a range of US history-centric institutions including the Smithsonian, South Street Seaport, Museum of American Finance and the Library of Congress over a span of seven years. Her area of expertise is political culture of early America particularly the revolutionary and early national eras. Career In addition to editing Alexander Hamilton: Writings for the Library of America in 2001, Freeman is the author of Affairs of Honor: National Politics in the New Republic (2001). Both books have been quoted in biographies about Hamilton or the Founding Fathers. Her first book, Affairs of Honor, received praise for being \\"analytically incisive\\" from Stanford University historian and Pulitzer Prize winner Jack Rakove and \\"enormously original\\" from Rutgers University history Professor and Thomas Jefferson scholar Jan Lewis. In this debut work, Freeman lays out the challenges that early patriots faced as they struggled to create a new and independent country. Freeman posits that office-holders and office-seekers were particularly immersed in conflict: \\"Regional distrust, personal animosity, accusation, suspicion, implication, and denouncement‚Äîthis was the tenor of national politics from the outset.‚Äù A prominent focus of her research has been the practice of dueling, including those rules governing one of the most famous encounters in history between Alexander Hamilton and Aaron Burr. In an interview with fellow historians Kenneth T. Jackson and Valerie Paley, Hamilton author Ron Chernow called attention to Freeman's work and her discovery that Hamilton had been involved in ten previous character challenges prior to the eleventh and fatal event: \\"Joanne Freeman's book explains that a duel is simply the final stage of 'an affair of honor'.\\" In his book, the Founding Fathers and the Politics of Character, Andrew Trees further cites Freeman's observations that Hamilton saw honor \\"as the foundation of Hamilton's vision for himself, the polity, and the nation.\\" Andrew S. Trees,The Founding Fathers and the Politics of Character, Princeton University Press, 2004, p.169. Freeman's series of lectures on the American Revolution is one of 42 courses offered online by Open Yale Courses. Freeman has been interviewed for several documentaries about Hamilton. These have aired on American Experience and The Discovery Channel. In 2002, she appeared in Founding Brothers with fellow historians Ron Chernow, Richard Brookhiser, David McCullough, and Carol Berkin on The History Channel; the two-part program and overview of five founders - George Washington, Hamilton, John Adams, Benjamin Franklin and Thomas Jefferson - was based on the Pulitzer Prize winning book of the same title by Joseph Ellis.Joanne B. Freeman, Dueling as Politics: Reinterpreting the Burr-Hamilton Duel, The William and Mary Quarterly, 3d series, 53 (April 1996): 289‚Äì318. Freeman's published findings about the history of dueling helped inspire the song \\"Ten Duel Commandments\\" in the Tony Award winning musical Hamilton by Lin-Manuel Miranda. Though she agrees with fellow historians that the show has historical errors, she is a fan of the Broadway hit and its creator and believes it is engendering interest in the Founding Fathers, ‚Äò‚ÄòPeople should think and evaluate and not necessarily instantly accept stories whether it‚Äôs on the stage or wherever they get it from,‚Äô‚Äô she said. ‚Äò‚ÄòThe play is getting people to ask a lot of questions about Hamilton and history. (Miranda) would be very happy.‚Äô‚Äô Freeman has also appeared in the PBS documentary Hamilton's America that traced the making of the musical. Newer Projects Freeman worked for two years as a historical consultant for the National Park Service in the reconstruction of the Hamilton Grange National Memorial. In 2017, she edited and published The Essential Hamilton: Letters & Other Writings, with the Library of America. Her latest book, The Field of Blood: Violence in Congress and the Road to Civil War, documents and analyzes episodes of physical violence between antagonistic members of U.S. Congress in the decades before the Civil War; it was published on 11 September 2018 by Farrar, Straus & Giroux. She has drawn parallels between American parties polarized in the mid-19th century with 21st-century bombast. \\"Then as now, raising hackles before the eyes of the press was a play for power; politicians who displayed their fighting-man spunk were strutting their suitability as leaders.\\" Starting February 3, 2017, Freeman joined the crew of the popular weekly American History radio show BackStory as a co-host; the 8 year old show based out of University of Virginia is also a popular podcast. The premise of the 1 hour program is to examine contemporary happenings through the lens of the past.

Early life  Harkness was born on July 10, 1793, in Portsmouth, Rhode Island.  Mid Life  A. Harkness & Sons Foundry circa 1848 is 2-story with smoke stack and 3-story building in foreground on Front Street, east of Lawrence St. Harkness became a machinist in Paterson, New Jersey in his early twenties. He was an industrial person with an excellent reputation. Harkness went to Cincinnati in 1820 when he was 27 years old and with James Goodloe established a machine-shop and copper foundry on the northeast corner of Broadway and Pearl Streets. He manufactured steam- engines for all kinds of uses, mostly steamboats. Harkness retired from that partnership in 1828 and accumulated a large fortune of $4,000. He borrowed another $2,000 and with this $6,000 total in the summer of 1828 built a new shop on the north side of Front Street, just east of Lawrence Street. He built steam pumps for the Cincinnati Water Works in 1828 and into the 1830s. The two-story machine shop on Front Street with a smoke stack was the nucleus for the three-story Harkness factory. All these buildings ultimately occupied an entire city block from Lawrence Street. Harkness was a mechanic and engineer and from his factory manufactured equipment and engines for sugar mills. He branched out and developed other enterprises from the profits he made at his factory. One such venture was the Hamilton Foundry that made machinery for river steamboats. Another of Harkness's new enterprises was the Franklin Cotton Mills with Jacob Strader and Samuel Fosdick as partners. Harkness formed a partnership with Alexander Bonner Latta in 1838 and went into railroad locomotive manufacturing. He built locomotives for the Little Miami Railroad company and other railroad companies with a total of over 30 locomotives built within a ten-year period. He is considered the founder of the Cincinnati locomotive industry.  Later life and death  Harkness retired in 1853 as a wealthy person. He died of cancer on May 10, 1858, at the age of 65 in Cincinnati.  Family  Harkness married Mary Hoagland on February 17, 1817. He had a son, William, who committed suicide in 1853.

The movie is a remake of the 2004 American movie Saw.https://www.thenewsminute.com/article/saduram-2-tamil-remake-hollywood- slasher-film-saw-worth-watch-49970  Plot  Vishal (Riaz) and Dr. Vasudevan (Yog Japee) wake up one day to find out that they both are stuck inside a square room devoid of any furniture. The only other element in the room apart from the two of them is the dead body of a man lying in the middle of the room, blood soaked. Vishal and Vasudevan do not know each other. Soon, Vishal realizes that there is a tape recorder near him, he finds a cassette in his pocket, which he plays. The cassette welcomes him to the SQUARE and tells him that his only way of escaping is by finding a clue that only the guy opposite him can see. Soon, Vasudevan plays the cassette from his pocket, and the recording again welcomes him to the SQUARE and tells him that he has been doing a lot of good by saving lives as a doctor, and yet he has committed a grave mistake, which he is now getting punished for. He is told that there is only eight hours remaining for him to escape, and his escape would only be by killing the one opposite him. Vishal, unwilling to cooperate with Vasudevan, cries and screams, asking the kidnapper to let him go. Finally coming to terms with their capture, encouraged to think objectively by Vasudevan, Vishal gives in. They both start working together to find out ways to escape by charting the clues the kidnapper gives. Meanwhile, on another plane, Siva Subramaniam (Roheit Nair), working in a multinational company, is told that he has been selected as the \\"Employee of the Decade\\" and will have to collect his coveted award from their Delhi Headquarters. He comes home to a good news that his wife Dhivya (Suja Varunee), who is pregnant, has conceived twin babies. Overly rejoiced, the couple celebrates their good luck. As Vasudevan and Vishal discuss, recall, and think, we uncover their personal lives. Vasudevan, a reputed doctor from a government medical centre is married and has a teenage daughter. However, he has an ongoing relationship with one of his trainee students ‚Äì Dr. Preethi (Sanam Shetty). While he is honest for the most part of his professional life, he is threatened by another trainee student Dr. Shankar (Brihadish Kaushik) to rewrite a postmortem report of a rape victim in favour of the accused (an MP‚Äôs son). He is threatened with photos of him with Preethi. Scared, Vasudevan sells out. Vishal, on the other hand, is a photographer who takes pictures of people in their intimate moments, mostly done on request by certain clients. One such assignment he was given by Shankar was to follow and take pictures of Vasudevan along with Preethi. Vasudevan gets shocked upon knowing that Vishal already knows him and is partly the reason why he is in the SQUARE. Meanwhile, Siva and Dhivya prepare to leave to Delhi to receive his award, but their flight meets with a tragic accident. Back in the square, Vasudevan tells Vishal that a few months earlier, a lawyer was killed brutally in a similar fashion of the dead man in the middle of the room. He says that he was suspected of that murder as he was the lawyer who had demanded that he change the postmortem report. Although his innocence was proved, one CB-CID police officer named Aadhi (Birla Bose) still suspected Vasudevan. Upon getting a certain lead, long after the case got over, Aadhi goes in search of the killer (then deemed serial killer) sure that it was Vasudevan. The killer escapes from his clutches, in the process gravely injuring him, puncturing his vocal cord. Long after, Aadhi still tries to pin the whole case on Vasudevan, hoping to catch him at his weakest. Vishal and Vasudevan get suspicious that their kidnapper might be Shankar. Vasudevan comes to know that his wife and daughter have been kidnapped by him too, as a security measure in case Vasudevan tries to escape. Heartbroken and with no way out, Vasudevan starts realizing the value of his family, the love that they have for him, and the love that he has for them. We go back in time to see that Dhivya finds out that Siva is terminally ill and has been undergoing treatment without telling her a word about it. She then breaks down and cries. Siva tells her that not everyone gets the best in life. He then asks her to appreciate what they have got in life. Aadhi goes to Vasudevan‚Äôs office, suspecting something. Inside, Shankar holds Vasudevan‚Äôs wife and daughter captive. They try to escape and hear a gunshot. Aadhi arrives at the spot. Shankar escapes from him and heads elsewhere. Vasudevan, unable to wait for rescue any longer and losing his patience, decides to break free by cutting his leg free from the chain. Vishal tries to stop him. Vasudevan shoots Vishal, like the kidnapper commanded earlier, and breaks away to leave the square. Meanwhile, Shankar and Aadhi have a tough fight, at the end of which Shankar kills Aadhi. He comes to the square to finish the two of them. However, Vishal regains consciousness and kills Shankar in the process. Vishal also realizes the Vasudevan had carefully shot him on his shoulder so as to not mortally injure him. Vasudevan then escapes the square. Vishal tries to escape by checking for the lock code from Shankar‚Äôs body when the dead body in his midst wakes up. It is Siva, and he is the mastermind behind the whole square. Siva, who upon recovering from his flight accident, finds out about the girl‚Äôs rape and how the lawyer, Shankar, and Vasudevan played their part in defending the convict. He realizes that Vishal was instrumental in instigating this and spoiling several other lives by clicking pictures of their intimate moments. He decides to destroy all their lives. He kills the lawyer first, pushes Shankar to kidnap Vishal and Vasudevan, and thereafter Vasudevan‚Äôs wife and kid. In the end, Siva tells Vishal that all he had to do was cooperate and work with Vasudevan to find his escape lock code, which is written right on his back. Siva tells him that he has lost and he deserves to rot in the square. Siva leaves the square, promising to return with others who do not appreciate their lives.

It is considered a fundamental aspect of bastard feudalism, and acted as a means of tying magnates to the lower nobility, just as feudalism had done in a different way.Carpenter, C., 'The Beauchamp Affinity: A Study of Bastard Feudalism at Work', EHR 95 (1980), 514. One form of the relationship was known as livery and maintenance. The lord provided livery badges to be worn by the retainer and \\"maintenance\\" or his support in their disputes, which often constituted obstruction of judicial processes. Origins One of the earliest identifiable feudal affinities was that of William Marshal, 1st Earl of Pembroke, who by 1190 had gathered a force around him consisting of men without necessarily any strong tenurial connection to him. Rather than receiving land, these men received grants of office and the security of Pembroke's proximity to the king.Crouch, David, & D. A. Carpenter. 'Bastard Feudalism Revised' Past & Present (1991), 171‚Äì72. Historian Michael Hicks has described it as a \\"personal, not feudal\\" connection,Hicks, M. A., Bastard Feudalism (London, 1995), 105. which David Crouch called an early example of a bastard feudal relationship. On the other hand, a hundred years later, the earl of Lincoln gathered bodies of men‚Äîoften from among his tenants‚Äîfrom his estates in Lincoln, who were still linked to the earl feudally through their tenure of his land.  Composition  Middleham Castle was the centre of the earl of Salisbury's Yorkshire affinity. Central to a noble affinity was the lord's indentured retainers, and beyond them was a more amorphous group of general supporters and contacts. The difference, K. B. McFarlane wrote, was that the former did the lord \\"exclusive service\\" but the latter received his good lordship \\"in ways both more and less permanent\\" than the retainers.McFarlane K. B., England in the Fifteenth Century: Collected Essays (London, 1981), 27 n.2. Christine Carpenter has described the structure of the earl of Warwick's affinity as \\"a series of concentric circles\\" with him at the centre.Carpenter, C., 'The Beauchamp Affinity: A Study of Bastard Feudalism at Work', EHR 95 (1980), 515. It has been noted that a lord only had to gather a relatively small number of people around in areas where he was strong, as members of his affinity supported not only him but also each other; thus, the number of men who could come to his aid was often far greater than the number of men he actually knew. These were men the lord trusted: for example, in 1459, on the verge of the Wars of the Roses, the earl of Salisbury gathered the closest members of his affinity to him in Middleham Castle and took their advice before publicly coming out in support of the rebellious duke of York.Mercer, M., Medieval Gentry: Power, Leadership and Choice during the Wars of the Roses (London, 2010), 12.Pollard, A. J., Warwick the Kingmaker: Politics, Power and Fame (London, 2007), p. 38. The lord would often include men in positions of local authority, for example Justices of the peace, within his affinity.Walker, S. K., 'Yorkshire Justices of the Peace', English Historical Review 108 (1993), 287. On the other hand, he might, as John of Gaunt did in the later fourteenth century, recruit people into his affinity regardless of their social weight, as an expression of his \\"courtly and chivalric ambitions\\", as Anthony Goodman said.Goodman, A., 'John of Gaunt: Paradigm of the Late Fourteenth-Century Crisis', Transactions of the Royal Historical Society 37 (1987), 146‚Äì48. A contemporary described these as \\"kin, friendis, allys and parttakaris\\" (\\"kin, friends, allies, and partakers\\") to the lord.Wormald, J., Lords and Men in Scotland: Bonds of Manrent, 1442‚Äì1603 (Edinburgh, 1985), 76ff. Members of the affinity could usually be identified by the livery the lord would distribute for their identification with him; this could range from simple armbands to \\"a more exclusive form of livery‚Äîexclusive metal mounted riband bands\\"; high-ranking members of John of Gaunt's retinue‚Äîa \\"highly prized\\" position‚Äîwore the Collar of Esses. The members of the affinity closest to the lord were those of most use: the estate officials, treasurer, stewards, and often more than one lawyer.  Later Middle Ages  John of Gaunt, Duke of Lancaster: In the later fourteenth century, his affinity was second only to that of the king. By the late Middle Ages, kings such as Richard II and Henry IV had created their own affinities within the regional gentry,Given-Wilson, C., 'The King and the Gentry in Fourteenth-Century England', TRHS, 5th ser. 38 (1987), 87‚Äì102. for political as well as martial motives.Coss, P. R., 'Bastard Feudalism Revised ‚Äì Reply', Past & Present 131 (1991), 62. They were therefore at a greater distance from the royal court, but they were also more numerous than the household knights of earlier kings. By the fifteenth century, most regional agents of the crown were considered to be in the king's affinity, as they had a closer connection to the crown than ordinary subjects.Robertson, C. A., 'Local Government and the King's 'affinity' in fifteenth-century Leicestershire and Warwickshire', LAHS 52 (1976), 38. By the reign of Henry VI, E. F. Jacob estimated that the number of squires employed by the king in the localities increased from 150 to over 300.Jacob, E. F., The Fifteenth Century 1399‚Äì1485 (Oxford, 1961), 451. In Richard's case, it has been suggested it was for the purpose of building up royal power to counteract the pre-existing affinities of the nobility and strengthen his own power. Indeed, they were at the heart of the army Richard took to Ireland on his 1399 campaign, prior to his deposition. This could include several hundred 'King's knights' and esquires, retained with hard cash.Wormald, J., Lords and Men in Scotland: Bonds of Manrent 1442‚Äì1603 (Edinburgh, 1985), 77ff. In fact, the amounts the crown spent on its regional affinity were the cause of much of the discontent over royal expenditure that Richard II, for example, faced in 1397. Likewise, John of Gaunt's affinity increased by half between 1381 and the early 1390s and cost him far greater sums than the 10% of income that magnates generally expended on their retinues. Gaunt used it to defend his position against the crown as Richard II's reign became increasingly erratic, and his son, Henry of Bolingbroke, inherited it in 1399, and found it a ready-made army that allowed him to overthrow Richard. In very similar circumstances, in 1471, Edward IV, returning from exile to reclaim his throne, gathered his affinity with him as he marched south, and it has been said that \\"it was as master of such an affinity that at Barnet and Tewkesbury King Edward won a wider mastery\\".Morgan, D. A. L., 'The King's Affinity in the Polity of Yorkist England', Transactions of the Royal Historical Society 23 (1973), 12. The earl of Salisbury, also using his affinity as a show of strength in 1458, attended a royal council meeting with an affinity of about 400 horsemen and eighty knights and squires; the contemporary Brut Chronicle estimated it at around 500 men.Maurer, M., Margaret of Anjou: Queenship and Power in Late Medieval England (Woodbridge, 2003), 154 n.68.Bean, J. M. W., From Lord to Patron: Lordship in Late Medieval England (Philadelphia, 1989), 172‚Äì73. Affinities were not confined to kings or magnates; in the 1420s, for example, Cardinal Beaufort maintained an affinity in many English counties, although, as an churchman, his affinity was political rather than military.Sweetinburgh, S. (ed.), Later Medieval Kent, 1220‚Äì1540 (Woodbridge, 2010), 241. They were not also confined to men: Edward II's consort, Isabella, had an affinity whose \\"collective influence was as powerful as the most powerful lords\\", even if with less of a military. They could also be expanded through the course of events; Edward IV's covert marriage to Elizabeth Woodville brought an important Midlands family and their retainers directly into the royal household.Morgan, D. A. L., 'The King's Affinity in the Polity of Yorkist England', Transactions of the Royal Historical Society 23 (1973), 7. Historiography The traditional view among historians was that the affinity was a thirteenth-century construction that arose out of the nobility and crown's need to recruit armies, against a backdrop of declining feudal service failing to provide troops. Victorian historians, such as Charles Plummer, saw the affinity as being effectively synonymous with the lord's household, and little more than his personal thugs. The only connection noted between members of the affinity and the retaining lord was a military one.Weiss, Michael, Loyalte me Lie': Richard III and affinity politics in northern England (University of California Irvine thesis, [1977]), 3. . 1981 This then led them to see the emergence of noble affinities as directly responsible, in part at least, for the decline in social order in the fourteenth and fifteenth centuries. But as Simon Walker has put it, their unfavourable judgements have largely been replaced by a more sympathetic account that acknowledges the affinity as an essential element in the mechanics of good lordship. For example, a lord would recruit into his affinity some who could provide him with military service, but others who did not; some who were formally retained and some who were not; and ultimately every individual was recruited with mutual benefit at the heart of their relationships. The affinity itself would change depending on whether it was a time of war or peace, or whether it was in an area where the lord was strong. Seen in the context of playing multiple roles, it has been called a \\"socio-political-military joint-stock enterprise\\" that helped uphold noble authority without needing a basis in feudalism itself. In the mid-fifteenth century, it could vary in organization from being secured almost exclusively by military indenture (for example, the affinity of William, Lord Hastings) to being based more on blood and marital connections, as with the House of Neville.Weiss, Michael, Loyalte me Lie': Richard III and affinity politics in northern England (University of California Irvine thesis, [1977]), 4. . 1981 Recently it has been questioned whether a royal affinity could actually work in the same way as a noble one. It has been suggested that since the king had to be a lord to his retainers and provide good lordship, but also king to the entire people, a contradiction existed, resulting in a decline in local stability where this occurred. At the same time, even powerful magnates such as Gaunt could cause local dissatisfaction by retaining some and, inevitably, excluding others. On the other hand, it has also been pointed out how, particularly for kings, recruitment into the affinity was a clear promotion which could act as an encouraging loyalty or offered a political amnesty.Morgan, D. A. L., 'The King's Affinity in the Polity of Yorkist England', Transactions of the Royal Historical Society 23 (1973), 8.

Osser in 1971 Maurice S. Osser (January 10, 1910 ‚Äì September 30, 1995) was a Democratic politician from Philadelphia who served as City Commissioner. Osser was born in 1910 in Philadelphia, the son of two Jewish immigrants from Russia, Benjamin Osser and Hannah Brody Osser. Osser grew up in the old 16th ward, which housed a diverse collection of immigrant families. He initially worked at his father's livery yard and attended Temple University at night. The neighborhood was heavily Republican, but Osser became involved in the political scene of the Democratic Party, which was outnumbered two-to- one there. In 1931, while still studying for his bachelor's degree, Osser was appointed leader of the 16th ward. Internal party politics led to Osser's ouster as ward leader in 1933, but he remained a committed party worker. He completed his law degree from Temple University Law School and practiced law. He was reelected ward leader in 1946. In 1948, he ran for Congress in the 3rd district against Republican Hardie Scott and lost badly. He ran again in 1950 in a much closer race. The official tally showed Osser losing to Scott by 925 votes, but he alleged that the race was stolen. He took his challenge to the floor of the House of Representatives, but it was rejected. The following year, Osser ran for city commissioner and won. In that election, the Democrats overcame the Republicans' 67-year-old hold on city government and became the dominant party in the city. Osser joined fellow Democrat Thomas P. McHenry and Republican Walter I. Davidson on the three-member commission, with McHenry serving as chairman. The office was a county office, a holdover from the time before consolidation of the townships in Philadelphia County into one city. The most important of the remaining duties of a commissioner in Philadelphia was the conduct of the city's elections; they also had responsibility for regulating weights and measures. Because the commissioner's office was a state office, it remained exempt from the city's civil service regulations, making it a powerful source of patronage. After 1951, the Democrats held most offices in Philadelphia, but politics there were still combative, even on a personal level: after the 1955 election, at which he was reelected, Osser got in a fistfight with a Republican ward leader. He was reelected again in 1959 and mooted for a seat on the local courts in 1961 and 1963, but the disapproval of the bar association stymied his changes. In 1965, the commissioner's office was finally consolidated into the city government and stripped of its non- election-related duties, reducing the political clout of the job. When the ward boundaries were realigned the following year, Osser became ward leader of the 63rd ward in Northeast Philadelphia. He was easily reelected commissioner in 1963 and 1967, becoming chairman of the commission in 1964. Around that same time, Osser was accused of accepting kickbacks on a deal to replace the city's antiquated voting machines. City Controller Alexander Hemphill got wind of it and City Council held hearings, but the disposition of some of the money was never discovered. Osser drew more controversy in 1971 when the voter rolls were purged of 92,000 names, most of them African Americans. In 1972, he was indicted for mail fraud and taking bribes that were said to total tens of thousands of dollars over the previous fourteen years. He was convicted in United States District Court in December 1972 and resigned his office. Osser served seventeen months of a six-year sentence. He was released from jail in 1975 and retired from politics, but remained active in Jewish causes. He died in 1995 at the age of 85.

Early life James Banyard was born in the market town of Rochford, Essex. His father, John Banyard, worked at Rochford Hall as a ploughman; James also became an agricultural labourer but spent most of his free time carousing in local pubs. Described as \\"an ugly man\\" with a loud booming voice, James was charismatic and became a popular local figure thanks to a talent for conjuring tricks, mimicry and topical rhyme. He composed comedy songs called \\"glees\\" (unaccompanied songs for men's voices in three or more parts, popular c.1750‚Äì1830) and one called \\"The Syren Wrecked on The West Knock\\" was still remembered 25 years after his death. He had no time for religion and indulged in heavy alcohol consumption. He was also a poacher for which he was eventually jailed. Whilst in prison he learnt the craft of shoemaking which became his livelihood upon his release. He married Susan Garnish (1802‚Äì1844) in around 1826 but continued to lead a dissoloute and argumentative life. By his early thirties his wife began to despair of his drunken behaviour. Following a visit to a local fair she \\"insisted he reform\\" and made him promise to attend the local Wesleyan Methodist chapel. The preacher's words had a dramatic effect on Banyard and \\"a change came over him\\". He became a strict teetotaller and began going to church regularly. Banyard became a respected member of the Rochford Methodist community and eventually became a preacher at the local chapel himself. Influence of Rev. Robert Aitken and meeting William Bridges The Scottish born Anglican cleric Robert Aitken had left the Church of England in 1834 having been overcome by \\"the spirit of the Lord\\". He became an evangelical revivalist and founded his own Christian Society. Between the years 1837 and 1839 the teetotaller Aitken was in London preaching \\"in the open air\\" in Lambeth and at Whites Row Chapel in Spitalfields. It was in Spitalfields that a Methodist local preacher and hat block maker from Southwark William Bridges, heard Aitken evangelize on the text Enoch walked with God. Bridges became \\"a changed man\\" and in 1837 founded his own tiny religious sect called The Plumstead Peculiars. That same year Bridges visited one of his sisters in Rochford and struck up a friendship with Banyard, swapping ideas and discussing \\"religious topics\\". Bridges invited Banyard to stay with him in London and at some point led him to Aitken. Banyard instinctively realised that Aitken and Bridges had \\"something more than he\\" and before leaving Bridges home at 8 Gravel Lane Southwark, is said to have gone to an upstairs room, fallen to his knees and been 'born again'. Bridges would later have a similar influence on the leader of another rural sect, John Sirgood. The Banyardites, and The Peculiar People Banyard returned to Rochford and began preaching \\"Right of Liberty\\"; believing there was no sin in Christians once they accepted the Holy Spirit in Christianity, he asserted \\"for to know our sins are forgiven is the first step in religion\\". Quite soon there was a \\"dispute\\" with the Rochford Wesleyan church and Banyard was ejected for refusing to obey instructions. He began open air preaching in Rochford Square and held prayer meetings at his cottage. Banyard was often \\"drenched with pails of water\\" and had \\"filth of all sorts\\" thrown at him; including \\"rotten eggs and dead cats\\"; one of the worst tormentors amongst the intolerant and irreligious was Banyard's embittered former friend, Layzell. In spite of this early opposition his message began to catch on. At first the sect were known simply as The Banyardites. As the congregation grew Banyard and Bridges took over the lease of an old workhouse building known as The Barracks in Rochford circa 1838 and set up their own chapel at Union Lane (near the Marlborough Head Inn). Faith Healing Shortly after the chapel opened a man called William Perry from Southend arrived at The Barracks \\"helped by two other men\\". He was weak with consumption (tuberculosis) and claimed that whilst at prayer he had heard a voice reciting James 5: Verse 14 -15 The Prayer of Faith. Perry believed the preacher could act and an instrument of the Lord and might cure him. At first Banyard was apparently reluctant to indulge in Divine healing saying \\"it is not for me to dampen your faith, brother\\"; but eventually \\"they got on their knees and prayed\\". The man is said to have recovered and \\"walked 12 miles that same day\\". There followed several similar 'miracle cures', including a Charles Porter of Southend who was cured of a liver complaint. These events gave the Banyardites the reputation of a \\"special people\\" with special \\"gifts from God himself\\". They help explain the phenomenal growth of the movement which 'spread like wildfire\\" and established chapels in Essex, Kent, and East London. The Banyardites are said to have helped bring order to Daws Heath, an area so notorious that J W. Burrows described it as \\"a hotbed of lawlessness\\". In 1848 there was a setback when the \\"laying on\\" of Banyard's hands failed to save a child at Prittlewell. On this occasion the anger of the local population saw Banyard \\"guarded out of the village by the police\\". This tragic event did not prevent the sect's leaders hiring a hall in Prittlewell in 1850 where they preached on \\"various occasions\\". A church 'Elder' Isaac Anderson describes how he was \\"baptised with water\\" by Banyard at a \\"special meeting\\" held in 1851 at Rochford and \\"accepted into the church\\". By this time, with Bridges operating in London, the movement in Essex was too large for one man with a growing family to control. In 1852 the Banyardites officially became the Peculiar People, a name Bridges had taken from the book of Deuteronomy (Deuteronomy 14:2). Banyard and three other men, Samuel Harrod, David Handley and John Thorogood, were ordained as Bishops. (Thorogood's son John Thorogood Jnr, later married Banyard's eldest daughter Hephzibah in October 1868). At this time a constitution was established; there were Bishops, Elders and 'Saints' and their strict code included abstention from alcohol and smoking. The sect adopted a dress code for worship: a dark suit and bowler hat for men, and black capes and bonnets for the women. Their hymns were sung without musical accompaniment, a practice later adopted by the Society of Dependents. Later life Susan Banyard had died childless aged 42 in 1844; James remarried in 1845 to the widow Judith Knapping (nee Lucking) (1823 - 1877), and together they had seven children. In 1855 Banyard's fifth child Josiah was born in Rochford. When the boy became seriously ill, Banyard \\"agonised\\" at length but eventually a doctor was called in. From this time on, Banyard began to advise the use of prayer and medical attention. This matter led to the first doctrinal schism within the church of the Peculiar People when Banyard was deposed as Bishop. Because he owned the Rochford chapel he continued to preach there to \\"a loyal minority\\". Banyard was replaced by Bishop Samuel Harrod (who was deposed himself in 1890 following a sex scandal). Death Banyard's decision to seek medical aid for his son, saw him reduced in stature in his own movement for the final eight years of his life. Sadly Josiah died in 1861. James and Judith had a final child together that same year, Tamar Banyard. James Banyard continued to preach until \\"disease and death silenced him\\". He died on 31 October 1863; the cause of death is unknown. He was buried in St Andrew's church Rochford. In 1877 his wife was laid to rest with him. In 1950, Anna Turner (nee Banyard) joined her parents. The inscription reads: \\"In memory of James Banyard of Rochford. The founder of the Peculiar People in the County of Essex. Born 31 January.

Few members of this gens are mentioned by the historians, but a number are known from inscriptions. The most notable may have been the two Pacidii who were commanders in the army of Gnaeus Pompeius Magnus during the Civil War.Dictionary of Greek and Roman Biography and Mythology, vol. III, p. 80 (\\"Pacidii\\"). Origin The nomen Pacidius belongs to a class of gentilicia formed from other names, using the suffix -idius. Normally such names would be formed from names ending in -idus, but in this case no corresponding name Pacidus is known, and the suffix was chosen arbitrarily without a direct morphological relationship to the original name.Chase, pp. 121, 122. The root of the nomen is probably the Oscan praenomen Paccius, which was also used as a gentile name. Pacidius would therefore be cognate with the nomen Paccius, and probably also with Pacilius.Chase, pp. 123, 128. If the name is derived from the Oscan praenomen Paccius, then the Paccii would be an Oscan family, perhaps of Samnite origin. This seems quite probable, given the fact that most of the inscriptions bearing this name are concentrated in and around Samnium. However, in at least some cases it is likely that Pacidius is instead an orthographic variation of Placidius, derived from the Latin cognomen Placidus, \\"peaceful\\". Praenomina Despite the relatively small number of Pacidii known, it seems that they favoured the praenomina Publius and Gaius, and perhaps also Lucius, three of the most common names throughout Roman history. They also used Numerius, which although relatively uncommon at Rome, was frequently used by Oscan-speaking peoples, such as the Sabines and Samnites.

She visited the United States three times in an effort to avoid the schism created by the views of Elias Hicks. Life Anna Lloyd was born in 1788 in Edgbaston Street, Birmingham, the daughter of Charles Lloyd and Mary (n√©e Farmer). The Lloyds were an influential Quaker banking family, and Anna's brother was the poet Charles Lloyd. In 1808, Anna married Isaac Braithwaite (two years earlier, her sister Mary had married Isaac's brother George), thus forging the union of two prominent Quaker dynasties. Their children included the Quaker minister Joseph Bevan Braithwaite.Edward H. Milligan, ‚ÄòBraithwaite, Joseph Bevan (1818‚Äì1905)‚Äô, Oxford Dictionary of National Biography, Oxford University Press, 2004 accessed 9 April 2017 Doctrinal differences within the Quakers were created by the views of Elias Hicks after 1808; William Forster highlighted the issue in 1820, after the growth of Hicks‚Äô influence. Prominent English evangelical Quakers, including Elizabeth Robson, Forster and Braithwaite, travelled to the United States between 1821 and 1827 to denounce Hicks' views. The visiting British Quakers exacerbated the differences among American Quakers, differences that echoed the 1819 split between the American Unitarians and Congregationalists. The influence of Anna Braithwaite was especially strong. She visited the United States three times between 1823 and 1827 (the last two journeys accompanied by her husband) and published her Letters and observations relating to the controversy respecting the doctrines of Elias Hicks in 1824. Hicks felt obliged to respond and in the same year published a letter to his ally in the Philadelphia Meeting, Dr. Edwin Atlee, in The Misrepresentations of Anna Braithwaite. This in turn was replied to by Braithwaite in A Letter from Anna Braithwaite to Elias Hicks, On the Nature of his Doctrines in 1825. Braithwaite's family were affected by doctrinal differences. In 1835, the Beaconites separated from the Quakers and five of Anna's children joined the new group. Braithwaite died in Kendal in 1859.

Whereas most authors do not define the exact time-frame of this period, it is generally agreed that this awakening (or revival) occurred in the 18th century. Historian Svoronos According to the Greek historian Nikos Svoronos (1911-1989), the period of the Greek National Awakening is 1715-1821.Nicolas G Svoronos Histoire de la Gr√®ce moderne, Paris : Presses universitaires de France, 1964, ¬©1953.

Internal and external forces The Greek ‚Äì as well as other Balkan nations‚Äô ‚Äì awakening was generated by internal and external forces. Opposition to the Ottomans was the main internal impetus. The main external factor was the assistance from Russia, on the ground of the common religion and long historical bonds. Since the fall of Constantinople to the Turks, the Greek national aspirations for liberation were expressed in the form of popular oracle and prophecies, some of them alleging to the intervention of fair-haired people (xanthon genos) to help Greeks. In 1656 a prominent Greek clergyman interpreted the \\"fair-haired people\\" as the Russians. With the emergence of Russia as a big power in Eastern Europe, the Greek-Russian ties assumed a military and political dimension. Beginning with the 1711 Pruth Campaign, Peter the Great called for the cooperation of all Orthodox people under the Russian leadership, to fight for \\"the belief and the fatherland\\". After this campaign, the sultan appointed Greek Phanariots as governors of the Ottoman vassal territories of Wallachia and Moldavia. The Phanariots introduced an enlighted reform in their principalities, and produced a line of educated Greek and Balkan scholars who contributed to the national awakening of their respective countries. The Greek communities in Russia, as well as in the Western and Central Europe, were also a key factor to the Greek awakening. Treaty After the Treaty of Kutchuk-Kainardji (1774) Russia assumed the role of protector of the Orthodox people subjects of the Ottoman Empire. After Peter the Great, Catherine II envisaged a \\"Greek Project\\" which involved a revival of a Greek state with Constantinople as capital, to be ruled by her grandson Constantine. The Russian expansionist policy greatly facilitated the modern Greek awakening, catalyzing key components such as military resistance, political activism, commercial growth, educational and cultural progress. Russia Russia‚Äôs wars against the Ottoman Empire in 18th early 19th century (1711, 1737‚Äì39, 1768‚Äì74, 1787‚Äì92, 1806‚Äì12), as well as the short-lived Russian occupation of the Ionian islands after the Napoleonic wars, nourished the Greek tradition of armed resistance to the Ottomans and helped Greeks to receive fighting experience. The most important Russian influenced revolutionary activities of the Greeks in 18th c. were the failed Orlov expedition in 1769-1770 and the Lambros Katsonis‚Äô flotilla raids against the Turks in 1778-1792 . Other independence movements of the 18th century, were those of the Souli and Souliotes. Theophilus C. Prousis, The Greeks of Russia and the Greek Awakening, 1774-1821.

He was known for composing the anti-apartheid song \\"Meadowlands\\", and for his career as a producer, during which he was influential in the development of mbaqanga. \\"Meadowlands\\" The settlement of Sophiatown had been destroyed by the apartheid government of South Africa in 1955, and its 60,000 inhabitants forcibly moved, many of them to a settlement known as Meadowlands. The forced relocation inspired Vilakezi to write \\"Meadowlands\\". \\"Meadowlands\\" was set to an \\"infectious jive beat\\". It featured music writer Todd Matshikiza on the piano. The lyrics of the song were written in three languages; IsiZulu, SeSotho, and tsotsitaal, or street slang. Superficially upbeat, the song was misinterpreted as being supportive of the move by the South African government; as a result, Vilakezi was congratulated for it by a government bureaucrat, and according to some sources, had an application for housing expedited. Originally performed by Nancy Jacobs and Her Sisters, as with many other protest songs of this period, \\"Meadowlands\\" was made popular both within and outside South Africa by Miriam Makeba, and it became an anthem of the movement against apartheid. Production career When he wrote \\"Meadowlands\\", Vilakezi was a \\"talent scout\\" for the music production company \\"Troubadour\\". From 1952 to 1970 he also ran the black division of the music production company True Tone Records. He was among the first musicians to affiliate with the organisation South African Society of Composers, Authors, and Music Publishers, which sought to represent musicians in some legal matters. In 1962, its functions were largely taken over by the Southern African Music Rights Organisation (SAMRO). In 1954, he recorded Spokes Mashiyane playing the pennywhistle, and would later persuade Mashiyane that the same music would sound better on a saxophone. The music that resulted has been described as the earliest style of mbaqanga, a genre that would remain popular among black South Africans for many years. Appropriation In 1974 Bertha Egnos produced the play Ipi Tombi. Vilakezi charged that she had appropriated some of his recorded music in the play's hit song \\"Mama Thembu's Wedding\\". Vilakezi's allegation was supported by an investigation by SAMRO. However, he was unable to obtain redress in court. Commentators have referred to this episode as an example of the widespread appropriation of black South African music (both traditional and contemporary, recorded music) by white artists, who then profited from them.

The source said the helicopter was flying from north to south and that a trail of white smoke came down from the helicopter as three objects were dropped. According to the source, the first object landed in the northern area of the town, the second landed in the middle of the courtyard of a family house, and the third landed close to an opposition checkpoint on the road to Idlib. Around 16:40 a doctor at the Shifa Hospital was called in order to assist with two patients, a 52-year-old woman and her pregnant daughter-in-law. Victims The 52-year-old woman was severely intoxicated. She died between 22:30 and 22:45 just before arriving at a hospital in Turkey. Test results indicated that she had been exposed to sarin. Her daughter-in-law had moderate symptoms and recovered after 15 to 20 minutes of atropine treatment, but was also sent to a hospital in Turkey. She arrived at a border hospital at 19:30. She could then walk, but had, according to the medical officer, nausea and was vomiting. Other alleged victims with milder symptoms was also sent to Turkey, however, the examining doctor did not observe symptoms consistent with exposure to toxic chemicals, and initial tests of blood samples tested negative for sarin gas.

Price is currently an associate professor in the School of Biological Sciences at University of Missouri-Kansas City, and an associate professor in the department of Neurology and Cognitive Neuroscience at the University of Missouri-Kansas City School of Medicine.\\"Faculty Detail: Jeffrey Price, Associate Professor, MBB  Ph.D. Doctoral Faculty.\\" School of Biological Sciences: University of Missouri-Kansas City. Curators of the University of Missouri, n.d. Web. 11 Apr. 2017. Research interests Price's research centers around the molecular mechanisms of circadian rhythms, using Drosophila melanogaster as model organisms. He is specifically interested in the role of protein kinases in clock function, and using forward genetics screens Price has contributed to the identification and characterization of many critical elements of the Drosophila circadian clock. The molecular circadian clock of D. melanogaster can be described as a feedback loop of transcription and translation, in which the proteins CLOCK and CYCLE act as transcriptional activators of the period and timeless genes. Their protein products, PER and TIM, respectively, dimerize and translocate to the nucleus after phosphorylation by DBT. In the nucleus, PER/TIM heterodimers bind to and suppress CLK/CYC heterodimers to inhibit the transcription of period and timeless, resulting in daily oscillations of PER and TIM. DBT is itself regulated by BDBT and SPAG, which stimulate its kinase activity toward PER and increase the cytoplasmic stability of DBT, respectively. Timeline of selected major research contributions *1994: Identification and characterization of timeless mutant flies *1998: Identification and characterization of double-time mutant flies *2013: Identification and characterization of bride of double-time *2015: Identification of SPAG as a link between the clock and neurodegeneration =Timeless= In 1994, Price, together with Amita Sehgal, identified the timeless gene through forward genetics mutagenesis screens. A mutant Drosophila line was generated displaying arrythmia in time of eclosion and per mRNA cycling, reliable phase markers for the Drosophila circadian clock. Price and Seghal mapped the mutations to chromosome 2 and termed the novel gene timeless. Leslie Vosshall, one of their collaborators, later noted that tim mutants were unable to localize PER protein to the nucleus, suggesting an interaction between PER and TIM. Price later contributed to the characterization of six mutant tim alleles altering circadian rhythm, providing further evidence for its role in clock function. =Double-time= In 1998, Price, together with Justin Blau and Adrian Rothenfluh, characterized three mutant alleles of another novel clock gene, doubletime, or dbt, through forward genetics mutagenesis screens and mapped the mutations to chromosome 3. The mutations, termed dbt S, dbt L, and dbt P, shortened (dbt S) or lengthened (dbt L) circadian rhythms in Drosophila. Dbt P was lethal to pupae, but Price and Blau noted that mutant strains of Drosophila larvae harboring homozygous dbt P mutations also sustained loss of rhythms in PER and TIM protein levels, as well as constitutive accumulation of PER protein. These results suggested that the normal function of DBT is to reduce the stability of PER protein monomers through phosphorylation status. The identification of double-time provided a crucial explanation for the observed 4-6-hour delay between peak per mRNA levels and peak PER protein levels in the Drosophila clock. In addition to studying kinase function in D. melanogaster, Price studies the role of protein kinases in vertebrate clocks. Evolutionary analysis has shown DBT has orthologs in the mammalian genome, specifically CK1Œµ and CK1Œ¥ of the Casein kinase 1 family of kinases, suggesting that the mammalian clock may contain kinases with similar function. The mammalian clock has since been well characterized, and both CK1Œµ and CK1Œ¥ appear to perform a similar function to DBT, though CK1Œ¥ may have a larger effect on clock function. =Bride of Double-time= In 2013, Price's lab identified a noncanonical FK506-binding protein named Bride of Double-time (BDBT), which interacts with DBT protein kinase. In his experiment, RNA interference (RNAi), which reduced BDBT expression, resulted in long periods and arrhythmicity of locomotion, as well as high levels of hypophosphorylated nuclear PER and phosphorylated DBT. These results demonstrated a role for BDBT in the circadian clock. When BDBT was overexpressed, Price found that the phosphorylation and DBT-dependent degradation of PER increased, suggesting that BDBT stimulates DBT circadian activity toward PER. In addition, BDBT was shown to rhythmically accumulate in PER and DBT-dependent cytosolic foci in the fly eye. Price's lab established BDBT as a mediator of DBT's effects on PER, which regulates PER nuclear accumulation in discrete foci In photoreceptors. In 2015, Price's lab noted that DBT proteins lacking a nuclear localization signal (NLS) failed to interact with BDBT, suggesting that this interaction is mediated by the NLS. =Spaghetti= In 2015, Price identified an upstream regulator of DBT named spaghetti, encoding the SPAG protein. SPAG antagonizes DBT autophosphorylation, increasing the stability of DBT during the day by delaying proteasomal degradation. Using RNAi, Price found that SPAG knockdowns in Drosophila caused either an increase in period or arhythmicity, as well as reduction in cellular levels of DBT. SPAG also has a role in neurodegeneration, as flies with reduced SPAG experienced increased levels of activated caspase proteins in the optic lobes, resulting in neurodegeneration through apoptosis when human tau is also expressed in the eye.

It was utilized to move pulpwood logs into large piles so they could be sent through waterways to paper mills. The stacker operated at the Cornell Wood Products Mill from 1912 until its obsolescence in 1971. It is listed both on the National Register of Historic Places, as well as on the Wisconsin State Historical Society listing of Cornell Millyard Park.  History  The Pulpwood Stacker on the east bank of the Chippewa River at Cornell, Wisconsin was manufactured to streamline the Cornell Wood Products Mill pulpwood process. It was designed by Joor Engineering Company of England and constructed on-site in 1912 by Minneapolis Tool and Machinery Company. Wisconsin had become a major manufacturer of paper and pulpwood products in the United States by the last half of the 19th century. By extension, the timber industry was one of the state's most important employers. As the labor market changed in early part of the 20th century, employers looked towards mechanization to achieve the same results. Timber was cut into logs at the pulpwood mill, and then stockpiled on the premises before being sent along the river to paper mills. Operating with a 35-bhp motor at a 45-degree angle, the double-trussed stacker replaced what had been a labor-intensive method of handling the timber product. It moved the cut logs into large piles on land, from which they could then be placed in the water for their journey to the paper mill. The stacker's wide base narrows to a tip giving it an elongated pyramid shape. It moved logs with a wire and metal conveyor system, and expelled them through a chute. Similar to how a bridge is repaired, a catwalk along one side is provided for maintenance workers to climb up and down the equipment. It became obsolete in 1971, replaced by more economical and effective methods of moving logs. A fire two decades later destroyed most of the stacker buildings. Millyard Park and historic certification Both the stacker and land upon which it sits are now owned by the city of Cornell, which created Millyard Park to commemorate that part of the city's history. The stacker's condition had deteriorated by 1991, and the city began fund raising with a goal of collecting $50,000 for needed repairs. On October 10 of that year, the Cornell City Council made application to the Wisconsin State Historical Society, and the National Register of Historic Places in an effort to qualify for matching funds. Wisconsin State Historical Society added Cornell Millyard Park to the state register of historic properties on July 9, 1993. The stacker alone was added to the National Register of Historic Places on December 23, 1993. In their research into its qualifications for historic status, the National Park Service concluded that it \\"is possibly the only remaining structure of its kind.\\" A \\"Save the Stacker\\" fund was set up in Cornell, where as of 2009, it was estimated that it would take a minimum of $350,000 to clean off the rust and refinish the old equipment, a process that would require workers to climb up the left side of the stacker at its 45-degree angle. As of 2016, the city approved $23,000 from a special fund to make needed repairs. The city's long-range goal is to raise $500,000 within the next two decades for a complete renovation.

They constitute the western extension of the Maranh√£o mangroves ecoregion. The mangroves are relatively intact, although they are under some pressure from agriculture and logging. Location The Par√° mangroves grow along the coast of the state of Par√°, and extend inland along estuaries and rivers for up to . They include a stretch of the Atlantic coast of Maraj√≥ island, and the Maraj√≥ Bay and Atlantic coasts of mainland Par√°. They adjoin the western part of the Maranh√£o mangroves ecoregion, stretching from near Bel√©m on the Par√° River along the coast of eastern Par√° state to the border of Maranh√£o state. The mangroves adjoin the Tocantins/Pindare moist forests further inland and the Maraj√≥ v√°rzea at the mouth of the Amazon River. The ecoregion contains about 28% of the total mangrove area in Brazil. They are part of the larger Guianan-Amazon Mangroves global ecoregion, which also includes the Maranh√£o mangroves, Amap√° mangroves and Guianan mangroves. Physical The terrain consists of islands and mudflats created from fine- grained sediments and clay deposited by the Amazon, which are colonized as they form and stabilized by the salt-tolerant mangroves. The tides range from . Since the land is flat, saline water and mangroves are found as much as from the coast. The climate is tropical, warm and humid. Temperatures range from . Mean air temperature is about . Mean annual rainfall is about , with a well- defined dry season from July to December when monthly rainfall is under . Annual rainfall may be as high as . Ecology The ecoregion is in the Neotropical realm and the mangrove biome. Mangroves form a continuous belt along the Par√° and Maranh√£o coasts, with six species of mangrove trees and several associated species. They are important as a nursery for fish and in protecting the coast, and provide an important source of food and other resources to the local human population. The mangroves of Par√° and Maranh√£o extend along of coast and cover about or about 85% of mangroves in Brazil. The mangroves benefit from the constant influx of fresh water from rainfall and from the Amazon River. However, they must compete with freshwater hardwood species typical of the Amazon rainforest. =Flora= Rhizophora mangle (red mangrove) forest, Caet√© estuary, Bragan√ßa, Par√° The most common mangrove tree species in Rhizophora mangle, which dominates estuaries that are most exposed to the ocean. Rhizophora mangle reaches in height. Rhizophora racemosa is less common, found only in Par√° only in Maraj√≥ Bay, as is Rhizophora harrisonii, intermediate in salt tolerance between these two. Avicennia germinans is common on higher areas with less flooding, and under more saline conditions. Avicennia schaueriana is less common, mainly found near sandy beaches. Avicennia schaueriana may reach in height. Laguncularia racemosa is found along the coast in saline and brackish environments, mostly along forest edges and other open spaces. The transition zone between the coastal mangroves and inland dry forest holds Rhizophora racemosa, Rhizophora harrisonii, Laguncularia racemosa and Conocarpus erectus mangroves, as well as Spartina alterniflora on the seaward margin and Hibiscus tiliaceus and Acrostichum aureum on the landward margins. Tropical forest and palm species that grow with the mangroves include Dalbergia brownei, Rhabdadenia biflora, Montrichardia arborescens, Mora oleifera, a√ßa√≠ palm (Euterpe oleracea) and Orbygnia martiana. =Fauna= Rare and endangered fauna include scarlet ibis (Eudocimus ruber), wattled jacana (Jacana jacana), tucuxi (Sotalia fluviatilis), West Indian manatee (Trichechus manatus), green sea turtle (Chelonia mydas) and leatherback sea turtle (Dermochelys coriacea). Status The World Wildlife Fund gives the ecoregion the status of \\"Relatively Stable/Intact\\". The mangroves are inaccessible, and population density is low, so much of the habitat is intact other than the city of Bel√©m and its surroundings. The mangroves are used by artisanal fishermen as a source of crabs and wood. Threats include subsistence agriculture and livestock raising, tourism, logging, mining and urban development.

He was one of the best Irish two-year-olds of 1973 when he won the Marble Hill Stakes and the Mullion Stakes as well as finishing third in the Coventry Stakes. In the following year he was narrowly beaten in the Vauxhall Trial Stakes before recording his biggest success in the Irish 2000 Guineas. He was beaten in his next three races when tried over longer distances before ending his career with a win in the Whitehall Stakes. After his retirement from racing he became a very successful sire of National Hunt horses. Background Furry Glen was a \\"big, strong, lengthy\\" bay horse with no white markings bred in Ireland by James Geraghty. He was sold as a foal for 3,500 guineas and then returned to the sales as a yearling when he fetched 14,000 guineas. He entered the ownership of Seamus McGrath who also trained him during his racing career. He was named after an area in the south-western corner of Phoenix Park. He was from the first crop of foals sired Wolver Hollow who won the 1969 Eclipse Stakes and went on to become a successful breeding stallion with his other progeny including Wollow. HIs dam Cleftess was an unraced daughter of the Kentucky Derby winner Hill Gail. Racing career =1973: two-year-old season= After finishing unplaced on his racecourse debut over five furlongs, Furry Glen won a maiden race over the same distance at the Curragh. He was then moved up in class and distance for the Marble Hill Stakes over six furlongs at the same course and won impressively from a field which included six previous winners. In June he was sent to England to contest the Coventry Stakes at Royal Ascot and finished third behind Doleswood and Dragonara Palace. In August he started 2/5 favourite for the Mullion Stakes over seven furlongs at Leopardstown Racecourse and won by one and a half lengths from Wanlockhead. In September he started favourite for the Larkspur Stakes over the same course and distance and finished third behind Primed and Sir Penfro. =1974: three-year-old season= On his three-year old debut Furry Glen contested the Group Three Vauxhall Trial Stakes over seven furlongs at Phoenix Park Racecourse, and finished second, beaten a head by the Vincent O'Brien-trained Cellini, the winner of the 1973 Dewhurst Stakes. The Irish 2000 Guineas, run on soft ground at the Curragh on 18 May attracted a field of ten runners. Cellini started favourite ahead of the British challengers Welsh Harmony (Horris Hill Stakes) and Pitcairn (Blue Riband Trial Stakes) with Furry Glen, ridden by George McGrath starting the 10/1 fourth choice in the betting. Furry Glen was last of the ten runners at half way and appeared to have no chance of winning but then began to stay on strongly on the outside. He caught the leader Pitcairn in the final strides and won by a short head, with a gap of three lengths back to Cellini in third. Furry Glen was moved up in distance for the Gallinule Stakes over ten furlongs at the Curragh later in May but was beaten a short head by Sir Penfro. Despite his defeat he was stepped up in distance again for the Irish Derby over one and a half miles on 29 June. He lost any chance he may have had when he was badly hampered in the straight and finished seventh, more than fifteen lengths behind the winner English Prince. On his next appearance in August, Furry Glen was most disappointing when coming home fifth behind Richard Grenville in the Blandford Stakes at the Curragh. On his final start, the colt was dropped back in distance for the Whitehall Stakes over nine furlongs at Phoenix Park and won by a short head from the filly Leave It To Me, to whom he was conceding thirteen pounds. Assessment There was no International Classification of European two-year-olds in 1973: the official handicappers of Britain, Ireland and France compiled separate rankings for horses which competed in those countries. In the Irish Free Handicap, Furry Glen was assigned a weight of 133 pounds, placing him fourth behind Apalachee, Cellini and Saritamer. The independent Timeform organisation gave him a rating of 113, 24 pounds below their top-rated two-year-old Apalachee. In 1974 he was given a rating of 121 by Timeform, ten pounds behind their top-rated three- year-old colts Caracolero, Dankaro, Nonoalco and Sagaro. Stud record Furry Glen was retired from racing to become a breeding stallion, beginning his stud career at the Ballymaglasson Stud in County Meath at a fee of ¬£500. He had little success as a sire of runners on the flat but was very successful National Hunt stallion. His best winners included Big Matt (Victor Chandler Chase), Change The Act (Tolworth Hurdle), Commercial Artist (Ericsson Chase), Danny Connors (Coral Golden Hurdle Final), Shannon Glen (Mumm Prize Novices' Hurdle), Strath Royal (Charlie Hall Chase), Super Tactics (Racing Post Chase), Toby Tobias (Martell Cup), Triple Witching (Long Distance Hurdle) and Vicario de Bray (Champion Hurdle Trial).
