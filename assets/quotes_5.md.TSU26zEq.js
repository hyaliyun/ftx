He is known as Padre Mario. He was well known for the healings of thousands as well as for the construction of a foundation in Gonz√°lez Cat√°n, Buenos Aires Province, which includes among other things free health care and education up to college level. Childhood and studies Jose Mario Pantaleo was born in Pistoia, Tuscany, to Ida Melani and Enrico Pantaleo. His father was a successful businessman, though much of the Pantaleo family's wealth was lost as a result of World War I. In February 1927, Mario, who already had endured a terrible bout of pneumonia that almost cost his life, and his family emigrated to Cordoba, Argentina, where Enrico's brother had business interests. Enrico's entrepreneurships didn't work out in Argentina, so in 1931 the family returned to Italy. At that time, Mario already knew his destiny: to be a priest. On December 3, 1944, Jose Mario Pantaleo completed his studies in the seminary of Mattera. Without a fixed destiny in his homeland, and bearing in mind that Cardinal Antonio Caggiano, leader of the Roman Catholic Church in Argentina, had asked the Pope for more clergymen, he went to Saint Pio of Pietrelcina for counsel. He encouraged Mario, saying, \\"Go my son, you're following your destiny. You have also been chosen for a singular mission.\\" Pantaleo returned to Argentina in 1948 and lived there the rest of his life. Early life in Argentina His first destination in Argentina was the province of Santa Fe. He would be the vicar of the church San Pedro in Casilda; a year later he would be reallocated to the church of la Guardia in Rosario and then to the small town of Aceval. At the end of 1951 he was named chaplain of the Hospital Provincial de Rosario. There he would meet three people who would have strong bonds with him for the rest of his life: Juan Lo Celso, director of the hospital, a young physician called Escalante de Larrechea, and Perla Garaveli. Perla met Padre Mario when she went to see him because of cancer in her uterus. That day, without asking Padre Mario for anything, he noticed her and cured her. She recalls saying: To which Padre Mario replied: Miracles and life in Gonz√°lez Cat√°n In 1958 Padre Mario decided to travel to Buenos Aires to study philosophy, an old passion of his. He wrote a letter to Antonio Caggiano asking him for the transfer. He was put in charge of the Hospital Ferrioviario. It was at this time that the legend began as he would cure people at a small apartment in the neighborhood of Floresta. People would line up long hours to be seen by the priest from Pistoia. With his small savings (but huge dreams), he bought a piece of land in the Gonzales Catan area to build a house and a church. Gonzales Catan was then a forgotten place with small houses, but that would change as the years passed. Rich and poor would travel to Gonzalez Catan looking for Padre Mario to help cure them. There have been hundreds of testimonies during the years including from high profile people like historian F√©lix Luna, businesswoman Mar√≠a Amalia Lacroze de Fortabat, as well as former Argentine presidents Carlos Menem and Arturo Frondizi. Always having a strong faith, he would say of himself (when healing others) to be a \\"guitar\\" to be played by the \\"guitarist\\" referring to his relationship with God in which he was only an instrument of God's will. Foundation The Obra del Padre Mario foundation is known for its vast community services and social actions developed because of the extraordinary capacity to love of its founder, Padre Mario. Its main areas of action are health, education, the handicapped, the community, culture and sports. =Health= Seventy-two percent of Gonz√°lez Cat√°n's population lives in poverty, and public health can't cope with the estimated 550,000 requests for medical attention every year. In this context the Policlinic Cristo Caminante of the foundation has become an invaluable resource for the general population and especially poor people and young children. =Education= As Padre Mario said, what children receive in a classroom is something that will last a lifetime. The Pantaleo school provides education from Kindergarten to college level. In 2006 the college celebrated its first graduate. The Pantaleo school has the objective of giving Gonz√°lez Cat√°n youth the possibility to work at a higher level and thus help the whole community to develop. Movie Alejandro Doria, a well-known Argentine filmmaker, decided in 2006 to make a movie about the life of Padre Mario called Las Manos. Although it was not a biographical movie it strove to show the spirit of Padre Mario. It starred famous Argentinian actors Jorge Marrale as Padre Mario and Graciela Borges as Perla. The movie was very well received by the critics and spectators. It was the best Argentine movie that year and people who knew Padre Mario (including Perla) stated the fidelity of the movie in portraying his life and spirit. Legacy Padre Mario's legacy lives on in his foundation and the thousands he cured. His foundation helps to improve the quality of life of the region. Devotion for Padre Mario has not faded. There are hundreds who prayed to Padre Mario for help in an illness and have been cured, and there are several books with testimonies. Perla Garavelli is currently seeking the beatification of Padre Mario.

It was opened in 1813 to trans-ship iron and coal from the Forest of Dean. It was once connected by a horse drawn tramroad to Pidcock's Canal which brought materials down to the wharves by tub-boat. In the 1960s imported wood was still being brought in by barge from Avonmouth.Photo in Francis Frith Collection It remained in commercial use until the 1980s. The entrance to the canal consists of an outer tidal gate opening into a wide basin. From there a lock opens into the one-mile canal cut. Immediately above the lock, a pair of gates point the other way as protection against a high tidal flood in the estuary. There is one swing bridge crossing the canal. The docks have recently been restored to create a marina and harbour area for seagoing yachts and motor boats.. As of 2020 the outer lock gates have failed in the open position and are inoperable.

He taught at the Military Academy in Belgrade and at the Yugoslav royal court before the war. He was also the secretary- general of Zbor. He became the Serbian Commissioner of Education on 10 July 1941. He was tried of collaboration by the communists following the war and was sentenced to death. He was executed in July 1946. Early life Velibor Joniƒá was born on 12 February 1892 in Krnjevo, Kingdom of Serbia to Krsta and Sofia Joniƒá (n√©e Veljkoviƒá). Before World War II, he taught at the Military Academy in Belgrade and worked as a journalist. He joined the Yugoslav National Movement (, Zbor) before the war and became its secretary-general. He also worked as a teacher in the royal court. He was married and had one child. Yugoslav National Movement The Yugoslav National Movement, established in 1935, was presided by right-wing politician Dimitrije Ljotiƒá, who had connections to the royal court and served a short stint as Minister of Justice in 1931. Joniƒá served as its secretary-general. The party was declared illegal upon establishment, since virtually all political parties in Yugoslavia had been banned since the declaration of King Alexander's dictatorship in 1929. After a petition by Joniƒá and attorney Milan Aƒáimoviƒá, the Ministry of the Interior eventually conceded and recognized Zbor as an official political party. The organization received German financial aid. It had limited support stemming from the fact that radical right-wing sentiment was not strong amongst the Serbian population, due to associating it with Germany. Being extremely anti-German, the majority of ethnic Serbs rejected fascist and Nazi ideas outright. World War II Joniƒá was appointed Commissioner of Education within the Commissioner Government on 10 July. With his encouragement, 545 prominent Serbs signed the Appeal to the Serbian Nation on 13 August and called for collaboration with Germany. On 29 August, the Germans put Milan Nediƒá in charge of the Serbian puppet administration. Joniƒá became Minister of Education on 7 October, having replaced Milo≈° Trivunac. As Minister of Education, he was given jurisdiction over the Serbian Orthodox Church. He attempted to win the church over to collaboration with the Germans, with little success. He was the chief editor of the weekly Srpski narod (1943‚Äì44). On 28 August 1944, Nediƒá appointed Joniƒá to manage the evacuation of the Serbian puppet government to Germany. Joniƒá suggested that the 5,000 Serbian intellectuals who had expressed support for the German occupation be hidden in Serbian Orthodox monasteries or transferred to Germany along with the government ministers. The Government of National Salvation stopped operating on 3 October, when the Soviet Red Army entered Belgrade and handed power over to the Yugoslav Partisans. Joniƒá fled Yugoslavia towards the end of the war. He and other exiled members of the Serbian puppet government met with Serbian Patriarch Gavrilo V and Bishop Nikolaj Velimiroviƒá in Vienna in December 1944. After the war, Joniƒá was accused of collaborating with the Germans and was tried in Belgrade. He was found guilty of collaboration and executed in Belgrade on 17 July 1946.

Turner made his debut against Kent at Amblecote on 5 July 1909; he scored 6 and 19 in an innings defeat. He made a further eight appearances that season, but did not reach 20 in any of them, ending the summer with an average of just 9.10. In 1910 he did a little better, hitting 49 not out against Warwickshire at Birmingham, but his best year was 1911, when he scored 463 runs at 15.43. This included his only two half-centuries, which were achieved in successive matches: 53 against Sussex at the end of May, then 66 versus Warwickshire a week later. Though he had played 16 matches in 1911, Turner never again turned out more than eight times in a season. A single match in 1913 was his last for eight years, and although he returned for eight more games spread over 1921 and 1922, he could muster only 200 runs from 16 innings, with a highest score of 44 against Gloucestershire in June 1921; this was also the only occasion on which Turner acted as wicket-keeper. Turner was a strictly occasional bowler, only turning his arm over at all in the three seasons from 1909 to 1911. Of his four first-class wickets, three came in the same innings in July 1911, when he accounted for Kent's Jack Hubble, Bill Fairservice and Charlie Blythe to finish with 3-7.

History  The company started out as KERN Internationale Handels- und Vertriebsgesellschaft mbH (KERN International Trade and Distribution Company) (Logo) which was founded in 1969 by Manfred and Ruthild Birte Kern in Frankfurt am Main, Germany. Initially, the company focused on data processing and printed products. Linguistic and translation services came into play for the first time within the context of a printing commission. The Barbados Tourist Board intended to print a brochure in Germany and came up with the idea of creating an English edition to promote the beauty of the Caribbean island throughout Europe. Due to the success of this major pilot project, KERN changed course by placing greater emphasis on translation projects. KERN soon gained clients across Germany and Europe to such an extent that demand could no longer be met at one location. The first branch opened in Duesseldorf in 1979. With subsequent branch openings, the company was renamed KERN GmbH, Language Services. The first overseas branch was opened in 1983 in Paris. The foundation of KERN Corporation in New York City followed in 1985. In the 1990s, the company expanded and extended its network of branches in Germany, United States; Switzerland, England, China and Netherlands. In 1997, the company was again renamed KERN AG, Global Language Services. Headquarters relocated to a listed building in Frankfurt in May 2005. It is at these headquarters that KERN currently combines its entire range of language services under one roof. Today, KERN Global Language Services operates in 8 countries, with over 40 company owned subsidiaries and branches. The original printing and data processing field of the company continues its important role of the KERN group, and now operates under the name of KERN & Partner Finanzwerbeagentur GmbH. (KERN & Partners Financial Advertising Agency). The range of language services offered ‚Äúunder one roof‚Äù at its headquarters enables the KERN group not only to simply translate texts, but also to work on documents in their entirety ‚Äì from translation, design of advertising campaigns, desktop publishing to printing and delivery of the final product. At the beginning of 2000, the KERN group absorbed the Institut f√ºr Kreatives Lernen (IKL) (Institute for Creative Learning) which offers language training for specialists and executive staff. The resulting company, KERN AG IKL Business Language Training & Co. KG, offers modern language training across Germany and Europe. KERN AG IKL is also a recognised test centre for the Educational Testing Service (ETS) and offers the opportunity to take the Test of English as a Foreign Language (TOEFL) online, an Admissions prerequisite of many English speaking universities, especially the United States. Test of English for International Communication (TOEIC), Test de fran√ßais international (TFI), London Chamber of Commerce and Industry (LCCI) are additional internationally recognised tests that can be taken at KERN AG IKL.  Areas of business  KERN Global Language Services core services comprise translation into all world languages, as well as terminology management, layout editing, DTP (Desktop Publishing), the localization of software and websites, in addition to language training.

The process involves adding a certain amount of sugar during roasting in order to glaze the beans. By adding the additional sugar to the beans it increases the effects of the Maillard Reaction during the roasting process, thus giving the beans more of their distinct flavor. The glazed beans are then mixed with normal roasted beans. While originally a cheap way of preserving the coffee beans in the 1920s, due to the common use of low grade Robusta Coffee the process was also used hide negative aroma and taste characteristics of the coffee. Another suggested reason for continued use of the technique has been maintenance of the aroma and taste of the coffee. The addition of sugar during the torrefacto roasting process increases the production of compounds with antioxidant properties. Both ground and brewed torrefacto coffee has higher antioxidant capacity than standard roasts. In addition, the espresso method of extraction yielded higher antioxidant activity than other brewing methods.L√≥pez-Galilea I, Andueza S, di Leonardo I, Paz de Pe√±a M, Cid C. Influence of torrefacto roast on antioxidant and pro-oxidant activity of coffee. Food Chemistry, 94;(1):75-80. According to Sagi Cohen, the Torrefacto process allows coffee to be kept fresh for longer; lowers its price, as it is mixed with much cheaper sugar; and imparts it with flavors which he variously describes as \\"burnt sugar\\", \\"diluted asphalt\\" and \\"liquefied coal\\".

Built by Intamin, the ride featured a hydraulic launch and opened in 2005. The tightly packed layout is the result of a limited area to house the ride. On 30 December 2016, Kanonen closed permanently and was replaced by Valkyria, a Bolliger & Mabillard dive coaster. History In 2002, Liseberg's only looping roller coaster HangOver, a Vekoma Invertigo model, was removed. The park contacted several roller coaster manufacturers with the aim of introducing a new looping ride, with the winning bid coming from Swiss company Intamin. Lars-Erik Hedin, technical director of Liseberg said \\"Due to the good experiences with Balder and the impressive catapult launch we decided to mandate Intamin again with the project\\". =Closure and relocation= In 2016, Liseberg announced that Kanonen would close to be replaced by a B&M; dive coaster called Valkyria in 2018. 30 December 2016 was Kanonen's last day, it was then dismantled and sold afterwards. On 19 July 2018, the roller coaster was announced to have been sold to Lost Island Water Park located in Waterloo, Iowa., with plans to be included within a theme park expansion of the complex with a planned opening in 2022. Track layout After departing the station, Kanonen's 16-person trains are accelerated to 72 km/h straight into a high top hat element. This is immediately followed by an air time hill and a high vertical loop, the first inversion of the ride. After a highly banked turnaround, the trains pass through a heartline roll before entering the brake run, bringing the ride to an end. Rollbacks As with many launched roller coasters, Kanonen was susceptible to rollbacks when the train does not gain enough momentum on the launch track in order to make it over the top-hat and rolls down backwards. Kanonen had magnetic brakes along the launch track in order to slow the train down if this happens. Rollbacks usually happen if there is strong winds or the track is wet, but other factors can affect the launching system. On 8 June 2009, the right conditions meant that a train got balanced at the top of the top-hat with 14 riders on board.

These microwave links typically carry a mix of Ethernet /IP, TDM (Nx E1) and SDH traffic to connect sites with high capacity. Such microwave links used to carry 2xE1 (4Mbit/s) now carry 800Mbit/s or more, using modern 1024QAM or higher modulation schemes. Fixed wireless is the operation of wireless communication devices or systems used to connect two fixed locations (e.g., building to building or tower to building) with a radio or other wireless link, such as laser bridge. Usually, fixed wireless is part of a wireless LAN infrastructure. The purpose of a fixed wireless link is to enable data communications between the two sites or buildings. Fixed wireless data (FWD) links are often a cost-effective alternative to leasing fiber or installing cables between the buildings. The point-to-point signal transmissions occur through the air over a terrestrial microwave platform rather than through copper or optical fiber; therefore, fixed wireless does not require satellite feeds or local telephone service. The advantages of fixed wireless include the ability to connect with users in remote areas without the need for laying new cables and the capacity for broad bandwidth that is not impeded by fiber or cable capacities. Fixed wireless devices usually derive their electrical power from the public utility mains, unlike mobile wireless or portable wireless devices which tend to be battery powered. Antennas Fixed wireless services typically use a directional radio antenna on each end of the signal (e.g., on each building). These antennas are generally larger than those seen in Wi-Fi setups and are designed for outdoor use. Several types of radio antennas are available that accommodate various weather conditions, signal distances and bandwidths. They are usually selected to make the beam as narrow as possible and thus focus transmit power to their destination, increasing reliability and reducing the chance of eavesdropping or data injection. The links are usually arranged as a point-to-point setup to permit the use of these antennas. This also permits the link to have better speed and or better reach for the same amount of power. These antennas are typically designed to be used in the unlicensed ISM band radio frequency bands (900 MHz, 1.8 GHz, 2.4 GHz and 5 GHz), however, in most commercial installations, licensed frequencies may be used to ensure quality of service (QoS) or to provide higher connection speeds. Fixed wireless broadband With the growing infrastructure of wireless networks, and improving speed and reliability, fixed wireless has also become a viable solution for broadband access. Businesses and homes can use fixed-wireless antenna technology to access broadband Internet and Layer 2 networks using fixed wireless broadband. Networks which have redundancy and saturation and antennas that can aggregate signal from multiple carriers are able to offer fail-over and redundancy for connectivity not generally afforded by wired connections. In rural areas where wired infrastructure is not yet available, fixed-wireless broadband can be a viable option for Internet access.

Early and family life Jackson was born in Parkersburg in Wood County, Virginia (now West Virginia). His grandfather John G. Jackson had served in the U.S. House of Representatives as well as a U.S. District Judge, and earlier as a Brigadier General in the Virginia militia. His father was also (Virginia militia) General John Jay Jackson. His brothers became Federal Judge John Jay Jackson, Jr. and Circuit Judge and West Virginia Governor Jacob B. Jackson. Career He graduated from Princeton University in 1845. After studying law, he was admitted to the bar in 1847. He opened his practice in Parkersburg, West Virginia. He won election as prosecuting attorney for Wood County in 1856 and 1860. He served as a member of the West Virginia House of Delegates in 1870 and 1871. He was a member of the State constitutional convention in 1872. He served as a judge on the fifth circuit court from 1873 to 1888, when he resigned after thinking he was elected to the U.S. Congress in a very close race with Republican Charles Brooks Smith. Although Jackson presented credentials as a Democratic Member-elect to the Fifty-first Congress and served from March 4, 1889 until February 3, 1890, Smith, successfully contested the election and served the final year of the term before being defeated for re-election by Democrat James Capehart. West Virginia legislators then elected Jackson as a judge on the criminal court for Wood County, where he served from 1891 until his death. Death and legacy Jackson died in Parkersburg, West Virginia on February 14, 1901. He was buried at Riverview Cemetery. The Jackson Memorial Fountain at Parkersburg is dedicated to the Jackson family.

The church is recorded in the National Heritage List for England as a designated Grade II* listed building. It is an active Anglican parish church in the diocese of Chester, the archdeaconry of Macclesfield and the deanery of Knutsford. Its benefice is combined with that of St John the Evangelist, Toft. History Knutsford was a chapel of ease in the parish of St Mary's Church, Rostherne, until the 18th century. In 1741 an Act of Parliament was obtained for it to become a distinct parish. The church was built between 1741 and 1744 at a cost of ¬£4,000 (), the architect being J. Garlive. In 1879 the apsidal chancel was extended and reordered by Alfred Darbyshire. St John's is within the Conservative Evangelical tradition of the Church of England, and it has passed resolutions to reject the ordination of women. Architecture =Exterior= The church is built in neoclassical style in brick with stone dressings and a slate roof. The plan of the church consists of a west tower, a two-storey nave and a shallow chancel. The tower is in four stages with a west doorway over which is a round-arched window, a clock and round-arched belfry windows. The top of the tower has a parapet with modillion brackets swept between urns. The parapet of the nave has alternating solid and balustraded panels. At the southwest is a doorway in a pedimented case with a rusticated architrave and a round-arched inner door. There is a similar doorway at the northwest. =Interior= The nave has a classical arcade of four bays with Tuscan columns on high bases carrying semicircular arches. Galleries are on the north, west and south sides. There are two fonts. One is made of marble and has an oak cover. It dates from the time of building of the church but spent some time in the garden of a private house. The other dates from 1865 and is in High Victorian style. An old parish chest is in the tower and in the church is a two-tier brass candelabrum donated in 1768. On the north wall is a pyramidal memorial to Ralph Leycester of Toft who died in 1776. Also in the church is a memorial to Elizabeth Leigh who died in 1823 which is signed by Richard Westmacott. The stained glass is by Heaton, Butler and Bayne. Two memorial boards are in the church which are believed to have been painted by members of the Randle Holme family of Chester. The three-manual organ was built in 1882 by Alex Young and Sons. There is a ring of six bells. Four of these were cast in 1748‚Äì49 by Rudhall of Gloucester: the other two were cast by John Taylor Ltd in 1996. The parish registers begin in 1581. In 2014 reordering works to the interior were completed, designed by architects Graham Holland Associates. This involved the removal of the late-Victorian pews, and the installation of an oak floor, and glazed screens between the narthex and nave and at the three external doors. Four of the Victorian stained glass windows were relocated onto the Church Hill facade, while the two rows of windows in the aisles were replaced in a clear leaded Georgian design. External features In the churchyard is a stone sundial probably dating from the late 18th century. It consists of a baluster-like pedestal on circular plinth. It is listed at Grade II.

The company became internationally known in the late 1980s due to a corruption scandal known as the Agrokomerc Affair. During the war in Bosnia and Herzegovina, Fikret Abdiƒá, the chief executive officer of the company, used his wealth and political influence to create the state of Autonomous Province of Western Bosnia. Initial growth Agrokomerc is located in an area that was put in an economic blockade by the Yugoslav Communist party immediately after World War II. At the time the company was one farm located just over the border in Croatia. In the 1970s, with its new president Fikret Abdiƒá, Agrokomerc started to grow by making connections with farmers in surrounding areas, building chicken farms and providing jobs for thousands of unemployed people in the region that would have otherwise moved out. Shortly after, Agrokomerc became the main subject in all aspects of local life. With positive influence on employees and the public, as well as with its own investments, Agrokomerc made this region into one of the most advanced regions in Yugoslavia. With its own resources Agrokomerc built roads in the farthest parts of the region, provided water supplies to almost every house in the region, invested in the school system to get high educated employees. By the 1980s the company had millions of chickens, thousands of turkeys, thousands of farmed rabbits, mayonnaise production, liquor production, chicken, turkey and rabbit meat, salami and luncheon production, chocolate production, mushrooms production, and owned cold and dry storage. With over 13,000 employees, its own trucks for distribution of products, a bus service for employees and the public, huge reputation for quality of products all over Europe and further, Agrokomerc was considered to be a successful company and a food manufacturing giant.  The Affair  The affair around Agrokomerc become public in August 1987, after an article published on 15 August 1987 in Belgrade-based Borba in which the company was accused of issuing issued promissory notes without coverage. The Executive Council of the SR Bosnia and Herzegovina also released a note regarding the case. Soon, a media campaign was launched against Fikret Abdiƒá, but also against the brothers Hamdija and Hakija Pozderac, who were accused of political sponsorship for Abdiƒá, and were considered main culprits for Abdiƒá‚Äôs entry into the financial system. Presidency of the Central Committee of the League of Communists of Bosnia and Herzegovina (CK SK BiH) held an extended session on 31 August 1987 discussing business irregularities of the SOUR Agrokomerc. Even in April, the Presidency of the CK SK BiH asked the republic institutions for checking the real status within Agrokomerc. This request to the republic institutions was made after the Republic Secretariat of Internal Affairs (RSUP) warned about the wide phenomenon of business irregularities, misuse, bribery, corruption and inappropriate use of funds. The Presidency of the CK SK BiH asked the party organisations in Velika Kladu≈°a and Cazin to refrain themselves from illegal doings and to analyse the complete status. However, due to noncooperation of the Agrokomerc business structures and refusal to give in the information, the Executive Council of the Assembly of the SR Bosnia and Herzegovina formed a special group in order to investigate the economic-financial status of Agrokomerc. The finding of the special group shocked the whole Yugoslav public. The Central Committee of the SK BiH referred to the activities of the business organs of Agrokomerc as \\"anti-self-managing\\" and \\"technocratic\\", asking for expulsion of Fikret Abdiƒá from the Central Committee, his dismissal from the Federal Council of the Yugoslav Assembly, and removal from the post of president of the business committee of Agrokomerc. The authorities asked for questioning of responsibilities of communists in the Republic‚Äôs Public Persecution, the State Accounting Service, the People's Bank and the Business Bank Sarajevo - Udru≈æena banka, because they showed a lack of initiative in discovering irregularities and protecting the legality and the state property. In the war When the war broke out in the 1990s, Abdiƒá created the Autonomous Province of Western Bosnia, a de facto independent entity that existed in the northwestern corner of the Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina between 1993 and 1995. Agrokomerc was the cornerstone of its economy.  After the war  The original company folded after the war, but was re-established as Agrokomerc d.d Velika Kladu≈°a by former workers in 1999 in cooperation with of the Sarajevo-based company Gad≈æo Komerc, which specialised in producing the Tops brand biscuits. Although the company exported its products to the United States, Australia and Canada, it struggled financially and was later brought under state control. Agrokomerc was auctioned by the state in 2014, but reported problems in attracting buyers.AGROKOMERC NA LISTI ZA PRIVATIZACIJU U 2014. GODINI, RTVUSK In 2017, it was reported that the company had been acquired by AC Food, a company of the Sarajevo-based food and textile conglomerate AS Group and had recovered financially, continuing to produce biscuits, chocolate and other confectionery products, with plans for production of meat, poultry and eggs from 2018.

The receiving system noise temperature is the summation of the antenna noise temperature and the RF chain noise temperature from the antenna terminals to the receiver output. Antenna temperature (Tant) is a parameter that describes how much noise an antenna produces in a given environment. Antenna noise temperature is not the physical temperature of the antenna but rather an expression of the available noise power at the antenna flange. Moreover, an antenna does not have an intrinsic \\"antenna temperature\\" associated with it; rather the temperature depends on its gain pattern and the thermal environment that it is placed in. Antenna temperature is also sometimes referred to as Antenna Noise Temperature. To define the environment, we'll introduce a temperature distribution - this is the temperature in every direction away from the antenna in spherical coordinates. For instance, the night sky is roughly ; the value of the temperature pattern in the direction of the Earth's ground is the physical temperature of the Earth's ground. This temperature distribution will be written as TS(Œ∏, œÜ). Hence, an antenna's temperature will vary depending on whether it is directional and pointed into space or staring into the sun. For an antenna with a radiation pattern given by G(Œ∏, œÜ), the noise temperature is mathematically defined as: :T_\\\\text{A} = \\\\frac{1}{4\\\\pi} \\\\int_{0}^{2\\\\pi} \\\\int_{0}^{\\\\pi} G(\\\\theta,\\\\varphi) T_\\\\text{S}(\\\\theta,\\\\varphi) \\\\sin(\\\\theta) \\\\; d\\\\theta d\\\\varphi [1] This states that the temperature surrounding the antenna is integrated over the entire sphere, and weighted by the antenna's radiation pattern. Hence, an isotropic antenna would have a noise temperature that is the average of all temperatures around the antenna; for a perfectly directional antenna (with a pencil beam), the antenna temperature will only depend on the temperature in which the antenna is \\"looking\\". The noise power PN (in watts) received from an antenna at temperature TA can be expressed in terms of the bandwidth, B, that the antenna (and its receiver) are operating over: :P_\\\\text{N} = k T_\\\\text{A} B,[1] where k is the Boltzmann constant (). The receiver also has a temperature associated with it, TE, and the total system temperature T (antenna plus receiver) has a combined temperature given by T = TA \\\\+ TE. This temperature can be used in the above equation to find the total noise power of the system. These concepts begin to illustrate how antenna engineers must understand receivers and the associated electronics, because the resulting systems very much depend on each other. A parameter often encountered in specification sheets for antennas that operate in certain environments is the ratio of gain of the antenna divided by the antenna temperature (or system temperature if a receiver is specified). This parameter is written as G/T, and has units of dB¬∑K‚àí1. G/T Calculation G/T is the figure of merit for a satellite system. G is the Receive antenna gain. T is the system noise temperature. System noise temperature = antenna noise temperature + Receiver noise temperature (LNA) Antenna noise temperature is the noise power seen at the receive output of the antenna. (To LNA) If we are not measuring with an LNA or Receiver then System noise temperature = antenna noise temperature. This is not a representative value for calculating G/T since the G/T relates to the receive performance of both antenna and receiver.  Selection of antenna aperture  Satellite antenna aperture is closely related to quality factor (G/T value) of earth station. G/T value and satellite power demand, i.e. equivalent rent bandwidth, show logarithmic linear relationship. In other words, the value of equivalent rent bandwidth increases with the narrowing of antenna aperture. Therefore, when selecting earth station aperture, it is not the smaller, the better. And earth station aperture should make a compromise between space overhead (equivalent rent bandwidth) and ground overhead (antenna aperture) to make system achieve optimum allocation.

Chartiers Valley's rankings are as follows: *2016- 146th out of 676 *2015- 173rd *2014- 202nd *2013- 170th Special education In December 2009, the district administration reported that 377 pupils or 11% of the district's pupils received Special Education services. In order to comply with state and federal laws, the District engages in identification procedures to ensure that eligible students receive an appropriate educational program consisting of special education and related services, individualized to meet student needs. At no cost to the parents, these services are provided in compliance with state and federal law; and are reasonably calculated to yield meaningful educational benefit and student progress. To identify students who may be eligible for special education, various screening activities are conducted on an ongoing basis. These screening activities include: review of group-based data (cumulative records, enrollment records, health records, report cards, ability and achievement test scores); hearing, vision, motor, and speech/language screening; and review by the administrative team. When screening results suggest that the student may be eligible, the District obtains parental consent to conduct a multidisciplinary evaluation. Parents or guardians, who believe their child is eligible, may verbally request a multidisciplinary evaluation from a professional employee of the District or contact the Director of Student Services. By Pennsylvania law, the evaluation must be completed within 60 days. In 2010, the state of Pennsylvania provided $1,026,815,000 for Special Education services. The funds were distributed to districts based on a state policy which estimates that 16% of the district's pupils are receiving special education services. This funding is in addition to the state's basic education per pupil funding, as well as, all other state and federal funding. Chartiers Valley School District received a $1,451,261 supplemental funding to pay for special education services for its students, in 2010. For the 2011-12 school year, all Pennsylvania public school districts received the same level of funding for special education that they received in 2010. This level funding is provided regardless of changes in the number of pupils who need special education services and regardless of the level of services the respective students required. =Gifted education= The District Administration reported that 46 or 1.32% of its students were gifted in 2009. By law, the district must provide mentally gifted programs at all grade levels. Services designed to meet the needs of gifted students include the annual development of a Gifted Individual Education Plan, support services and specially-designed instruction designed to challenge the student. Students in the gifted education program are encouraged to compete in area intellectual competitions. The referral process for a gifted evaluation can be initiated by teachers or parents by contacting the student‚Äôs building principal, requesting an evaluation. All requests should be made in writing which commences a 60-day evaluation deadline. To be eligible for mentally gifted programs in Pennsylvania, a student must have a cognitive ability of at least 130 as measured on a standardized ability test by a certified school psychologist. Other factors that indicate giftedness will also be considered for eligibility. Budget In 2009, the district employed 281 teachers with an average salary of $56,210.

Districts are not allowed to raise taxes above that index unless they allow voters to vote by referendum, or they seek an exception from the state Department of Education. The base index for the 2010-2011 school year is 2.9 percent, but the Act 1 Index can be adjusted higher, depending on a number of factors, such as property values and the personal income of district residents. Act 1 included 10 exceptions, including: increasing pension costs, increases in special education costs, a catastrophe like a fire or flood, increase in health insurance costs for contracts in effect in 2006 or dwindling tax bases. The base index is the average of the percentage increase in the statewide average weekly wage, as determined by the PA Department of Labor and Industry, for the preceding calendar year and the percentage increase in the Employment Cost Index for Elementary and Secondary Schools, as determined by the Bureau of Labor Statistics in the U.S. Department of Labor, for the previous 12-month period ending June 30. For a school district with a market value/personal income aid ratio (MV/PI AR) greater than 0.4000, its index equals the base index multiplied by the sum of .75 and its MV/PI AR for the current year.Pennsylvania Department of Education 2010-11 Act 1 of 2006 Referendum Exception Guidelines.

Each year, the Chartiers Valley School Board has the option of adopting either 1) a resolution in January certifying they will not increase taxes above their index or 2) a preliminary budget in February. A school district adopting the resolution may not apply for referendum exceptions or ask voters for a tax increase above the inflation index. A specific timeline for these decisions is publisher each year by the Pennsylvania Department of Education. According to a state report, for the 2011-2012 school year budgets, 247 school districts adopted a resolution certifying that tax rates would not be increased above their index; 250 school districts adopted a preliminary budget. Of the 250 school districts that adopted a preliminary budget, 231 adopted real estate tax rates that exceeded their index. Tax rate increases in the other 19 school districts that adopted a preliminary budget did not exceed the school district‚Äôs index. Of the districts who sought exceptions 221 used the pension costs exemption and 171 sought a Special Education costs exemption. Only 1 school district sought an exemption for Nonacademic School Construction Project, while 1 sought an exception for Electoral debt for school construction. For 2009 and 2010, the Chartiers Valley School Board did not apply for any exceptions to exceed the Index limit.

Russell National School Lunch Act (42 U.S.C. 1751 et seq) or the Child Nutrition Act of 1966 (42 U.S.C. 1771 et seq) \\"shall establish a local school wellness policy by School Year 2006.\\" The legislation placed the responsibility of developing a wellness policy at the local level so the individual needs of each district can be addressed. According to the requirements for the Local Wellness Policy, school districts must set goals for nutrition education and physical education that are aligned with the Pennsylvania State Academic Standards for Health, Safety and Physical Education, campus food provision, and other school-based activities designed to promote student wellness. Additionally, districts were required to involve a broad group of individuals in policy development and to have a plan for measuring policy implementation. Districts were offered a choice of levels of implementation for limiting or prohibiting low nutrition foods on the school campus. In final implementation these regulations prohibit some foods and beverages on the school campus.Nutrition Standards for Competitive Foods in Pennsylvania Schools for the School Nutrition Incentive, Pennsylvania Department of Education ‚Äî Division of Food and Nutrition.

It encompasses the Arli National Park and the Singou Reserve. It is considered to comprise part of the most significant and important savanna woodland wildlife areas still existing in West Africa.  Fauna and history  In 1980, aerial counts revealed that the largest antelope population in the entire region inhabited the Arly-Singou complex. More recent studies indicate that the antelope population has been sustained by the end of the 20th century. In 2003, herds of African elephant, buffalo, roan antelope, western hartebeest, oribi, Grimm's duiker, Buffon's kob, bushbuck, waterbuck, bohor reedbuck and groups of warthog, anubis baboon and Patas monkey were recorded in Arly-Singou during an aerial survey. In 2002, it was estimated that between 364 and 444 lions reside in Arly-Singou, based on information by local people. But census data were not available. In 2004, census data were still not available. Based on information by wildlife researchers, it was estimated that 50 to 150 lions reside in Arly-Singou. Previously the endangered painted hunting dog, Lycaon pictus, occurred in Burkina Faso within the Arly-Singou ecosystem, but, although last sightings were made in Arli National Park, the species is considered extirpated throughout Burkina Faso. The Arly-Singou project is considered to have taken a somewhat new initiative in structure, in regard to wildlife management undertakings funded by the government in the area. However, the project also permits private operators to share and hold authority of the area's management, in a bid to take advantage of the benefits of greater external funds, from these operators.

First described in 1859, the large-scale whiting is known to inhabit shallow waters along the coasts of a number of Indo-Pacific countries including Japan, Indonesia, Philippines and the Solomon Islands. Little is known of the species biology, even though it is of minor importance to fisheries throughout its range. The species was first scientifically described by the Dutch ichthyologist Pieter Bleeker in 1859 from a specimen collected from the waters of Batavia in Bali, Indonesia. This specimen was designated to be the holotype. Description As with most of the family Sillaginidae, the large-scale whiting has a slightly compressed, elongate body tapering toward the terminal mouth. The body is covered in small ctenoid scales, except for the two rows of cheek scales which are mostly cycloid. The first dorsal fin has 11 spines and the second dorsal fin has 1 leading spine with 19 to 21 soft rays posterior. The anal fin is similar to the second dorsal fin, but has 2 spines with 19 to 21 soft rays posterior to the spines. Other distinguishing features include 51 to 56 lateral line scales and a total of 34 vertebrae. The species has a known maximum length of over 16 cm. While reviewing the species, McKay only was able to examine the swim bladders of juveniles. He found the juveniles to have well-developed swim bladders with no posterior or anterior extensions, but the duct like process well developed. The fish is a yellowish colour, being darker above with a diffuse silver longitudinal mid-lateral band on the sides. All fins are hyaline in appearance, with the dorsal fins being dusky with a narrow blackish margin. Juveniles have a series of small brown spots along their back at the base of the dorsal fins. Distribution and habitat The large-scale whiting has been recorded from Japan, the Indonesian Archipelago, New Britain, Solomon Islands and the Philippines A 1980 report from India by Dutt and Sajutha is in error and was the first recording of the then undescribed species, Sillago lutea. The species enters estuaries and may penetrate freshwater rivers, at least as juveniles. Large-scale whiting are only found in relatively shallow water of 0 to 5 m in depth. Relationship to humans Although the species is of minor importance at present, it is often caught in trawls and seines, being of slight importance to local fisheries throughout its range.

He was a son of Ansbertus, a Senator, and wife Blithilde. Monderic had originally been consecrated as a coadjutor for Bishop Tetricus of Langres, who had suffered a stroke. The understanding, however, was that he would serve as Archpriest of Tonnerre in the diocese of Langres, until Bishop Tetricus died. But in the war between King Guntram and King Sigibert, Monderic had given gifts and furnished supplies for Sigibert, and so he was sent into exile super ripam Rhodani in turri quadam arcta atque detecta, ('by the bank of the Rhone in a certain small tower that had lost its roof') in which he was held for two years cum grandi cruciatu ('with great discomfort'). Archbishop Nicetius, who was the bishop of Lyon and Metropolitan of the diocese of Langres, intervened on his behalf and sheltered him in Lyon for two months. Unable to get his original place restored, Monderic fled to King Sigibert. About 570, Sigebert, King of Austrasia, created a see at Arisitum for Munderic, taking fifteen parishes and the village of Arisitum, which had once belonged to the Goths but at the time was in the diocese Bishop Dalmatius of Rodez.Gregory of Tours, Historia Francorum Book V, chapter 5, in: J.-P.

It qualitatively estimates and reports on potential road safety issues and identifies opportunities for improvements in safety for all road users.\\"FHWA Road Safety Audit web page, retrieved 2/19/2009 Road safety audits differ from conventional traffic safety studies in two key ways: road safety audits are often pro-active investigations, rather than reactive investigations of sites with histories of complaints or poor safety performance, and the investigation team is independent from the staff that is designing the project or maintains the road. Road safety audits are commonly used in the United Kingdom and Australia, and are coming into wider use in the United States. They are a mandatory requirement for all trunk road Highway Improvement Schemes in the UK (including motorways). The requirements of a Road Safety Audit are contained in the Design Manual for Roads and Bridges Volume 5 Section 2 ‚Äì 'HD19/03 Road Safety Audit'.HD19/03 A key feature of a road safety audit is the use of a team of professionals with varied expertise. The team should include highway safety engineers, highway design engineers, maintenance personnel, and law enforcement. Additional specialties should be added to the team as needed. The team members must not be involved in the design or maintenance of the facility being examined, so that they can have an objective point of view. The road safety audit may investigate general safety conditions, or it may focus on specific concerns or users. Walkability audits concentrate on pedestrian safety and accommodation,Walkability Audits, retrieved 2/19/2009 and transit audits focus on safety of bus and train users. The New York State Department of Transportation's Safety Appurtenance Program (SAFETAP) uses audit techniques to make simple but effective safety improvements in conjunction with road resurfacing projects.Highway Safety Improvement Program 2007 Annual Evaluation Report This helps prevent increases in crashes that sometimes occur due to increased driving speeds after road resurfacing. Audits attempt to avoid some of the limitations inherent to any crash history scoring system. Some of these limitations are: * Reactive systems require waiting until crashes have already occurred, possibly with resulting injuries and fatalities. * Crash frequencies are subject to regression toward the mean. It can be hard to determine whether good or poor short-term safety performance is due to the inherent safety or hazards of the site, or random variation. Sites with high or low crash rates are likely to move towards the mean as a matter of course, even if nothing changes. * Most existing procedures focus on sites that have experienced the most accidents, which may or may not be the sites that could benefit most from a safety improvement. * Reactive systems are limited by the quality and timeliness of the data entered into them. Deficiencies in crash reporting limit the effectiveness of these systems. If historical crash data are available, the audit team should make use of them. However, one of the strengths of the audit process is it can find safety concerns before they contribute to crashes. Lack of data is a reason to use the audit process, rather than an excuse not to. There are three basic forms of road safety audit: * Audit of an existing road or road network : To check a road or a network for consistency, to make sure that a road user does not encounter unexpected road safety issues * Audit of a roadworks project at various stages of completion: :Feasibility stage, or project scoping, when the general nature of the project is determined :Preliminary design stage, when alternate courses of action for the project are analyzed, and selected or discarded :Detailed design stage :Construction stage, to make sure work zone traffic controls are protecting road users and construction workers :Post construction stage, to make sure the completed project is performing as intended * Thematic audit :Thematic audits focus on particular aspects of a road. They may be used to investigate road safety issues brought up by road user groups, or audits conducted to support a land development application. Australian experience has shown benefit/cost ratios of from 3 to 242 from implementation of recommendations of individual design stages audits, and benefit/cost ratios of from 2.4 to 84 for existing road audits.Austroads Report AP-R209 \\"Evaluation of Proposed Actions Emanating from Road Safety Audits\\" This makes sense as it assigns the highest benefit cost ratio to feasibility stage, preliminary design stage and design stage audits, since these audits can remove poor design features from projects before they are built. Criticisms Road safety audit has been criticised for standing in the way of innovation. The value of road safety audit is critically dependent on the knowledge and training of the individuals undertaking the audit. The lack of formal and robust accreditation of Road Safety Auditors has led to a wide variation in the skills of people practicing: from the highest levels of technical competence, to those with poor knowledge who are able to conduct little more than checks of code compliance. It is expected that in future years rigorous examination based systems of accreditation will emerge internationally.

He was the son of Ansbertus, a Senator, and his wife Blithilde, whose parents were Charibert I and Ingoberga.  Life  Virtually no information survives concerning the acts of Arnoald prior to his becoming Bishop of Metz or during his occupation of the episcopal seat. From Paul the Deacon we learn that he was Roman and of senatorial extraction suggesting that he came from one of the families in southern Gaul whose members had held senatorial rank during the empire. The Commemoratio Genealogiae Domni Karoli Glorissimi Imperatoris, clearly incorrect in some respects (see below), suggests strongly that Arnoald was one of the Ferreoli, a family dating from the 4th century who were based in the Midi but appear to have switched their loyalties from the Visigothic Kingdom to the Frankish Kingdom of Austrasia with its capital at Metz during the two decades following the Battle of Vouill√© in 507. Modern arguments have been made that this relationship was invented by contemporaries to give the Carolingians a Roman pedigree. However this is unlikely to have been the case inasmuch as (a) the Ferreoli, though significant, were far from the most prominent senatorial family in Gaul and (b) it would have been too easy for the Carolingians to obtain whatever Roman bloodline by marrying into remnants of those families. Still the interest taken by the Austrasians in the Ferreoli is enigmatic and significant and may have to do with their potential use in a conquest of Visigothic Septimania. Several members of the family were elevated to the rank of Patrician (senior Roman official) of Provence during the 6th century. Arnoald's acquisition of the bishopric of Metz is unsurprising inasmuch as his uncle Agilulf had held it. The reason Agilulf was granted the position is more obscure. There do not appear to be any predecessors of this family in the bishopric of Metz which prior to 590 was not important enough to warrant a single mention from Gregory of Tours. Prior to Agilulf, the most powerful bishops in the Austrasian kingdom were Egidius of Rheims and Gregory of Tours. Egidius was convicted of treason in 590 and the rise of the Bishops of Metz from that time certainly is in part due to those events. Even after these events, Metz cannot truly be said to have become the most powerful bishopric until the time of Arnulf. It is of some interest that the name of the diplomatically adept deacon of Gregory of Tours in 590 was also an Agilulf.  Relation to St. Arnulf of Metz  The Commemoratio Genealogiae Domni Karoli Glorissimi Imperatoris written originally in the early 9th century states that Arnulf of Metz was the son of predecessor Arnoaldus of Metz, himself a son of Ansbertus and thus the Ferreoli of the Midi. J. Depoin in \\"Grand Figures Monacales Du Temps Merovingiens. St Arnoul de Metz, Etudes de Critique Historique\\" Revue Mabillon 21, (1921) observed that chronologically and for other reasons - Arnulf was identified as a Frank in contemporary documents whereas Arnoald was identified by Paul the Deacon as a Roman ex nobilia senatorum familia orto - this construction was incorrect and proposed an alternative to the effect that Arnulf's father was Bodegisel, based in significant part on the Vita Gundolphi. David Humiston Kelley then proposed that Arnoaldus was likely an ancestor of the Carolingians through a daughter Itta, wife of Pepin of Landen. Christian Settipani carefully revisited and expanded upon the work of Depoin and Kelley. He concurred in Arnulf's descent from Bodegisel instead of Arnoald, and that there was a connection between the Ripuarian Frankish royal house and the Carolingians but argued (without dismissing the possibility of Itta's being Arnoald's daughter) that there was a connection through Arnulf's wife, Doda who he posited as a daughter of Arnoald. Kelly considered Settipani's proposed connection between the Carolingians and Arnoald and regarded it as probable.

Each job in a job chain makes up a step in the processing of the chain. * Job dependencies, which can be based on the results of the execution of preceding job nodes in one or more job chains. * Cross-platform scheduling: ** Universal agents to execute jobs directly on remote hosts across different operating systems, ** Agentless scheduling to execute jobs across different operating systems. * Active/passive clusters for scalability & high-availability. * Recording of job history, frequency and log information in SQL databases. * Triggering of job starts by directory monitoring and file watching. * Built-in file transfer capabilities. * Scripting capabilities (Shell, JavaScript, PowerShell, etc.). * A monitoring interface for integration with system monitors such as Nagios, Zabbix, SCOM, etc. * A library of standard job templates covering operations such as file transfer and log rotation. * Graphical interfaces for job configuration, workflow control and access to the job logs and history. = Implementation = * The JobScheduler master is written in C++ and Java, the agent has been developed with Scala and Java. Standard jobs distributed with the JobScheduler are implemented with Java. * Information about the individual objects processed by the JobScheduler - jobs, job chains, orders, schedules, etc. - are persistently stored in the form of XML files. * A database management system (DBMS) is used by the JobScheduler master to store job status, protocol and history information. Supported DBMSs are listed below. = JobScheduler Universal Agent = * The Universal Agent has been introduced for carrying out complex scheduling tasks on remote computers and operating systems not otherwise supported by the JobScheduler master. * The agent runs on any operating system that supports a Java Virtual Machine. * The agent acquires its configuration and task execution requests from one or more JobScheduler master instances and does not require a DBMS. * Master / agent communication uses a single HTTP or HTTPS connection. * A number of JobScheduler agents can be configured in an agent cluster for redundancy and fail-over. = Supported platforms =  JobScheduler Master  Operating systems: * Windows (32 & 64 bit) * Linux (32 & 64 bit) Database management systems: * Oracle * SQL Server * MySQL * MariaDB * PostgreSQL  JobScheduler Universal Agent  The Universal Agent can be run on any operating system that supports a Java Virtual Machine. A DBMS is not required. = Licensing = The JobScheduler can be used under the open source GPL 2.0 license. Users can also purchase commercial licenses. The JobScheduler Universal Agent can be used under a freeware license (under restriction) or commercial licenses. = Support and Services = Enterprise-level support and services are available for users with commercial licenses. Users operating JobScheduler under the open source license can obtain support from the JobScheduler Knowledge Base and the forum on SourceForge.

It ran in Philadelphia that year, unsuccessfully, and on Broadway in 1930 after the original book by George S. Kaufman was revised. The story satirizes America's taste for war: America declares war on Switzerland over a trivial trade issue. Aside from the title tune, the 1940 Judy Garland-Mickey Rooney musical film Strike Up the Band had no relation to the stage production. The overture is often performed as a stand-alone concert work. Libretto The original book by George S. Kaufman centered on Horace J. Fletcher, a Babbitt-like cheese tycoon who tries to maintain his monopoly on the American market by convincing the United States government to declare war on Switzerland. The story ended darkly. The 1930 plot by Ryskind, softened the political overtones, increased the emphasis on romance and added a happy ending. It relegated the war plot to a dream sequence. The incident that incites war concerned chocolate instead of cheese. =1927= Act 1 Workers at the Horace J. Fletcher American Cheese Company sing their daily vocal exercises (\\"Fletcher's American Cheese Choral Society\\") to start the day and greet The foreman Timothy Harper, manager C. Edgar Sloan, and owner Horace J. Fletcher. Fletcher is pleased with the President signing a new bill imposing a fifty percent tariff on imported cheese. Mrs. Draper arrives to ask Fletcher to do charitable work with her in order to get close to him. Her daughter Anne goes to meet Timothy, though her mother disapproves of the relationship (\\"17 and 21\\"). Fletcher receives news that someplace called \\"Switzerland\\" has sent a telegram protesting the tariff. Fletcher tells Sloane to send a messenger to the hotel of Colonel Holmes, the President's adviser. Mr. Fletcher's daughter Joan enters and wants him to handle James Townsend, a reporter who wrote an article calling her a snob. After she leaves, Townsend arrives to interview Fletcher about Switzerland's response to the tariff. Production During its original 1927 pre-Broadway tryouts, the political satire closed in Philadelphia, fulfilling original librettist's George S. Kaufman's definition of satire as \\"what closes on Saturday night.\\"Furia, Philip. \\"Chapter:Sweeping the Country, 1930‚Äì1933\\" Ira Gershwin: The Art of the Lyricist, Oxford University Press US, 1997, , pp. 81, 87‚Äì88Suskin, Steven. \\"'Strike Up the Band', 1927\\" Show Tunes: The Songs, Shows, and Careers of Broadway's Major Composers Oxford University Press US, 2010, , pp. 67, 69 The original is heavily influenced by Gilbert and Sullivan.Jones, Kenneth. \\"Starry Studio Recording of Strike Up the Band Is Dusted Off for Release by PS Classics\\". Playbill.com, April 5, 2011 The Gershwins revised the story with Ryskind for the 1930 Broadway run; they also removed the song The Man I Love, now a Gershwin standard, from the show. They added a dozen new songs and rewrote the lyrics or even changed the melodies of many of the 1927 songs. The new score is less Gilbert-and-Sullivan and more swing-influenced. Directed by Alexander Leftwich and choreographed by George Hale, the revised production opened on Broadway at the Times Square Theatre on January 14, 1930 and closed on June 28, 1930 after a moderately successful run of 191 performances. The cast included Dudley Clements and Blanche Ring. Score The Gershwins' first fully integrated score for a book musical was influenced by the operettas of Gilbert and Sullivan. The pit band was the Red Nichols Orchestra, which included Benny Goodman, Glenn Miller, Gene Krupa, Jimmy Dorsey, and Jack Teagarden. The overture is often performed alone as a concert work.Examples:             * The title song, \\"Strike Up the Band\\", was given to the University of California, Los Angeles by the Gershwins in 1936 as \\"Strike Up the Band for UCLA\\" and has become one of the school songs. In 1990, a studio cast recording of the original 1927 score (and some of the 1930 songs), featuring Rebecca Luker, Brent Barrett, Beth Fowler and Don Chastain, was released on the Nonesuch label. At the same time, the 1930 version was recorded with the same cast but not released.

Don Rose, using Gershwin's original score and notes, augmented the orchestration of the overture to facilitate a performance by a full symphony orchestra (which features more players than a traditional pit orchestra). This version is the one commonly performed by symphony orchestras. Luther Henderson and Sammy Nestico created arrangement for Brass ensemble.

The show's name was derived from Bryant Park in New York City, which NPR's New York studios overlook. While the Bryant Park Project (a.k.a. \\"the BPP\\") was originally a working title, the show debuted with the name intact on October 1, 2007. The show was broadcast live from 7 to 9 a.m. Eastern time, Monday through Friday and, at its height, was carried by 13 NPR member stations, mostly in small markets. The Sirius Satellite Radio station NPR Now repeated the show (on tape unless breaking news necessitated live updates) from 10 a.m. to noon Eastern, 7 to 9 a.m. Pacific. The show's host was Alison Stewart, previously of MTV News, ABC News and MSNBC, although Stewart went on maternity leave in April 2008. In her absence, the show was co-hosted by Rachel Martin, formerly the show's newscaster, and Mike Pesca, until Martin left the show on June 27, 2008 to take a position as White House correspondent for ABC News. The show's regular newscaster was Mark Garrison, although Korva Coleman often substituted from NPR's Washington bureau. The show's Executive Producer was Sharon Hoffman and the Supervising Senior Producer was Matt Martinez. On July 14, 2008, the New York Times reported that NPR would be cancelling the Bryant Park Project as of July 25, 2008. Host Alison Stewart, who was absent on maternity leave, returned to host the final week of broadcasts.  Overview  The show was meant to appeal to a younger, less-traditional NPR audience. Recurring segments include a Monday morning sports wrap-up featuring Bill Wolff (Stewart's husband and a former producer at ESPN), political news discussions with Jim VandeHei from the blog The Politico, a Tuesday section on new music releases, and frequent interviews with various musicians and performers including Tegan and Sara, Peter Bjorn and John, Jill Sobule, and The Pipettes. Daily segments included \\"The Most\\" (a segment Stewart brought from her MSNBC show of the same name, presenting and discussing the most-read, -shared and -emailed stories from various online news sources) and \\"The Ramble\\" (a brief rundown of quirky news stories, read over a music loop taken from the song \\"In One Ear and Out the Other\\" by dance music trio Fujiya and Miyagi). News headlines were read at approximately ten and forty minutes past the hour, ten minutes later than the traditional top and bottom of the hour updates. The show also had an occasional segment called \\"Make Me Care\\" in which guests had 60 seconds to argue why a subject should matter to listeners. The tone was often informal compared to the more conventional content found in other NPR newsmagazines. It was distributed online via podcast and streaming audio, and also could be heard on Sirius Satellite Radio and on select NPR stations. The show also had a frequently updated blog. On July 14, 2008 NPR announced via The New York Times that \\"their experimental weekday morning program, designed to draw a younger audience to public radio and capture listeners who had moved online, is being canceled.\\" The last broadcast of the program was on July 25, 2008. The Times called the show \\"an expensive failure ‚Äî the first-year budget was more than $2 million ‚Äî and [cancellation] comes at a time when NPR is facing the same financial constraints as other news media thanks to higher costs and a downturn in underwriting.\\"  History  Luke Burbank originally co-hosted the program with Alison Stewart. On the November 13, 2007 broadcast, Burbank announced that he was planning on leaving the show in mid-December to be closer to his daughter in Seattle. Since January 2008, Burbank has hosted the nightly talk show \\"Too Beautiful to Live\\" on KIRO, an AM news and talk station in Seattle. On his current show, Burbank has alluded to being unhappy with the early-morning hours necessary to produce a morning news show and has hinted at personality conflicts with NPR producers and executives. On the May 8, 2008 episode of the show, which featured pre-recorded birthday wishes for Burbank from various friends and family members, Burbank, in speaking about his time at the BPP, said, \\"My name is mud at NPR New York.\\" Radio stations The Bryant Park Project was carried on the following stations: *KBIA 91.3 HD 3 - Columbia, Missouri *KCPW-FM 88.3 FM - Salt Lake City, Utah *KXOT 91.7 FM - Seattle/Tacoma, Washington *WITF-FM 89.5 HD 2 - Harrisburg, Pennsylvania *WLRN-FM 91.3 HD - Miami, Florida *WPSU 91.5 HD 2 - State College, Pennsylvania *WVTF * HD 3 - Virginia: Roanoke, Lynchburg, Blacksburg, and Charlottesville *WWVT-FM 89.9 HD 2 - Roanoke, Virginia *WUKY 91.3 HD 3 - Lexington, Kentucky *WVTX 88.7 FM - Burlington, Vermont (VPR World Channel) *WXXI-FM 91.5 HD 3 - Rochester, New York *Sirius Satellite Radio Note: * = more than one frequency References External links * Bryant Park Project blog * Bryant Park Project episodes on the iTunes Music Store NPR programs 2007 radio programme debuts 2008 disestablishments in New York (state) 2008 radio programme endings ","title":"Bryant Park Project"},{"id":"13214810","text":"Debbie Dunn (born 26 March 1978) is an American sprinter, who specializes in the 400 metres.

The Goejanverwellesluis is a lock in Hekendorp, Netherlands. The 'Goejannen' - the men from the surrounding polders who went to sea - said their last farewells by this channel. According to the tradition, Wilhelmina of Prussia, wife of stadholder William V was captured here on 28 June 1787 by the Patriots from Gouda. In reality, her entourage were arrested at Bonrepas on the river Vlist, on the way to Schoonhoven near Haastrecht. Wilhelmina was at a farm overhanging the Goejanverwellesluis, where Cornelis Johan de Lange, commander of the free corps of Gouda, had been billeted. Informed of her plans by the gentleman Martinus van Toulon, former bailiff of Gouda, the Commission of Defense stopped her from driving on to Gouda that night. The princess left the very same evening after 10pm in the direction of Schoonhoven and turned back to her spouse stadholder William V at Nijmegen. This event formed the main reason for the Prussians' raid into Holland, with Frederick William II of Prussia coming to his sister Wilhelmina's aid and so making possible William's return to the Hague. This raid led to an exodus of the Patriots from the United Republic of the Seven Netherlands in 1787. A foot ferry at Goejanverwellesluis was replaced by the Wilhelmina van Pruisen Bridge in 1992.

The facilities include a theater and the Coral Springs Museum of Art, which features changing exhibits of works by nationally-recognized artists and Florida artists.  History  During a community visioning exercise in the City of Coral Springs in the early 1980s, the participants indicated that there was a need for a community center to host meetings and events, as well as serve as a hub for recreational activities. As part of a large general obligation bond issuance for parks and a public safety facility, $8 million was allocated for the community center, which was expanded to include a gymnasium, which had also been identified as a need. During the construction, many consultants and engineers worked on the facility, which was designed by Donald Singer, a local architect of international stature. Due to space limitations, a novel solution to the need for basketball courts and auditorium space was developed by combining the two. The two-court gymnasium opened directly into the theater, with portable seating used to service both. When facing south, the bleachers served as the mezzanine of the theater, when facing north as grandstands for the gymnasium. During the three-year construction, cost-overruns totaling another $1 million and several contractor bankruptcies forced many ‚Äúvalue engineering‚Äù decisions to be made, including reducing the stage and fly tower space, reducing the number of classrooms, and downgrading material specifications. The basic envelope of the building however, remained the same. The facility opened in 1989 as a division of the Parks & Recreation Department. Before a year had passed it had become evident that although the building had been designed primarily for recreation activities, the demand for cultural activities far outweighed the level of use the facility was generating. By 1990, the City Centre (as it was then called) was made into its own department separate from Parks & Recreation and theater professionals were recruited to run the facility. In 1994 the City committed funds generated from revenue bonds to fix the acoustical and space problems in the facility. At the same time, a wealthy artist was courting the City to partner in building an art museum. The two projects were a natural match and a total of $4.5 million ($1.5 million from the patron) was allocated to the project. The renovated facility reopened in 1996 and the complex was renamed The Coral Springs Center for the Arts. Coral Springs Museum of Art Opened in 1997, the focus of the Coral Springs Museum of Art is on highlighting present day, nationally-recognized artists and Florida artists who create traditional, Modern, Postmodern and digital art. Each year the museum also hosts an exhibition by members of the Coral Springs Artist Guild. Recent exhibitions have included works by Pablo Cano, Scott Draves, Clyde Butcher, William Glackens and Charles Mills. On May 9, 2015 the Coral Springs Museum of Art hosted its inaugural comic book convention, Comics Fest Coral Springs. The event featured panels on costuming, comics creation, a Quick Draw competition, and cartooning lessons, as well as vendors and an Artist Alley. Special guests included comics writer Barbara Randall Kesel, Archie Comics artist Fernando Ruiz, Charles Paul Wilson III, artist on The Stuff of Legend, DC and Marvel Comics illustrator Jos√© Delbo, Dee Fish, creator of The Wellkeeper, illustrator Manny Cartoon, and painter Silvana Delbo.

Built during the Northern Wei Dynasty, this pagoda is one of the few intact sixth-century pagodas in China and is also the earliest known Chinese brick pagoda. Most structures from that period were made of wood and have not survived, although ruins of rammed earth fortifications still exist. Background A circular- based stone-constructed Buddhist pagoda built in 523 AD during the Southern and Northern Dynasties period. It is the oldest existent stone Chinese pagoda, although wooden Chinese pagodas that existed beforehand have since been worn down and destroyed. The spread of Buddhism dramatically influenced Chinese architecture. By the sixth century, Buddhism had spread with tremendous momentum throughout China: Chinese culture was adjusting and adapting its traditions to include Buddhism worship. The Chinese transformed the rounded earthen mound of the South Asian stupa into the towering pagoda to house the sacred buried relics of Buddha at its core. Style and shape The pagoda has had a changing shape over time from its Indian Buddhist origins to its form in China. The unique many-sided shape of the Songyue Pagoda suggests that it represents an early attempt to merge the Chinese architecture of straight edges with the circular style of Buddhism from the Indian subcontinent. The perimeter of the pagoda decreases as it rises, as this is seen in Indian and Central Asian Buddhist cave temple pillars and the later round pagodas in China. The Songyue Pagoda is unique in form, being twelve-sided. The tower is 40 m (131 ft) high and built of yellowish brick held together with clay mortar. It is the oldest surviving pagoda and was built at a time when, according to records, almost all pagodas were of wood. The pagoda has a low, plain brick pedestal or base, and a very high first story characteristic of pagodas with multiple eaves, with balconies dividing the first story into two layers and doors connecting the two parts. The ornamented arch doors and decorative apses or niches are intricately carved into teapots or lions. At the base of the door pillars are carvings shaped as lotus flowers and the pillar capitals have carved pearls and lotus flowers. After the first story there are fifteen closely spaced roofs lined with eaves and small lattice windows. The pagoda features densely clustered ornamental bracked eaves in the dougong style ornamenting each story. Inside the pagoda, the wall is cylindrical with eight levels of projecting stone supports for what was probably wooden flooring originally. Beneath the pagoda is an underground series of burial rooms to preserve cultural objects buried with the dead. The inner most chamber contained Buddhist relics, transcripts of Buddhist scriptures and statues of Buddha.

The winning couple was given their own restaurant to run. For the winners of the first series the prize restaurant was in Oxfordshire, near to Blanc's own Le Manoir aux Quat' Saisons. For the second series the prize restaurant was in Marlow, Buckinghamshire. The first series aired on BBC Two on 29 August 2007 and a second series aired on 10 September 2008. The first series also had its own spin-off, The Restaurant: You're Fried! (a play on The Apprentice: You're Fired!) which aired on BBC Three after the main programme. This did not return for either of the subsequent series. The third and final series was broadcast on 29 October 2009. In the US, the show was retitled Last Restaurant Standing by BBC America. The first series aired in spring 2008, the second in spring 2009, and the third in winter 2010. In July 2010, the BBC announced that the show has officially ended. Format Nine couples with little or no restaurant experience competed in a series of challenges whilst running their own restaurants. Challenges were set by Raymond Blanc, a successful French chef who owns a number of restaurants in the UK, most notably Le Manoir aux Quat' Saisons. The couples lived together in a shared house during the eight- week series. Each week, Blanc set a task, such as to make as much profit from selling cocktails or desserts. Each couple's restaurant was visited by Blanc's \\"inspectors\\" ‚Äì restaurant industry experts David Moore and Sarah Willingham - who reported back to Blanc on the service, food and organisation of each. There was then a \\"boardroom\\" showdown in which each couple was given individual feedback. All couples were then called in together and the \\"Restaurant of the Week\\" award was presented to the couple deemed to have performed the best during the task. Blanc then named the three (or two in later episodes) poorest performing couples that would perform a further challenge. In the specific challenge, the three couples chose or were assigned helpers from amongst the other contestants. They then competed again in tasks such as selling the most meals in a cafeteria. The couple deemed to be the worst-performing were eliminated by Blanc, with the line \\"I'm closing your restaurant\\". For its first two series, The Restaurant was shown twice a week; the first being the task in which all couples took part, and the second being the challenge and subsequent elimination of one couple. In the third series, this was reduced to one episode a week. The theme music was written by Dru Masters, and other music used included \\"Waltz No. 2\\" from Shostakovich's Jazz Suite and '\\"Showtime\\" from the soundtrack to Magnolia composed by Jon Brion. Some music from the Amelie soundtrack was used the series. \\"Let's Groove Again\\" by Gonzales was used as the music for the programme's promotional trailer. History The BBC announced the production of The Restaurant in October 2006, with chef and restaurateur Raymond Blanc named as the star of the series. Blanc invested a six-figure sum of money into the programme, and was described as being \\"very excited\\" about the series. The first series began airing on 29 August 2007 and drew to a close on 17 October 2007. The series saw married couple Jeremy and Jane Hooper win the chance to set up their own restaurant, Eight at the Thatch, in the Oxfordshire town Thame, which opened in November 2007. After a period of maternity/paternity leave, Jeremy and Jane stepped down and left Eight at the Thatch, on 5 May, 2008 their brief tenure marked by reported rampant arguments and failure. On 28 January 2008 the BBC confirmed the return of the programme for a second series, which began airing on 10 September 2008. It is reported in The Aylesbury Commuter newspaper (8/5/08) that two local restaurants, The Green Dragon in Haddenham and Le Bistro in Wendover are to feature in the next series, which commenced filming 21 May 2008. The Ben Johnson at Weston On The Green, near Oxford, also features in the next series. The final episode of the second series was screened on 29 October 2008, in which finalists Michele and Russell competed against James Knight-Pacheco and Alasdair Hooper to provide a high class five- course meal to passengers on the Orient Express. The programme concluded as Raymond Blanc chose to start a new restaurant with winners Michele English and Russell Clement. A third series of The Restaurant aired on BBC2 and BBC HD in 2009 and was won by JJ Goodman and James Hopkins. The victory was surprising to some as JJ had no kitchen experience, being instead a mixologist. The BBC defended the decision stating \\"the judges liked their ability to think on their feet, their work ethic and their concept.\\" They beat runners up Christopher Hackett and Nathan Gooding in the final.

Chain conveyors consist of enclosed tracks, I-Beam, towline, power & free, and hand pushed trolleys. Industries where used A lineshaft roller conveyor moves boxed produce at a distribution center A Conveyor belt conveys papers at a newspaper print plant Roller conveyor for carton transport in the apparel industry Conveyor systems are used widespread across a range of industries due to the numerous benefits they provide. * Conveyors are able to safely transport materials from one level to another, which when done by human labor would be strenuous and expensive. * They can be installed almost anywhere, and are much safer than using a forklift or other machine to move materials. * They can move loads of all shapes, sizes and weights. Also, many have advanced safety features that help prevent accidents. * There are a variety of options available for running conveying systems, including the hydraulic, mechanical and fully automated systems, which are equipped to fit individual needs. Conveyor systems are commonly used in many industries, including the Mining, automotive, agricultural, computer, electronic, food processing, aerospace, pharmaceutical, chemical, bottling and canning, print finishing and packaging. Although a wide variety of materials can be conveyed, some of the most common include food items such as beans and nuts, bottles and cans, automotive components, scrap metal, pills and powders, wood and furniture and grain and animal feed. Many factors are important in the accurate selection of a conveyor system. It is important to know how the conveyor system will be used beforehand. Some individual areas that are helpful to consider are the required conveyor operations, such as transport, accumulation and sorting, the material sizes, weights and shapes and where the loading and pickup points need to be. Care and maintenance A conveyor system is often the lifeline to a company's ability to effectively move its product in a timely fashion. The steps that a company can take to ensure that it performs at peak capacity, include regular inspections and system audits, close monitoring of motors and reducers, keeping key parts in stock, and proper training of personnel. Increasing the service life of a conveyor system involves: choosing the right conveyor type, the right system design and paying attention to regular maintenance practices. A conveyor system that is designed properly will last a long time with proper maintenance. Here are six of the biggest problems to watch for in overhead type conveyor systems including I-beam monorails, enclosed track conveyors and power and free conveyors. Overhead conveyor systems have been used in numerous applications from shop displays, assembly lines to paint finishing plants and more. Impact and wear-resistant materials used in manufacturing Conveyor systems require materials suited to the displacement of heavy loads and the wear-resistance to hold-up over time without seizing due to deformation. Where static control is a factor, special materials designed to either dissipate or conduct electrical charges are used. Examples of conveyor handling materials include UHMW, nylon, Nylatron NSM, HDPE, Tivar, Tivar ESd, and polyurethane. Growth in various industries As far as growth is concerned the material handling and conveyor system makers are getting utmost exposure in the industries like automotive, pharmaceutical, packaging and different production plants. The portable conveyors are likewise growing fast in the construction sector and by the year 2014 the purchase rate for conveyor systems in North America, Europe and Asia is likely to grow even further. The most commonly purchased types of conveyors are line-shaft roller conveyors, chain conveyors and conveyor belts at packaging factories and industrial plants where usually product finishing and monitoring are carried. Commercial and civil sectors are increasingly implementing conveyors at airports, shopping malls, etc. Types Belt driven roller conveyor for cartons and totes. Flexible conveyor * Aero-mechanical conveyor * Automotive conveyor * Belt conveyor * Belt-driven live roller conveyor * Bucket conveyor * Chain conveyor * Chain-driven live roller conveyor * Drag conveyor * Dust-proof conveyor * Electric track vehicle system * Flexible conveyor * Gravity conveyor * Gravity skatewheel conveyor * Lineshaft roller conveyor * Motorized-drive roller conveyor * Overhead I-beam conveyor * Overland conveyor * Pharmaceutical conveyor * Plastic belt conveyor * Pneumatic conveyor * Screw or auger conveyor * Spiral conveyor * Tubular Gallery conveyor * Vertical conveyor * Vibrating conveyor * Wire mesh conveyor =Pneumatic= Every pneumatic system uses pipes or ducts called transport lines that carry a mixture of materials and a stream of air. These materials are free flowing powdery materials like cement and fly ash. Products are moved through tubes by air pressure. Pneumatic conveyors are either carrier systems or dilute-phase systems; carrier systems simply push items from one entry point to one exit point, such as the money-exchanging pneumatic tubes used at a bank drive-through window. Dilute-phase systems use push-pull pressure to guide materials through various entry and exit points. Air compressors or blowers can be used to generate the air flow. Three systems used to generate high-velocity air stream: # Suction or vacuum systems, utilizing a vacuum created in the pipeline to draw the material with the surrounding air. The system operated at a low pressure, which is practically 0.4‚Äì0.5 atm below atmosphere, and is utilized mainly in conveying light free flowing materials. # Pressure-type systems, in which a positive pressure is used to push material from one point to the next. The system is ideal for conveying material from one loading point to a number of unloading points. It operates at a pressure of 6 atm and upwards. # Combination systems, in which a suction system is used to convey material from a number of loading points and a pressure system is employed to deliver it to a number of unloading points. =Vibrating= A vibrating conveyor is a machine with a solid conveying surface which is turned up on the side to form a trough. They are used extensively in food-grade applications to convey dry bulk solids where sanitation, washdown, and low maintenance are essential. Vibrating conveyors are also suitable for harsh, very hot, dirty, or corrosive environments. They can be used to convey newly- cast metal parts which may reach upwards of . Due to the fixed nature of the conveying pans vibrating conveyors can also perform tasks such as sorting, screening, classifying and orienting parts. Vibrating conveyors have been built to convey material at angles exceeding 45¬∞ from horizontal using special pan shapes. Flat pans will convey most materials at a 5¬∞ incline from horizontal line. =Flexible= The flexible conveyor is based on a conveyor beam in aluminum or stainless steel, with low-friction slide rails guiding a plastic multi-flexing chain. Products to be conveyed travel directly on the conveyor, or on pallets/carriers. These conveyors can be worked around obstacles and keep production lines flowing. They are made at varying levels and can work in multiple environments. They are used in food packaging, case packing, and pharmaceutical industries and also in large retail stores such as Wal-Mart and Kmart. =Spiral= Like vertical conveyors, spiral conveyors raise and lower materials to different levels of a facility. In contrast, spiral conveyors are able to transport material loads in a continuous flow. A helical spiral or screw rotates within a sealed tube and the speed makes the product in the conveyor rotate with the screw. The tumbling effect provides a homogeneous mix of particles in the conveyor, which is essential when feeding pre-mixed ingredients and maintaining mixing integrity. Industries that require a higher output of materials - food and beverage, retail case packaging, pharmaceuticals - typically incorporate these conveyors into their systems over standard vertical conveyors due to their ability to facilitate high throughput. Most spiral conveyors also have a lower angle of incline or decline (11 degrees or less) to prevent sliding and tumbling during operation. =Vertical= Vertical conveyors, also commonly referred to as freight lifts and material lifts, are conveyor systems used to raise or lower materials to different levels of a facility during the handling process. Examples of these conveyors applied in the industrial assembly process include transporting materials to different floors. While similar in look to freight elevators, vertical conveyors are not equipped to transport people, only materials. Vertical lift conveyors contain two adjacent, parallel conveyors for simultaneous upward movement of adjacent surfaces of the parallel conveyors. One of the conveyors normally has spaced apart flights (pans) for transporting bulk food items. The dual conveyors rotate in opposite directions, but are operated from one gear box to ensure equal belt speed. One of the conveyors is pivotally hinged to the other conveyor for swinging the attached conveyor away from the remaining conveyor for access to the facing surfaces of the parallel conveyors. Vertical lift conveyors can be manually or automatically loaded and controlled. Almost all vertical conveyors can be systematically integrated with horizontal conveyors, since both of these conveyor systems work in tandem to create a cohesive material handling assembly line. Vertical conveyor with forks Like spiral conveyors, vertical conveyors that use forks can transport material loads in a continuous flow. With these forks the load can be taken from one horizontal conveyor and put down on another horizontal conveyor on a different level. By adding more forks, more products can be lifted at the same time. Conventional vertical conveyors must have input and output of material loads moving in the same direction. By using forks many combinations of different input- and output- levels in different directions are possible. A vertical conveyor with forks can even be used as a vertical sorter. Compared to a spiral conveyor a vertical conveyor - with or without forks - takes up less space. Vertical reciprocating conveyors (or VRC) are another type of unit handling system. Typical applications include moving unit loads between floor levels, working with multiple accumulation conveyors, and interfacing overhead conveyors line. Common material to be conveyed includes pallets, sacks, custom fixtures or product racks and more. =Motorized Drive Roller (MDR)= Motorized Drive Roller (MDR) conveyor utilize drive rollers that have a Brushless DC (BLDC) motor embedded within a conveyor roller tube. A single motorized roller tube is then mechanically linked to a small number of non- powered rollers to create a controllable zone of powered conveyor. A linear collection of these individually powered zones are arranged end to end to form a line of contiguous conveyor. The mechanical performance (torque, speed, efficiency, etc.) of drive rollers equipped with BLDC motors is right in the range of that needed for roller conveyor zones when they need to convey general use carton boxes of the size and weight seen in typical modern warehouse and distribution applications. A typical motorized roller conveyor zone can handle carton items weighing up to approximately 35 kg (75 lbs.). Because each zone can be individually controlled, this style of conveyor lends itself to network based distributed control systems and as such the technology is very often used as Zero Pressure Accumulation (ZPA) conveyor. White Paper - Selecting the Right Accumulation Conveyor The same motor technology has also been applied to higher gear reduction ratios such that pallet handling conveyors can be built with 24VDC Motorized Drive Rollers that can convey loads in the 500 kg to 1000 kg range (1000 to 2000 lbs) There are many types of conveyor systems and roller conveyor equipment manufacturers world-wide and each can offer variations to this basic concept that either increases performance (and cost) or even reduces performance (and cost). Because roller conveyor equipment can economically handle cartons that are in the physical size range of mail and on-line order shipments; roller conveyor equipment and systems that utilize this technology have been growing steadily in number over the last 20 years because of the popularity of internet based shopping. The technology has grown to the level that the Conveyor Equipment Manufacturer's Association (CEMA) has separate and distinct guidelines for its application Here are some advantages to MDR conveyor versus conventional (AC gearmotor driven) conveyor * Less noise than conventional AC gearmotor driven conveyor * Less power consumption over time compared to AC gearmotor driven conveyor and pneumatic devices * Safer for operating and maintenance personnel compared to AC gearmotor These advantages often make MDR conveyor a popular choice for conveyors in Distribution centers ,Order processing facilities, as well as general Manufacturing operations where operator ergonomics and safety are considerations. =Heavy-duty roller= Heavy-duty roller conveyors are used for moving items that weigh at least . This type of conveyor makes the handling of such heavy equipment/products easier and more time effective. Many of the heavy duty roller conveyors can move as fast as . Other types of heavy- duty roller conveyors are gravity roller conveyors, chain-driven live roller conveyors, pallet accumulation conveyors, multi-strand chain conveyors, and chain and roller transfers. Gravity roller conveyors are easy to use and are used in many different types of industries such as automotive and retail. Chain-driven live roller conveyors are used for single or bi-directional material handling. Large, heavy loads are moved by chain driven live roller conveyors. Pallet accumulation conveyors are powered through a mechanical clutch. This is used instead of individually powered and controlled sections of conveyors. Multi-strand chain conveyors are used for double-pitch roller chains. Products that cannot be moved on traditional roller conveyors can be moved by a multi-strand chain conveyor. Chain and roller conveyors are short runs of two or more strands of double-pitch chain conveyors built into a chain-driven line roller conveyor. These pop up under the load and move the load off of the conveyor.

It had a population of 141 at the 2010 census. The neighborhood consists of many old homes on large, almost rural lots now largely wooded. The English first settled the land in the 17th century. At the center of Cannondale is Cannon Crossing, a small shopping village of boutiques and restaurants made up of 19th-century buildings restored by the late actress June Havoc in the late 1970s on the east side of Cannondale Railroad Station. Both are part of Cannondale Historic District, which encompasses the central part of Cannondale and most of its significant historical buildings. The area was originally called \\"Pimpewaug\\" by the local Indians, and it was the name originally used by the colonial settlers. The Cannon family became prominent in the area, in part because of the Cannon Store, which started operating in the 1790s. In March 1852, the Danbury & Norwalk Railroad opened a station in the neighborhood, near where the tracks crossed Cannon Road, and named it Cannon Station. Soon after, Charles Cannon began a campaign to get a post office in the neighborhood, and on April 29, 1870 it became a reality in a store east of the railroad tracks (very probably in a building which also functioned as a general store and the train station). At this time, the neighborhood became known as \\"Cannon Station\\". In 1882, the U.S. Post Office changed the local office's name to \\"Cannon\\", then changed it back to Cannon Station in 1896. The similarity of \\"Cannon\\" and \\"Canaan\\", a town on the northern border of the state, caused residents to want a further adjustment in the name. In November 1915 the post office name was changed to Cannondale. The post office was closed in 1967 but the name remains, generally covering an area centered on the intersection of Danbury Road (U.S. Route 7) and Cannon Road.Wilton Historical Society, Cannondale: A Connecticut Neighborhood, 1987 In 1915, Samuel Miller, who was instrumental in the final name change, acquired a cannon which had been used in the Civil War battle of Galveston. It was placed at the intersection of Danbury and Cannon roads and toppled twice, once as a Halloween prank and another time in an automobile accident. Geography and soil Cannondale is in the east-central part of Wilton, just north of Wilton Center (Wilton's downtown area). Route 7, the Norwalk River and the train tracks (now the Danbury Line of Metro-North Railroad) all run close to each other from south-southwest to north-northeast through the neighborhood. At its widest, the neighborhood stretches from east to west and from north to south. The Norwalk River valley is above sea level in the north of Cannondale and descends to above sea level at the southern end of the neighborhood. Turner Ridge, the western border of Cannondale, rises as high as , but the ridges east of the river are high. At the far eastern side of the neighborhood are the Saugatuck River and Wilton's border with the town of Weston. According to the United States Census Bureau, Cannondale has a total area of , all land. According to Cannondale: A Connecticut Neighborhood (hereafter referred to as \\"CACN\\"), published by the Wilton Historical Society, \\"The soil that graces Cannondale [...] remains, arguably, the best in the state\\", with dark brown, sometimes red-tinted, surface soil of a type that extends from New Milford in the north down to the shore of Long Island Sound and named \\"Wilton Loam\\". Public open space In the northeast area of Cannondale is the Gregg Preserve, the Belknap preserve and the Honey Hill Preserve.Sharp, Penelope and Patricia Sesto, \\"A Walker's Guide to Wilton: A guidebook to selected open space lands and trails in Wilton\\", Wilton, Connecticut: The Wilton Conservation Commission (publisher), 2002 edition The Belknap Preserve is a tract with an entrance on Wampum Hill Road, south of its intersection with Honey Hill Road. The preserve has the Loop Trail (1.5 miles long), Cut-Across Trail (0.25 miles) and access trails (0.6 miles). The preserve was bought by the town government from the Belknap family in 1999. The preserve has woodland, open pastures, wetlands, and Mayapple Brook valley. The trails cross several old fields in different stages of reforestation. Stone walls mark off the property lines and many run across the tract. At the southwest corner of the preserve, a trail connects to the Gregg Preserve. The entrance to the Gregg Preserve is located at the cul-de-sac of Mayapple Road. One trail follows the perimeter of the property, with interior trails crossing it. Horseback riding is allowed if permission is granted by the Wilton Land Conservation Trust, which owns the property. The Connecticut chapter of The Nature Conservancy transferred ownership of the property to the Wilton Land Conservation Trust starting in 1979. Most of the land in the preserve consists of mostly open deciduous woods, with some stands of planted evergreens and some open fields. Honey Hill Road forms part of the northern boundary of the preserve, which is east of the Danbury Line railroad tracks and east of Seeley Road (which forms part of the border at the southern end of the tract). A pond just east of the railroad tracks is not part of the preserve. The Honey Hill Nature Preserve consists of about , most of it in Weston, and is entered from Wampum Hill Road. No parking area is provided, but visitors may park on Wampum Hill Road south of its intersection with Honey Hill Road. The preserve is owned by the Aspetuck Land Trust, which established it in 1968. In 1974 and 1978 the original was expanded. The parcel occupies the northern end of an oval hill, the crest of which is parallel to the north-south Wilton/Weston town line. Transportation The Cannondale station is part of the Danbury Line of Metro-North railroad. History =To the late 18th century= The Algongian name for the area was spelled in various ways by early colonists, with \\"Pimpewaug\\" being one common spelling. The area known as Pimpewaug covered a somewhat larger area than present Cannondale - from Honey Hill and the Split Rock in the north to the site of the present Wilton railroad station, and west from Drum Hill to Buckingham Ridge in the east. Many Native American arrowheads have been found in Cannondale's level meadows, and a large flat rock on the east side of the railroad tracks, south of Honey Hill Road, was purportedly a \\"Dancing Rock\\" of local Indians. By the 1720s there were no dangerous Indians in the area around Wilton, but there are reports of individual Indians in or close to Cannondale coexisting with English settlers in the early 18th century. According to one report, an Indian lived in a wigwam near the present intersection of School Road and Danbury Road, at the edge of Cannondale or just to the southwest of it. According to Captain Daniel Hurlbutt Jr. (1740‚Äì1827), he was nursed by an Indian woman as an infant near 236 Hurlbutt Street (at the southern end of Cannondale or just beyond it), until his father, fearing the woman's milk might be a negative influence on his son, stopped the practice.Russell, Robert H., Wilton, Connecticut: Three Centuries of People, Places and Progress, Wilton: Wilton Historical Society, 2004, 2007, page pp 8‚Äì9 The neighborhood, like the rest of Wilton, was originally a part of Norwalk, founded in 1651. By 1726, a separate parish was created for Wilton, allowing area residents to avoid the long trek into Norwalk for Sunday church services (and for men to travel down to Norwalk for militia drilling). Organizationally, the parish was split into a church and an \\"ecclesiastical society\\" responsible for secular matters such as levying taxes for support of the church, schools and the militia, as well as for building roads and maintaining them and cemeteries. Pimpewaug became one of the three original school districts in Wilton, all of which were formed in 1729. The location of the first schoolhouse is not known, but it may have been in the same location as the second schoolhouse, a few hundred yards south of the intersection of Danbury Road and Olmstead Hill Road. That location is just north of present-day Wilton High School and south of Allen's Meadow. Pimpewaug school met in August and September. For the rest of the year, children were employed on their families farms, which were the original and primary industry in the area until well into the 19th century. The Norwalk River supplied power for sawmills and gristmills. By 1809, Cannondale resident Thomas Cole used Norwalk River power for a machine to form wheel hubs for carriages. His brothers, Sherman and Curtis Cole, and nephews later ran the business under the name Cole, Nichols & Company. The plant was probably on the northeast and southeast corners of the intersection of Seeley and Danbury roads, with a sawmill, hub shop, blacksmith shop and a shed for trimming or stripping, where wagons, chaises and sulkies were built. In the late 19th century, the business was replaced at the site by the D&L; Lockwood wire mill. A number of homes from the colonial era survive today in Cannondale. William Belden's home at 5 Scribner Hill Road, built in 1740 near the Split Rock, is one. The building is considered \\"a splendid example of the region's colonial architecture\\" and, with its original 2¬Ω stories, four rooms on the main floor and five upstairs, is somewhat larger than was normal for the time. Belden's of land produced better harvests than that of his neighbors, and in some years they would buy grain from him. =Late 18th century to 19th century= In 1792, the Wilton Parish School Committee established nine school districts in town, with District 7 corresponding to the present-day Cannondale neighborhood. By 1795, the districts passed from control of the local Congregational society to a new Wilton School Society, independent of ties to a particular religion. Through 1830, Wilton received a state subsidy of $600 from the sale of lands in present-day Ohio, part of a \\"Fire Lands\\" settlement the state of Connecticut received to compensate residents for the burning of five towns by the British during the American Revolutionary War. The 1792 boundaries of District 7 were used by mapmakers Beers, Ellis and Soule for their 1867 Atlas of New York and Vicinity to define the section of town they called \\"Pimpewaug\\". According to CACN, the boundaries still define the neighborhood. The influence of the Cannon family, particularly Charles Cannon (1824-1892), his son George (1784-1829) and his grandson, also Charles, was so great that the central area of Pimpewaug became known as \\"Cannon's\\" or \\"Cannon\\" by the time the railroad line was built through the area and needed a name for the new station. In the late 1780s, John Cannon (1752-1802) established the Old Red Store, later known as the Cannon Store. The building survives, preserved behind a home on Danbury Road. The exact original location of the store is not known, although many believe it was at the site of a small (100-by-150-foot), oval, man-made pond on the west side of Danbury Road, just south of its intersection with Olmstead Hill Road. The water table, about below ground, is the source of the pond, which has no brooks leading in or out of it, and the digging and establishment of the store building's foundation might have led to the creation of the pond. By 1829, the store was located on the east side of Danbury Road. Although the business did well as late as the 1850s, by 1860 it no longer existed, and Charles Cannon was listed in the U.S. Census as simply a farmer with of land. Already in the period from 1849 to 1857, however, Cannon had begun other business ventures, including employing area women to sew vests, pants, shirts, coats and overalls. Eighteen Cannondale women, representing about one in four families in the neighborhood, sewed clothing for Cannon's business. They were among 303 women employed that way by Cannon over a seven-year period. In the early 1850s, Cannon became a subcontractor for the building of the Danbury & Norwalk Railroad through Pimpewaug. From March to December 1851 he employed between 51 and 86 Irishmen (and only Irishmen) each month in constructing roadbeds and laying tracks. One working man, Timothy Sullivan, was paid 75 cents per day, working six days per week throughout March, for a total of $14.44. Of that, $10 was deducted for board. The line opened in February 1852. Thomas Cannon became a town selectman and was involved with the D&L; Lockwood Company's wire mill, perhaps as its manager. The mill supplied brass and copper wire throughout much of the United States. 1872 Cannondale School building, now a restaurant In 1860, Cannondale had about 250 residents, making up 13 percent of the town's population. U.S. Census records showed that most residents were farmers, with a typical home including two parents, two children and a boarder or employee of the family, working as either a servant or farm laborer. Farms typically were about in size, and typical products from them were butter, cattle, potatoes, buckwheat, cider, oxen, horses, swine and sheep. The occupations of 106 Cannondale residents who responded to the census showed 32 were farmers, 20 farm laborer, 11 servants, 10 shoemakers, six shirt makers, six carpenters, four teachers, four blacksmiths. There were a few wealthy families and no paupers. The neighborhood had three businesses that year: A hub factory run by George and William Nichols; wagons made by Charles Cole and hoes manufactured by Charles Gregory. In 1872, a second schoolhouse was built in Cannondale to replace the first. The new schoolhouse was on the corner of Danbury and Olmstead Hill roads. By 1900, the neighborhood had become home to people of more varied occupations than farming. There were some laborers, many of whom worked at the Gilbert & Bennett wire factory in Georgetown, just to the north. In 1899 the Cannon Grange was founded with 53 members. At a meeting in a local home (within from where the present Grange building stands), members of the Norfield Grange described how their organization worked and what it did. =20th century= In 1952‚Äì1953, Zion Hill Methodist Episcopal Church at 470 Danbury Road was moved to a new location on its property with a new foundation. It was decided that the church's old horse sheds, built in 1885 and dilapidated, must be removed. One longtime church member, Bess Warncke, was fond of the sheds and said they would be removed \\"over my dead body\\". But the church decided they must go to make way for more parking. According to historian Robert Russell, \\"On the October 1952 weekend that they were removed, Bess Warncke died.\\"Russell, Robert H., Wilton, Connecticut: Three Centuries of People, Places and Progress, Wilton: Wilton Historical Society, 2004, 2007, page 427 Cannon Crossing, an restoration of a pre-Civil War village, with 19th-century buildings just across the railroad tracks from the Cannondale train station, was created by actress June Havoc, who sold the property in 1989.Klein, Alvin, \\"THEATER; June Havoc, Off Stage\\", article, The New York Times, March 5, 1995, retrieved December 29, 2008 Notes External links *Cannondale on google maps Wilton, Connecticut Neighborhoods in Connecticut Census-designated places in Fairfield County, Connecticut Census-designated places in Connecticut 1729 establishments in Connecticut ","title":"Cannondale, Connecticut"},{"id":"13215020","text":"The Roman Catholic Diocese of Molegbe () is a suffragan Latin diocese in the Ecclesiastical province of Mbandaka-Bikoro in the Democratic Republic of the Congo.

It was introduced to the market in 1993. While styled like a rangefinder camera, and intended for a similar style of photography, in specification it is more like a larger \\"point and shoot\\" camera. The Konica Hexar enjoys something of a \\"cult status\\" among film camera aficionados because of the quality of its lens, rangefinder-style ergonomics and interesting and useful operating modes (notably its \\"silent mode\\").  Lens  The camera is fitted with a 35mm fixed-focal length lens with autofocus and with a large maximum aperture of f2. The lens accepts lens filters of 46mm diameter (however, camera settings must be manually adjusted to compensate for any reduction in light transmission caused by the filter). A metal pull-out lens hood surrounds the lens. The lens on the Hexar is considered to be of high quality for this type of camera and is often compared with other high-quality lenses such as those from Leica. It is often stated that the lens is a copy of the Leica Summicron 35mm f2 lens, although this does not appear to be the case. The source of this statement may be a pair of articles by Dante Stella where he states that photos taken with the Hexar have a similar \\"look\\" to those taken with a 35mm Summicron, but notes that the lens seems more similar to a Nikon 35mm f1.8 lens design.  Viewfinder  The viewfinder uses projected parallax-corrected brightline framelines which shows the field of view to be captured when a photograph is taken. The centre of the viewfinder shows the point at which autofocus will be attempted, and a lamp in the viewfinder indicates when focus has been achieved. The viewfinder is located on the far upper left-hand side of the camera (when seen from the rear) in a position similar to that traditionally used for rangefinder cameras.  Camera body  The Hexar is similar in form to a Leica M mount camera with equivalent lens and handgrip fitted. Construction is of cast- aluminium, finished in flat black or silver (later model), with a raised plastic hand-grip. Controls are an aperture control dial with central shutter release button, power/mode selection switch and a series of six multi-function buttons located on the top right-hand side of the camera (when seen from the rear), along with a multi-function LCD display.  Film transport  The camera has a hinged, swing-open, camera back with cut-out view window to show details of the film loaded in the camera. Film loading, advance and rewind is motorised and automatic. A button to manually trigger film rewind is also provided. Film sensitivity can be detected via standard DX encoding or the ISO value can be selected manually. Film is automatically advanced to the next frame (and the shutter cocked) after each shutter activation. When the end of a film is reached (or the manual rewind button pressed), the film is wound back into the film canister, with a brief pause to allow the film to be removed \\"leader out\\" if desired.  Silent Mode  One notable feature of the Konica Hexar is its \\"silent mode\\", which can be selected by a button on the camera top plate, when powering up. This enables a slower, but much quieter, film advance, shutter cocking and autofocus. In normal operation the Hexar is very quiet. It is nearly inaudible at any distance from the camera in \\"silent\\" mode (Leica rangefinder cameras, reputed to be very quiet, are not as quiet as the Hexar when in \\"silent mode\\".) In Hexar Silver models, \\"silent mode\\" was disabled at the factory, apparently due to a dispute over intellectual property. This model can have silent mode re-enabled through a somewhat arcane set of \\"programming\\" steps that can be readily discovered through internet searches. Note that this \\"firmware change\\" is not without risk and all steps must be completed exactly correctly.  Shutter  The camera uses an electromagnetic stepper motor shutter. There is no provision for non- electronic shutter release; charged batteries are always required for shutter operation. Shutter speeds between 30 seconds and 1/250th of a second are provided.  Focus  Focus can be set with an active-infrared autofocus or by manual adjustment. In autofocus mode, a central indicator in the viewfinder shows the point the camera will attempt to focus on and a lamp in the viewfinder indicates that focus has been achieved when the shutter release is half pressed. Focus remains locked until the shutter release is pressed fully or the button released. Manual focus is initiated by a button on the top plate of the camera. Focus is adjusted by reading the focus distance from the top- mounted LCD and adjusted with the \\"+\\" and \\"-\\" buttons. A single button can be pressed to lock focus at infinity.  Exposure metering  The camera provides automatic exposure metering in aperture priority auto-exposure or programmed exposure modes (with AE lock and +/-2EV exposure compensation) or exposure can be manually set (with exposure metering still available). Light is metered through a sensor on the front of the camera body rather than using TTL metering or a sensor inside the filter ring. This means that manual camera settings (ISO value or exposure compensation) must be used to account for light reduction due to any filter fitted. Exposure modes are selected via the four-position power/mode switch as follows: * off the camera is switched off * P Program AE (auto-exposure) mode. Exposure is set by calculating the correct shutter speed for the given lighting, film sensitivity and currently-selected aperture. If the calculated shutter speed is higher than the maximum available (1/250th of a second) the aperture is closed to expose with an achievable shutter speed value. If the calculated shutter speed is lower than the \\"camera shake\\" shutter speed (default 1/30 of a second, but variable from 1/4 to 1/60) the aperture is opened to expose with that shutter speed. * A Aperture priority AE mode. Exposure is set by calculating the correct shutter speed or the given lighting, film sensitivity and currently-selected aperture. If that shutter speed is not available the photo is taken with the closest available shutter speed, but the aperture value is not varied. * M Manual exposure mode. Exposure is set by the user indicating the aperture value via the aperture dial and the shutter speed via push-buttons on the camera top plate. Half- pressing the shutter release will set the shutter speed value to the correct value as calculated by the camera's metering system, which the user can then vary. A self-timer button, also on the camera's top plate, can be used to trigger an exposure with a time delay of approximately 10 seconds (cancelable).  Electronic flash  Hexar with the original flash and lenscap attached The camera has a flash hot-shoe, and was often sold with a dedicated Konica Hx-14 flash unit. Automatic flash exposure is available when used with this HX-14 unit, in variable-aperture automatic mode when set to [P]rogram mode (useful for fill-flash), fixed-aperture automatic flash mode when set to [A] or [M] modes or manual mode when the flash is set to \\"P-full\\". Manual flash is possible with other flash units, including non-Konica units.  Additional features  Later-production examples of the Hexar supported four features not available in earlier units: * multiple exposures * AF focusing for infrared Kodak and Konica films * Guide number flash exposure using detected autofocus range * a manual exposure mode with spot metering For a time, Konica offered an upgrade to retrofit these features to earlier-model cameras. Cameras without this modification can have this upgrade applied through a set of \\"programming\\" steps which can be discovered through internet searches (a similar in concept to the steps to enable \\"silent mode\\"). As with \\"silent mode\\" enablement, this \\"firmware change\\" is not without risk and all steps must be completed exactly correctly.  Models and packaging  The original Hexar and the Hexar Silver The Konica Hexar was sold either \\"body only\\" or as a set with HX-14 flash unit. Earlier models were black and came in a \\"standard\\" model or a model supporting an autodate film back. Later- production samples of this unit supported additional features, as noted above. A Hexar Rhodium finish (metallic pinkish in color) was available as an alternative to the more standard black finish. A similar model was also marketed as Hexar Titanium in other markets. In 1993 two limited-edition versions of the Hexar were released: * Hexar Classic: \\"Classic: 1993 silver chrome finish Hexars commemorating the 120th Anniversary of Konica. Hard to find since only 2000 were made, special gray presentation box, top plate engraved \\"120 Years, Since 1873.\\"\\" This model supported auto-bracketing of exposure, a feature not found in other models (except, perhaps, the Gold Hexar below). * Hexar Gold: \\"Konica's Gold Hexar is very stylishly done with a burnished gold finish, rather than the shiny gold finish used by most gold cameras. The packaging is first rate as well, with a special red velvet lined presentation walnut embossed case. The inside case is labeled \\"Konica's 120th Anniversary.\\"\\" 500 Gold Hexars were produced. In 1997 the Hexar Silver replaced earlier models, finished in a silver color and with \\"silent mode\\" disabled at the factory, apparently due to a dispute over intellectual property. These models can have silent mode re-enabled through a somewhat arcane set of \\"programming\\" steps that can be readily discovered through internet searches.  Successors  Konica later released a rangefinder camera, the Hexar RF, with some (perhaps superficial) similarities to the Hexar camera. They also released a Leica thread mount lens in 35mm focal length (the UC Hexanon 35mm f2 in so-called L mount) that is said to be a design descendant of Hexar camera's 35mm f2 lens.  End of the company  Konica and Minolta merged to form Konica Minolta in 2003. In 2006 Sony acquired photographic assets from Konica Minolta, with the latter company withdrawing from all photography-related activity. The targets of the acquisition by Sony were the designs and tooling for Minolta/Konica Minolta SLR cameras and accessories. It is not known whether Sony acquired other photographic assets such as film camera designs or whether those are retained by Konica Minolta. Whatever the case, none of the involved companies has expressed any interest in renewed production of film cameras or digital cameras based on such designs. Konica Minolta has since announced \\"Konica Minolta ceased the entire customer services for Konica Minolta cameras and related products, as of 31 December 2010.\\" It appears that services such as downloads for camera manuals were withdrawn at roughly the time of this announcement.

Both vicariates served lands around Lake Kivu during the colonial era. The first vicariate, from 1912 to 1922, served what are now Rwanda and Burundi. The second vicariate, from 1929 to 1952, served territory in the east of the Belgian Congo. Rwanda and Burundi The missions in Burundi had been under the Apostolic Vicariate of Unyanyembe, while those of Rwanda were under the Apostolic Vicariate of Southern Victoria Nyanza. In 1912 these missions were joined to form the new Apostolic Vicariate of Kivu. On 12 December 1912, John Joseph Hirth was appointed the first Vicar Apostolic of Kivu. Hirth established his headquarters at Kabgayi, and worked there until his retirement in 1921. By then there were thirty thousand Christians in the Vicariate. The name was changed to the Apostolic Vicariate of Urundi and Kivu in 1921. On 25 April 1922 the Apostolic Vicariate of Ruanda was created from the former Apostolic Vicariate of Kivu, led by Bishop L√©on-Paul Classe. On 14 February 1952 this was divided into the Apostolic Vicariate of Kabgayi and the Apostolic Vicariate of Nyundo. The Apostolic Vicariate of Urundi was also created on 25 April 1922, serving the territory of what is now Burundi and led by Bishop Julien-Louis-Edouard-Marie Gorju. On 14 July 1949 it was renamed to the Apostolic Vicariate of Kitega, and on 10 November 1959 was elevated to the Archdiocese of Gitega. Congo The Apostolic Vicariate of Kivu was restored on 26 December 1929 serving the eastern Belgian Congo, led by Bishop Edoardo Luigi Antonio Leys. He was succeeded in 1944 by Bishop Richard Cleire. On 10 January 1952, after losing territory to the Apostolic Vicariate of Kasongo it was renamed the Apostolic Vicariate of Costermansville, led by Bishop Xavier Geeraerts. On 6 January 1954 this became the Apostolic Vicariate of Bukavu, which on 10 November 1959 was promoted to the Metropolitan Archdiocese of Bukavu.

They dwell their entire lifespan in the abdomen of the wasp. Two particular species of social wasp it has been known to infect are Polistes gallicus and Polistes dominula. Younger members of a wasp colony tend to be targeted, although X. vesparum displays parasitic behavior in all stages of this host. Polistes sp. parasitized by Xenos vesparum According to Fabio Manfredini of Pennsylvania State University, co- author of an animal behaviour study of this insect's odd life cycle, published on 8 October 2011, the parasite infects a European paper wasp and completely alters its worker caste behaviour. The infected wasp begins to suffer nutritionally, then flies to meet with other infected wasps. The male parasite, which pupated in the infected wasp, exits the wasp's abdomen as a winged insect and mates with the female parasites which stay inside their host. Wasps infected with the male parasite die. Wasps infected with the female parasite then fatten themselves up much like queen wasps do. They then fly to meet with other uninfected queen wasps. Then when the parasite is mature, the infected wasp flies to mingle with other uninfected wasps, thereby spreading brood and larvae into new environments.

The road is an old one, existing prior to the founding of Baltimore in 1729. Currently, Windsor Mill Road begins near Walbrook Junction in West Baltimore as a one-way street for several blocks, but becomes a larger two-way road at Gwynns Falls Parkway. It then proceeds as a winding road, passing two city parks: Gwynns Falls Park and Leakin Park. After passing the two parks, Windsor Mill Road runs mostly straight with few curves. The road is lined mostly with single-family houses, apartments, and small shops and shopping centers throughout its duration. Then passing Forest Park Avenue, it becomes the Baltimore County line between Kernan and Forest Park Avenues in the Woodlawn area, run by motorists in the area.

Early life  Ludwig Gatterman was born on 20 April 1860 in Goslar, an old mining town north of the Harz mountains. Two of his three siblings died at a young age. During his time in the Realschule he started experimenting. In 1880, he wanted to study at the University of Leipzig, but he had to complete his compulsory military service before he could start. He started his studies in 1881. After one year with Robert Bunsen at the University of Leipzig, he visited Liebermann for one semester at the University of Berlin to improve his skills in organic chemistry. Gattermann chose the University of G√∂ttingen, which was close to Goslar for his further studies. He started his thesis under the supervision of Hans H√ºbner, who died in 1884, and finished his Ph.D. in 1885. As successor of Hans H√ºbner, Victor Meyer came to G√∂ttingen and some renowned chemists worked as assistants in his group, which consisted of Rudolf Leuckart, Emil Knoevenagel, Traugott Sandmeyer and Karl von Auwers. His private life in Heidelberg and Freiburg was overshadowed by his problematic 25-year-long marriage which was divorced. Gattermann had one daughter who cared for him during his illness which caused his death on 20 June 1920. Career =G√∂ttingen= During his time as assistant of Victor Meyer in G√∂ttingen, Victor Meyer established a cooperation with the dyes company of Friedr. Bayer & Co., later known as Bayer AG, and especially with the chief chemist Carl Duisberg starting in 1888 and working perfectly for 32 years, which gave Gatterman an insight into industrial chemistry and provided him with access to chemical compounds produced by Bayer. =Heidelberg= He followed Victor Meyer, who succeeded Robert Bunsen, to the University of Heidelberg in 1889. Gattermann conducted the practical education of the students in the laboratory for several years, till the suicide of Victor Meyer. He stayed with the successor of Meyer, Theodor Curtius, for two further years until 1900 in Heidelberg. =Freiburg= Gattermann became professor at the University of Freiburg in 1900. He improved the educational situation and was mainly involved in organisation and teaching. The results of his personal research get sparse and most of the publications come from his PhD students. Research His dangerous analysis of the highly explosive nitrogen trichloride in 1887 showed his excellent abilities in the laboratory. His nickname \\"der Heros\\" was coined after an English article title a hero of science reporting about nitrogen trichloride. The production of boron and silicon by the reaction with magnesium yielded amorphous powders which were more reactive and easier to handle than the substances. The improved Sandmeyer reaction using metallic copper as catalyst, and the discovery of the reaction of hydrocyanic acid with an aromatic compound now called the Gatterman reaction were achieved during his time in Heidelberg. He also conducted research in inorganic chemistry. Gatterman synthesized and characterized Si2Cl6, Si3Cl8 and also the selfigniting P2H4.

History In 1993, the band released their d√©but, self-titled EP on La F√°brica Magn√©tica. After two more years of touring, they released an LP‚ÄîGo-Off. The album was also released in Brazil the following year, through Paradise Records. Next, the band flew to Chicago to record an album with Jeff Murphy at Short Order Recorder. Do the Worm was released on Roto Records in Spain in 1997, and came out in the US in 1998 on spinART Records.

Principles of European Tort Law The unification of European tort and insurance law is the most ambitious goal which the founders of the European Centre of Tort and Insurance Law, the European Group on Tort Law, pursue in cooperation with ECTIL. The broadly-based comparative research resulted in the drafting of ‚ÄúPrinciples of European Tort Law‚Äù, which provide a foundation for discussing a future harmonisation of the law of tort in the European Union. Further, the \\"Principles\\" shall form a stimulus for both academics and practitioners and could serve as a guideline for national legal systems, thereby leading to gradual legal harmonisation. Finally, the present isolated tort law regulations, which are at times themselves contradictory, require a uniform concept from the European Union. The European Group on Tort Law spent more than a decade on preparatory works for the \\"Principles\\". These studies have been published in the series \\"Principles of European Tort Law\\". The ‚ÄúPrinciples of European Tort Law‚Äù themselves have also already been released in print, accompanied by a commentary and several translations. The online version of the \\"Principles\\" in several languages can be found on the Group's website at [www.egtl.org.] Other research projects In addition to the \\"Principles\\", ECTIL has also undertaken several projects of its own. The topics range from fundamental questions, e.g. non-pecuniary or pure economic loss, to the relationship between tort law and related schemes such as liability insurance or social security, from several studies in the health- care sector to compensation for victims of terrorism. The results are published in ECTIL's series \\"Tort and Insurance Law\\". Most projects are also discussed at international conferences at various European locations. Collaboration Due to the international nature of the research undertaken by ECTIL, close bonds have been formed with both academics and practitioners whose contributions are vital to the study of the respective legal system. While ECTIL co-operates with several other European research institutions, its closest partner is the Institute for European Tort Law (ETL), founded in 2002 as a Research Unit of the Austrian Academy of Sciences and converted into an Academy Institute in 2008. Not only do both institutions share offices and library, but they also draw from their mutual network of researchers built up over the years. ECTIL and ETL have thereby established a think tank of more than 160 researchers in over 40 countries, including all jurisdictions of the European Union, as well as Norway, Switzerland, Israel, South Africa, Japan and the United States of America. Annual Conference on European Tort Law (ACET) The Annual Conference on European Tort Law (ACET) is held in Vienna every year and provides both practitioners and academics with the opportunity to learn of the most significant recent developments in tort law within Europe in each calendar year preceding the conference. Experts from all over Europe present the highlights of their contributions to the European Tort Law Yearbook, which is published after each conference. The reporters provide a comprehensive overview of the previous year's court practice and legislation in the respective jurisdictions. Furthermore, an overview of the developments in the field of EU law is provided. A comparative analysis reviews the essential aspects of all reports. In addition to those national reports, the conference features special presentations on current issues of tort law.

It was the last work that Eric Morecambe and Ernie Wise worked on together before Morecambe's death in 1984 (the comedian being in poor health at the time of filming). It was written as a pastiche of the works of various writers including Agatha Christie and Edgar Wallace, and is set in 1946‚Äîfeaturing Morecambe and Wise ostensibly as 1940s versions of themselves. The duo's move from the BBC to Thames in 1978 was a much publicised media event, and one of the main reasons for their move was to make films and move away from the format of the Morecambe & Wise Show that had proved so popular in the previous decade. The film was completed in late 1983, but not shown until after Morecambe's death the following year. It was originally made with a laughter track, but this was absent when broadcast, and again so when later released on both VHS and DVD. The film features a plot of family members dying in strange circumstances and the two leads are drawn into this when Eric's niece Kathy (Lysette Anthony) is visited by the family's lawyer, played by Fulton Mackay. It was made largely on location, produced on videotape, and was originally broadcast on ITV on 3 January 1985.

De Brulier launched his career as an actor and singer on the stage in his native country and transferred to the American stage after moving to Canada and then to the United States in 1898. In the 1900 U.S. census he was recorded as Francis G. Packer, butler, in a private household in Denver, Colorado. His first film role was a poet in The Pursuit of the Phantom in 1914. In 1915 he acted in the film Ghosts based on a play by Henrik Ibsen. Nigel De Brulier portrayed Cardinal Richelieu in the following four films, The Three Musketeers (1921), The Iron Mask (1929), The Three Musketeers (1935) and The Man in the Iron Mask (1939). De Brulier appeared with Douglas Fairbanks in The Gaucho (1927) and was also one of the few actors of the silent era who reached reasonable success in talkies, although his roles in them were quite minor. He played the wizard Shazam in the 1941 Republic serial Adventures of Captain Marvel and also acted in Charlie Chan in Egypt in 1935. He played Jokaanan, the Prophet in a silent film version of Oscar Wilde's Salome (1923). A clip of De Brulier in Salom√© was used in Before Stonewall, a film documenting the gay rights movement.. Retrieved 28 February 2008. His French-born wife, Natale Octavia de Brulier (1879-1969), was a Christian Science practitioner, and their daughter, Josephine de Brulier (b. Los Angeles, 1911), was an assistant librarian. Death De Brulier died in Los Angeles on January 30, 1948. He was interred at Grand View Memorial Park Cemetery in Glendale, California.

The current building is a restoration of a largely 19th century structure, burnt out in 1981. Killeen was built as one of a pair of castles either side of a major roadway north, the other being the extant Dunsany Castle.Dunsany, County Meath, April 1991: Carty/Lynch - The History of Killeen Castle; Mary Rose Carty, Its estate was occupied continuously by the Cusack, and then after a marriage, Plunkett, families, from 1172 to 1951. History =The Cusacks= Killeen Castle, County Meath The original structure at Killeen Castle is said to have been a Norman fortification, perhaps wooden, built for the de Lacy magnates, and held from 1172 by the Cusack family, beginning with Geoffrey de Cusack. The stone castle was built by Geoffrey de Cusack around 1181.Skryne and the Early Normans by E.Hickey 1994 p.93 The date is carved above the doorway.Cusack.Fr.P.(1981) The Cusacks of Killeen, Co. Meath. O.Cist.. Killeen Castle was the seat of the de Cusacks for over 250 years, from Geoffrey de Cusack (1172) until Lady Joan de Cusack (1441), who with her husband, Sir Christoper Plunkett, \\"caused the church to be built beside the castle.\\".Dr Beryl F.E.Moore, p.27 This chantry church is now a national monument Annals of St Mary's CSMii, p. 275 An early recorded description of the castle and its interiorCusack.Fr.P.(1981) The Cusacks of Killeen, Co. Meath. O.Cist. reads - The date is Aug 1st (the feast of St. Peter's Chains). As we approach the castle we are faced by four tall battlemented towers with five storeys of slit openings linking the curtain walls of the building. The castle is set on a slight mound. We enter by a steep wooden stairway, and find ourselves, having passed through the considerable thickness of the wall from the narrow doorway, into the Great Hall on the first floor. Rushes cover the stone flags, and besides the usual furniture, such as a trestle-table, benches and the straight-backed, carved, oaken armchair of the Lord of the Manor, we note on our left a heavy green and white curtain covering one wall of the Hall. Opposite us with its sloping stone hood is the fireplace with logs burning in the grate. The right hand wall is hung with the Lord's war harness, his morion, hunting trophies and feathered lure used in falconry. It is a costly piece with a perch and gilt borders. In such surroundings the de Cusacks, Lords of Killeen, lived, made war, and expanded their fiefdoms for 225 years until the castle passed to the Plunketts through the marriage of Lady Joan de Cusack to Christopher Plunkett of Rathregan in 1399. =The Plunketts= The first Plunkett to hold the castle, Sir Christopher, became the 1st Baron Killeen, and divided his estate between his elder two sons, the second son taking possession of sister castle, Dunsany, and later becoming the 1st Baron Dunsany. The elder branch continued as Barons of Killeen, and later Earls of Fingall. The third, Sir Thomas Fitz- Christopher Plunket, married heiress Mary Ann Cruice of Rathmore, daughter of Sir Christopher Cruice of Cruicetown, Moydorrah and Rathmore Castle - a crucifix in their honour is located on the demesne. The fourth and sixth sons founded other landed houses. Dunsoghly Castle, one of the few intact fifteenth-century castles in Ireland, was built by the family of Sir Robert Plunket, the fourth son, between 1450 and 1480. An additional title, as Baron Fingall, in the Peerage of the United Kingdom, was acquired in 1831. While the titles survived, the Killeens were the premier Catholic peers of Ireland. The castle was developed over time, and by the fifteenth century was a mid-size fortified tower house. The two branches of the original family remained close through the centuries and during the worst of the Penal Laws, the Dunsany branch, having survived transportation to Connacht under Cromwell and other difficulties, converted to the Church of Ireland, and held Killeen in trust for the elder branch, which remained Roman Catholic. Unlike some arrangements of this sort, Killeen was formally returned when the legal situation changed. The castle fell into disrepair in the late 17th century, was leased out, and was not restored until around 1779, when parts of the demesne were landscaped and some of the estate features were added. Significant reworking was carried out from 1803 to 1813 under the supervision of Francis Johnston, and in 1841, much of the castle was demolished and rebuilt (using much existing material) by The 9th Earl of Fingall, in the style of a small Windsor Castle. The two towers added have the dates 1181 and 1841 inscribed, and at the time of completion, it was said that Killeen had 365 windows. =After the Plunketts= The 12th Earl of Fingall (1896-1984), the last to hold the earldom, sold Killeen Castle and its remaining estate in 1951, to Sir Victor Sassoon. The Earl remained as manager of the stud farm established near the castle. In 1953, the Earl and Countess moved to a modern house built on the lands, and most of the house contents were sold. Sassoon died in 1961 and his heirs sold the estate on in 1963, to French art dealer and major racehorse owner, Daniel Wildenstein. The last Earl moved from the estate to Corballis on the Dunsany Estate, then The Commons. He died in 1984 and is buried at Dunsany Church. In 1978, the castle and estate were sold to advertiser Basil Brindley, who continued the stud farm operation. On 16 May 1981, the castle was burnt out in an arson attack, being left abandoned for many years. The lands and buildings were sold again in 1989. =New development= In 1989, a new development plan was proposed, and later revised, with multiple applications for permission, including the conversion of the castle into a high-end hotel, the installation of a championship standard golf course and the construction of more than one hundred units of luxury housing on the estate. With successive modifications and discussions, plans were approved, with conditions to protect parts of the demesne landscape, and estate features, including a holy well. Work began in 2005. In August 2006 it was announced that Killeen Castle would open in 2009 as a 179-room luxury golf and spa hotel under the Starwood Luxury Collection brand. However, in early 2009, Starwood withdrew from the project after plans were scaled down by developers Snowbury following a downturn in the tourism and leisure industry. Golf On 14 December 2006, after over a year of bidding, Killeen Castle was chosen as the host venue for the 2011 Solheim Cup, the first time Ireland had ever hosted this event, despite the fact that the golf course had yet to be constructed. The 18-hole championship course was designed by Jack Nicklaus and opened in 2008; it hosted the revived Ladies Irish Open on the Ladies European Tour in August 2010 and 2011 in the run up to the Solheim Cup. Dave Pelz Scoring Game School opened at Killeen Castle estate in June 2008, with a focus on the game within of the hole. Contents The demesne contains the castle itself, a substantial stable yard, a church (sometimes, incorrectly, called \\"Killeen Abbey\\"), a holy well (the \\"Lady Well\\"), a pond, a walled garden and other features. The church, dedicated to the Blessed Virgin Mary, was erected around 1425, is in the Gothic style and has an adjacent cemetery. It is preserved as a National Monument. Popular media In 1966, scenes directed by John Huston for the film Casino Royale were filmed at the castle. For the purposes of the film, the castle was named 'Castle McTarry'.

Technology Silicone Key web design The technology uses the compression molding properties of silicone rubber to create angled webbing around a switch center. On depression of the switch, the webbing uniformly deforms to produce a tactile response. When pressure is removed from the switch, the webbing returns to its neutral position with positive feedback. To make an electronic switch, a carbon or gold pill is placed on the base of the switch center which contacts onto a printed circuit board when the web has been deformed.Custom Design & Manufacturing of Silicone Rubber Keypads. Silicone Dynamics. Retrieved 2015-09-05 Alternately, instead of using a conductive pill, the switch itself can be made of a conductive elastomer such as rubber with a mixture of carbon. It is possible to vary the tactile response and travel of a key by changing the webbing design and/or the shore hardness of the silicone base material. Unusual key shapes can easily be accommodated as can key travel up to three millimeters. Tactile forces can be as high as 500 g depending on key size and shape. The snap ratio of a keypad determines the tactile feel experienced by the user. The recommended snap ratio for designers to maintain is 40%-60%; if dropped below 40% the keys will lose tactile feel but have an increased life. Loss of tactile feel means the user will not receive a ‚Äòclick‚Äô feedback during actuation. Snap ratio is calculated as the difference between the actuation force and the contact force of a switch divided by the actuation force. The actuation force is the force required to collapse the membrane of a rubber switch, and the contact force is the force required to maintain rubber-switch contact closure with a printed circuit board. Mathematically, this can be represented by: where F1 is the actuation force, and F2 is the contact force. By adding pigments to the natural silicone rubber, it is possible to create keys in various colors which can be molded together (Flowing colors) during the compression process to form a multi key keypad. Individual legends can be printed on to a key allowing full customization of the keypad for its application. Techniques have also been developed to allow for keypads to be spray painted and legends then laser etched through the paint coating. This allows individual key to be illuminated using SMT LEDs placed on the printed circuit board. Also several coating materials such as Sealplast coating can be done to ensure a smooth surface where the printed legend last longer with good feeling of touch. Laser etching is the laser controlled process of removing the top coat layer of a painted keypad (usually black in color) to reveal lighter colored layer below (usually white). The effect is to produce an enhanced backlight effect by only lighting the legends on a keypad. By combining laser etching with either Electroluminescence (EL) or LED backlighting in a range of color options it is possible to produce an interesting range of effects. Also the contact resistance can be customized based on electronics need where contact pills can be of different resistance. A general carbon pill can be of around 20 to 100 ohms, a low resistance contact pill can be up to 10 ohms. Gold or Supra- Conductive pills can be used to obtain a resistivity as low as 1 ohm. Applications Keypad with translucent rubber Common applications of silicone rubber keypads include remote controls for TV, video and HIFI units, electronic toys and games, and industrial control equipment. Industrial silicone rubber keypads such as ones produced by CTI Electronics Corporation are used in the medical, marine, or, military are typically sealed comply to specific industry standards such as NEMA or IP66 for protection against elements such as liquids or dust. Mobile phone handset manufacturers have, in recent years, been the main consumer of rubber keypads worldwide. Their involvement has led to advances in technology including the use of hard plastic key tops bonded to a rubber keypad and also the use of embossed Mylar layer to produce an enhanced tactile response. With the increased use of low- current switching in automobiles, silicone-rubber keypads are being used extensively as switch mechanisms for various buttons such as window lifts and steering wheel mounted controls. Low-resistance pills such as SC pills and gold pills, along with short-stroke metal-dome contacts, are widely used in these settings.

The case confirmed a legal right to abate relatively extreme noise and smell, provided it cannot be justified as being protected by way of an easement have arisen such as from the passing of time (an easement by prescription) or custom on the piece of land in question. The judge recited the separate law, in an obiter dictum in an old Latin maxim in the English common law, that there is no right to a view. William Aldred claimed that Thomas Benton had erected and used a pig sty too close to his house, so that the stench made his own house unbearable to live in, including the \\"stopping of wholesome air\\". Judgment The Court ruled that the smell of the sty was enough to deprive Aldred of his property and personal dignity and therefore a violation of his rights and his honor as it was stripped away from him, holding that a man has, \\"no right to maintain a structure upon his own land, which, by reason of disgusting smells, loud or unusual noises, thick smoke, noxious vapors, the jarring of machinery, or the unwarrantable collection of flies, renders the occupancy of adjoining property dangerous, intolerable, or even uncomfortable to its tenants...\\" The Court also held the following.

She was primarily utilized as a defender or a defensive holding midfielder. Hingst announced in the middle of 2011 that she would be retiring from international football with the German national team. In addition it was announced by 1. FFC Frankfurt manager Siegfried Dietrich that Hingst had left the Frankfurt club. Career = Club = Hingst had played at several local clubs at junior level. At age 15, she played for the first team of Hertha Zehlendorf in the Regionalliga, then the second-highest division in Germany. In 1996 and 1997, Hingst won the league with Zehlendorf, but they failed to win their promotion play-offs both years. At that time, Germany's head coach Tina Theune had urged her to play at Bundesliga level, if she wanted to continue her international career. Hingst joined newly promoted Bundesliga side Turbine Potsdam for the 1997‚Äì98 season. From 2001 to 2003, Potsdam was runner-up in the Bundesliga for three years in a row. Hingst won the Bundesliga title with Potsdam in 2004 and 2006, and claimed the German Cup competition from 2004 to 2006 three consecutive times. In the 2004‚Äì05 season, Potsdam also won the UEFA Women's Cup. In 2007, Hingst moved to the Swedish first division side Djurg√•rdens IF Dam, where she played for two years, finishing runner-up in the league both seasons. She returned to Germany in 2009, joining 1. FFC Frankfurt. In her third season at the club, she won the 2011 German Cup. It was announced after Germany's poor 2011 FIFA Women's World Cup campaign, that she would leave 1. FFC Frankfurt. In October 2011 she signed to Australian club Newcastle Jets. On 29 September 2012 she signed for Australian W-League side Canberra United FC. =International= Hingst made her debut for the German national team in August 1996 against the Netherlands. One year later, she won her first international title at the 1997 European Championship. The final against Italy was her only game in the starting line-up. At the 1999 FIFA Women's World Cup, Hingst was Germany's youngest player in the squad, yet she started in all matches and scored one goal in a group match. The team was eliminated in the quarter-finals. At the 2000 Summer Olympics, Hingst won bronze with the German team.

Hingst again won the European Championship in 2001, which was played on home soil in Germany. However, she was only used sparely and did not appear in the final of the tournament. Hingst was part of Germany's winning squad at the 2003 FIFA Women's World Cup, starting in all matches for Germany.

Hingst was one of the team's key players at Germany‚Äôs successful title defence at the 2007 FIFA Women's World Cup. Alongside Kerstin Stegemann, Annike Krahn and Linda Bresonik, she was part of Germany's defence which did not concede a single goal in the entire tournament. One year later, she won her third bronze medal at the 2008 Summer Olympics and she was part of the team to win Germany's seventh title at the European Championship. Hingst was also called up for Germany's 2011 FIFA Women's World Cup squad.

The district includes the late 19th century collection of buildings that comprise Tampico's central business district, among them are two apartments that the Reagan family occupied in the early 1900s. The buildings in the district went through several periods of rebuilding during the 1870s due to major fires and a tornado. The district boundaries encompass the 100 block of Main Street and exclude properties that do not date from the historic period. The historic district represents an intact commercial district representative of rural, small town Illinois. The buildings present a cohesive architectural unit; each building within is dependent on the others for its significance. The district's contributing properties are divided into two major categories \\"contributing structures\\" and \\"significant structures.\\" Both commercial buildings that the Reagans occupied second floor apartments in are listed as \\"significant.\\" The Main Street Historic District was added to the U.S. National Register of Historic Places in 1982. History Tampico, Illinois, in southeastern Whiteside County, was founded in 1858 but settlers did not arrive in earnest until 1871, partially due to the swampy nature of the terrain. After the Chicago, Burlington and Quincy Railroad constructed a line through Tampico in 1871 growth was rapid but faced a series of major setbacks. In 1872, 1874 and 1876 the village was struck by major fires which required the repeated rebuilding of the town's central business district along Main Street. A tornado destroyed about 40 buildings in 1874, adding to the headache caused by the fires. As a result of the repeated rebuilding, all buildings along Main Street built after 1876 are constructed from brick. Between 1896‚Äì1905 the Main Street district in Tampico went through a building boom. Many agriculturally oriented industries located in Tampico during this time period. The construction of the Hennepin Canal from 1899‚Äì1907 also contributed to the influx of new buildings in Tampico and during the period of construction five new buildings were added to Main Street. It was in 1906 that the family of Ronald Reagan moved into the district, occupying the apartment on the second floor of the building at 111 Main Street. They would live in other locations in Tampico, move, and eventually briefly return to the village and occupy another second floor apartment within the district. Modern Main Street (Illinois Route 172) in Tampico has fewer buildings and less density than it did during the peak of its historical significance from 1871‚Äì1920. Fires, and new construction are to blame, in part, for this situation. Despite fewer buildings, the row of commercial buildings along the east side of Main Street are illustrative of the former density of the district. Boundaries Historically, the central business district in Tampico stretched one block, the 100 block, of Main Street, which extended from Market Street on the north to the Chicago, Burlington and Quincy tracks on the south. The boundaries of the historic district mostly overlie the traditional boundaries of the central business district The district boundaries exclude properties that are not part of the historic period. In addition, the boundaries exclude residential properties. The northern boundary of the historic district, near Market Street, was drawn to include the properties at 106 and 107 S. Main while excluding a lot, vacant at the time of the district's inclusion on the National Register, and a new building. The southern border was drawn along Pig Alley and designed to exclude a non-historic grain elevator near the railroad tracks. Architecture The buildings in the Tampico Historic District all have a uniform setback, save the neo-Colonial, 1970s era bank building. All but one of the district's buildings stand two stories, contributing to a uniform architectural rhythm and harmony. Most of the district's buildings have matching cornice lines and the two frame buildings in the historic district predate the incorporation of Tampico as a village.Ward, Michael. \\"Main Street Historic District ,\\" (PDF), National Register of Historic Places Nomination Form, 1 April 1982, HAARGIS Database, Illinois Historic Preservation Agency. Retrieved 11 September 2007. Land use within the district boundaries is strictly commercial and the architecture of the buildings reflect that use.\\"Main Street Historic District,\\" Property Information Report, HAARGIS Database, Illinois Historic Preservation Agency. Retrieved 11 September 2007. The most architecturally significant structures in the district are part of an integrated, cohesive unit. Their significance is dependent upon each other, thus, the removal of any one of the buildings would reduce the integrity of the other buildings. Properties =Contributing structures= The building at 131 S. Main was built in 1873 and features an added mansard roof. The three buildings considered contributing structures, while dating from the period of historical significance for the district, have been extensively altered. In addition, all three buildings are free-standing structures and thus, not integrated into the whole of the visual harmony found in the significant structures. The three altered buildings are located at 106, 110 and 131 South Main Street. The building at 131 Main, on the east side of the street, was originally constructed in 1873 and formerly owned by the Glassburn Lumber and Feed company. The west facade of the building has been altered by the addition of a new storefront and a pseudo-Mansard roof. The structures at 106 and 110 Main are connected by a single story structure between them. 106 S. Main Street was constructed in 1873 and features a false- front with a parapet that hides its gable roof. The building formerly housed a millinery and a beauty shop and its front (east) facade has been significantly altered. At 110 S. Main Street is a 1905 two-story brick building originally used as a grocery store. The building, which has been used by the Masonic Lodge, has had part of its cornice removed and replaced by a shingled canopy. =H.C. Pitney Variety Store= The two-storefront H.C. Pitney Variety Store is attached to the older building on its south. The building known as the H.C. Pitney Variety Store consists of two store fronts, and was erected by Ray McKenzie in 1900. The H.C. Pitney Variety Store occupied the property, under various owners, from 1911 until 1920. H.C. Pitney owned the store from 1911 until 1914, when he sold it. During his first period of ownership, Pitney employed Jack Reagan, the father of 40th U.S. President Ronald Reagan, as a clerk.Berger, Marilyn. \\"Reagan had long struggle with Alzheimer's Disease,\\" The New York Times, June 5, 2004, p. 4. Retrieved 11 September 2007. The H.C. Pitney Variety Store is most notable for its upstairs tenants from 1919-1920. During this period, H.C. Pitney operated the building as the H.C. Pitney Variety Store, and the second-floor apartment was occupied by the family of 40th U.S. President Ronald Reagan. The building is part of a two-story commercial block along Main Street, and is attached to the building next to it. Of the two structures in the block the Pitney Store is the newest, the other building was built a year earlier. The two-story brick building features a metal cornice and two storefronts listed at different addressed. The first store front, at 124 Main Street is 3 bays wide and the second, at 122 Main Street, is 4 bays wide. =Ronald Reagan Birthplace= The Ronald Reagan Birthplace (center), above a restored bank building in Tampico, Illinois. The building known as the birthplace of 40th U.S. President, Ronald Reagan, was constructed in 1896 for G.W. Stauffer by Fred Harvey Seymour and later became known as the Graham Building.Birthplace of President Ronald Reagan, (Brochure), Tampico Historical Society, Tampico, Illinois. It was built in 1896 and housed a tavern from that time until 1915. On February 6, 1911 the 40th President of the United States, Ronald Reagan, was born in the apartment above the bakery/restaurant [which later became the site of the First National Bank. The Reagans would move out of the apartment and into a house on Glassburn Street in Tampico a few months after Ronald was born. Architecturally, the two-story brick building is similar to its neighboring buildings. It is brick, two stories tall, has three second-story windows and a cornice. Only the area's oldest buildings differ from the Reagan Birthplace's metal cornices and flat-headed windows. The building's first-floor interior has been restored as the First National Bank, which occupied the property from 1919‚Äì1931. On the second floor the apartment has been restored to the period when Reagan was born. The site offers tours to the public and is listed as a \\"significant\\" contributing property to the historic district. =Significant structures= The structures at 113 and 115 Main were built simultaneously. 115 Main has been a funeral home since 1903. The contributing properties in the Main Street Historic District are classified into two categories, \\"significant\\" and \\"contributing\\". Significant structures are those with architectural or historical distinction, 10 of the 14 buildings remaining within the district are classified as significant. The significant structures are grouped into two sets, one consists of the buildings from 107‚Äì119 Main Street (along the east side of the street) and the second of buildings from 122‚Äì126 Main Street (west side of street). The first group of significant structures are along the east side of Main Street and addressed from 107‚Äì119. 107 S. Main Street was constructed for Susie Slippell in 1903 and once housed a harness shop. The next building, 109 Main, was built in 1898 by J.J Blietz, it held the Elmdorf Grocery and Meat Market. The building adjacent the former meat market is the Ronald Reagan Birthplace. 113 and 115 Main were built simultaneously in 1900, and share a wall. 113 Main is the current home to the Ronald Reagan Gift Shop and was originally constructed by Fred Seymour for use as the Seymour Grocery Store. The building at 115 was built for M.R. Lyon and has been in use as a funeral home since 1903. The buildings at 117 and 119 S. Main Street were constructed in 1877 following the last major fire in downtown Tampico. The structures at 117 and 119 are the oldest brick buildings in the historic district and were built in 1877 following the last major fire. 117 Main, built for J.C. Paice, has housed a grocery store, meat market, and variety store, and retains its original cast iron storefront. The building at 119 Main was erected for Ruben Davis. It was damaged by fire in 1980 but has since been repaired. The second group of significant structures are found on the west side of Main Street from 122‚Äì126. The two storefronts at 122 and 124 Main are the H.C. Pitney Variety Store. The adjacent structure was built in 1899 for A.J. Glassburn, son of town founder John Glassburn. The building housed the Tampico State Bank from 1899‚Äì1931 with A.J. Glassburn as its president. Glassburn also served as mayor of Tampico during three periods, 1882‚Äì1885, 1887‚Äì1893, and 1901‚Äì1902. After 1931 the building housed another bank and a lumber and hardware store. Significance The Main Street Historic District in Tampico, Illinois is most significant in two areas. First, the district represents an intact example of a central commercial district in a rural Illinois town. Second, the birthplace of the 40th President of the United States, Ronald Reagan, is located within the district's boundaries. These reasons contributed to the historic district's listing on the U.S. National Register of Historic Places on 3 June 1982.

Early career  He competed in the 250cc All-Japan Road Racing Championship from 1991 to 1996. In 1993 he was signed by Suzuki who were entering the Championship for the first time with the RGV250. Numata took the machine to its first victory at Round 9 of the championship. He went on to give Suzuki its first ever 250cc national title in 1995, beating Honda‚Äôs Tohru Ukawa, and repeated the feat again the following year beating future 250cc World Champion Daijiro Kato.  Grand Prix Career  He got a wild card ride in both the 1995 and 1996 Japanese Grand Prix and while a non-finisher in 1995, rode an impressive race in 1996 to finish 2nd behind then 250cc World Champion Max Biaggi. Numata then competed for two years in the 250cc World Championships with Suzuki. However, the machine received little development as the factory were concentrating on their 500cc effort. Numata finished 1997 in 12th position, and 1998 in 16th but in each case he finished well ahead of his team-mates on similar machinery. In 1999, Numata had a one-off ride on the Muz 500 as a replacement rider for Luca Cadalora in the 500cc class, finishing 13th in the race.

It indicates a printer error that requires further investigation to diagnose, but not necessarily that it is on fire.  Printer flammability  In the late 1950s, high speed computerized printing was still a somewhat experimental field. The first documented fire-starting printer was a Stromberg-Carlson 5000 xerographic printer (similar to a modern laser printer, but with a CRT as the light source instead of a laser), installed around 1959 at the Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory and modified with an extended fusing oven to achieve a print speed of one page per second. In the event of a printing stall, and occasionally during normal operation, the fusing oven would heat paper to combustion. This fire risk was aggravated by the fact that if the printer continued to operate, it would essentially stoke the oven with fresh paper at high speed. However there is no evidence of the \\"lp0 on fire\\" message appearing in any software of the time. As the technology matured, most large printer installations were drum printers, a type of impact printer which could print an entire line of text at once through the use of a high speed rotary printing drum. It was thought that in the event of a severe jam, the friction of paper against the drum could ignite either the paper itself, or, in a dirty machine, the accumulated paper and ink dust in the mechanism. Whether this ever happened is not known; there are no reports of friction-related printer fires. The line printer employed a series of status codes, specifically ready, online, and check. If the online status was set to \\"off\\" and the check status was set to \\"on,\\" the operating system would interpret this as the printer running out of paper. However, if the online code was set to \\"on\\" and the check code was also set to \\"on\\", it meant that the printer still had paper, but was suffering an error (and may still be attempting to run). Due to the potentially hazardous conditions which could arise in early line printers, Unix displayed the message \\"on fire\\" to motivate any system operator viewing the message to go and check on the line printer immediately. In the early 1980s, Xerox created a prototype laser printer engine and provided units to various computer companies. To fuse the toner, the paper path passed a glowing wire. If paper jammed anywhere in the path, the sheet in the fuser caught fire. The prototype UNIX driver reported paper jams as \\"on fire.\\" Later print engine models used a hot drum in place of the wire.  Phrase origins  Michael K. Johnson (\\"mkj\\" of Red Hat and Fedora fame) wrote the first Linux version of this error message in 1992, however he as well as Herbert Rosmanith and Alan Cox (all Linux developers) have acknowledged that the phrase existed in Unix in different forms prior to his Linux printer implementation. Since then, the lp printer code has spread across all sorts of POSIX-compliant operating systems, which often still retain this legacy message. Modern printer drivers and support have improved and hidden low-level error messages from users, so most Unix/Linux users today have never seen the \\"on fire\\" message. However, a few people still run into it today with varying levels of amusement or confusion. The \\"on fire\\" message remains in the Linux source code as of version 5.6.7. The message is also present in other software modules, often to humorous effect. For example, in some kernels' CPU code, a CPU thermal failure could result in the message \\"CPU#0: Possible thermal failure (CPU on fire ?)\\" and similar humor can be found in the phrase halt and catch fire.

Song  The track was written about Jenny Boyd, sister of Pattie Boyd, in the throes of a heroin overdose, shortly before they went with The Beatles to Rishikesh. She married Mick Fleetwood and was, at one time, the sister-in-law of George Harrison and, later, Eric Clapton. The song features a wind section with oboe, flute, and bassoon.

The tradition includes a selection of received myths concerning the origin and organization of the universe. Their belief system may be described as a polytheistic religion containing a very strong element of spirituality based on an epistemology of mysticism.  Muisca religion  = Creation of the universe = Bachu√© (\\"the Grandmother\\") is a non-material principle of creation, the will, the thought and the imagination of all the things to come. She is a similar concept to the principle of tao in the Chinese mythology. The time of unquyquie nxie (\\"the first thought\\") is the time of the cosmic origin, when the thoughts of Bachu√© became actions. This is the time when Bachu√© created the builders of the universe and ordered them to create. = Beginning of the world = The world started with Chimi (\\"the pulp\\"), the first material object in the world. Then, in the inners of tomsa, were incubated the embryos of stars, embryos of land and embryos of stone. When tomsa was full, the seeds of the earth emerged and the remains were thrown away, forming the Milky Way. The elements were distributed to the deities: the heat to Su√© ‚Äì the sun, the cold to Ch√≠a ‚Äì the Moon, and the clouds and smoke to the Earth, but all the things were still seeds and nothing was germinated. Then, Mnya, gold, energy, was united with Chimi, the pulp, and became Ch√≠mini, the creative force, which caused the germination of the seeds of all things. = Origin of mankind = According to Muisca legends, mankind was originated in Lake Iguaque, when mother goddess Bachu√© came out from the lake with a boy in her arms. When the boy grew, they populated the earth. They are considered the ancestors of the human race. finally, they disappeared unto the lake in the shape of snakes. = Great flood = Due to transgressions against the divine laws, Chibchacum brought forth a flood that covered the world and nearly destroyed the human race. Then, the protective god Bochica drove away the waters through the Tequendama Falls, and taught humans the basis of civilization, agriculture, religion, the arts, and crafts. When he was about to leave to his heavenly kingdom, Cuchavira (the rainbow) appeared and Bochica announced his second coming, far away in the future, in an event marked by death and disease. These events are similar to the biblical histories of Genesis and Apocalypse. = Deities = The first gods, constructors of the universe, built the first cuca or ceremonial temple. They were: * Bachu√© (\\"The one with the naked breasts\\"): the mother goddess who raised from the underworld to give birth to the human race * Bochica (\\"The father of civilization\\") also called Nemqueteba, Nemquereteba, Sadigua, Chimizapagua * Ch√≠a: the Moon goddess of the Muisca * Chibchacum (\\"The one who holds the earth\\"): the universal legislator * Chiminigagua: trinity deity, constituted by Ch√≠, Ch√≠mini and Chiminigagua * Cuchavira: god of the rainbow * Cuza (\\"The one who is like the night\\"): the male principle of creation * Huitaca: rebelling goddess of sexual liberation * Nencatacoa (\\"The protector of festivities, beer, and the arts\\") The gods danced a very long dance (sas quyhynuca), with the music of the fo drum, in the first ceremony. This ceremony gave origin to space and time. Then, the gods created the first materials of the universe: fiva (the air), faova (the cosmic cloud) and ie (the smoke). Then, they created the six directions of the material dimension, and in the middle of itugue, the emptiness, they created the centre of power tomsa (bellybutton of the universe). But, still the universe had no consistence, and they waited many bxogonoas aeons until the sas bequia, the beginning of the world.

Founded in the early 1900s, the El Dorado mine underwent a gradual transformation in the latter half of the 20th century into an informational mine and tour destination. The El Dorado Gold Mine is owned by Alaska Riverways, Inc., and is located 10 miles north of Fairbanks on the Elliot Highway. History The El Dorado Gold Mine began as a placer mining claim operated by the \\"Swede Brothers\\" of Fairbanks in the early 1900s. As records of the era were spotty and often poorly kept, the mine's exact ownership history for much of the first half of the century is unclear, though it is known that the mine changed hands several times. The mid-20th century was a turbulent period for the El Dorado mine, as gold mining was halted by order of President Franklin D. Roosevelt during World War II, and individual mining claims were hamstrung by the government's imposition of a fixed price for gold. Small claims became less and less profitable to mine, and operations at the El Dorado mine ground virtually to a halt. The mine was eventually purchased by Andrew Wescott, a Fairbanks gold miner, in the late 20th century. Wescott, realizing that the profitable days of solo mining in interior Alaska had passed, began to rebuild the El Dorado mine as an informational tour destination for Alaska visitors. The mine eventually became such a popular stop for tourists that Wescott could not handle the increased business by himself, so in 1990 Wescott entered a partnership with the Binkley family of Fairbanks in order to better develop the mine. A few years later, Wescott sold his stake in the mine to the Binkleys. The mine operates from May to September, offering tours of the mines and train tours several times per day.

In the 1950s she was reacquired once again by the Navy and reclassified, serving as USS James O'Hara (T-AP-179) until her final decommissioning. The ship was laid down for the Army under Maritime Commission contract by Seattle-Tacoma Shipbuilding Corporation, Tacoma, Washington, 16 June 1941; launched 30 December 1941; and delivered to the Army 30 November 1942. World War II From December 1942 to April 1943, James O'Hara served as an Army transport, steaming from the West Coast to Australia, thence via the Panama Canal to New York. Arriving New York early in April 1943. she was acquired by the Navy 15 April and commissioned 26 April, Comdr. Charles Allen in command. =Mediterranean Theatre= After shakedown, James O'Hara departed Norfolk, Virginia early in June for duty with the 8th Fleet in the Mediterranean. Arriving Oran, Algeria, 22 June, she prepared for the forthcoming invasion of Sicily. Invasion of Sicily Carrying troops of the 45th Infantry Division, she departed 5 July for Operation Husky, and, as part of CENT Force under Rear Admiral A. G. Kirk, she closed the Sicilian shore off Scoglitti 10 July. Despite heavy seas and an enemy air attack, she debarked her troops as Allied forces sought to wrestle the strategic island from Axis control. During almost the next 2 months James O'Hara shuttled troops from North Africa to Sicily; then she prepared to take part in the Allied invasion of Italy. Invasion of Italy Assigned to Rear Admiral J. L. Hall's Southern Attack Force, she departed Oran 5 September and approached the Gulf of Salerno late 8 September as the Allies announced the armistice with Italy. During mid-watch, 9 September, she debarked assault troops in landing boats, and later began unloading cargo. Her boats assisted HMS Abercrombie, damaged by a German mine. Undaunted by German air attacks, the veteran transport discharged cargo at the Paestrum beaches before departing for Oran 11 September. As Allied forces secured Salerno, entered Naples, and began the hard-fought drive up the boot of Italy, she continued to transport reinforcements and cargo from North Africa to Italy. On 30 November she departed Oran in convoy for the United Kingdom; and, with almost 2,000 troops embarked, she arrived Belfast, Northern Ireland, 9 December Departing for the United States 20 December, she reached New York 31 December. =Pacific Theatre= Sailing for Norfolk 15 February 1944, James O'Hara embarked marines and loaded cargo before departing for the Pacific 26 February. She arrived Pearl Harbor 16 March and during the next 2 months practiced for the forthcoming invasion of the Marianas. Invasion of Saipan As part of Vice Admiral R. K. Turner's Northern Attack Force, she departed Pearl Harbor 29 May; touched at Eniwetok; and carrying troops of the 4th Marine Division, arrived off Saipan in the early hours of 15 June. She debarked her troops in the initial assault waves, then discharged cargo as bitter fighting raged on shore. After embarking casualties and enemy prisoners, she departed 17 June and cruised northeast of Saipan while Vice Admiral Marc Mitscher's Fast Carrier Task Force defeated Admiral Ozawa's Mobile Fleet in the Battle of the Philippine Sea, the greatest carrier battle of the war. Following the resounding American victory, James O'Hara returned to Saipan 23 June; completed unloading cargo; and departed 24 June for Eniwetok and Pearl Harbor. Invasion of the Palaus Following additional amphibious training, James O'Hara departed in convoy 12 August and reached Guadalcanal the 24th. On 8 September she sailed for the Palau invasion, aimed at securing air bases prior to the scheduled invasion of the Philippines. She closed the Palaus 15 September, and 2 days later, debarked troops during the amphibious assault against Angaur Island. She remained off the Palaus until 23 September when she sailed for the Admiralties, arriving Manus 27 September. Invasion of Leyte At Manus, James O'Hara embarked troops of the 1st Cavalry Division and departed in convoy 12 October for the invasion of Leyte. Assigned to the Northern Attack Force, she entered Leyte Gulf 20 October, closed about 7 miles off San Ricardo and debarked five waves of assault troops. After unloading 476 tons of combat cargo, she sailed that evening for the Palaus and arrived Kossol Passage the 23rd. She embarked survivors of escort carriers Gambier Bay and St. Lo, sunk while gallantly defending the Leyte beachhead in the Battle off Samar, and from 28 to 31 October carried them to Guam. After returning to Manus 15 November, between 17 and 29 November she transported reinforcements to Leyte and sailed to Hollandia, New Guinea, to prepare for the invasion of Luzon. Invasion of Luzon As part of Vice Admiral D. E. Barbey's San Fabian Attack Force, James O'Hara departed Sansapor, New Guinea, 30 December with troops of the 6th Infantry Division embarked. Steaming via Leyte Gulf and Surigao and Mindoro Strait, she entered Lingayen Gulf 9 January 1945 and boated assault troops and cargo during amphibious landings which spearheaded the liberation of Luzon. Departing the same day, she steamed via Leyte and Ulithi to Guam where she arrived 6 February to stage for the amphibious invasion of Iwo Jima. Invasion of Iwo Jima Carrying men of the 3rd Marine Division, the attack transport departed Guam 17 February and arrived off Iwo Jima the 19th. Until 27 February she operated in the retirement area; then during the next week she debarked reinforcements, unloaded cargo, and embarked casualties. On 5 March she sailed for Guam where she arrived 8 March to debark more than 400 casualties of the bitter fighting on Iwo Jima. From 9 to 27 March, James O'Hara sailed via the Solomons and the New Hebrides to New Caledonia where, during the next month, she practiced amphibious attacks. Between 3 May and 15 July she transported men and supplies from New Caledonia and New Guinea to the Philippines. After loading cargo at Guiuan, Samar, she sailed for the United States 18 July and reached San Francisco 4 August. =After hostilities= After the cessation of hostilities, the veteran transport departed 25 August and carried troops via Eniwetok to the Philippines. Arriving Manila Bay, Luzon, 17 September, she operated along the Luzon coast until 1 October when she departed Lingayen Gulf for Japan. Steaming in convoy, she reached Wakayama, Honsh≈´, 7 October and debarked occupation troops. She departed Nagoya, Honsh≈´, 28 October, embarked returning veterans at Tinian 3 November; and sailed for San Francisco 5 November. After arriving 17 November, between 22 December and 4 February 1946 she made another Operation Magic Carpet run to Saipan and back to the West Coast. =Decommission and return to the Army= USNS James O'Hara USS James O'Hara decommissioned at San Francisco 5 April 1946 and was transferred to the Army the same day. During the next 4 years she served out of Seattle, Washington as a transport with the Army Transportation Corps, under the name USNS James O'Hara. Korean War Reacquired by the Navy 1 March 1950, she was reclassified T-AP-179 on 28 April and assigned to MSTS. During the struggle to repulse Communist aggression in South Korea, James O'Hara transported troops and supplies from the West Coast to the Far East. Operating primarily out of Seattle, between October 1950 and July 1954 she made 18 deployments to ports in Japan and South Korea. In addition she supplied American bases in the Marshalls and the Marianas, and she made numerous troop training and rotation runs to bases in Alaska. =Final decommission= She continued this pattern of deployment and readiness operations until 30 November 1959 when she arrived Seattle for inactivation. She entered the National Defense Reserve Fleet in Puget Sound 14 January 1960. Transferred to the Maritime Administration in November, her name was struck from the Navy List 1 July 1961, and she was berthed at Olympia, Washington.

After sharp fighting the numerically superior Finnish forces liberated Gogland and Bolshoy Tyuters, and later provided support for German forces defending Bolshoy Tyuters against Soviet counterattacks. Background In April 1938, the Soviets contacted the Finns, stating that they didn't trust Nazi Germany and wanted guarantees that Finland would not be used for the German attack on the USSR. In March 1939, the Soviets asked Finland to lease Suursaari and four small uninhabited islets for thirty years, and cede rich and heavily populated areas on the Karelian isthmus, saying that they were vital for the defense of Leningrad, the second biggest Soviet city. In return, the Soviet Union offered a large slice of empty and unofficially disputed Karelian borderland in exchange. The Finns refused. Soviet forces had occupied Gogland during the Winter War, and, under the terms of the Moscow Peace Treaty, Finland was forced to cede the island to the Soviet Union. As Operation Barbarossa commenced, the Soviets placed a garrison on the island; however, as invading German forces on the mainland moved closer to Leningrad, the Soviet command ordered the evacuation of most of the islands in the Gulf of Finland, as well as their besieged base at Hanko on the Finnish coast. Soviet forces left the islands of Gogland, Sommers and Bolshoy Tyuters on 7‚Äì9 December 1941. Finnish coastal forces noticed that the islands had been abandoned, and manned both Gogland and Sommers with small garrisons by December 12. Poor ice conditions and harsh weather made it difficult for the Finns to reinforce the garrisons, and when Soviet forces returned in company strength on January 2, 1942, the surprised Finns had to withdraw from Gogland. Capture of Gogland Determined to retake Gogland, the Finns concentrated a three battalion strong force to the nearby Haapasaaret Islands, which are roughly 20 km NNE of Gogland. Finnish forces were under command of Major General Aaro Pajari and consisted of the second battalion of the 6th Infantry Regiment, or II/JR 6, and the first battalion of the 27th Infantry Regiment, or I/JR 27, and the whole of the 2nd Coastal Battalion (RP 2) supported by the mortar and anti-tank gun companies of the 6th Infantry Regiment, 3rd company of the 23rd Engineer Battalion, 1st Battalion of the 19th Field Artillery Regiment (total of 12 guns), and two artillery batteries (total of 8 guns). The strength of the Soviet garrison was roughly 500 men but it lacked artillery, which meant that the garrison had to fight without support, while the Finns had artillery and air support. Prior to the attack Finnish forces opened two roads over the ice to the island's vicinity. Assault troops rode in trucks as far as they could, then, in the pre-dawn hours of March 27, traveled the last five kilometers over the packed ice on skis. Finnish forces were split into two groups: Detachment Sotisaari, containing the bulk of the forces, which approached the island from the west, and the three company strong Detachment Miettinen, which was to pin down Soviet defenders on the eastern side of the island. The Finnish plan called for the regular infantry battalions to spearhead the assault, with coastal troops held in reserve. At 04:00 on 27 March 1942 Finnish artillery began bombarding known Soviet strongpoints on Gogland. II/JR 6 reached the island without meeting opposition; I/JR 27, however, met determined resistance as it neared its planned entry point, and quickly switched to the same route used by the other battalion. Finnish forces successfully overcame most of the Soviet defenders and captured key locations on the island. Fatigue from the long march to the island, enemy resistance, and difficult terrain forced the Finns to halt their assault at 22:00, at which time the only remaining Soviet strongpoints were in the extreme southern and northern tips of the island. During the night some of the Soviet forces still on the island chose to flee over the ice. The Finns resumed clearing the island the next morning. In many cases, defending Soviet forces refused to surrender and put up very stiff resistance, forcing the Finns to use satchel charges on Soviet positions. The last remaining Soviet strongpoints were taken on the morning of 29 March. Small numbers of Soviet troops escaped over the ice towards Moshchny Island (), though the fleeing men suffered losses from repeated strafing runs by Finnish Air Force fighters. Air activity was high on both sides. On March 27‚Äì28 Finnish Air Force Fokker D.XXI, Curtiss P-36 Hawk and Brewster F2A Buffalo fighters claimed a total of 27 Soviet Polikarpov I-153 and Polikarpov I-16 fighters. Air forces on both sides supported their ground forces with strafing and bombing runs, the Finns using twin engined Bristol Blenheim and Tupolev SB-2 bombers. Capture of Bolshoy Tyuters On March 30, 1942, with Gogland secured, the Finns sent a small patrol to investigate Bolshoy Tyuters. A strong Soviet garrison forced the patrol to depart. A stronger force was sent to capture the island on April 1, and by the time the company-sized force reached the island the Russians had abandoned it. On the following day the Russians returned, and despite Finnish resistance, managed to create strongpoints on the island. With German support, Finnish troops eventually managed to destroy or drive off the remaining Soviets. Aftermath On April 8, 1942, after the Germans had transported artillery to the Bolshoy Tyuters, the Soviets launched another attack. The assault force was estimated to have been roughly 1,200 men strong, but the heavy German artillery on the island and lack of cover on the frozen Gulf of Finland caused heavy casualties among the Soviets. After the attack had been repulsed the Finns left the island to the Germans, who occupied it until they evacuated Estonia in 1944. Though the operation to capture Gogland had succeeded, the overall goal of capturing all the main islands in the Eastern Gulf of Finland failed, as the German forces needed for the operation were required to defend against Soviet counter-offensives on the Leningrad Front.

On September 28, 1974, Kunkel was the first base umpire when Nolan Ryan pitched the third of his record seven no-hitters. On September 28, 1975, exactly one year later, Kunkel was behind the plate when four Oakland Athletics pitchers‚ÄîVida Blue, Glenn Abbott, Paul Lindblad and Rollie Fingers‚Äîcombined to no-hit the California Angels, 5‚Äì0.Coberly, p. 172. On September 30, 1980, Kunkel caught pitcher Rick Honeycutt of the Seattle Mariners using a thumb tack to illegally alter baseballs during a game against the Kansas City Royals. Kunkel ejected both Honeycutt and Seattle manager Maury Wills. On April 25, 1981, Kunkel was the crew chief when Seattle manager Maury Wills had the batter's boxes drawn at a larger-than-regulation size prior to a game at the Kingdome, which was detected by opposing manager Billy Martin of the Oakland Athletics. Kunkel ordered the boxes redrawn by the grounds crew, and Wills was later fined and suspended. Death Kunkel died in May 1985 of cancer at age 48 in Red Bank, New Jersey. During his battle with cancer, Kunkel was featured in Safe at Home, a 10-minute film released by the American Cancer Society. Regarding his recovery, Kunkel stated that \\"I'm living proof that there's life after cancer. ... My problem never enters my mind until someone brings it up.\\" =Legacy= Kunkel's uniform number 9, assigned when the American League adopted umpire numbers in 1980, was retired after his death until the umpiring staffs were unified in 2000, when it was assigned to Brian Gorman. At the time of his death, Kunkel was one of only two umpires still using the outside chest protector, Jerry Neudecker being the other. Kunkel was the last MLB player who later became a major league umpire. In addition to his son Jeff Kunkel playing in MLB; son Kevin Kunkel, and grandson Jeff Kunkel,MLB bio both had minor league playing careers. Father- and-son Bill and Jeff were featured on a Topps baseball card in 1985. There is a park named in Kunkel's honor in the Leonardo section of Middletown Township, New Jersey, where he had been a longtime resident.

The current President & Chief Executive Officer is Bill Kottmann, active since January 2017 replacing long-time President & CEO Pamela Meyer Davis who began her position in 1988. Edward serves the residents of Chicago's west and southwest suburbs, including Naperville, Aurora, Bolingbrook, Channahon, Crest Hill, Downers Grove, Glen Ellyn, Homer Glen, Joliet, Lemont, Lisle, Lockport, Minooka, Montgomery, North Aurora, Oswego, Plainfield, Romeoville, Shorewood, Sugar Grove, Warrenville, Wheaton, Winfield, Woodridge, and Yorkville. The main campus is located at 801 S. Washington Street, Naperville, IL. History =Edward Sanitorium= Founded by Eudora Hull Gaylord Spalding in 1907 as a memorial to her husband Edward Gaylord, the Edward Sanitorium was one of the first treatment centers for tuberculosis in the Great Lakes region and became a model for other such centers in the nation. In 1920, a fire destroyed the Sanitorium's main building. A new, fireproof structure was built at the cost of $150,000. The Sanitorium flourished in the 1930s, thanks in part to the support of Joy Morton, the owner of the Morton Salt Company and the founder of The Morton Arboretum in Lisle, Illinois. As the tuberculosis epidemic subsided, Edward turned its attention to other more urgent community health needs. =Edward Hospital, 1955‚Äì1987= On October 1, 1955, Edward Sanitorium officially reopened its doors as Edward Hospital, an acute care facility with 45 beds. The hospital's first patient was 23-month-old Frederich Maurer, Jr., who was brought in after he was kicked by a horse. Edward became a public, tax-supported entity in 1959. As the Naperville, Illinois community grew, Edward expanded, adding patient care units and providing patients with more advanced technology. In 1962, the hospital expanded to 110 beds with state-of- the-art all-electric beds, a nurse call communication system and piped-in oxygen. Just five years later, in 1967, Edward grew to 133 beds with a $620,000 addition to the main building. By 1981, Edward had 162 patient beds and 125 physicians. Eugene Morris, president of the hospital since 1959, retired. In the following years, Edward turned down merger, acquisition and management offers from competing Chicago area hospitals and remained independent. In 1984, Edward became a private, non-profit organization. =Edward Hospital, 1988‚Äìtoday= In 1988, the arrival of Pamela Meyer (now Pam Davis) as president and chief executive officer marked the beginning of an era of dramatic and continuous growth and innovation at Edward Hospital. Since then, Edward Hospital evolved into Edward Health Services Corporation in the 1990s and, now, Edward Hospital & Health Services. The first major move under Davis was the opening of Edward Health & Fitness Center on the Naperville campus, the first medically based fitness center in DuPage County, Illinois. (A second Edward Health & Fitness Center, in Woodridge, opened in 1997.) In 1990, Edward introduced a comprehensive cardiac medicine program, offering open heart surgery, diagnostic services and cardiac rehabilitation. The state's first freestanding outpatient heart center, the Edward Cardiovascular Institute, opened in 1993 and in 1998, Edward became the first healthcare facility in DuPage County to screen people for heart disease using Electron Beam CT calcium scoring (Ultra Fast Heart Scan). The 1990s also saw the opening of the Edward Cancer Center, expansion of the emergency department, opening of Edward Healthcare Centers in Bolingbrook, Illinois and Naperville, the acquisition of Linden Oaks Hospital (a full-service behavioral health facility) and the opening of the Center for Surgery in Naperville. In addition, in 1992, Edward became the first hospital in Illinois to offer all private patient rooms, one of many innovations in patient care and customer service for which Edward has become known. Others include animal assisted therapy, healing arts, concierge service and valet parking. Modern Healthcare magazine recognized the spectacular growth in 1998 by naming Edward as the 34th fastest-growing hospital in the U.S. and fastest-growing in Illinois. In 1999, Edward reaffirmed those rankings with a \\"Growth Zone\\" announcement for its Naperville campus-a $90 million renovation and expansion project to ensure high quality healthcare for a fast-growing community. Over the next couple of years, the project resulted in expanded outpatient services, expanded women's imaging services, new operating rooms for minimally invasive procedures, new mother/baby suites, and a four-floor Education Center and a 900-space parking garage. Since 2000, the pace and scope of expansion has increased. Edward opened the first pediatric emergency department in DuPage County, and also achieved a Level III designation for its neonatal intensive care unit, the highest level of care in Illinois in 2000. Additionally, in 2004, it expanded its emergency department by another to allow for annual growth in the number of emergency visits and more private and efficient triage and treatment areas for patients. In 2002, the 71-bed Edward Heart Hospital opened (the first of its kind in Illinois) and reinforced Edward as a national leader in complex cardiac care. That reputation was further enhanced in 2005 when HealthGrades ranked Edward #1 for cardiac surgery in the Chicago area and again in 2006 when Edward was named a Solucient Top 100 Hospital for cardiovascular care. In 2005 the Edward Cancer Center opened. The facility doubled the previous space available for medical oncology and radiation therapy. Also in 2005, Edward became the only hospital serving DuPage and Will Counties to achieve the Magnet designation for nursing excellence. At the time, only two percent of the nation's 6,000 hospitals had been recognized with the honor by the American Nurses Credentialing Center. 2006 saw Edward expand access to convenient, high quality healthcare in Plainfield with the opening of the Edward Plainfield Outpatient Center, a facility that provides Immediate Care, imaging services and community Wellness classes and events to the residents of one of the fastest-growing areas in Illinois. Edward Sleep Center and Edward administrative offices opened on Diehl Road in Warrenville as well. The Edward Plainfield Outpatient Center is located on the Edward Plainfield campus, which is also the site of a Medical Office Building (opened in 2006) and the future home to Edward Plainfield Hospital (seeking approval to build), Plainfield Surgery Center (2008) and Edward Plainfield Cancer Center (2009). Linden Oaks at Edward began 2007 with the opening of Arabella House, an eight-bed residential care home for women with eating disorders. The home helps patients ease back into the \\"real world,\\" from care in a hospital setting back to family, home, work, school. Also in 2007, Edward announced plans for a nearly $200 million \\"makeover\\" on its Naperville campus that will result in upgraded OB services, renovated and expanded surgical services, new cardiac cath capacity and a build out of a new three-floor addition to Edward Heart Hospital. Edward closed 2007 by completing a $49.7 million, three-floor, , 42-bed addition to the Edward Heart Hospital building. The expansion includes 28 beds for medical/surgical patients and 14 beds for intensive care unit patients. Edward was ranked as the 10th largest hospital in the Chicago area by Crain's Chicago Business in 2007, is the largest employer in Naperville and is the busiest hospital in DuPage County for inpatient discharges, births and emergency visits, according to the Metropolitan Chicago Healthcare Council. In 2008, Edward's growth in the southwest suburbs continued with the openings of the Plainfield Surgery Center on the Edward Plainfield campus and Edward Healthcare Center in Oswego. On the Naperville campus, Edward addressed the increased demand for services with the completion of a two-floor, 360-space addition to the South Parking Deck. Edward Cancer Center kicked off RapidArc, radiation therapy technology that treats patients up to eight times faster than conventional or helical IMRT delivery systems. Today, Edward Hospital & Health Services is a full-service, regional healthcare provider. , Edward Hospital has 354 private patient rooms and 7,700 employees, including 1,340 nurses and a medical staff of more than 1,900 physicians, representing nearly 100 medical and surgical specialties and subspecialties. Ninety-eight percent of Edward's physicians are board certified. Edward also provides imaging technology, care for critically ill newborns, minimally invasive surgery, newest clinical trials and behavioral health services through Linden Oaks at Edward. In July 2013, Edward Hospital merged with Elmhurst Memorial Hospital to create a new healthcare system currently called Edward-Elmhurst Health. In 2018, Edward-Elmhurst Health announced that it had overestimated its revenues by $92 million over several years. After revealing the error, CEO Mary Lou Mastro stated that the hospital system had made corrections to its accounting systems.

He was the older brother of Fletcher Christian, leader of the mutiny on the Bounty. Life Edward Christian was one of the three sons of Charles Christian of Moorland Close and of the large Ewanrigg Hall estate in Dearham, Cumberland, an attorney-at-law descended from Manx gentry, and his wife Ann Dixon.Glynn Christian, Fragile Paradise: The discovery of Fletcher Christian, Bounty mutineer; 2nd ed. (U.S.A.: Bounty Books, 2005), p. 11.Charles Christian at thepeerage.com, accessed 28 May 2010 Charles's marriage to Ann brought with it the small property of Moorland Close, \\"a quadrangle pile of buildings ... half castle, half farmstead.\\" Charles died in 1768 and Edward's mother Ann proved herself irresponsible with money. By 1779, Ann had run up a debt of nearly ¬£6,500 (equal to ¬£ today), and faced the prospect of debtors' prison. Moorland Close was lost and Ann and her younger children were forced to flee to the Isle of Man, where English creditors had no power. The three elder Christian sons managed to arrange a ¬£40 (equal to ¬£ today) per year annuity for their mother, allowing the family to live in genteel poverty. His mother Ann died on the Isle of Man in 1819. Christian attended St Bees School and went up to Peterhouse, Cambridge in 1775, but migrated to St John's College in 1777, graduating as third wrangler in 1779. While at Cambridge he forged a friendship with William Wilberforce. He was admitted to Gray's Inn on 5 July 1782. In 1788 Christian was appointed Downing Professor of the Laws of England, although the chair was only founded along with Downing College in 1800. He held the professorship in conjunction with a fellowship of Downing until his death in 1823. He was also law professor at the East India Company College from 1806 to 1818. Christian was Chief Justice of the Isle of Ely and was one of the presiding judges at the Ely and Littleport riot Special Commission assizes at Ely in 1816. Works In 1794, Stephen Barney, counsel to the mutineer William Muspratt, at the urging of Edward Christian, published his version of the Minutes of the Bounty Court- Martial, and included an Appendix written by Edward Christian. In it, Edward did not try to excuse his brother Fletcher's conduct, but citing his interviews with several of the people involved (none directly), and listing the names and addresses of several prominent people as witnesses to these interviews, he recounted several of the excesses of William Bligh, Commander of the Bounty. At the time of the publication of the Minutes and Appendix, the public's only published source of information about the mutiny were Bligh's own A Narrative of the Mutiny on the Bounty, published in 1790, and A Voyage to the South Sea, published in 1792. With the publication of the Appendix, the tide of public opinion began to turn against Bligh. Indeed, Bligh responded by publishing An Answer to Certain Assertions Contained in The Appendix to a Pamphlet, entitled... etc., etc., to which, Edward Christian promptly published A Short Reply to Capt. William Bligh's Answer, which only served to fan the flames. The process was aided by the efforts of the family of Peter Heywood, a midshipman on the Bounty, and others, but many attribute the source of William Bligh's bad reputation, to this day, to Edward Christian's Appendix. It is believed by many that Edward Christian's impetus for both the Minutes and the Appendix, were a letter from, and a subsequent meeting with, Peter Heywood, after the latter's pardon.

The series received widespread attention due to its creators Roseanne Arnold, then starring in the fifth season of her comedy Roseanne, and her husband and Roseanne co-producer Tom Arnold. The Jackie Thomas Show starred Tom Arnold as a misanthropic sitcom actor. Premise As Jackie Thomas, Arnold played a former nightclub comic and slaughterhouse worker now starring in his own sitcom (a show-within-a-show), also called \\"The Jackie Thomas Show.\\"Freeman, John. \\"Tom Arnold plays a nasty boss for laughs in new ABC sitcom.\\" The San Diego Union-Tribune, 1992-11-29, p. TV WEEK. As described in one review, Arnold's character was \\"an obnoxious, loud-mouthed tyrant who fires writers, producers, actors, even the show's caterers, on the slightest whim.\\" In the premiere episode (written by the Arnolds with Brad Isaacs), Jackie demanded that the child actor portraying his sitcom son be killed off, due to Jackie's jealousy over the amount of fan mail received by the boy. \\"He's unbelievable,\\" Tom Arnold said of the Jackie Thomas character. \\"It's a guy you love to hate. He has his own reality and it's different from the people around him. And you go, 'Gosh, the guy is such a jerk.' But you have compassion for him, especially as the show goes on, because you learn where he came from, what's really going on with him.\\"Du Brow, Rick. \\"A Simple Matter of Clout.\\" Los Angeles Times, 1992-11-29, p. 3. The character was named in tribute to Arnold's two favorite comedians, Jackie Gleason and Danny Thomas. From the beginning, The Jackie Thomas Show was intended to be an ensemble production, as Arnold \\"didn't feel [he] was ready\\" to support a show on his own. The cast included recurring Roseanne guest star Martin Mull as a network executive, Dennis Boutsikaris, Michael Boatman, Paul Feig and Maryedith Burrell as writers and Alison LaPlaca as an office assistant.Shales, Tom. \\"Doubting 'Thomas'; Tom Arnold's Hard-to-Like Sitcom on ABC.\\" The Washington Post, 1992-12-01, p.

The couple acknowledged the similarities; Tom Arnold was quoted, \\"We wanted to take the show-business end of our lives and mix the public perception of us and the reality of us and put them into the show--the images of what people think maybe we did or what they've read that we did.\\" Roseanne said, \\"All the work we do is personal. It's based on my kids, my family. You just take it from real life. That's the funniest stuff.\\" Such comparisons were bolstered by a BBC documentary, Feeding the Monster, which depicted the backstage activity behind the writing, rehearsal and filming of the season four Roseanne episode \\"Santa Claus.\\" Although the documentary didn't mention The Jackie Thomas Show, the Los Angeles Times' Jeff Kaye said that \\"the documentary unveils a real-life, parallel universe to the new series.\\" Kaye wrote that \\"the show's writers live in constant terror, their exhausting work-weeks punctuated by Pepto-Bismol swigging and all-night writing sessions. They are emotionally battered and their life expectancy on the show is short.\\" The segment aired in Britain but was omitted from the documentary's American broadcast on the Showtime cable channel, due to Roseanne Arnold's relationship with Showtime's rival HBO.

When Jackie actually shows up in the person of the one-dimensional Arnold, the image disintegrates.\\" Rosenberg called the pilot episode \\"weak and unsatisfying.\\" Rick Kogan of the Chicago Tribune reviewed the show more favorably, calling it \\"as solidly crafted a sitcom as I've seen in some time.\\" He praised the pilot for introducing \\"an attractively quirky cast\\" and \\"a wholly conceived, interesting environment.\\"Kogan, Rick. \\"2 Arnolds at the top?

Roseanne told the media that the messages were sent in \\"self-defense\\" and that the critics in question had chosen to make personal attacks on the Arnolds instead of responding to the show itself. She said, \\"Generally what emerges in these reviews is fear and loathing of women. It's very misogynistic. Something needs to be done. These people are affecting the revenues of the work Tom does and I do.\\" She defended her use of the anti- gay epithet \\"faggot\\" in her letter to Roush, saying that her comments were \\"based on personal things I know about him.\\" In a later interview, Tom Arnold said he supported his wife's efforts and said the epithet was an \\"anti-[Roush] term.\\" Ratings and scheduling The Jackie Thomas Show debuted on Tuesday, December 1, 1992 at 9:30 PM EST, the time slot directly following Roseanne; the Arnolds publicly acknowledged that they had used their clout to have the show scheduled in what was widely considered the best time slot on television (although they denied rumors that Roseanne had threatened to quit her own show, with Roseanne saying \\"I didn't have to go that far\\"). To make room, the timeslot's former occupant Coach moved to 9:30 PM on Wednesday, replacing the sitcom Laurie Hill, which was cancelled.Hodges, Ann. \\"Young Indy/World discovers Houston actor.\\" Houston Chronicle, 1992-10-23, p. 1.

In 1829 he moved to London, and before long managed to start his own engraving workshop. After attempting a short-lived fashion journal, Cosmorama, he joined with the journalist Henry Mayhew and the printer William Last to found Punch in 1841. Initial difficulties forced Landells to sell his one-third share to the publishers Bradbury & Evans: after the new owners replaced Landells with Joseph Swain as engraving chief, Landells responded with a pamphlet A Word with Punch (1847). The Queen, Prince Albert, & Princess Royal on leaving the Carriage, King William Dock, sketched by Landells in 1844 Herbert Ingram consulted Landells about launching his illustrated weekly Illustrated London News in 1842: after a commission to sketch Victoria's first visit to Scotland that year, Landells became the paper's first artist correspondent and continued to supply prints for the newspaper until his death. Landells was also involved in several other magazines: the less successful Illuminated Magazine (1843-35), Great Gun (1844, in imitation of Punch), the Lady's Newspaper (1847-63, after which incorporated in the Queen), Diogenes (1853, another attempt to imitate Punch), and the Illustrated Inventor. Responding to the growth in the children's book market, he wrote and illustrated several books for children: Boy's Own Toy-Maker (1858), Girl's Own Toy-Maker (1859), and Illustrated Paper Model Maker (1860).

It has been reported interbreeding with the related lesser honeyguide (I. minor) and the two are sometimes treated as a single species. It is 14-15 centimetres long and has a heavy black bill. The upperparts are yellow-green with dark streaking while the head and underparts are dark greyish, sometimes with faint streaking. The outer tail-feathers are mostly white and there may be a pale spot on the lores. Juvenile birds are similar to adults but are darker and greener. The lesser honeyguide is smaller with a less heavy bill. It has a paler head and underparts, less-streaked upperparts and a more conspicuous patch on the lores. The calls of the thick- billed honeyguide include a repeated \\"frip\\" which is similar to the call of the lesser honeyguide but deeper. It occurs in the African tropical rainforest (more sparsely present west of the Dahomey Gap). The nominate subspecies is found from southern Nigeria south to north-west Angola and east to Uganda and western Kenya. The form cassini occurs in eastern Sierra Leone, Liberia and southern parts of Guinea, C√¥te d'Ivoire and Ghana. The species inhabits the interior of dense forest. Where its habitat becomes fragmented it may be replaced by the lesser honeyguide which favours more open habitats.

The island is oblong in shape with several inlets on its south coast, lying on an east‚Äìwest axis in Loch Sealg (Loch Shell), and shelters the harbour of Lemreway on the \\"mainland\\" of Lewis nearby. There are two peaks at either end of the island, with the low ground in the middle. There are two lochans in the west, and three in the east as well as a number of burns.

Although Haswell-Smith suggests that the name means \\"yew island\\", the preponderance of Norse names in the Outer Hebrides suggests that the second element of \\"Iubhard\\" may be a corruption of fjord/firth. Dean Munro visited the island in 1549, and reported \\"pasture and schielling of store, with faire hunting of ottars out of their bouries\\".

The Bury St Edmunds witch trials were a series of trials conducted intermittently between the years 1599 and 1694 in the town of Bury St Edmunds in Suffolk, England. Two specific trials in 1645 and 1662 became historically well known. The 1645 trial \\"facilitated\\" by the Witchfinder General saw 18 people executed in one day. The judgment by the future Lord Chief Justice of England and Wales, Sir Matthew Hale in the 1662 trial acted as a powerful influence on the continuing persecution of witches in England and similar persecutions in the American Colonies.Notestein 1911: p261 -262 Jurisdiction As well as being the seat of county assizes, Bury St Edmunds had been a site for both Piepowder Courts and court assizes, the latter since the Abbey was given a Liberty, namely the Liberty of St Edmund. For the purposes of civil government the town and the remainder (or \\"body\\") of the county were quite distinct, each providing a separate grand jury to the assizes. The trials The first recorded account of a witch trial at Bury St Edmunds Suffolk was of one held in 1599 when Jone Jordan of Shadbrook (StradbrokeWright 2005: p13) and Joane Nayler were tried, but there is no record of the charges or verdicts. In the same year, Oliffe Bartham of Shadbrook was executed,Notestein 1911: p393 for \\"sending three toads to destroy the rest (sleepGeis & Bunn 1997: p50) of Joan Jordan\\". =The 1645 trial= The trial was instigated by Matthew Hopkins, the self-proclaimed Witchfinder GeneralGeis & Bunn 1997: p188 and conducted at a special court under John Godbolt. On 27 August 1645, no fewer than 18 people were executed by hanging at Bury St Edmunds. 16 of the 18 people executed that day were women, accounting for 89% of the total.Notestein 1911: p178 Among the executed was: *Anne Alderman, Rebecca Morris and Mary Bacon of Chattisham *Mary Clowes of Yoxford *Sarah Spindler, Jane Linstead, Thomas Everard (cooper) and his wife Mary of Halesworth *Mary Fuller of Combs, near Stowmarket *John Lowes, Vicar of Brandeston *Susan Manners, Jane Rivet and Mary Skipper of Copdock, near Ipswich *Mary Smith of Great Glemham *Margery Sparham of Mendham *Katherine Tooly of Westleton. *Anne Leech and Anne Wright, origin unknown.Robbins 1959: p252 It has been estimated that all of the English witch trials between the early 15th and early 18th centuries resulted in fewer than 500 executions, so this one trial, with its 18 executions, accounted for 3.6% of that total. Witch Finder General, from a broadside published by Matthew Hopkins before 1650. According to John Stearn(e)A detailed account of Hopkins and his fellow witchfinder John Stearne can be found in Malcolm Gaskill's Witchfinders: A Seventeenth Century English Tragedy (Harvard, 2005). The duo's activities were portrayed, unreliably but entertainingly, in the 1968 cult classic Witchfinder-General (US: The Conqueror Worm). known at various times as the witch-hunter,Notestein 1911: p166 and \\"witch pricker\\",Notestein 1911: p248 associate to Matthew Hopkins, in his book A Confirmation and Discovery of Witchcraft there were one hundred and twenty others in gaol awaiting trial, of these 17 were men,Wright 2005: p26 Thomas Ady in 1656 writes of \\"about a hundred\\",Robbins 1959: p. 252 though others record \\"almost 200\\".Robbins 1959: p. 251 Following a three-week adjournment made necessary by the advancing King's Army,Notestein 1911: p179 the second sitting of the court resulted in 68 other \\"condemnations\\"; Transcribed into modern English by Steve Hulford, 2005. though reports say ‚Äì \\"mass executions of sixty or seventy witches\\".Notestein 1911: p404Robbins 1959: p66 Both Hopkins and Stearne treated the search for, and trials of witches as military campaigns, as shown in their choice of language in both seeking support for and reporting their endeavours. There was much to keep the minds of Parliamentarians busy at this time with the Royalist Army heading towards Cambridgeshire, but concern about the events unfolding were being voiced. Prior to the trial a report was carried to the Parliament - \\"...as if some busie men had made use of some ill Arts to extort such confession;...\\" that a special Commission of Oyer and Terminer was granted for the trial of these Witches. After the trial and execution the Moderate Intelligencer, a parliamentary paper published during the English Civil War, in an editorial of 4‚Äì11 September 1645 expressed unease with the affairs in Bury: =The 1662 trial= This took place on 10 March 1662,Geis & Bunn 1997: p36 when two elderly widows, Rose Cullender and Amy Denny (or Deny or Duny), living in Lowestoft, were accused of witchcraft by their neighbours and faced 13 charges of the bewitching of several young children between the ages of a few months to 18 years old, resulting in one death.Seth 1969: p. 105 They may have been aware of each other, inhabiting a small town,Geis & Bunn 1997: p. 125 but Cullender was from a property-owning family, whilst Denny was the widow of a labourer.Geis & Bunn 1997: p32-33 Their one other link was the fact that they had tried and failed to purchase herring from a Lowestoft merchant, Samuel Pacy.Seth 1969: p. 109 His two daughters Elizabeth, and Deborah were \\"victims\\" of the accused and, along with their aunt, Samuel Pacy's sister Margaret, gave evidence against the women. They were tried at the Assize held in Bury St Edmunds under the auspices of the 1603 Witchcraft Act, by one of England's most eminent judges of the time Sir Matthew Hale, Lord Chief Baron of the Exchequer.Notestein 1911: p261 The jury found them guilty of the thirteen charges of using malevolent witchcraft, and the judge sentenced them to death. They were hanged at Bury St Edmunds on 17 March 1662. Thomas Browne, the philosopher, physician and author, attended the trial. His reporting of similar events that had occurred in Denmark influenced the jury of the guilt of the accused.Notestein 1911: p. 266Thomas 1971: pp524-525 He also testified that \\"the young girls accusing Denny and Cullander were afflicted with organic problems, but that they undoubtedly also had been bewitched\\".Geis & Bunn 1997: p6 He had expressed his belief in the existence of witches twenty years earlier, and that only: \\"they that doubt of these, do not only deny them, but spirits; and are obliquely, and upon consequence a sort not of infidels, but atheists\\"Browne 1645: p64 in his work Religio Medici, published in 1643: > ... how so many learned heads should so farre forget their Metaphysicks, and > destroy the ladder and scale of creatures, as to question the existence of > Spirits: for my part, I have ever beleeved, and doe now know, that there are > Witches; The original pamphlet A Tryal of Witches, taken from a contemporary report of the proceedings, erroneously dates the trial as March 1664, both on the front page and introduction. Original documents in the Public Record Office and other contemporary records clearly states it took place in the 14th year of the reign of Charles II (30 January 1662 to 29 January 1663).reign = actual: 29 May 1660 ‚Äì 6 February 1685 but according to royalists de jure from 30 January 1649 the day of execution of his father. At this time the new year did not occur until March, so the father's death (and Charles II succession) would have been recorded as 1648. Further clarification if required This case became a model for, and was referenced in, the Salem Witch Trials in Massachusetts, when the magistrates were looking for proof that spectral evidence could be used in a court of law.Geis & Bunn 1997: p185 Reverend John Hale, whose wife was accused at Salem, in his publication, Modest Inquiry into the Nature of Witchcraft, noted how the judges consulted for precedents and lists the 60-page publication A Tryal of Witches. Cotton Mather, in his 1693 book The Wonders of the Invisible World, concerning the Salem Witch Trials, specifically draws attention to the Suffolk trial,Mather 1693: p. 44 and the Salem judge stated that although spectral evidence should be allowed in order to begin investigations, it should not be admitted as evidence to decide a case.Mather 1693: p. 42 =Other trials= Another recorded witch trial in Bury St Edmunds was in 1655 when a mother and daughter by the name of Boram were tried and said to have been hanged. The last was in 1694 when Lord Chief Justice Sir John Holt, \\"who did more than any other man in English history to end the prosecution of witches\\",Notestein 1911: p320 forced the acquittal of Mother Munnings' of Hartis (HartestWright 2005: p37) on charges of prognostications causing death.Robbins 1959: p69 The chief charge was 17 years old, the second brought by a man on his way home from an alehouse.

During the First World War, the island of Corfu served as an island hospital and quarantine for sick Serbian soldiers following the epic retreat of the Serbian army and part of the civilian population through Montenegro and Albania in 1915 following the Austro-German-Bulgarian invasion of Serbia (see Serbian Campaign (World War I)). While the main camps of the recuperating army were on Corfu itself (a contingent was sent to Bizerte as well, and many of the civilian refugees were accepted by France), the sick and near-dying, mostly soldiers, were treated on Vido to prevent epidemics. In spite of Allied material help, the conditions of both the improvised medical facilities and many of the patients on the island resulted in a high fatality rate. Due to small area of the island and its rocky soil, it soon became necessary to bury the dead in the sea (by weighting the corpses with rocks to prevent them from floating). Over 5,000 people were buried at sea near the island of Vido. A monument of gratitude to the Greek nation was erected at Vido by Serbs in the 1930s.

In the 2008‚Äì09 Magners League, Thomas spent much of his time on the bench, playing second-fiddle to Jones and Priestland at fly-half, and the majority of his playing time was spent in other positions, including two starts on the wing in December 2008. Thomas only made six appearances for the Scarlets in 2009, resulting in a transfer to Leeds Carnegie in June 2009.

She is portrayed by Jennifer Tilly in both live-action and voice over in Bride of Chucky, Seed of Chucky, Curse of Chucky, and Cult of Chucky. As a human, Tiffany has bleached blonde hair and brown eyes, a gothic fashion style, and has a chest tattoo of a stabbed heart with Chucky written above it. After becoming a doll, Tiffany redoes her hair and makeup to resemble her human self, and wears a golden necklace that says \\"Tiff\\". Her appearance changes throughout the series: her lips become smaller, her hair becomes straighter, and her clothing changes. Tiffany, like her love interest, Chucky, wants to transfer her soul to the human protagonist. Both she and Chucky kill people; however, Tiffany appears to only kill people she feels deserve it, while Chucky is willing to kill anyone. Personality Tiffany has many different personalities which can be a little skeptical. She dresses in a gothic fashion and can be described as a hopeless romantic. She has a \\"bimbo\\" hairstyle, but is sweet, creative, inventive, and somewhat feminist. Unlike Chucky, she possesses a genuinely kind and compassionate side, although she can be quite short- tempered, and is struck sometimes by remorse which is out-of-sync with her love of killing. It is shown, in Bride of Chucky, that she loves deeply, believing \\"love would set her free\\". She is easily disappointed, terribly violent, and unforgiving when angered. She attempts to reform in Seed of Chucky, to \\"break her addiction\\" to killing. However, Tiffany's urge to maim is strong, and she continues to use creative means to murder. Backstory Not much is known about Tiffany Valentine, but that she is was the girlfriend of Charles Lee Ray, the serial killer known as the Lakeshore Strangler before he was killed. She, like so many others, referred to him solely by his nickname, Chucky. Tiffany was drawn to Ray because of her fetish for murderers and psychopaths. Although never said on-screen, it is likely that Tiffany helped Chucky in committing his murders and acted as his accomplice. Tiffany and Charles lived together for years until the night Chucky was gunned down in a toy store by police officer Mike Norris. However, before he was killed, Chucky managed to transfer his soul into the body of a Good Guy doll. After the news spread of Chucky's first killing spree as a doll, Tiffany spent the next ten years searching for the remains of Chucky, to bring him back to life. It is never stated where Tiffany was born. Some fans have speculated that she like Chucky was born in Hackensack, New Jersey and moved with Chucky to Chicago. Appearances =Bride of Chucky (1998)= Tiffany sets up and murders a police officer in order to steal Chucky's remains from an evidence vault. Stitching and patching the remains together with new doll parts, she re-enacts the voodoo ritual which put his soul inside the doll. When an argument reveals that Chucky has no intention of marrying her, an outraged and hurt Tiffany confines him in a playpen and taunts him with a bridal doll. Chucky soon breaks out of the pen and electrocutes Tiffany in her bath, leaving her lifeless. He repeats the chant which transfers her soul into the doll. Stuck in the same circumstances, they need the Heart of Damballa (a voodoo amulet) buried with Chucky's human remains in Hackensack, New Jersey. To escape their doll bodies, Tiffany phones and tricks a neighbor, Jesse, into transporting these \\"dolls\\" for $1000. Several people are gruesomely killed during the road trip. Tiffany's particularly creative murder of a con-artist couple in a bridal suite moves Chucky to proclaim his love and propose to Tiffany; she accepts and they have sex. Jesse and Jade become wanted for the murders as all evidence links back to them; Chucky and Tiffany reveal they are alive and take the couple hostage, needing new wheels they steal a Campervan. The hostages instigate a fight between Chucky and Tiffany, Distracted, Jade kicks her into the oven and Jesse throws Chucky out the window, Jesse spins out which ends with their stolen Campervan crashing. Chucky forces Jade to his grave site to retrieve the amulet, when Jesse arrives to trade Tiffany for Jade. Chucky does so but quickly recaptures the couple and prepares to transfer Tiffany's soul into Jade. However, touched by Jade and Jesse's love, Tiffany stabs Chucky and they fight. Tiffany is stabbed in the heart by Chucky, and avenged by Jade who shoots Chucky to death. As she lies dying, Tiffany gives birth to a bloody baby doll which attacks the crime investigator. =Seed of Chucky (2004)= Chucky and Tiffany are brought back to life by their child when he reads the inscription on the Heart of Damballa. When they see he has no genitals, Tiffany sees it as proof the child is a girl and names it Glenda (feminizing the name, Glen, which Chucky had given to him previously). Now going by \\"Tiffany Ray\\", Tiffany plans to transport her soul into the body of Jennifer Tilly. They also plan to impregnate her and put Glen/Glenda's soul in the baby's body. Their plan is successful, as Jennifer swiftly gives birth to two babies, a boy and a girl. This works out perfectly as Glen/Glenda has a split personality: a sweet and caring boy, and a homicidal girl. However, Chucky decides to remain a doll, seeing that being human is not so great. Disturbed by this, Tiffany leaves Chucky, taking Glen/Glenda with her, causing Chucky to get angry. Tiffany and Glen/Glenda go to Jennifer's hospital. Chucky follows them and hits her in the head with an axe for leaving him, thus killing her. However, at the very last minute, she successfully passes her soul into Jennifer before dying. Five years later, she is happily living in Hollywood while inhabiting Jennifer's body, and is raising the twins on her own. On the twins' birthday, one of the maids tries to quit her job because she is afraid of \\"troubled child\\" Glenda. Tiffany tells her she can go, but then beats her to death with her doll body. Her eyes then turn green while she evilly laughs. In the extended version, she then hides the body and tells Glenda to keep a secret. =Curse of Chucky (2013)= Eight years after the events of Seed of Chucky, Tiffany's soul still possesses actress Jennifer Tilly's body. She does not appear on-screen until it is revealed that she was the one responsible for mailing Chucky out to Nica's home, facilitating his murder spree on the family he blames for his human death. She pays a police officer to get Chucky from evidence after Nica's trial and once he is in his car she jumps up from the back and slits his throat with a nail file. The status of their twins is never stated. Six months later, Tiffany mails Chucky to the home of Nica's niece, Alice, and he kills her paternal grandmother. Chucky attempts to transfer his soul into Alice. =Cult of Chucky (2017)= Four years after Nica Pierce was falsely imprisoned, Tiffany visits her in a mental institution after she was framed by Chucky for the murders of her family which Tiffany helped orchestrate. She is revealed to be the legal guardian of Nica's niece Alice and came to tell Nica that Alice had died, supposedly of a \\"broken heart\\". She leaves Chucky as a gift for Nica, saying that it was a gift from Alice. She later calls Andy Barclay and delivers a taunting message about Chucky's growing \\"Cult\\". Tiffany later kills a security guard outside the Asylum, slitting his throat with a nail file. She is also shown to still be in possession of her former doll body, which is sitting in the back of her car. At the end of the film, Tiffany is reunited with Chucky (now possessing the body of Nica) and the two reaffirm their relationship with a kiss. Tiffany expresses some remorse at Alice's apparent death and says it was nice having her around. Chucky/Nica replies by saying \\"fuck that kid\\" and then they both begin laughing maniacally, along with the Tiffany doll, which is revealed to hold part of Tiffany's soul before they drive off into the night. Other appearances On the special features of the Seed of Chucky DVD, Tiffany sits alongside Chucky and Glen/Glenda on a sofa in their family home, where they watch a slideshow of their holiday to various places. Nearly all of these places have evidence of Chucky having killed someone; this upsets Tiffany and makes Glen feel uncomfortable. Also on the special features of Seed of Chucky DVD, Chucky and Tiffany are interviewed by the Fuzion interviewer to promote the film.

The music video was directed by Fenton Williams of Filament Productions. Eh Hee to be Released on iTunes AntsMarching.org. Retrieved 2010-07-08. Origins \\"Eh Hee\\" was written as an evocation of the music and culture of the San people of southern Africa. In a story told to the Radio City audience (an edited version of which appears on the DVD version of Live at Radio City), Matthews recalls hearing the music of the Khoisan and, upon asking his guide what the words to their songs were, being told that \\"there are no words to these songs, because these songs, we've been singing since before people had words\\". He goes on to describe the song as his \\"homage to meeting... the most advanced people on the planet\\". Live performance history The song debuted in February 2006 on the Dave Matthews & Friends Caribbean cruise under the title \\"Ayhee\\". It was performed as part of a mini-performance on each individual ship after stormy conditions cut the main show short. Other than a solo performance by Matthews in Manchester a few months later, it was not performed again in full until 2007 at an acoustic concert at Radio City Music Hall by Matthews and Tim Reynolds. Beginning with that concert, the title was changed from \\"Ayhee\\" to \\"Eh Hee\\" on the setlist, and its performance was later released as part of the Live at Radio City album. The next performance of the song was performed by the entire Dave Matthews Band in August 2007 in Noblesville, Indiana and became only the second to ever be performed by the band, as well as Matthews and Reynolds, Dave Matthews & Friends, and as a solo by Matthews. \\"Eh Hee\\" went on to become one of the most performed songs by the band during the summer 2007 tour, and live performances of the song were released on the albums Live at Piedmont Park and 2008's Live at Mile High Music Festival.

It is an ornate brick building designed by Richard Morris Hunt in the 1870s. In 1973 it was listed on the National Register of Historic Places. Hunt was commissioned by his brother-in-law, Joseph Howland, to design a home for a subscription library he donated to the city. The completed building has much in common with the Stick style summer homes in Newport, Rhode Island, that Hunt designed at this early stage of his career. Some of its design elements have been compared to Norwegian vernacular architecture. The interior was not complete in its current form until almost the end of the century. Except for some upgrades to its utilities, it has remained largely intact since then. Throughout the 1920s it was one of only two remaining public subscription libraries in the state. In response to a donor's bequest, the library became free at the end of that decade. Almost 50 years later, the library moved out when it outgrew the building. Since then it has been used as a cultural center, hosting various visual and performing arts events. Building The building is located at the east end of downtown Beacon, at the corner of Main Street and Tioronda Avenue, just west of where Churchill Street forks off to cross Fishkill Creek. The blocks to the west and north are urban and densely developed with larger mixed-use buildings, on the south side of the street. A large church is just across Tioronda from the Howland. To the south, across Van Nydeck Avenue, is a mostly wooded area with a few houses. The Madam Brett Homestead, a 1709 stone house also listed on the Register, is near the west end of the block. Another listed building, Beacon's post office, is a block and a half west along Main Street. =Exterior= The building itself is a two-story three-by-five-bay brick structure on a foundation of bluestone and granite quarried at nearby Breakneck Ridge. Its first story is faced in brick; the second in polychrome fishscale shingles. Atop is a six-gabled roof covered in Delaware slate pierced by a brick chimney on the west side. On the first story the foundation is capped with a granite water table. The east (front) face has arched double two-over-two double-hung sash windows and central main entrance are set in slightly recessed arched panels trimmed with patterns of black and buff brick. The tops of the panels are corbelled. Narrow side panels between the window panels and corners have a simple cross design in black and buff brick corresponding to the top of the window arches. Six wooden pillars flanking the main entrance support a projecting bay on the second story, with a small hood sheltering the entrance steps. The second story as a whole is set off from the lower level by another water table. Its windows are narrow, tall two-over-two double-hung sash above fluted panels. They extend above the roofline, where they are topped with hipped roofs giving them the appearance of dormers. Wood painted red trims the shingles. The central window has tall, narrow, two-over-four double-hung sash. Its face has a half-timbered appearance, although the section on either side of the windows is faced in clapboard rather than stucco. Above it is a two-paned semicircular lunette window. The bay is topped with a steeply pitched gabled roof and finial. On the side elevations, there are two two-over-two double-hung sash windows in the east bays with a similar treatment as the front windows. Two gables pierce the south face. The smaller one on the north has two-over-two double-hung sash with another half-timbered face in the gable. Its larger counterpart on the south has a large paired window of one-over-one double-hung sash with smaller flanking windows. Above it is a tympanum set with intricate tracery. A similar window is located opposite; it has no smaller window closer to the east. =Interior= The interior of the building is a large open space. Floors are of English cane felt overlaid with hemlock, to dampen sound, and topped with strips of Georgia pine. A second-story gallery with a wrought iron railing is supported by carved wooden pillars and wrought iron brackets. Bookshelves are built into the walls and the dado is paneled. Handwrought Georgia pine pillars and hammerbeams support a ceiling. Doors are carved to look like books with pages rising from the middle when closed. alt=A large space with a wooden gallery along the upper portion, large windows above, and paintings and ornate decorations in the wooden walls. On the lower level, at the bottom of the image, there are a lot of people doing various things Other rooms include a small entryway on the first floor and two small offices. On the second floor are three small rooms. They were originally the librarian's apartment, but are now also used as offices. History Joseph Howland, a Civil War general and former New York State Treasurer whose Tioronda estate was a mile (1.6 km) south of the building's location in what was then the village of Matteawan, commissioned the building from his brother-in-law, Richard Morris Hunt, late in 1871. At the beginning of the next year, a general meeting was held for all those interested in establishing a subscription library. By August the building was complete, and the library opened with a formal ceremony at which Howland transferred the building to the library's board of trustees. Hunt's building followed contemporary architectural styles similar to those of the cottages he was building for wealthy vacationers in Newport, Rhode Island. It most clearly reflects the polychrome and Picturesque modes. The woodwork around the main entrance also shows hints of the emerging Stick style; there was one more at the gables, but it has been lost. In 1940, a Federal Writers' Project guidebook would describe it as \\"in the Norwegian chalet style\\". It was one of the last libraries to use natural light for its reading room. The original 2,200-volume collection grew quickly, as did the membership. In 1887 electric lighting replaced the original gas lamps. Seven years later, more space was needed, and the upper gallery was added, the last significant change to the building. Some alterations have also been made to the heating system over the years. Even after the village of Matteawan, where it was located, merged with nearby Fishkill Landing at the beginning of the 20th century to become today's city of Beacon, the library remained subscribers-only. In the late 1920s, when it was one of only two such libraries remaining in the state, a wealthy local resident made a bequest to the library on the condition that it become a free public library. That began in 1929, essentially making it the city's library. In 1942, Nancy Lamont, the second librarian, left the position. She and her predecessor had served a combined 70 years. The library continued to serve the city and its residents from the building until the 1970s, when the growth of the former outpaced the capacity of the latter. In 1976 the library moved to a vacant department store building two blocks west along Main, where it has remained, still called the Howland Library. After the library moved out, the Howland Cultural Center was established to keep the building in use and preserve it. It hosts a variety of visual and performing arts events, as well as public and community meetings. It rents out the building for some events, mostly similar to those it stages itself but also including small weddings. In 2007, the center installed geothermal heating to cut its energy costs and reduce the use of fossil fuels. A system using water in vertical pipes to be dug 250 feet (76 m) into the earth beneath the center will both heat and cool the building. It heats the building with up 70% more efficiency and cools up to 40% more efficiently. In addition it is quieter, enhancing the building's acoustics.

He was a Royalist army officer active in the West of England, during the English Civil War. Origins Slanning was the son of Gamaliel Slanning of Hele, Devon, by his wife and cousin Margaret Marler, daughter of Edward Marler of Crayford, Kent. The Slanning family is first documented in 1538 and spanned nine generations until the extinction of the male line in 1700. The Slannings were granted or acquired land in Bickleigh, Walkhampton, Maybury, and Roborough, all near Plymouth. Career In 1612 he inherited the Devonshire manors of Maristow, Walkhampton, and BickleighBurke's \\"A genealogical and heraldic history of the extinct and dormant baronetcies\\" (1838), pages 489-490 \\"Slanning of Maristow\\", on Google Books. all near Plymouth. He attended Exeter College, Oxford and was admitted to the Inner Temple in 1628. However, he left the next year for the Low Countries \\"to learn the arts of war\\". Military activities Slanning returned to England and was knighted on 24 August 1632 at Nonsuch Palace.Knights of England He was appointed to the Commission for Piracy in Devon and Cornwall and as Vice-Admiral of the Southern Shores of both counties. He was subsequently appointed in 1635 Governor of Pendennis Castle, which castle guards the entrance to Falmouth harbour, in succession to William Killigrew (1606‚Äì1695). During this time he was resident at Trerose in the nearby parish of Mawnan. In February 1639 Slanning embarked with 13 guns and 100 officers bound for Cumberland to take part in the abortive First Bishops' War. It is possible that the men and guns were intended for the defence of Carlisle, but Slanning headed for York to command a company in a regiment of foot \\"appointed to guard the king's person\\", with the rank of Sergeant Major. He returned home following the Treaty of Berwick in June 1639 and by March 1640 had been appointed Recorder of Plympton St Maurice, Devon. Parliamentary activities In April 1640 Slanning was elected Member of Parliament for Plympton Erle, Devon, for the Short Parliament in what appears to be an unresolved double return. Slanning was Lieutenant-Colonel of a trained band of 157 men, two-thirds musketeers and the remainder pikemen. He and Sir Francis Bassett of Tehidy were given the responsibility for levies from the West of Cornwall for the Second Bishops' War. After the Treaty of Ripon he hurried back to stand for Parliament. In October 1640 Slanning was elected for both Plympton Erle and Penryn to the Long Parliament (in a way which was to give rise to charges of bribery), and chose to sit for Penryn. His was among the 59 names of the members posted for voting against the Bill of Attainder of Strafford. Seven other Cornish MPs also voted against the Bill, including Godolphin, Trevanion, and Richard Arundell of Trerice, who later married Slanning's widow Gertrude Bagg. In June 1641 he returned to Cornwall to resume his governorship of Pendennis Castle, but was back in London that winter, and in January 1642 was called to attend the House of Commons for sending letters to Francis Bassett in Cornwall for the arrest of the \\"Five Members\\", should they try to embark from a Cornish port, a charge that Slanning denied. He was still in the House in February and supplied it with information concerning \\"four Scottish merchants lately arrived in Cornwall\\", but probably left for Pendennis in April when many MPs withdrew. He was certainly in Cornwall when, on 9 August, he was barred from the Commons and ordered to attend the House as a \\"delinquent\\". Civil War On 25 August 1642, the Royalist commander Hopton entered Cornwall after separating from the Marquis of Hertford following their failed attempts to secure Wiltshire, Dorset, and Somerset. Hopton first visited Sir Bevil Grenvile at Stowe, Kilkhampton, then after brushing aside Bullers's Militia, headed for Pendennis on 24 September to confer with Slanning. Hopton appeared voluntarily before the assizes at Truro and after successful defence of his actions, began recruiting. In November 1642, Slanning formed one of the five Cornish regiments foot which was known as \\"the Tinners\\".Stoyle, Mark (2002) West Britons: Cornish identities and the early modern British state, University of Exeter Press ; pp. 205-207 (lists the officers of the regiment 1642-1646) The other regiments were formed under Colonel William Godolphin, Sir Bevil Grenville, Colonel John Trevanion and Warwick Mohun, 2nd Baron Mohun of Okehampton. Slanning and the first three of these were known as the \\"Wheels on Charles's Wain\\". A seventeenth century ode included the distich: :\\"Gone the four wheels of Charles's wain, :Grenville, Godolphin, Slanning, Trevanion slain\\"'' Slanning was released from his governorship of Pendennis Castle in 1643 and was succeeded by Sir John Arundell. Hopton first used his forces to make an unsuccessful attempt on Exeter then fell back on Plympton, took it, and invested Plymouth on 1 December. Later that month they took Alphington, Powderham, and Topsham but failed to capture Exeter in a night attack. Their first field battle was Braddock (actually Pinnock) Down in January 1643 when Ruthin's forces were forced to flee back through Liskeard and on to Saltash, while the Earl of Stamford withdrew from Launceston. Slanning's regiment, along with those of Grenville and Trevanion and half of the horse and dragoons, pursued Stamford while the rest followed up Ruthin. Hopton, after some futile negotiations, invested Plymouth again and this led to Slanning's sole command in battle, but not until after the first \\"wheel\\" was lost when the court poet Sydney Godolphin died of a wound received in a skirmish at Chagford, Devon. In February 1643 Slanning, in command of a detachment consisting of his own and Trevanion's regiments, was attacked at Modbury, Devon, by Chudleigh. He was able to execute a fighting withdrawal against superior forces, but at the cost of 250 killed or wounded, 1,000 muskets and five guns. The Cornish forces now left Devon and things remained quiet until the encounter battle of Polston Bridge, Launceston, in April, when the arrival of Slanning's and Trevanion's regiments proved decisive. Two days later there was another encounter battle, the \\"Western Wonder\\" of the Cavalier ballad, at Sourton Down, where in the middle of a violent thunderstorm, Chudleigh was able to hold the field and Hopton again retreated to Launceston. Slanning and his men had a brief sojourn at Saltash before rejoining the rest in a rendezvous with Grenvile's foot. They brushed aside a small force at Week St. Mary on 13 May and at 5.00 a.m. on the 16 May attacked the forces on Stratton (now Stamford) Hill, Stratton. This produced their most spectacular victory when, after ten hours of fighting uphill against twice their number of much better equipped enemy with a dug-in battery, the Royalists gained the position, killing 300 and capturing 1,700 with fourteen guns, ¬£300 and plentiful provisions, at a cost of 80 men. Slanning and Trevanion commanded the westernmost of the four columns. The Cornish Royalist army then received orders to rendezvous with Prince Maurice's men, whom they met at Chard in Somerset in June. This combined force now took Taunton, Bridgwater, Dunster Castle and Wells. Their first contact with the Parliamentarian commander William Waller was a cavalry skirmish at Chewton Mendip. Waller was driven out of Monkton Farleigh on 3 July 1643 and on 5 July, two days later, the Royalists won a pyrrhic victory at the Battle of Lansdowne. Slanning was described as \\"advancing from hedge to hedge at the head of his men, in the mouths of muskets and cannons, insomuch they thought him immortal, as indeed he was that day\\" whereas Sir Bevill Grenvile, the next \\"wheel\\", fell at the battle. The foot were now besieged in Devizes but witnessed the destruction of Waller's forces at Roundway Down. Storming of Bristol and death The Western Royalists took Bath, and after joining Prince Rupert on 26 July 1643 they stormed Bristol. Slanning commanded one of the three tertia of the Western Army which attacked the South Eastern defences at 3.00 a.m. Bristol fell after some thirteen hours fighting, Slanning and Trevanion were both mortally wounded. Slanning's leg was broken by a musket ball, and he died a few days later,Date of death stated as \\"a few days after\\" the day of the battle by ODNB. quipping \\"that he had always despised bullets, having been so used to them, and almost thought they could not hurt him\\", and professing \\"great joy and satisfaction in the losing of his life in the King's service to whom he had always dedicated it\\". No record remains of where Sir Nicholas Slanning was buried. The Sir Nicholas Slanning buried at St Mary the Virgin at Bickleigh, Devon was this Sir Nicholas's grandfather, but Slanning's body may have been returned there for burial since some of his arms reached Bickleigh and his funerary helmet and gauntlet may still be seen, by arrangement, at the church. Marriage and children In 1625 Slanning married Gertrude Bagge, a daughter of Sir James Bagge of Saltram,\\"Little Saltram\\", per Prince, John, (1643‚Äì1723) The Worthies of Devon, 1810 edition, London, p. 716, note 2 in the parish of Plympton, Devon. She survived him and remarried to Richard Arundell, 1st Baron Arundell of Trerice. By his wife Slanning had two sons and two daughters, including: *Sir Nicholas Slanning, 1st Baronet (1643‚Äì1691), granted a baronetcy by the restored King Charles II. *Elizabeth (died 1724), who married Sir James Modyford, 1st Baronet, Deputy Governor of Jamaica and had issue: her descendants were to inherit the Slanning estates after her brother's line died out. *Margaret, who married Sir John Molesworth, but had no children. The younger Sir Nicholas left one son and heir, Sir Andrew Slanning, 2nd Baronet. Andrew was murdered by John Cowland after a drunken brawl in a Convent Garden tavern in 1700. He was the last of the Slannings: his estates passed to the heirs of his aunt Lady Modyford.

He was killed in Warsaw by members of the Polish resistance movement. Early career Sym was born in Innsbruck, the son of Anton Sym, a Pole from Niepo≈Çomice in Galicia, and his Austrian wife Julia (n√©e Sepp). During World War I he served in the Austro-Hungarian Army, becoming a lieutenant. After the war, he served in the Polish Armed Forces infantry in the rank of a First Lieutenant, until in 1921 he took up the job of a bank attorney. Sym's movie debut took place in 1925, in a film called Vampires of Warsaw (of which no copy is known to exist). Handsome and athletic, he often played aristocrats and army officers. In 1927 he left for Vienna, where he signed a contract with the Sascha-Film production company. In late 1920s Sym worked mainly in Austria and Germany, appearing with such actresses as Marlene Dietrich, Anny Ondra and Lilian Harvey in silent movies like Die Pratermizzi or Caf√© Elektric directed by Gustav Ucicky. At the beginning of the 1930s, Sym returned to Poland and settled in Warsaw. He largely ceased working in motion pictures, instead appearing on the Warsaw theatre stage. He entertained by singing, dancing and playing the musical saw;Thomas Staedeli Portrait of the actor Igo Sym. he notably taught Dietrich to play the instrument.Daniel Spoto: Marlene Dietrich. Heyne Verlag, M√ºnchen 1992, pg. 61. Collaboration After the Invasion of Poland on 1 September 1939, Sym stayed in German-occupied Warsaw. Known before the war for his pro- German stance, the actor signed the Volksliste, thus becoming a Volksdeutscher.Bernhard Chiari; Jerzy Kochanowski (2003) Die polnische Heimatarmee, p. 449, Oldenbourg Verlag, Because of his fame, the Germans considered him an asset in legitimizing their authority. The General Government's propaganda department therefore made him director of Warsaw's Theater der Stadt Warschau, formerly Teatr Polski (the Polish Theater). Sym was also director of the Nur f√ºr Deutsche cinema, the Helgoland (formerly the Palladium), and licensee of the Teatr Komedia. Sometime in late 1939, Sym became a Gestapo agent. According to preserved documents, he had collaborated with Berlin since before 1 September 1939. At the beginning of the war he helped set a trap which caught actress Hanka Ordon√≥wna (who had been Sym's prewar screen partner and a friend from Warsaw's theaters). Polish resistance quickly learned about this, and a group of agents led by Teatr Komedia actor Roman Niewiarowicz started tracking Sym's activities. On film set of Heimkehr, 1941 On 10 October 1941 the film Heimkehr debuted in Berlin's Ufa-Palast am Zoo cinema. The Nazi propaganda movie directed by Gustav Ucicky told a story about the pre-1939 German minority in Poland's Volhynia, resettled during Nazi‚ÄìSoviet population transfers. The Germans, presented as noble, peace- loving people, were brutally persecuted by vicious Poles. In the final scene, Polish soldiers lead arrested Germans to execution; however, Wehrmacht airplanes and tanks appear, saving the community. Igo Sym did not perform in the film, but he actively collaborated in its production, casting Polish actors who were more or less willing to take part. Several actors refused, including Kazimierz Junosza-Stƒôpowski. Sym finally found some actors who were accepted by director Ucicky. After the war, these actors were punished for collaborating with the Germans. Igo Sym's collaboration with the Germans contrasts with the conduct of his younger brother Ernest who, during his official activities as a chemist, clandestinely produced explosives for Poland's Home Army. Assassination In early 1941, the headquarters of the underground Polish resistance group Union of Armed Struggle (ZWZ) decided to liquidate the collaborator. Sym's behavior was loudly trumpeted by the Nazis, and his assassination would show the Poles that the underground movement was active, always ready to punish all traitors. At first, the ZWZ planned to poison the actor, but later decided to shoot him instead. When Roman Niewiarowicz informed the ZWZ that Sym would leave for Vienna on March 8, 1941, the resistance decided to kill the collaborator before that date. To carry out the assassination, the ZWZ selected the commando group \\"ZOM\\" of the Intelligence Department of the Warsaw-City District, led by Bohdan \\"Szary\\" Rogoli≈Ñski. At 7:10 a.m. on March 7, 1941, two Polish agents knocked at the door of Sym's 4th floor apartment at 10 Mazowiecka Street in Warsaw. The agents ‚Äì Rogoli≈Ñski and Roman \\"Srebrny\\" Rozmi≈Çowski ‚Äì told Sym that they were postmen carrying a dispatch. Both were covered by Wiktor \\"Ma≈Çy\\" Klimaszewski. On opening the door, Sym was asked to confirm his name, which he did. One of the agents then shot Sym dead with a Vis pistol. Aftermath SS- Gruppenf√ºhrer Paul Moder announcement of execution of \\"a number of detainees\\" in retaliation of death of Igo Sym. On the same day, German loudspeakers on the streets announced that hostages had been taken as revenge for Sym's death. Then, posters signed by a Dr. Ludwig Fischer appeared on the walls stating that more hostages would be taken and curfew would be enforced from 8 p.m. to 5 a.m. Fischer threatened to shoot all hostages unless those responsible for assassination were found. All theatres were closed, and about 120 people were arrested, including teachers, physicians, lawyers and actors. The population of Warsaw was given three days to find Sym's murderers. As nobody was found, on March 11 in Palmiry, 21 hostages were executed. Several actors were also arrested and sent to Auschwitz, among them such notable figures as directors Stefan Jaracz and Leon Schiller.

It is from , which is the primary station and western terminus of the railway. Pendre is the site of the railway's locomotive and carriage sheds, and engineering works.\\"Talyllyn Handbook\\", 1983, by the Talyllyn Railway Preservation Society Passenger trains stop at Pendre by request only. 'Pendre' is Welsh for 'End-of-town'.  History  =Pre-preservation=  Construction  Layout of Pendre, around 1900 The wooden station building was ready for the opening of the line in November/December 1866. Building work for the workshops and sheds on this site started as soon as the railway was open to transport building materials to the site. The first buildings were completed by February 1867. The buildings consisted of: an engine shed with an attached cottage on the east end, for the engine-driver (the cottage was later occupied by the crossing-keeper), an adjoining workshop, the combined length of both of these buildings, to the south; and a single road carriage shed (now known as the \\"south carriage shed\\"). All these buildings (apart from the carriage shed, which was built of timber) were built out of slate blocks, and all had slate roofs (this slate was from the Bryn-Eglwys quarry).  Operation  From February 1867, Pendre was the passenger terminus at Tywyn. By 1877, passengers were being carried from Tywyn Wharf, though these trains were not advertised until 1909 and didn't appear on timetables until 1912. Wharf station did not have a run- round loop until 1952, so the locomotive propelled its empty carriages back to Pendre after their last train of the day. This operation continues even after the installation of the loop at Wharf, as the carriage sheds all have western enterences. = Post-preservation= Layout of Pendre, 1999 In 1959, construction started on a 2-road carriage shed on the site of a former hay barn. This also had an attached building which houses a Joinery, admin, engineering stores, electrical stores, automatic telephone exchange, and offices. This work was completed in 1963, and is known as the \\"North Carriage Shed\\". In 1962, the south carriage shed was rebuilt with steel frames. The loop was extended in the winter of 1967/1968.\\"Talyllyn news\\" ‚Äì the quarterly newsletter of the Talyllyn Railway Preservation Society ‚Äì issue no.261 In 1968, the cottage to the east end of the engine shed became unoccupied, so the engine shed was extended into the cottage. In 1972, work commenced on a 2-road carriage-shed (known as the \\"west carriage shed\\") and paint-shop at the west end of the site, which has since been extended to , which can accommodate ten of the railway's bogie carriages. A covered block-post with was built at the same time, which controls the points in the yard, and contains a 15-lever ground frame for controlling the pointwork in the yard, and also contains electric key token machines for the railway's block working system. The final major change at Pendre came in late 1983, when the gated level crossing ‚Äì which is just to the east of the station ‚Äì was widened and provided with new gates. The old gates are now in the children's playground at . In 2018, the society decided to launch a project to provide additional workshop and carriage shed facilities at Pendre. In 2019, the railway purchased a large area of land opposite the west carriage shed - known as \\"The Orchard\\" - as part of this project .

It was built in 1867 to serve local farms, and the village of Bryn-crug. The name 'Rhyd-yr-onen' means 'Ford of the ash tree'.  Construction  The station building and original platform are primarily constructed out of slate blocks from Bryn-Eglwys quarry. The platform surface is slate chippings and is edged with slate slabs. The 1990s platform extension uses concrete breeze blocks.  History  = Origins and early history = The station opened in February 1867, four months after the start of passenger services on the railway. The station is named after a nearby stream, the Nant Rhyd-yr-onnen (this stream is also known as the Nant Braich-y-Rhiw), which itself is named after the road's ford over it, just north of the station (now replaced with a bridge). It is along the railway from , and was the first intermediate station to open on the railway. A station building and platform was provided on the north side of the track, as the carriages had been modified to have doors only on this side for safety reasons. Steps were provided to the road on the south side, for passengers wishing to travel (across the track) southwards. The station had a passing loop at its western end, first shown on Ordnance Survey maps in 1901, to serve a slate quarry and manganese mine. A mineral tramway had been planned to serve the mine and quarries, but the necessary agreements were not reached with the local landowner Dr. Corbett. The outputs of the quarries and mine therefore had to be taken by road to the station, and the business soon failed. The loop soon fell into disuse and the west points were removed.\\"Talyllyn News\\" ‚Äì the TRPS' quarterly newsletter, issue number 260, pages 40, 41, & 42. Around the 1930s there appears to have been an accident here involving a goods van, and for several decades the van's body lay rotting beside the road bridge. During the Victorian era, the railway promoted the destination to tourists through references to a nearby chalybeate spring, and bottled water was produced here around the 1910s. = Preservation era = The siding was still in a good enough condition (relative to the rest of the permanent way of the railway) to be used as a refuge siding in 1951. This allowed the first train operated by the preservation society to run round. The train was hand-shunted past the locomotive, which was stabled in the siding. The remaining siding was removed during track renewals in early 1954, but it was reinstated, as a full loop, in the winter of 1956/1957, and was usable by late January. The loop was never used as a passing place for public train services during preservation; its main role was as an engineers' siding. Rhydyronen was used for rail storage at the time, and also for the stabling of a locomotive ‚Äì or the railway's motor trolley following the building of this machine ‚Äì for the transport of railway volunteers, most notably Hugh Jones, who lived, or were staying on holiday, nearby. The west end points of the new loop were removed in 1971, again because of the economic costs of maintaining the points, of what was a double- ended engineers' siding ‚Äì which saw limited use. The remaining siding was removed, with the east points, in August 1977.\\"Talyllyn news\\" ‚Äì the quarterly newsletter of the Talyllyn Railway Preservation Society ‚Äì issue no.252, page 2.

It is from . A station building and platform are provided on the north side of the track, as the railway's carriages have been modified to have doors only on this side for safety reasons. The station building is a Grade II listed structure. The name 'Brynglas' was taken from a local farm, and means 'Blue hill'. There are level crossings on both sides of the station: one to the east, for a farm track, and on to the west, for the public road to Pandy. The road crossing was originally a brick arch bridge, which now serves as a cattle creep. There is also a bridge over the Afon Cwm- Pandy. The station was originally situated between the two bridges, but the platform has since been extended in both directions such that it now stretches between both level crossings. The river bridge was rebuilt to carry the extended platform.  History  = Pre-preservation=  Before the station  When the Talyllyn Railway was built in 1865, there was no station at Brynglas. The site of the station was on a smooth curve, which had two brick arch underbridges in it, crossing the road to Pandy and the Afon Cwm- Pandy river. The road bridge had a headroom of only , and was replaced with a level crossing in mid-1866, after a request from local residents in that February. The alignment of the railway was slewed southwards at about the same time, to ease the gradient on the road leading to the (new) level crossing, and because it had brick arches experienced settlement, probably caused by uneven compression of the underlying soil. A new girder bridge was constructed over the road/cattle creep, with cast iron -beam girders resting on brick abutments, and the river bridge was also replaced.  Construction  The station was opened in July 1872 (when it first appeared in Bradshaw's Guide), between the two bridges. The station is accessed off the public road, the disused northern arch being used to cross the cattle creep (former road bridge). A station building and platform, both built out of slate-blocks, being provided for waiting passengers. The platform surface is slate chippings, edged with slate slabs.  Slate quarrying  A short goods siding was provided on the west side of the western level crossing, for the Cwm-pandy slate quarry, a small slate quarry at . The quarry was short-lived, opening in 1877 and closing around 1880. Despite the quarry's closure, the siding built for it was never removed, and was used for goods to local farms. = Post-preservation = In 1953, the goods siding was converted into a passing loop. It was extended westwards in 1961. A further siding was laid on the south side of the loop in 1975, for wagon storage. The points for the loop and siding are controlled by a six-lever ground frame by the level crossing, which was covered in the 1960s, for the comfort of blockmen. The cabin also contains the electric key token equipment to allow trains to pass here, in accordance with the railway's Block Working System. Around 6 p.m. on 10 June 1993, a heavy, although very localised, thunderstorm in the mountains to the south of Brynglas caused a flash flood down the Cwm Pandy valley, and much debris was deposited on the Pandy hamlet and station. In the passing loop west of the station a hedge was swept away by the flood, and the embankment was severely eroded. The train service was cancelled until the afternoon of 14 June, whilst the track-work was cleared of debris. The embankment was not fully repaired until 3 July. The platform was extended in the 1990s, which entailed rebuilding the river bridge to carry the platform (the cattle creep was crossed by the existing brick arch). The block-cabin to the west of the station was modified around 2010, by having the southern (track-facing) wall moved northwards. In November 2007, the level crossing to the west of the station (over the public road to Pandy) was replaced. A timber surface was provided. In February 2010, The farm crossing to the east of the station was replaced, the new crossing being built out of concrete. The road crossing to the west of the station was again replaced in November 2019, at the same time as the adjacent cattle creep's deck. This was because cattle creep's main girders had been found to be severely rusted, and were made of cast iron. A new bridge, made of concrete with steel girders, and a new road crossing, made of concrete, were both provided.  In fiction  In The Railway Series by Rev. Wilbert Awdry, Glennock station on the Skarloey Railway was partly based on this station.

It is from . Unlike most places on the line, the station was built for tourist traffic, for visitors to the local Dolgoch Falls. To the west of the station, there is three-span brick viaduct that carries the railway over the Dolgoch Ravine. This is the largest engineering structure on the railway; it is high. It is also a grade II listed structure. The railway passes through rock cuttings either side of the viaduct. This is an important stopping point, despite the lack of significant passenger facilities, because all steam trains take water here on the \\"up\\" (eastwards) journey, from one of the two \\"up\\" tanks; it is important on the \\"down\\" (westwards) journey because all passengers have their tickets checked here on the down journey. There are three water towers in total at the station; two at the east end of the station for up trains, and one at the west end for down trains. The original water tower is the western of the up towers. The name 'Dol-g√¥ch' means 'Red-meadow'. It was taken from the nearby stream, the Nant Dolgoch (known at the time as the Nant Dol-g√¥ch).  History  = Pre-preservation = When the line was built in 1865, a water tower was provided, built of slate blocks from the Bryn-Eglwys Quarry, with a wooden tank. The passenger station was open by August 1867 (when it was listed in Bradshaw's Guide), and a station building and small platform were provided for passengers. Both were built out of slate blocks, and the platform had a surface of slate chippings, edged with slate slabs (this slate was from the Bryn-Eglwys Quarry, brought to the site by rail). The station did not appear in Brawdshaw's Guide from November 1867 until July 1872 (the same time as was opened),, which has mislead many sources to quote 1872 as its opening date. Some slate quarrying was carried out at the nearby Dolgoch quarry during the early years of the railway, and it is believed that a siding was provided here for them. Prospecting for the quarry started in January 1868, however it was not until January 1877 that a quarry opened in the ravine. This quarry appears to have been initially successful, however a major storm in August 1880 brought the quarry into a terminal decline and it closed in April 1884. =Post-Preservation= In 1958, a footbridge was built over the railway immediately west of the station, to provide more direct access to the Dolgoch Falls. In 1961, the platform was extended in both directions to accommodate longer trains. A new steel water tower was added at the east end of the new platform, and is now the main tower for up trains. The original water tower has since been reconditioned and is used occasionally. The platform extensions are of a similar construction as the original platform; the only difference in their construction is that the slate used on the extensions was not from the Bryneglwys quarry. The platform surface of the entire platform, including the extensions, was changed during the construction of the platform extensions; the platform now has a tarmac surface (the slate slab edging was not changed). In 1987, the platform was widened, and the surface renewed again. In the 2000s, a further steel water tower was built at the west end of the platform, which is used by some down trains. Around 2010, a toilet block was added to the station, just to the west of the station building.  In popular culture  In The Railway Series by Rev.

Buildings and Station layout The original station building was built for the opening of the railway to passenger services in 1867. It was of timber construction ‚Äì like the station building at (which was the only other passenger station on the railway when the railway was opened). The station was not built out of slate, like all the other stations on the railway, because it was built before the railway's construction finished, when there was no slate from the Bryn Eglwys quarry to build it out of. A platform was provided for passengers, on the north side of the line. A siding was provided at the west end of the station, just before the start of the run-round loop. The date at which this was first laid is unknown, but it was between 1889 and 1901; it was taken out of use shortly before the First World War. The siding was reinstated during the Second World War to load pit props from nearby forests to be taken down to Tywyn. The siding was removed again in the early 1950s. In the 1930s, the station building was replaced, because the original building was in need of extensive repairs which would have been uneconomical to do. The new building was built out of slate blocks, like most of the other buildings on the railway. The west end of the building was used as a lookout post for the Home Guard during the Second World War, and gunports were cut in the west wall of the station. = Post-preservation = Operation The watering point at Ty Dwr fell out of use in the early 1950s, shortly after preservation. In 1955, the tower was removed as the slate was needed to build a retaining wall at the site of a major landslip approximately south of . In December 2018, a project was launched to re-build the water tower. In 1976, the -long mineral extension to the foot of the Alltwyllt incline was re-opened for passenger services. was built at the new terminus. Abergynolwyn remains the principal station at the eastern end of the line as it has better passenger facilities than Nant Gwernol. Buildings The station building was replaced again in 1969, with a larger building, also constructed out of slate, as the 1930s structure was both in need of much repair and too small to serve the increasing tourist traffic being carried. This newest building has since been extended to the west, the extension looking externally similar to the original wooden station building. When the railway was extended to Nant Gwernol, it became necessary to accommodate two trains simultaneously, so the platform was extended to long, believed to have been the longest platform on narrow gauge railway in Britain at the time. A signal box with a 14-lever lever frame was also constructed at the same time. The base of the signal box was constructed out of slate blocks salvaged from derelict buildings in the Bryn Eglwys quarry. On 6 May 1991, a toilet block was opened just to the north-east of the station building.  In fiction  In The Railway Series by Rev. Wilbert Awdry, Skarloey station on the Skarloey Railway was based on this station.

It was established in 1955 in Jamshoro, Sindh.Sindh Adabi Board scheme for world class literature in cold storage It is under the Education Department of the Government of Sindh. Activities The organization has published Sindhi folklore, poetry, lexicography, archaeology and original literary works. These works have included anthologies of poetry works of Shah Abdul Latif Bhittai, Sachal Sarmast, Chen Rai Sami, Khalifo Nabi Bux Laghari, Miyoon Shah Inayat, Hamal Khan Laghari, Talib-ul- Mola and other mystic poets of Sindh. The Board has published translations of selected works, manuscripts and other writings from world literature into the Sindhi language. Background Sindhi literature has been in existence for around five thousand years, through the civilizations of Moen-jo-Daro, Amri and Bhambhore. The Vedic texts were written by the banks of Sindhu (the River Indus) in Pakistan. Literary relics in British museums today show Buddhist influences over early literary works. With the advent of Arabs, Sindh received the cultural impact of Islam, and the first complete translation of the Qur'an was completed in 884 CE in Sindh. The Soomra Dynasty (1026 to 1351 CE) was a period of renaissance of the Sindh language in literature. Religious verse also took life in this period; Pir Sadaruddin was a pioneer of verse who invented Ginan as a new genre in Sindhi literature. The Sama period is known as the golden age of Sindhi verse. Qazi Kadan, Shaikh Hamad, Ishaq Aahangar and Mamooi Fakirs were the leading poets of this period. The times of the Arghons, the Trakhans and the Mughal Empire (1526 to 1858) gave rise to nationalistic feelings in Sindhi literature. The verse of Makhdoom Nooh Sarwar, Lutfullah Kadri, and Shah Inayat Rizvi convey the suffering experienced by the local people throughout 250 years of occupation. The time of the Kalhora Dynasty (1701 to 1783) is known as the summit of success of Sindhi literature. The Kalhoras were indigenous people of Sindh. Mystic poets like Shah Abdul Latif Bhitai were the product of this period. The verse of Shah Abdul Latif Bhitai not only cast long shadows in social and political directions but also revolutionized the literacy taste and standard. Sachal Sarmast, Chain Rai Sami, Bachoo Mal Lund, Hamal Faqeer Laghari were poets of this period. Though the British were non-native, soon after settling in Sindh they took up the task of formalizing Sindhi manuscript and soon succeeded. Sindhi language was standardized and official documents were published in it. This development gave an impetus to Sindhi literature by laying down the foundation for formal publication of Sindhi writing. Creation of the Board It was at this point that think-tanks in Sindh realized the dire need of an organisation which could initiate, supervise and promote the publication of material in Sindhi language. The Federal Advisory Board was created to fill the need in August 1940. In September 1950 a more powerful executive committee was constituted, and in March 1955 the Sindhi Adabi Board was brought into being. Muhammad Ibrahim Joyo served as the first secretary of the Board. The Board was registered with the Assistant Registrar of the Joint Stock Committee in Khairpur. =Board of governors= =Chairman= Makhdoom Jamil uz Zaman was the previous chairman from 4 June 2010 to 2011.

Written by Yes members Jon Anderson and Chris Squire, it was first included on 1971's The Yes Album and has appeared on several later albums. As with many progressive rock songs, the track consists of multiple distinct movements spliced together to form a cohesive longer work. The first movement, titled \\"Your Move\\", was released as a single. It became a top 40 hit in the United States, which helped the group build momentum. Later, album- oriented rock stations would frequently play the entire nearly seven-minute track, including both \\"Your Move\\" and the second movement titled \\"All Good People\\"; this version remains a staple of classic rock stations to today. The tune uses chess as a lyrical metaphor for navigating interpersonal relationships, and contains several allusions to the music of John Lennon. It has received positive reviews from several critics and has been considered one of Yes's best-known songs, with AllMusic's Mike DeGagne stating that \\"the harmonies are resilient from start to finish\\" and that the track \\"still stands as one of their most appealing\\" works. Music critic Robert Christgau has also singled it out for praise. Lyrics The first part of the song, \\"Your Move\\", alludes to the game of chess as a metaphor for male‚Äìfemale relationships. Examples include the phrases \\"move me onto any black square\\", \\"make the white queen run so fast\\", and \\"the goal is for us all to capture only one\\". A reference to John Lennon's work is in the lyric \\"send an instant karma to me\\", with \\"Instant Karma!\\" being a single released by Lennon in 1970. Also, the sentence \\"All we are saying is give peace a chance\\" is heard in the organ part before switching to \\"All Good People\\", referencing another Lennon song, \\"Give Peace a Chance\\". More generally, Anderson has stated that the line \\"'cause it's time, it's time in time with your time\\" was an attempt to say that he would \\"do anything that is required of me to reach God\\" and that he wants the listener to feel \\"in tune and in time with God.\\" Just before the three-minute mark of the song, at the final part of \\"Your Move\\", the chorus of Lennon's \\"Give Peace a Chance\\" can be heard in the background.John Anderson, Former Yes Frontman, Pays Tribute to John Lennon in California Composition and legacy In the studio recording on The Yes Album, the song opens with Jon Anderson, Chris Squire and Steve Howe singing the sentence \\"I've seen all good people turn their heads each day so satisfied I'm on my way\\" twice a cappella, in three-part harmony. This is followed by a solo intro by Steve Howe on a Portuguese 12-string guitar. Howe also sometimes plays the solo on a standard acoustic guitar. As the 12-string begins a repeated four-bar phrase, it is joined by bass drum as Anderson resumes singing the lyrics, solo and in three- part harmony. Dual recorders enter on the third verse. Finally, a Hammond organ joins them, playing the same chords as the la√∫d until the first part of the song ends on a loudly sustained and unresolved organ chord. The second part, \\"All Good People\\", consists of many repetitions of the sentence \\"I've seen all good people turn their heads each day so satisfied I'm on my way\\" sung to the same melody as before, but over a driving country rock accompaniment, ending in a powerful vocal harmony and organ phrase which begins on a chord progression of E, D, C, G, then A. Each repetition of the verse is one whole step lower than the previous as the song fades out. Anderson has stated that he wanted to have the song develop quietly but then open up into a big grandiose, church organ sound. Village Voice critic Robert Christgau called the song a \\"great cut\\", being one in which he thought Yes' \\"arty eclecticism comes together.\\" The song has been included on several compilation albums, such as 1981's Classic Yes and 2004's The Ultimate Yes, since its initial release on The Yes Album in 1971. Having been performed many times during Yes' tours, a live version was most recently released on the 'Like It Is: Yes at the Bristol Hippodromehttps://www.amazon.com/Like-Yes-at- Bristol-Hippodrome/dp/B00P2WQXM0 album, which was distributed through Frontiers Records.

Reitz was a native of Kansas, and earned bachelor's, master's and doctorate degrees in his chosen field. After working as an agricultural economist, university professor and U.S. government agricultural administrator, Reitz was selected to be the fifth president of the University of Florida, serving from 1955 until 1967.University of Florida, Past Presidents, J. Wayne Reitz (1955-1967) . Retrieved October 24, 2012.  Early life and education  Wayne Reitz was born on New Year's Eve, 1908, in Olathe, Kansas.University of Florida, J. Wayne Reitz Union, J. Wayne Reitz Union History . Retrieved August 28, 2009. His parents later moved his family to Canon City, Colorado, where he graduated from high school in 1926, and was admitted to Colorado State University in Fort Collins, Colorado. While he was a university student, he was a member of Sigma Chi Fraternity (Beta Tau Chapter), the editor of the Silver Spruce yearbook, freshman class president, student body president, and the winner of the Rocky Mountain Oratory Award. Reitz received his bachelor's degree in 1930. After graduating with a bachelor of science degree, Reitz started work as an agricultural extension economist, first at Colorado State, and then at the University of Illinois in Urbana-Champaign, where he earned his master of science degree in 1935. That same year, after accepting an assistant professorship in agricultural economics at the University of Florida in Gainesville, Florida, Reitz married Frances Huston Millikan. After being promoted to full professor, Reitz returned to his formal studies at the University of Wisconsin in Madison, Wisconsin, where he earned his doctor of philosophy degree in 1941. Reitz left academic life in 1944 to work as an economic consultant for the United Growers and Shippers Association. Four years later, he became Chief of the Citrus Fruits Section in the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA). In 1949, President J. Hillis Miller prompted Reitz to return to the University of Florida by appointing him the university's provost for agriculture. During his time as provost, he was also appointed to the administrative boards of the Escuela Agr√≠cola Panamericana in Tegucigalpa, Honduras, and the Instituto Interamericano de Ciencias Agr√≠colas de la OEA in Turrialba, Costa Rica.  University president  = Selection as president = University of Florida president J. Hillis Miller Sr.'s sudden and unexpected death in November 1953 started a lengthy search for his successor. In 1954, the Florida Board of Control named Philip G. Davidson, then president of the University of Louisville, as the university's new chief executive.Associated Press, \\" Control Board Will Not Meet Until January,\\" Ocala Star-Banner, p. 3 (December 23, 1954). Retrieved March 9, 2010. Davidson, however, withdrew his name when controversial Acting Florida Governor Charley Johns refused to sign his payroll warrant. A new search was initiated and, two and a half months after Acting Governor Johns was replaced by the newly elected LeRoy Collins, the Board of Control settled on Reitz as its choice to be the university's fifth president on March 22, 1955. He was the first University of Florida faculty member to be elevated to the position. = Growth and expansion = During Reitz's term, more than 300 new campus buildings were erected at an approximate cost of $50 million. The buildings constructed and expanded during his term included a new health center, a nuclear training reactor, an educational television station, and a married- student housing complex. Along with the new buildings, Reitz tightened admissions standards and placed greater emphasis on academic achievement in matters ranging from the awarding of financial aid to the development of advanced placement procedures. Reitz expanded the graduate school through the addition of new programs and centers (especially the Latin American Language and Area Center) and created the Division of Sponsored Research to increase funding opportunities for research. His wife, a gracious hostess to countless dignitaries and students, also took an active role in advancing the university's music program. The facilities expansion coincided with a doubling of the student population from 9,000 to 18,000 during his tenure. In 1960, Reitz was initiated as an honorary member of the Alpha Phi chapter of Alpha Kappa Psi.Alpha Phi Chapter Member Roll = Controversy, the Johns Committee, and integration = The Reitz years were not without controversy. Strict behavior guidelines, dress codes, and a faculty disciplinary committee to enforce these rules all received Reitz's strong endorsement. In the early 1960s, the Florida Legislative Investigation Committee, led by state senator Charley Johns, accused twenty-two university employees and several students of homosexual conduct. Those that would not resign were summarily discharged or expelled. One attempted suicide. The denial of tenure to Marshall Jones, a psychiatrist active in radical causes, led to censure by the American Association of University Professors. Reitz has been criticized for not opposing or even welcoming Johns' investigation; Johns was a friend who at one point parked his car in Reitz's driveway, with Reitz's permission. \\"Reitz happily allowed Johns on campus.\\" This differs from the reactions of the Florida State University and University of South Florida's presidents. The campus did not witness significant integration-era disruption. The University of Florida was the first state university to integrate, and racial integration was achieved there with far less turmoil than most Southern universities and colleges. The University's relative openness to racial immigration was one reason the Johns Committee (completely opposed to integration) focused on the University of Florida; the Committee's first focus was to be the NAACP and any other outsiders who were communist or communist-leaning. (The NAACP was widely viewed as Northerners coming to the South and stirring up trouble, and integration was linked to communism, which was in turn believed to be linked with homosexuality as a threat to national security.) The first African- American student was allowed to enroll in the College of Law in September 1958. Reitz's close relationship with the student body was instrumental in curbing attempts to resist the court order to integrate. Reitz, however, had more trouble with state governors. He opposed LeRoy Collins' 1957 attempt to create a chancellor system, and he had to fend off attempts by subsequent governors to assume control of the university's day-to-day operations. A 1965 showdown with Governor Haydon Burns over budgetary matters almost ended in Reitz's resignation. After a year of relative calm, Reitz announced he would resign in January 1967, citing \\"presidential fatigue,\\" but remained in office until Florida Supreme Court Justice Stephen C. O'Connell was sworn in as the university's new president.  Post-presidency  After resigning as university president, Reitz served as the director of graduate programs in the U.S. Office of Education, and eventually returned to his international activities. In addition to his Latin American work, Reitz was named to the Rockefeller Foundation's Board of Agricultural Consultants and, in 1964, he accepted an appointment to the Public Advisory Committee for Trade Negotiations. These responsibilities carried him to several nations as a teacher and adviser. His most extensive overseas assignment was to Mahidol University in Bangkok, Thailand, where he served as a consultant to the university rector. Reitz was said to have led one of the largest expansions of the campus physical plant and the new J. Wayne Reitz Union was renamed for Reitz after his retirement in 1967.University of Florida Foundation, UF Named Facilities, J. Wayne Reitz Union. Retrieved February 16, 2009. In retirement, Reitz became an important fundraiser for local charities as well as the University of Florida. He continued to work for the University of Florida Foundation's development office until his death on Christmas Eve 1993. Four years after his death, in 1997, the university established the merit-based Reitz Scholars Program to recognize and encourage academic achievement, leadership and service among its undergraduate students.University of Florida, Student Affairs, Reitz Scholars Program.

He appeared in 129 films between 1920 and 1938. Biography Fries was born in St. Louis, Missouri and died in 1938 in Los Angeles, California at age 50. He was the father of National Football League player Sherwood Fries. Fries became a dapper-looking supporting comic with a varied background in medicine shows and vaudeville. He easily transitioned to film in the early 1910s. By 1915, he was with the Keystone Cops and entered a lifelong friendship with Stan Laurel, which led to appearances in that star comedian's early films for Bronco Billy Anderson. Not surprisingly, Fries later landed at Hal Roach Studios, where he supported not only Laurel & Hardy and Charley Chase but also such lesser stars as Max Davidson and James Finlayson. Sound proved no hindrance and Fries would appear in many of Roach's German-language talkies, as well as characters in many of the Our Gang shorts. Often cast as inebriates, detectives, and bartenders (with a memorable turn as a Blacksmith matching wits with a delinquent 9-year-old in Roach's Readin' and Writin'), Fries played scores of bit parts and walk-ons in grade-A films. One of his more notable appearances was as a shiphand in the Marx Brothers' Monkey Business.

During his time as a professor, Hume also served as the horticulturalist and botanist with the university- affiliated Florida Agricultural Experiment Station. He was a published author and recognized expert on the cultivation of citrus fruits and pecans. Hume left the Florida Experiment Station after five years to accept a similar position with the North Carolina Agricultural Experiment Station in Raleigh, North Carolina. Hume returned to Florida to accept a position as the general manager of the Glen St. Mary Nurseries Company, a leading grower of citrus trees. He remained with the company from 1917 to 1929, later serving as the company's president and then the chairman of its board of directors. Hume continued to write and publish articles during this time, notably including The Cultivation of Citrus Fruits (1926), which became a standard reference in the field. He rejoined the faculty of the University of Florida in Gainesville, Florida in 1930, was appointed dean of the College of Agriculture in 1938, and became the provost for agriculture in 1943. During the early 1930s, He was one of the key researchers working on methods to eradicate the Mediterranean fruit fly infestation that was threatening Florida's citrus industry. Hume was appointed the university's interim president when president John J. Tigert resigned in 1947, and he continued to serve as the dean of the College of Agriculture at the same time. He was known for spending ten hours a day in his office, keeping up with his duties as president as well as dean of the agriculture college.

It is based on the 1894 novel Trilby by George du Maurier. The title character in this Gothic tale is a vocal coach who uses hypnotism to transform the tone-deaf Trilby into an acclaimed singer and steals her away from Little Billie, a sculptor for whom she has posed. At first the girl can remember nothing about her past, but as her memory slowly returns, she attempts to break free from her possessive mentor. The musical has been staged twice, both times with Chuck Wagner as Svengali and Linda Eder (Wildhorn's then future, now ex-wife) as Trilby. It premiered at the Alley Theatre in Houston, Texas in April 1991 and won the Alton Jones Foundation Award for New American Musicals. It was then produced at the Asolo Repertory Theatre in Sarasota, Florida in October 1991 through November 2, 1991. The director was Gregory Boyd.

He played parts of three seasons from until and was on the New York Yankees disabled list during the 1981 and 1982 seasons. A first-round pick by the Oakland Athletics in the 1975 Major League Baseball Draft, Robinson's career was derailed by an automobile accident while playing for the New York Yankees in 1980. He never returned to the majors, though he continued to play in the minor leagues in 1983, with the Pittsburgh Pirates AAA affiliate in Hawaii and in 1984 with the A's in Tacoma and Modesto. During that time, Robinson was a player-coach for the Modesto A's in , where he worked with future stars Mark McGwire and Jose Canseco. Early years Bruce Robinson was born in La Jolla, California, a beach community within the city of San Diego. Robinson is the youngest of three: brothers John Junior (Skip), Dave, and Bruce were all multi-sport stars in youth leagues and at La Jolla High School. Dave, Bruce's senior by eight years, graduated from San Diego State University and went on to become an outfielder in the Major Leagues with the San Diego Padres. Following his baseball career, Dave became a middle school physical education teacher in San Diego County. Oldest brother \\"Skip\\" was a collegiate pitcher and graduated from the University of California at Santa Barbara. Skip was a career banking executive to the wineries of Sonoma and Napa counties in northern California. After graduating from La Jolla High School in 1972, Bruce was chosen in the fourth round by the Chicago White Sox in the 1972 Major League Baseball draft, but elected to turn down their offer to attend Stanford University on a full baseball scholarship. Robinson received All-American recognition during both summer and college seasons at Stanford, breaking the university's single-season home run record in 1975. To this day, Robinson hit more home runs with a wooden bat in a single season than any other Stanford player. After finishing the school year at Stanford, Robinson joined the top summer collegiate program in the nation, the Alaska Goldpanners of Fairbanks. There he played with dozens of players who went on to stardom in the Major Leagues, helping the Goldpanners win three consecutive national championships at the National Baseball Congress (NBC) Tournament in Wichita, Kansas. Robinson's 1974 squad is widely acclaimed as the best amateur team ever assembled. Professional baseball career Bruce Robinson at Yankee Stadium Bruce Robinson at bat at Yankee Stadium A first- round pick in the 1975 Major League Baseball draft (21st choice overall), Robinson got most of his major league at-bats with the 1978 Oakland Athletics. After batting .299 with 10 home runs and 73 RBI in 102 games with the Vancouver Canadians in 1978, he received a mid-August call-up to the Major League club and hit .250 in 88 plate appearances over the final 28 games of the season. In 1980 Robinson, along with New York Yankees teammate Dave Righetti, was involved in a car accident in which his right shoulder sustained a career-impacting injury, necessitating reconstruction in May 1981. A drunken driver rear-ended Robinson and Righetti in Robinson's car. The resulting shoulder injury prevented Robinson from being the left-handed side of a catching platoon with the Yankees in 1981, and he missed both the 1981 and 1982 seasons while on the disabled list, and never made it back to the Major Leagues. During spring training in 1984, Robinson led the Oakland A's in batting average but was sent to the Triple-A Tacoma Rainiers, before accepting a player-hitting coach position with Oakland's class-A Modesto A's. Robinson's primary role was working with two young hitters, Mark McGwire (fresh from the 1984 Olympic team) and Jose Canseco, who at the time was under-performing. Robinson's lasting legacy on the game is his invention of the \\"Robby Pad\\" in 1980. The \\"Robby Pad\\", a hinged flap on the throwing shoulder of a catcher's chest protector, began seeing widespread use in the mid-1980s and can be viewed on most every catcher's chest protector from the Major Leagues to youth leagues. One of the original two \\"Robby Pads\\" is in the National Baseball Hall of Fame in Cooperstown, New York. Robinson retained the original prototype and it is framed in his home in Idaho. Robinson is the only former Major League player who can claim an affiliation with both the Baseball Hall of Fame and the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame. On August 24, 2012, Bruce performed 24 original songs as a solo act with his guitar and ukulele on the main stage at the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in Cleveland, Ohio. Music Robinson before his performance at the Rock & Roll Hall of Fame on August 24, 2012 Robinson's first album, It's About Time Robinson's second album, In Good Hands Bruce Robinson's third CD, 3 Robinson showed a love of music at 8 years old, and by age 10, he was saving his weekly allowance to buy 45s for $0.99 and Beatles albums for $3.00. Robinsons's first \\"gig\\" was at a La Jolla Elementary School P.T.A. meeting, singing with group of sixth-grade classmates. The musical group Nau & Them (Jim Nau, Robert McCleod, Tim Fallis, and Robinson) performed two songs made popular by Herman's Hermits, \\"I'm Henery the Eighth, I Am\\" and \\"Mrs. Brown, You've Got a Lovely Daughter\\". Nau & Them recast the members for the following year and played two shows, including the annual La Jolla Fall Carnival, which gave them a dose of rock stardom. The band consisted of Nau (piano & organ), Joe Fawcett (lead guitar & vocals), McCleod (rhythm guitar), Larry Mulvaney (drums), and Robinson (bass guitar and lead vocals). That 1967 performance was the last for him until an open-mic event 41 years later in Twin Falls, Idaho. A serious guitar player since college, Robinson carried a guitar on road trips throughout his baseball career. He started writing songs in 2008 and has written and copyrighted 50 songs through February 2014, 44 of them written since November 2011. Robinson credits a girl he met on the first day of kindergarten at La Jolla Elementary School in 1959 (and reunited with in 2007) with being the person that convinced him to write and perform music. Both songwriting and performing began in October 2008 when he wrote his first song, \\"Not Enough Time\\", and performed seven songs at his first open-mic in Twin Falls, Idaho. =It's About Time= Robinson released his debut self- produced music CD in January 2012, It's About Time, containing 20 original songs. Robinson plays guitar, ukulele, harmonica, banjolele, and provides lead vocals on all the tracks. The album was born out of Robinson's desire to leave a memory of his music for his kids and grandchildren. Originally intended to be a combination of cover songs and a few originals, Robinson wrote 14 songs the month prior to flying to Kansas City to record with a friend he had met at the National Association of Music Merchants (N.A.M.M.) trade show months earlier. =In Good Hands= In mid-July 2012, Robinson re-recorded the 20 songs from his first self-produced CD, and added in 13 new songs in order to have his entire catalog of music fully produced, working with sound engineer, Richard Livoni. Robinson released the album, In Good Hands in October 2012, a two-CD collection of country, blues, jazz, rock, and ballad originals. Robinson sings lead vocals, and plays guitar and ukulele. Backing him are musicians Aristotle Georgio (harmonica), Rick Nash (bass guitar), John Cain (keyboards and accordion), Joe Marillo (saxophone), Katie \\"Cat\\" Catinella (backing vocals), and Richard Blitz (lead guitar, dobro, percussion, and drums). =3= In June 2014, Robinson released his third CD, 3, consisting of 17 new original songs. As with his second CD, 3 leans country, but includes blues, rock, and one jazz tune. The band that backed Robinson for In Good Hands was reassembled for 3, with the addition of a pedal steel player, Tim \\"Steelbone\\" Cook. Personal life Robinson is the son of John Munro Robinson (1917-2017), a University of Minnesota law school graduate and banker/estate planner, and Kathleen (n√©e Tanner) Robinson (1925-2002), a career housewife and homemaker. Robinson's next-oldest brother, Dave Robinson, played in the major leagues for two seasons with the San Diego Padres. Robinson is also the father of Scott Robinson, an ambidextrous first baseman and catcher who played in the Houston Astros and Seattle Mariners organizations, was league MVP with the Macon Music, and spent two years as a player-coach with the River City Rascals. After eight years of professional baseball, Scott attained an engineering degree and is a project manager/superintendent, managing multiple projects in the Bay Area. His daughter Kelly has four children and was an impressive athlete as a child. His youngest son Tommy runs a successful internet company, has a degree in criminology and justice studies, and is a sheriff's deputy and on the SWAT team in Twin Falls, Idaho. When not traveling, Robinson splits time between San Diego and his Idaho home on the Snake River.

Following Android 17 distracting Toppo to allow Gohan to aid Frieza against Dyspo, and Gohan and Dyspo's eliminations, Android 17 teams up with Frieza against Toppo, and the two are hit by an attack from Jiren, allowing Toppo to fight Vegeta. After Vegeta eliminates Toppo, Android 17, Goku, and Vegeta attack Jiren together but are outclassed, Android 17 then sneaking up behind Jiren and damaging him. Jiren defeats Goku and Vegeta and proceeds to do the same to Frieza when the latter rejoins the fight. After Android 17 asks of Jiren's wish and Belmod explains Jiren's background of having lost friends and loved ones to a power villain, Android 17 accuses Jiren of using the other members of his team to meet his own ends. Jiren launches an energy blast on Android 17, Goku, and Vegeta, Android 17 holding the attack with a barrier and projecting force fields on Goku and Vegeta to shield them before self-destructing to destroy the blast. Goku thinks about 17's faith in him before assuming the Ultra Instinct form. After Ultra Instinct Goku is nearly eliminated by Jiren, 17 resurfaces with Frieza and resumes his participation in the fight. Combined attacks by 17 and Frieza destroy Jiren's barrier and following Goku and Frieza teaming up to take Jiren out of the ring, Android 17 becomes the only contestant remaining, winning the tournament and wishing for all the universes erased during the tournament to be restored. Shortly after the Tournament of Power, #17, along with #18, arrive to help the Z fighters fight off Moro's henchman once they arrive to Earth. = In other media = In the anime-only sequel, Dragon Ball GT, Dr. Gero and Dr. Myuu create a copy of Android 17 by the name of Hell Fighter 17, who meets up with Android 17 and brainwashes him. Android 17 attacks Trunks, confronting Android 18 with a proposed merge and using the same telepathic ability to try brainwashing her into complying, until Krillin brings her back to her senses, causing Android 17 to fatally injure him. Android 18 attacks Android 17, though he overwhelms her as she blocks an attack intended for her daughter Marron. Android 17 departs to meet his copy and the two fuse to form Super 17, defeating the heroes and under orders from Dr. Myuu, kills Dr. Gero again. Super 17 gives Goku trouble during their ensuring fight as he is able to absorb all of his attacks. After Android 18 arrives, seeking revenge for Krillin's murder, Android 17's psyche is able to take control of the fused form, killing Dr. Myuu and revealing to Goku and Android 18 that Super 17 is not able to move and absorb energy at the same time. Goku then kills Super 17 using the Super Dragon Fist as Super 17 is unable to absorb the attack. Android 17 is later revived with the Dragon Balls. Android 17 appears in multiple Dragon Ball Z games. In the 2005 game Dragon Ball Z: Budokai Tenkaichi, Android #17 becomes Super 17 and is confronted by Cell, Super 17 showing an interest in killing Goku before being defeated. In the 2011 game Dragon Ball Z: Ultimate Tenkaichi, Androids 17 and 18 fight the player and lose their Dragon Balls and radar after being defeated. In the 2015 game Dragon Ball Xenoverse, Android 17 is empowered by Towa as part of her plan to erase Trunks from existence, the player causing him to flee. Thanks to this change, Cell is able to absorb 17 and 18 without Trunks interfering. In the 2016 game Dragon Ball Xenoverse 2, Android 17 charges Cell on after the bio android defeats Piccolo and 16, in turn being knocked out by a hit from Cell that sends him flying into Android 18, the unconscious duo being absorbed simultaneously by Cell. When the player intervenes in Android #17's fight with Piccolo, Android #17 is found to have been empowered similarly to Cell, and Trunks warns that he must be stripped of the empowerment before Cell arrives. In an alternate ending, Androids 17 and 18 are prevented from killing Gohan by Trunks distorting the timeline and joining his mentor in facing the pair, leading to the androids' deaths. Android #17 appears in the spin-off manga Dragon Ball SD, being spat out by Cell.  Creation and conception  Androids #17 and 18 were created by Akira Toriyama after his editor at the time, Kazuhiko Torishima, expressed distaste with Androids #19 and #20 shortly after their debut. Torishima complained about the new youthful duo once they were incorporated into the story, resulting in the creation of Cell. Android #17's brief appearance during the Boo arc was originally Lunch, a character not otherwise seen during the second half of the manga. Toriyama: No.17 during the Genki-Dama scene was actually Lunch in the rough draft. Toriyama revealed Android #17's real name as Lapis in 2014. When introduced Android 17 has shoulder length black hair that is parted in the middle, which he retains throughout Dragon Ball Z. He has a black short-sleeved shirt with a white long sleeved undershirt, an orange bandana, blue jeans, green socks and blue shoes. In Dragon Ball GT, he is shown to retain this appearance but also have acquired a tan jacket. In Dragon Ball Super, Android 17's hairstyle becomes identical to Android 18's save for the parted side being the reverse of hers. His outfit now consists of a white and green shirt with blue jeans, black shoes and a tanned belt. He also wears an orange armband with the word \\"Ranger\\" written on it.  Voice actors  Shigeru Nakahara voices Android 17 in all Japanese media. In the English Funimation dub, Android 17 is voiced by Chuck Huber. Huber thought of Android 17 as his biggest role since \\"nobody liked Garlic Jr. as much as they liked Android 17.\\" Besides the aforementioned characters, Huber had previously voiced Emperor Pilaf, Master Shen, and Kibito. Huber considered the role his easiest and a \\"voice actor vacation\\", as under the direction of Christopher Sabat he did not have to put on a voice and was advised to be calmer in his dialect.Hannatalk interview with Chuck Huber Huber personally found the character to be a \\"giant jerk\\" though he liked 17 for the characteristic.  Abilities  Thanks to his conversion into a cyborg, Android #17 possesses superhuman strength, speed, durability, stamina, and reflexes. Similarly to many other characters in Dragon Ball, Android #17 can fly with the use . Android #17 wields the , which involves throwing out his hands to release two arcing electric energy beams after charging them,Dragon Ball: Xenoverse , where Android #17 fires an energy wave from the palm of his hand, and , #17 firing a single energy sphere that inflicts more damage than a normal one. Melee moves include Freedom Kick, where he kicks an opponent multiple times before stomping on them. Additionally, he possesses the rather unique ability to project barriers. While unnamed in the show, in other media the technique is called the . It is a versatile technique whose uses include trapping enemies, protecting oneself from attacks, and even empowering blows with barrier energy. Android #17 is introduced as one of the strongest characters at the time, easily defeating Piccolo and Tienshinhan. After Piccolo receives an increase in power, Android #17 is evenly-matched with him, and #17 is outclassed by Cell after he absorbs thousands of humans.  Reception  Android 17 has been met with positive reception. In the 2004 Dragon Ball Forever poll, Android 17 ranked 18th place for most popular character. Android 17 came in 17th place in Complex.com's list \\"A Ranking of All the Characters on 'Dragon Ball Z', Pearce citing Android 17's disliking of his cybernetics as making him more interesting. Duncan Scott said Android 17 was his favorite of the androids in the series. The fight between Android 17 and Piccolo has been cited as one of the greatest fights in Dragon Ball Z, ranking as the 6th best by Uproxx.com. Reviewer Shawn Saris lamented the lack of attention devoted to his apparent sacrifice in the Tournament of Power: \\"Due to his massive impact on the tournament, and the fact he is now dead (not simply knocked out of the tournament), more time should‚Äôve been given to appreciate the severity of the moment.\\" Android 17's wish to return erased universes was met with mixed reception, being called predictable by some commentators. Alternatively, Saris wrote, \\"The revelation that Zen-Oh would have erased everyone had 17 not wished for everyone to be saved only makes his wish better as it truly highlights how far Android 17 has come in such a short time.\\"  See also  *List of Dragon Ball characters  References  Dragon Ball characters Animated series villains Anime and manga characters who can move at superhuman speeds Anime and manga characters with superhuman strength Comics characters introduced in 1991 Fictional characters with energy-manipulation abilities Fictional cyborgs Fictional defectors Fictional gamekeepers and park rangers Fictional mass murderers Fictional victims of brainwashing and indoctrination Male characters in anime and manga Robot supervillains ","title":"Android 17"},{"id":"13217326","text":"Adolf J√ºlicher (26 January 1857 ‚Äì 2 August 1938) was a German scholar and biblical exegete. Specifically, he was the Professor of Church History and New Testament Exegesis, at the University of Marburg. He was born in Falkenberg near Berlin and died in Marburg. J√ºlicher differentiated between Jesus' parables and allegories. His \\"one-point' analysis identified parables as having a single point of reference to the real world, rather than several, as in an allegory. His approach has not held up completely to later research, but it remains foundational to all investigations of parables and allegories. Ideas =The Messianic Secret= J√ºlicher, along with Johannes Weiss,Johannes Weiss, Christ: The Beginning of Dogma, trans. V. D. Davis (Boston: American Unitarian Association, 1911) was instrumental in forging a consensus position on the new theory of \\"Messianic Secret\\" motif in the Gospel of Mark. Before J√ºlicher, William Wrede had theorized that the historical Jesus had not claimed to be the Messiah, but that the early church had claimed that he was. According to this theory, the author of Mark's gospel had invented the idea of the \\"Messianic Secret\\", whereby Jesus attempted to hide his identity, and only revealed it to a very few insiders.William Wrede, Das Messiasgeheimnis in den Evangelien: Zugleich ein Beitrag zum Verst√§ndnis des Markusevangeliums, (G√∂ttingen: Vandenhoeck & Ruprecht, 1901); English edition, William Wrede, The Messianic Secret, trans. J. C. G. Grieg (Cambridge: James Clarke & Co., 1971). Conservative interpreters of Mark's gospel, exemplified by William SandayWilliam Sanday, The Life of Christ in Recent Research (New York: Oxford University Press, 1907). and Albert Schweitzer,Albert Schweitzer, Von Reimarus zu Wrede (Tubingen: J. C. B. Mohr, 1906); English edition, Albert Schweitzer, The Quest of the Historical Jesus: A Critical Study of its Progress from Reimarus to Wrede, trans. W. Montgomery (New York: Macmillan, 1948). believed instead that Mark's portrayal of Jesus was largely historical. Scholarship was strictly divided for a time, with neither side considering the other's views at all valid.John M. DePoe, The Messianic Secret In The Gospel of Mark: Historical Development and Value of Wrede's Theory, http://www.johndepoe.com/Messianic_secret.pdf . J√ºlicher helped to bridge this divide by suggesting that while many of Wrede's suggestions were correct, other aspects of the Messianic Secret may have been historical. He called Mark's portrayal of Jesus as a taciturn Messiah \\"half-historical\\", and allowed for the analysis of some of Mark's presentation as an accurate depiction (while, at the same time, warning against an uncritical acceptance of these same statements).Adolf J√ºlicher, Neue Linen in der Kritik der evangelischen Uberliefrung (Giessen: Alfred T√∂pelmann, 1906) This helped pave the way to many post-Bultmann theories in the 1950s. =Parables= J√ºlicher also helped to change the understanding of the parables of Jesus among scholars, emphasizing that there was usually a single point of comparison between the story and what it represented.Adolf J√ºlicher, Die Gleichnisreden Jesu (2 vols; T√ºbingen: Mohr [Siebeck], 1888, 1899). He made a distinction between parable and allegory, claiming that a true allegory was a literary type of which Jesus was not aware and did not use. All specific allegorical interpretations of the parables, whether by later church fathers or in the gospels themselves, must have come from sources other than the historical Jesus.Raymond E. Brown, Parable and Allegory Reconsidered, Novum Testamentum, Vol. 5, Fasc. 1. (Jan., 1962), pp. 36-45. Online In contrast, most Medieval scholars saw the parables as elaborate allegories, with each aspect representing something specific.John P. Meier, A Marginal Jew Volume II, Doubleday, 1994. Later, scholars such as C. H. DoddC. H. Dodd, The Parables of the Kingdom (New York: Scribner & Sons, 1961). and Joachim JeremiasJoachim Jeremias, The Parables of Jesus, trans. S. H. Hooke, 2d ed. (New York: Scribner & Sons, 1954). built on J√ºlicher's work, emphasizing each parable's significance in regard to the \\"Kingdom of God\\". Nearly all subsequent scholarship has followed J√ºlicher's ideas in this, although some have seen a slightly wider range of comparisons that he proposed.Mark L. Bailey, Guidelines for Interpreting Jesus' Parables, Bibliotheca Sacra 155: 617 (1998): 29-38. http://www.biblicalstudies.org.uk/article_parables_bailey.htmlRobert H. Stein, An Introduction to the Parables of Jesus, Chapter 5, Westminster John Knox Press, 1981. =Other Ideas= In his thorough Introduction to the New Testament, composed in 1904, J√ºlicher wrote at length about many aspects of Biblical criticism.Adolf J√ºlicher, Einleitung in das Neue Testament. (Siebente Auflage; neubearbeitet in Verbindung mit Erich Fascher.) T√ºbingen: Mohr, 1904; English translation, Adolf J√ºlicher, An Introduction to the New Testament, translated by Janet Penrose Ward (London: Smith, Elder, & Co.). This influential work was still being discussed as contemporary thirty years later.Donald W. Riddle (review author), J√ºlicher's \\"Introduction\\" Re-Edited, \\"The Journal of Religion\\", The University of Chicago Press, 1932. In this text, he gives support to the two-source hypothesis, referring to Q as \\"a collection of the sayings of Jesus, composed without any exercise in conscious art.\\" He held that parts were devised before Mark, and parts after Mark, with no standard version ever existing. Although scholarship on Q is deeply divided and still without consensus, most researchers today believe Q to have been organized, either according to a series of catchwords or as a primitive liturgy, and later editions acknowledge this fact.Alan K. Kirk, The Composition of the Sayings Source: Genre, Synchrony, and Wisdom Redaction in Q (BRILL, 1998). His Introduction was also of interest in its very late dating of the Epistle of James, arguing that it was a disorganized collection of ethical exhortations written after even I Clement. Most of the body of An Introduction succinctly described the latest biblical scholarship of its day.

The main deities of this temple are Lord Krishna in the form of a child, and Goddess Bhadrakali, both having equal importance. There are sub- shrines for Lord Ganesha, Lord Sastha and Brahmarakshas, and there is a sub- temple for Lord Ganesha behind the temple. The temple is one of the two rival groups participating in the Thrissur Pooram, which is the biggest local festival in Kerala. Bhagavad Gita chanting makes the temple alive. Every day the Devaswom gives free lunch to people. History The original seat of the deity was in a village named Edakkalathur, located around 15 km away from Thrissur town towards the north-west. It was also named Thiruvambadi Temple, with the deity installed there as Parthasarathy, meaning the charioteer of Partha (Arjuna). There was another shrine for Lord Shiva too inside the temple, with equal importance. The temple had almost all the features of a Mahakshetra, like golden flag mast. Unfortunately, due to external conflicts, the pious Namboothiris of Edakkalathur were forced to migrate to Thrissur, with the idol of Lord Krishna as Parthasarathy with them. They installed the idol in a Brahmin home named Kachanappally Mana (now extinct), located 200 m away from the present temple. The pious, but childless Brahmin couple of the Mana insatlled the idol inside their homes, and the idol suddenly turned into the form of child Lord Krishna. After the Mana was extinct, a small temple was built in the form of Shala, and installed the idol of Lord Krishna there. This is how the idol of Lord Krishna came here. The family head of Kachanapally Mana was a devotee of Goddess Bhadrakali of the famous Kodungallur Temple, located 40 km away from Thrissur towards the south-west. He regularly used to visit the shrine once in a month. Unfortunately, due to old age, he could not travel to Kodungallur. The dress code is a must with no modern dresses allowed.

Accessed on 10 Oct 2010. The other three amber spas are Loddin, √úckeritz and Zempin. As of 2013, Koserow had a population of 1,656. History Koserow was first mentioned in the records in 1347 as Cuzerowe (Slavic for \\"goat\\" or \\"blackbird\\") and is one of the oldest settlements of Wendish origin on the island of Usedom. Koserow church is even older - already in existence by the end of the 13th century; it was built of field stones, has many treasures and is reportedly the oldest church on Usedom's Baltic Sea coast. The history of the village is steeped in legend and even the dreaded pirate, Klaus St√∂rtebeker, reputedly found a secret hiding place in the caves of Streckelsberg. The village was sacked during the Thirty Years War and the church bell taken. After the Treaty of Stockholm on 1 February 1720, the island of Usedom and Koserow fell into Prussian possession. After the administrative reform in 1815, Koserow became part to the Prussian province of Pomerania and from 1818 to 1945 was part of the district of Usedom-Wollin. Salt cabins in Koserow In 1820, the first salt huts were built to preserve the fish caught. Koserow at that time was one of the poorest communities on Usedom. Seaside tourists first began to arrive on foot, by coach or by sailing boat in 1846. Several storm floods hit the area in 1872 and 1874, worsening the economic situation. For centuries, the economy of the village had been based on fishing and agriculture. Its growth as a resort was slow due to its poor communications, but it took off once the railway reached the island of Usedom in the early 1900s and a network of metal roads was built. Lidos were established for men, women and families and a pier was built. During World War II, the pier was destroyed during an icy winter. Since 1993, the community has once again had a new pier. Koserow first received a railway connection on 1 June 1911. The town began to flourish as a seaside resort after the construction of the Prussian Northern Railway. Geography Local map showing the isthmus Koserow is located on. Koserow is located at the narrowest point of the isthmus between Nord and S√ºdusedom directly on the B 111, amidst a scenic region between the Baltic Sea and the backwaters. The village is on the slopes of Streckelsberg (about above sea level). It is located about east of the seaside resort of Ahlbeck and west of Zinnowitz. The Koserow shoal lies offshore at a depth of at least 1.75 fathoms. It is about 1 mile N.N.E. of Streckelsberg. Depths of 3.5 to 4.75 fathoms separate the Koserow and Vineta shoals. It is demarcated by a white beacon buoy marked \\"Koserowbank O.\\" off the shoal's eastern side. Another offshore feature is Koserow Steingrund, a large rock, measuring in length and in width. It is aligned in an east-west direction and is demarcated by a white spar buoy, marked \\"Koserow Steingrund N.\\".  Administration  Koserow's logo Until 2005 Koserow was the administrative seat of the sub-district (Amt) of Usedom-Mitte.

Culture Koserow church Amber Beach in Koserow, steep coast section called \\"Streckelsberg\\" in the background. = Recreation = Koserow is one of four Amber Spas towns, along with Zempin, Loddin, and √úckeritz. All are located at the narrowest part of the island. They share a 12 km long fine sandy beach called Amber Beach. The overall continuous beach area of the Baltic Usedom Island is 42 km, making it the longest sandy beach in all of Europe. In 1993, Koserow was recognised as a \\"nationally certified resort\\". As a seaside resort, it offers a variety of recreational activities including swimming, sailing, surfing, walking and cycling. = Places of interest = The Village Church (Dorfkirche) stands almost hidden behind chestnut trees and surrounded by a wall of glacial erratic boulders in Fischerstra√üe. It is the only medieval church on Usedom's Baltic coast and has several interesting architectural features. The original stonework of the 13th century building can still be seen in the centre section of the north wall with small early Gothic window openings and the plain triple-stepped arch of the old entrance. Expanded in the 15th century with a tower and sanctuary, it also has elements of High Gothic architecture. One particular treasure is the medieval winged altar, richly decorated with carved figures. It is the last, complete, surviving one of its kind on the island of Usedom. The unusually large crucifix, which was rescued from the sea by fishermen, has been christened by locals as the Vineta Cross. It dates to the 15th century and was made in Scandinavia. The German theologian, Wilhelm Meinhold was appointed minister at Koserow in the early 1820s. The Nature Park is located at the end of Hauptstra√üe. The pier The Koserow Salt Huts are timber-framed and were built around 1820. They were used as storage for rock salt and for salting and packing the herring caught by local fishermen into large wooden barrels. The salted fish was a staple diet for the poor villagers during the winter months. Destroyed in the storm surges of 1872 and 1874, they were rebuilt around 1900. The remaining 15 huts are protected and, today, one of them is a museum open from May to September.Sehenswertes in Koserow at www.seebad-koserow.de. Accessed on 10 Oct 2010.

Ford resides in Stanley, North Carolina with his wife, Robin, and their two children Alex and Austin. Career Ford's racing career began in the late 1980's when he worked at SABCO Racing under the direction of Gary Nelson, who now works as NASCAR's vice president of research and development. Ford‚Äôs duties included a little bit of everything, including suspension work and car set-up. =1990's‚Äì2005: Dale Jarrett and Bill Elliott (Yates and Evernham)= Before landing his first crew chiefing job with Bill Elliott‚Äôs team in 2000, Ford worked as a mechanic and jackman with Dale Jarrett's No. 88 team for Robert Yates Racing from 1996‚Äì99. During that time, Jarrett never finished lower than third in points, won the 1999 NASCAR Winston Cup Series championship, the 1996 Daytona 500, and scored victories in the Brickyard 400 in 1996 and 1999. The team won a total of 18 races during the four-year period. 2000 was the last year of Elliott‚Äôs tenure as an owner/driver, and when he moved to the new Evernham Motorsports team starting in 2001 (and continuing through 2003), Ford continued as his crew chief. With Evernham, Elliott and Mike Ford won four races, including the 2002 Brickyard 400. When Elliott semi-retired after the 2003 season, Ford did not continue with the No. 9 team for Evernham with their new driver, rookie Kasey Kahne, and Ford instead rejoined Yates and Jarrett's No. 88 team, this time as crew chief. Ford led Jarrett to a victory in the 2004 Budweiser Shootout at Daytona to start the year. Ford hired Russ Salerno as his Pit Crew Coach in 2004 to help with pit crew performance. =2005‚Äì2011: Joe Gibbs Racing (Jason Leffler and Denny Hamlin)= After 11 races in 2005, Ford left RYR and was later announced as the new crew chief for Jason Leffler and the Joe Gibbs Racing No. 11 team starting at Dover, replacing rookie crew chief Dave Rogers, who was taken and reassigned within JGR after the team did not qualify for the Coca-Cola 600. After the team still was not improving to the level the team wanted and expected, Leffler was also released and was replaced on an interim basis by Terry Labonte (whose brother Bobby was driving for Gibbs in the No. 18 at the time), and later their Busch Series drivers J. J. Yeley and Denny Hamlin. Ford worked with Hamlin full-time in 2006 when he got the ride. The two started off on a high note, winning the Budweiser Shootout, and sweeping both races at Pocono. Hamlin won Rookie of the Year in 2006 and finished an impressive third in points. In 2007, Ford and Hamlin won one race at New Hampshire in June and finished twelfth in points, their lowest points finish together. They had a similar year in 2008, winning once at the spring Martinsville race but improving to eighth in points. As crew chief of the No. 11 car, Mike Ford won 17 races and had championship finishes of 2nd, 3rd, 5th, 8th, 9th, and 12th. Ford and Hamlin never missed the chase in their six years paired together. On Dec 6th, 2011, Joe Gibbs Racing released Ford after a dismal year in 2011, only winning one race and dropping to ninth in points. =2012‚Äìpresent (Richard Petty Motorsports, BK Racing, Athenian Motorsports, RSS Racing)= On April 30, 2012, he replaced Greg Erwin as crew chief for the No. 43 Richard Petty Motorsports Ford, driven by Aric Almirola, for the rest of the 2012 season. On September 10, 2012, Richard Petty Motorsports announced that they would swap crew chiefs between their two teams, with Ford moving from Almirola‚Äôs No. 43 to the No. 9 of Marcos Ambrose, while Ambrose's crew chief, Todd Parrott, would become the new crew chief for the No. 43. However, after just seven races, Richard Petty Motorsports announced on October 30, 2012 that Ford was no longer with the organization and would be replaced by Drew Blickensderfer as Ambrose‚Äôs crew chief. In December 2012, Ford was hired as the competition director for BK Racing. He left BK Racing in October 2014 for Athenian Motorsports through the majority of 2015. Ford returned to BK in a crew chief role for the 2016 Daytona 500, working with the part-time No. 26 and No. 93 teams as crew chief for Robert Richardson, Jr. and Ryan Ellis. In 2017, he was hired as the competition director for GMS Racing‚Äôs No. 23 team in the Xfinity Series. On April 10, 2018, it was announced that Ford had rejoined Sieg‚Äôs team in some sort of consultant role. It is unclear if Ford is still working for them today.

It was first published on February 1, 2007 by Kensington Books as a trade paperback original. It was later published in hardcover by the Doubleday Book Club‚Äôs InSightOut Books division. The novel appeared on the top 10 bestsellers list of The San Francisco Chronicle shortly after it was released, and eventually reached number four on that same list. In the June 2007 catalog of Doubleday‚Äôs InSightOut Books SoMa was listed at the #1 bestseller. In June 2008 the novel was honored as a finalist for the national Lambda Literary award for debut fiction. SoMa is a social satire novel that tells the interwoven stories of men and women in their 20s in search of fun in San Francisco‚Äôs gritty South of Market (SoMa) neighborhood. The story takes place in the year‚Äôs following the 2001 dot-com bust, an economic collapse that hit the tech hub of San Francisco particularly hard and left the city with a swell of unemployed or underemployed young adults. Although fiction, the novel features real San Francisco locations and is inspired by true tales. As a result, the book is a fairly graphic and unflinching portrayal of sexuality in all its forms. Publishers Weekly called SoMa \\"A fun, frisky novel of shock horror,\\" and said that author Kemble Scott \\"has his ear to the underground of the sexual revolution.\\"  Plot summary Raphe is a casualty of the dot-com collapse, a former website designer now forced to work as a clerk at a mailbox shop in order to make ends meet. He discovers the shop is actually a front for a scam. His exposure to this seedy underground sparks his curiosity and eventually leads him on a journey into some of the more bizarre subcultures of San Francisco. Through a series of intense personal encounters, he realizes he‚Äôs not quite the man he thought he was. Lauren (Lolly) is a take-no-prisoners woman drawn to the city to find the type of man she can‚Äôt find in the suburbs. She discovers the hunt for love is far more complicated than she expected, especially when looking in all the wrong places. Mark Hazodo is a rich video- game entrepreneur whose love of games extends into a sordid secret sex life filled with extremes. The journeys of these three main characters intersect, overlap and eventually collide with outrageous, provocative and sometimes disturbing consequences. Major themes  SoMa explores the continuum of sexual orientation. The author makes the argument that in an open society, where people are allowed to pursue their desires without restrictions or shame, simplistic black and white views of sexuality are replaced by orientations that exist as complex shades of gray. The novel also depicts the consequences of living in the new millennium, an age when the latest generations have been bombarded since birth with constant sensory stimulation. Behaviors are pushed to new extremes in order to experience a tangible level of joy, pain, love or pleasure. The novel explores the sexualization of previously ordinary moments, in order to turn them into opportunities for gratification. These include room rental classified ads, public transportation, medical/health procedures and grooming. Even sex and drug use are played out in unusual, dangerous ways. The author has said the novel also represents a spiritual and philosophical treatise. In an interview with the literary review Small Spiral Notebook, Scott said, \\"Each of the main characters in SoMa follows a particular life philosophy to deal with their freedoms. As a literary concept, I modeled these philosophies very loosely on the tenets of the world‚Äôs three major religions. Do these older belief constructs fit these times? Do they help or hurt the characters? I‚Äôm not sure the old rules really work anymore. We need new ones, and we‚Äôre still figuring it out.\\" Footnotes  External links *Author's Homepage *SoMa Literary Review *Kemble Scott's YouTube page *Interviews, reviews and news coverage *Small Spiral Notebook Literary Journal Q & A with author *In Newsweekly profiles Kemble Scott 2007 American novels Novels set in San Francisco Fiction set in the 2000s 2007 debut novels ","title":"SoMa (novel)"},{"id":"13217554","title":"Inglewood Handicap"},{"id":"13217555","text":"King's Highway 85, commonly referred to as Highway 85, is a provincially maintained highway in the Canadian province of Ontario, connecting Highway 7 to immediately north of the Waterloo city limits. The highway, which is mostly controlled-access, travels through the Regional Municipality of Waterloo along the Conestoga Parkway from its interchange with Highway 7, which continues south along the parkway, to an interchange with Regional Road 15 (King Street), where it continues as Regional Road 85 to St. Jacobs. Prior to completion of the Conestoga Parkway through Waterloo, Highway 85 followed King Street north of Ottawa Street through Kitchener and Waterloo. Within the City of Waterloo, this former alignment is now maintained by the region as Regional Road 15\\\\. Within the city of Kitchener, the road is simply known as King Street. The parkway was constructed between 1968 and 1977. By 1980, Highway 85 was renumbered as Highway 86, to improve the continuity of provincial route numbers. However, when the majority of Highway 86 was decommissioned in 1998, the remaining portion was soon renumbered as Highway 85 in 2003.  Route description  Highway 85 enters Kitchener along the Conestoga Parkway Highway 85 begins in Kitchener at an interchange between the Conestoga Parkway and Victoria Street. At that interchange, Highway 7 exits the parkway, which from there northward on is Highway 85, and travels east on Victoria Street towards Guelph. The divided freeway continues north, swerving left and right through suburban Kitchener. It first crosses under a Via Rail line and then under Wellington Street, with which it has an interchange, after which it passes alongside the Grand River. As it enters the neighbourhood of Bridgeport, which it divides in two, the route curves west, interchanges with Lancaster Street and crosses into Waterloo. The highway begins to curve north, interchanging with Bridgeport Road. The highway crosses the Conestoga Creek as it interchanges with University Avenue, then gradually curves to the west. After an interchange with King Street, once the original routing of Highway 85, the route curves back to the north and interchanges with Northfield Drive. As it approaches the rural‚Äìurban fringe of the tri-city area, the freeway interchanges with King Street a second time. Highway 85 ends at the north end of the ramps from King Street, as does the Conestoga Parkway. The divided freeway ends and the route become Waterloo Regional Road 85, which continues north to St. Jacobs and Elmira.  History  Highway 85 was originally assumed by the Department of Highways (DHO), the predecessor to today's Ministry of Transportation of Ontario (MTO), during the mid-1930s. The existing Kitchener-Elmira Road was designated as Highway 85 on March 28, 1934. Initially, the route began at the intersection of Queen Street and King Street in downtown Kitchener, and proceeded north along King Street through Waterloo and St. Jacobs. North of St. Jacobs, the highway followed the same route as modern Waterloo Regional Road 85 to Elmira, ending at Church Street in downtown Elmira. Church Street itself would become Highway 86 several years later, on August 25, 1937, connecting Elmira and Amberley, and creating a short-lived common terminus between the two highways; Highway 86 was extended to Highway 7 near Guelph on April 13, 1938. Highway 85 begins at the interchange in the lower-right corner of the image and follows the Conestoga Parkway north into the distance Highway 85 remained unchanged for several decades until the Conestoga Parkway was constructed during the late-1960s and early 1970s. Construction of the new expressway began in February 1965 near King Street in Kitchener;Parkway was originally to be built as a ring road; Christian Aagaard. The Record. Kitchener, Ont.: Mar 1, 1999. pg. B.1 however, construction of the section that is now Highway 85 did not begin until September 1968, when a C$5 million contract for the section between Frederick Street and Bridgeport Road was awarded. Soon thereafter, a second contract for the section between Bridgeport Road and King Street in Waterloo was awarded. On April 16, 1970, the Highway 85 designation was moved from King Street to the new Conestoga Parkway; King Street was consequently transferred to local jurisdiction. Towards the end of the 1970s, construction began on a northward extension of the Conestoga Parkway from King Street to Northfield Drive; this was completed by 1977. By then, construction was underway on a two lane bypass of St. Jacobs east of the original route, connecting with the Conestoga Parkway at Northfield Drive, then an at-grade intersection. By the end of 1977, this bypass was completed. In 1975, the eastern section of Highway 86, from Elmira to Guelph, was decommissioned, truncating the eastern terminus of it to the western terminus of Highway 85. To provide a more direct routing between the two highways, a bypass of Elmira was constructed along what is now Listowel Road. By the end of 1979, Highway 86 was rerouted along this bypass, and the northern section of Highway 85 was decommissioned. In 1980 or 1981, Highway 85 was renumbered as Highway 86, eliminating the designation temporarily and creating one continuous highway between Kitchener and Amberley, on the shores of Lake Huron. On November 30, 1990, the Northfield Drive interchange was fully opened to traffic, eliminating a traffic signal from the northern end of the Conestoga Parkway.Northfield overpass and ramps to open; Kitchener - Waterloo Record.

Kitchener, Ont.: Feb 10, 1994. pg. B.1 In 1998, during the mass downloading of provincial highways to lower levels of government, the majority of Highway 86, from the Northfield Drive interchange to Amberley, was decommissioned. The Regional Municipality of Waterloo subsequently designated the section north from Waterloo to Elmira as Regional Road 85\\\\. Consequently, the remaining section of Highway 86, which exclusively followed the Conestoga Parkway, was renumbered as Highway 85 during the spring of 2003 to align the numbers and aid navigation.Highway 86 on Parkway to be Changed to 86  Major intersections   References   External links  * Highway 85 route * Waterloo Public Library 1954 image of King and Erb Streets in Waterloo with King's Highway 85 signage 085 Roads in the Regional Municipality of Waterloo ","title":"Ontario Highway 85"},{"id":"13217561","text":"Janus, in comics, may refer to: * Janus (DC Comics), an alias of the DC Comics character Two-Face * Janus (Marvel Comics), a Marvel Comics character, the son of Dracula * Janus (Ultraverse), a character in the Ultraverse * Janus Directive, a DC Comics crossover event * Judge Janus, a Judge Dredd character ","title":"Janus (comics)"},{"id":"13217569","text":"Darren Campion (born 17 October 1987) is an English footballer who predominantly plays at left-back for Whitchurch Alport.

The society had its origin in May 1960, when the first big post-war social event organized in Shetland took place. Known as the Hamefarin, it was an organized return trip to their native isles made by some 150 Shetlanders who had emigrated and settled worldwide in such countries as Australia, New Zealand, Canada and the USA. A week of social events of all kinds was laid on for the visitors at venues throughout the islands, and among the main attractions were a Grand Variety Concert and a Shetland Concert, each staged on two evenings in the Garrison Theatre, Lerwick. The opening act of each concert was a performance by forty ‚Äòmassed fiddlers‚Äô, players from all over the Shetland mainland gathered together by Tom Anderson and trained by him over the preceding winter months. The group‚Äôs performances of traditional Shetland fiddle tunes were so well received that it was inundated by requests to perform all over Shetland and invited to play for Her Majesty Queen Elizabeth II during a royal visit planned for August. As a consequence, the fiddlers formed themselves into Shetland Fiddlers‚Äô Society on 29 June 1960, with Tom Anderson as its Leader. Magnus Magnusson, then a reporter on the ‚ÄòScotsman‚Äô newspaper sent to cover the Royal visit, gave the Society its affectionate nickname \\"Da Forty Fiddlers\\", which stuck for many years until player numbers dwindled somewhat. The objectives of the Society include: * the preservation, development and presentation for the benefit, education and enjoyment of the public of the traditional art of Shetland fiddle playing * to give concerts recitals and other public appearance of Shetland fiddle music for the benefit, education and enjoyment of the public * to educate musicians in the traditional art of Shetland Fiddle playing‚Äô. Tom Anderson left the Society in 1980 but Shetland Fiddlers‚Äô Society still thrives, meeting weekly for practice. Since its establishment the Society has produced eight albums of recordings including a 50th anniversary compilation CD, with a ninth album recorded and expected on the market in spring 2014.

The South chapel dates to the 16th-century and has two windows in the South and one East window, all of three-lights. Originally there was a vestry to the north side of the chancel dating to the 15th-century but this was demolished in the 16th-century. The four-centred South doorway is 19th-century. The nave has elements dating to the 13th- century but is mainly 14th-century in date and has five-bay 14th-century arcades to both sides; the South one is earlier in date with compound piers while the North arcade has octagonal columns. The clerestory has five 15th- century square-headed windows to each side, all of two lights except for the South East one which has three lights. The North transept is 13th-century in origin with the East elevation having a 15th-century three-light four-centre arched window, and a small window to the South East lighting inserted in the 15th-century rood screen stair. The North aisle is 14th-century reworked in the 15th-century while the North doorway is 14th-century. The South aisle is 14th-century reworked in the 15th-century. The West window and three South windows are all 15th-century. The North porch is 15th-century with a room above with two-light square-headed windows to the West and North and which is reached by stairs at the South East corner. The West tower is 15th-century with a semi-circular stair turret projecting from the North East angle. The West elevation has a 19th-century pointed-arched doorway to the ground stage and a three-light four-centred arched window to the second stage. On the tower's North side the remains of a stone lamp holder are still visible about 12 feet up. The belfry level has pointed-arched two-light windows to all sides. All the roofs were repaired in the 19th-century but retain much of the original moulded timbering with that to the South aisle being 14th-century, with those elsewhere being 15th and 16th-century. The pews are 19th-century while the circular baptismal font is of uncertain date. The East wall of the porch retains the indents of a memorial brass to a priest, with the central indent in the shape of a chalice. The church was restored in 1889 by Somers Clarke and J. T. Micklethwaite.Beds Mercury 7 September 1889 Windows The window in memory of Rev George Bidwell The modern window by Carl Russell The glass in the church is mainly Victorian in date and of little artistic merit. The East window consists of three lights containing glass depicting the Last Supper installed in 1888 in memory of James Wagstaff. The pair of windows in the West are 15th-century with a tall two light window and a single lancet- shaped window lower down. The larger of the windows was installed in 1865 in memory of the Rev George Bidwell and portrays the Nativity, Crucifixion and Resurrection of Christ with the figures of Christ and Mary Magdalene depicted in the Garden of Gethsemane. The stained glass in the north window of the transept was installed in 1892 in memory of Elizabeth Wagstaff of Potton (1800-1892), the widow of the James Wagstaff who is similarly commemorated in the East window. The window depicts Christ in conversation with the Woman at the Well. The colourful modern glass in the central window of the South aisle depicting the Holy Spirit as a dove emerging from the rays of the sun above angel's trumpets was designed by Carl Russell and was installed in 1994 in celebration of 900 years of worship in the church, References The window in the North transept in memory of Elizabeth Wagstaff External links *St Mary's - Potton Parish Church *A panoramic virtual tour of the church and photos of its stained glass by Peter Loud Grade I listed churches in Bedfordshire Church of England church buildings in Bedfordshire Potton ","title":"St Mary's Church, Potton"},{"id":"13217595","text":"Barkhagen is a municipality in the Ludwigslust-Parchim district, in Mecklenburg-Vorpommern, Germany.

He later earned a second master's degree and his doctorate. After teaching for several years, Sledd was chosen to be the last president of the University of Florida at Lake City, from 1904 to 1905, and the first president of the modern University of Florida (first known as the \\"University of the State of Florida\\"), from 1905 to 1909. He was also president of Southern University from 1910 to 1914, and later became a professor and an influential biblical scholar at Emory University's Candler School of Theology from 1914 to 1939. Sledd first gained national recognition after he wrote a 1902 magazine article advocating better legal and social treatment of African-Americans. He is also prominently remembered for his role in founding the modern University of Florida, his scholarly analysis of biblical texts as literature, his call for an end to racial violence, and his influence on a generation of Methodist seminary students, scholars and ministers.

Several months later, on July 6, 1904, he was unanimously selected to be the president of the University of Florida at Lake City by its board of trustees.\\"University of Florida,\\" The Daily Miami Metropolis, p. 1 (August 3, 1904). At the time of his appointment, the University of Florida at Lake City was experiencing a controversy of its own: its administration and faculty were hopelessly fractured by personality conflicts and its unpopular president's failed attempts at improving the small school's instruction and academic standing.Julian M. Pleasants, Gator Tales: An Oral History of the University of Florida, University of Florida, Gainesville, Florida, pp. 8‚Äì9 (2006). The university's board of trustees had removed the ineffectual president, and dismissed seven members of its small faculty. The university, such as it was, had been known as \\"Florida Agricultural College\\" until 1903. When Sledd arrived in Lake City, it was a school with a new name, a faculty fractured by contentious personalities, an unknown number of returning students and an uncertain future. Sledd required all previous faculty members to re-apply if they desired to keep their jobs, hired replacement instructors, most of whom had earned doctoral degrees in their respective fields (in contrast to the previous faculty), and set about devising rigorous academic standards for the school's new students. Although the university was a designated land-grant college under the federal government's Morrill Act, it received insufficient annual financial assistance from the state government, and its finances remained tenuous. =University of the State of Florida= Sledd and members of the faculty were actively involved in urging Florida's state government to combine the state's several small institutions of higher education.University of Florida, Past Presidents, Andrew Sledd (1904‚àí1909).

The university consolidation movement gained the political backing of newly elected Florida Governor Napoleon B. Broward, and in 1905 the Florida Legislature passed the Buckman Act, which abolished the hodge-podge of state-supported colleges and consolidated their assets and programs into a new comprehensive university and land-grant college for white men, and a liberal arts college and normal school for white women. The Act mandated the merger of four separate institutions, including the existing University of Florida at Lake City, into the consolidated men's university‚Äîthe new University of the State of Florida.Pleasants, Gator Tales, p. 10. The four existing institutions that were merged to form the new University of the State of Florida in 1905 were the University of Florida at Lake City (formerly known as Florida Agricultural College until 1903), the East Florida Seminary in Gainesville, the St. Petersburg Normal and Industrial School in St. Petersburg, and the South Florida Military College in Bartow. After consolidation of the four schools into the new entity, only the new Gainesville campus would remain open after the 1905‚àí06 academic year. \\"The University of Florida,\\" Science, vol. 22, no. 563, pp. 473‚Äì474 (October 13, 1905).

The selection of Gainesville for the campus of the new men's university put Sledd's future as its first president in question. The University of Florida in Lake City was just one of the four existing institutions that were to be merged to form the new university, and there were other possible candidates for the presidency. Albert A. Murphree, president of Florida State College in Tallahassee, was the favorite of several prominent members of the legislature. But Sledd had Governor Broward's backing, and the Board of Control ultimately selected him to be the first president on June 7, 1905; Sledd's appointment was for a single year, but renewable on an annual basis, as was typical in the university's early years when the Board of Control appointed or re-appointed the presidents of the state's public colleges for each academic year.Pleasants, Gator Tales, p. 14.Proctor & Langley, Gator History, p. 27.

The new University of the State of Florida operated in Lake City during the first academic year of its existence (1905‚Äì06), while the buildings of the new Gainesville campus were being erected. Sledd managed the move of the school's assets from Lake City to Gainesville during the late summer of 1906, and participated in the official dedication of the campus on September 27, 1906.Pleasants, Gator Tales, p. 13 When registration for classes was held in Gainesville on September 24, 1906, there were 102 students and fewer than a dozen faculty members.

His political backing ended with the retirement of Governor Broward, and the inauguration of his successor Albert Gilchrist in January 1909. The Florida Board of Education, which then consisted of the governor and the state's elected cabinet members, oversaw the Board of Control and made no secret of its desire to remove Sledd, in part because members of the Board of Education believed that Sledd's admissions standards were too high and that the university was not growing quickly enough.Van Ness, \\"Florida's Sledd Affair,\\" pp. 325 & 345\\\\. The debate over admissions standards was not an insignificant one. Florida Agricultural College had previously admitted students who had only completed the tenth grade, which was the accepted standard of the day for an agricultural and mechanical college. Sledd advocated admitting only qualified high school graduates in keeping with the then-evolving standards for a university (but accepting some who had completed only the eleventh grade as a transitional policy); Sledd forcefully advocated improving Florida's secondary education system, and not compromising the academic standards of its newly created state university. Sledd's position regarding admissions standards was ultimately vindicated when his successor Albert Murphree upheld and, in fact, tightened Sledd's admissions policy in 1912. Id. at 350.

He meets an old enemy, Shifty Kerren, who is the manager of rival boxer Kid Delrano. Kerren says Delrano is in jail and needs to pay the ¬£6 ($30) fine to be released. When he plays on Costigan's sense of patriotism, he agrees to get him the money for his release. Costigan heads to the waterfront and the South African Sports Arena. Promoter \\"Bulawayo\\" Hurley set him up in a special grudge match with the Australian sailor/boxer Bucko Brent. Bucko was the brutal mate aboard the Elinor when Costigan served on her on the way to Bristol to meet the Sea Girl. They fought a few says into the trip and Bucko ended up with several broken bones. A few rounds into the fight, with Bucko almost unconscious, Bucko and crew from the Elinor soak his left glove in Turpentine. A blow from this to the face blinds Costigan but not before he can grab Bucko's wrist and force the glove into his own face. Things get worse when the referee gets involved and, being blinded, Bucko punches and blinds him as well. Soon, however, Costigan manages to catch hold of Bucko, knocks him out and wins the ¬£6 prize money. The fight took longer than expected so Costigan takes the money directly to Shifty Kerren's room only to find Kid Delrano already there. The Kid laughs at Costigan, having bet Shifty $10 that they \\"could hand you a hard luck tale and gyp you outa your last cent\\". Costigan soon knocks out the Kid, his sparring partner Bill Slane and Shifty then leaves. On his way back, he finds a young woman being thrown out by her landlady. Costigan uses the prize money to pay her rent and feels proud to have contributed to a worthy cause and for being too smart to be conned out of the money. However, back at the American Sailors Bar, the bar man mentions the notorious con artist \\"Boardin'-house Kate\\" is in town, taking money by pretending to being thrown out by her landlady.

In addition to the current name changed on 11 June 2005, parts of the ship's former names are visible: Cornelie Oldendorff and Asia Melody. On 9 August 2007, with a little blue paint, the ship's name changed again to Evangeli with a new flag country of South Korea. In all cases, the IMO number for this ship remains the same. The International Maritime Organization (IMO) number is a unique identifier for ships, registered ship owners and management companies. IMO numbers were introduced to improve maritime safety and security and to reduce maritime fraud. They consist of the three letters \\"IMO\\" followed by unique seven-digit numbers, assigned under the International Convention for the Safety of Life at Sea (SOLAS). The IMO number scheme has been mandatory for all ships since 1 January 1996. The number identifies a ship and does not change when the ship's owner, country of registry or name changes. The ship's certificates must also bear the IMO number. Since 1 July 2004, passenger ships are also required to carry the marking on a horizontal surface visible from the air.  History  = IMO resolution (1987) = In 1987 the IMO adopted resolution A.600(15) to create the IMO number scheme aimed at the \\"enhancement of maritime safety and pollution prevention and the prevention of maritime fraud\\" by assigning to each ship a unique permanent identification number. The IMO number remains linked to the hull of a ship for its lifetime, regardless of changes of names, flags, or owners. Lloyd's Register had already introduced permanent numbers for all the ships in their published register in 1963, and these were modified to 7-digit numbers in 1969. It is this number series that was adopted as the basis for IMO numbers in 1987. = SOLAS regulation (1994) = SOLAS regulation XI/3 was adopted in 1994 and came into force on 1 January 1996, making IMO numbers mandatory. It was applied to cargo vessels that are at least 300 gross tons (gt) and passenger vessels of at least 100 gt. In the SOLAS Convention, \\"cargo ships\\" means \\"ships which are not passenger ships\\". The IMO scheme does not apply to: * vessels solely engaged in fishing * ships without mechanical means of propulsion * pleasure yachts * ships engaged on special service (e.g. lightships, SAR vessels) * hopper barges * hydrofoils, air cushion vehicles * floating docks and structures classified in a similar manner * ships of war and troopships * wooden ships. M/S Finnmaid = Security enhancements 2002 = In December 2002, the Diplomatic Conference on Maritime Security adopted a number of measures aimed at enhancing security of ships and port facilities. This included a modification to SOLAS Regulation XI-1/3 to require the IMO numbers to be permanently marked in a visible place either on the ship's hull or superstructure as well as internally and on the ship's certificates. Passenger ships should also carry the marking on a horizontal surface visible from the air. The enhanced regulations came into effect on 1 July 2004. = Company and Registered Owner Regulation 2005 = In May 2005, IMO adopted a new SOLAS regulation XI-1/3-1 on the mandatory company and registered owner identification number scheme, with entry into force on 1 January 2009. The regulation provides that every ship owner and management company shall have a unique identification number. Other amendments require these numbers to be added to the relevant certificates and documents in the International Safety Management Code (ISM) and the International Ship and Port Facility Security Code (ISPS). Like the IMO ship identification number, the company identification number is a seven-digit number with the prefix IMO. For example, for the ship Atlantic Star (IMO 8024026), IMO 5304986 referred to the former ship manager Pullmantur Cruises Ship Management Ltd and IMO 5364264 to her former owner, Pullmantur Cruises Empress Ltd.  Assignment  IHS Maritime is the manager of the scheme and, as such, identifies and assigns IMO numbers without charge. The organization was previously known as Lloyd's Register-Fairplay and IHS Fairplay. For new vessels, the IMO number is assigned to a hull during construction, generally upon keel laying. Many vessels which fall outside the mandatory requirements of SOLAS have numbers allocated by Lloyd's Register or IHS Markit in the same numerical series, including fishing vessels and commercial yachts.  Structure  An IMO number is made of the three letters \\"IMO\\" followed by a seven-digit number. This consists of a six-digit sequential unique number followed by a check digit. The integrity of an IMO number can be verified using its check digit. This is done by multiplying each of the first six digits by a factor of 2 to 7 corresponding to their position from right to left. The rightmost digit of this sum is the check digit. For example, for IMO 9074729: (9√ó7) + (0√ó6) + (7√ó5) + (4√ó4) + (7√ó3) + (2√ó2) = 139.

In the early years of the 20th century, before modern AM or FM radio transmission was developed, radio transmitters communicated information by radiotelegraphy; the transmitter was switched off and on by the operator with a telegraph key, producing pulses of radio waves, to spell out text messages in Morse code. Around 1905 the first continuous wave radio transmitters began to replace the earlier spark transmitters. The Morse code signal of the spark transmitter consisted of pulses of radio waves called damped waves which repeated at an audio rate, so they were audible as a buzz or tone in a receiver's earphones. In contrast the new continuous wave transmitters produced a signal consisting of pulses of continuous waves, unmodulated sinusoidal carrier waves, which were inaudible in the earphones.K. G. Beauchamp,History of telegraphy, IET, 2001 , page 201 So to receive this new modulation method, the receiver had to produce a tone during the pulses of carrier. The \\"tikker\\", invented in 1908 by Valdemar Poulsen, was the first primitive device that did this. It consisted of a vibrating switch contact between the receiver's detector and earphone, which was repeatedly opened by an electromagnet. It functioned as a crude modulator; it interrupted the signal from the detector at an audio rate, producing a buzz in the earphone whenever the carrier was present. Thus the \\"dots\\" and \\"dashes\\" of the Morse code were made audible. Around 1915 the tikker was replaced by a better means of accomplishing the same thing; the \\"heterodyne receiver\\" invented by Reginald Fessenden in 1902. In this an electronic oscillator generated a radio signal at a frequency fo offset from the incoming radio wave carrier fC. This was applied to the rectifying detector with the radio carrier. In the detector the two signals mixed, creating a heterodyne (beat) signal at the difference fC - fC between these frequencies, which was in the audio frequency range. The heterodyne provided the audible tone in the earphone whenever the carrier was present. After vacuum tube oscillators were invented in 1913 by Alexander Meissner the heterodyne receiver replaced the tikker. Today the heterodyne method is still used to receive CW signals, and the beat frequency oscillator (BFO) is a standard part of all communications receivers.

The event currently carries a purse of $200,000. History The event was inaugurated on 30 October 1974 as the Morvich Handicap at the Oak Tree Racing Association meeting at Santa Anita Park as the eighth race on the racecard over a distance of furlongs on the dirt. The event was named for Morvich, an American Champion Two-Year-Old Colt who in 1922 became the first California- bred racehorse to win the Kentucky Derby. The following year the event scheduled for the Downhill Turf course at the distance of about furlongs. In 1999 the event was classified as Grade III In 2010 the Oak Tree Racing Association meeting was held at Hollywood Park Racetrack and the race was shortened to six furlongs. In 2012, the Morvich Handicap was renamed to the Eddie D Stakes in honor of Eddie Delahoussaye, a US Hall of Fame jockey. Eddie Delahoussaye rode the Tsunami Slew to victory in 1984 running of the event. The event was upgraded to Grade II for the 2019 running. Also that year the event run at the shorter five furlong distance with Santa Anita Administration not holding events on the Downhill Turf course.

Sometime after 1037, he was appointed Archbishop of Ohrid, prior to which he had held the position of chartophylax in the Hagia Sophia in Constantinople. Under Patriarch Michael Keroularios (1043‚Äì59), Leo was sent as the spokesman of Constantinople to theological debates with clergymen representing the Pope of Rome in southern Italy. He reiterated his views in a 1053 letter to the bishop John of Trani, which was however addressed to the Pope and all Latin bishops. In this letter, \\"Leo for the first time shifted the religious estrangement between East and West toward liturgical and disciplinary issues\\" (J. Meyendorff), and condemned various practices of the Western Church such as the eating of strangled meat, with blood, the fasting on Saturdays (contrary to the Council of Trullo), or various minor issues of ritual. The most important point of friction, however, was the Western use of unleavened bread (azyma) for celebrating the Eucharist, which provoked a running argument carried out in a series of letters with Cardinal Humbert of Silva Candida, which finally led to Humbert's mission to Constantinople in 1054 and the finalizing of the Great Schism between Rome and the East through their mutual anathemas, resulting in the existence as separate Churches of the Roman Catholic Church and the Eastern Orthodox Church.Andr√© Vauchez, Richard Barrie Dobson, Michael Lapidge (editors), Encyclopedia of the Middle Ages (Routledge 2000 , vol. 1, p. 841  See also  * History of the East‚ÄìWest Schism  References   Sources  * Year of birth unknown 1056 deaths 11th-century Byzantine bishops Archbishops of Ohrid Byzantine theologians 11th- century Byzantine writers 11th-century Christian theologians ","title":"Leo of Ohrid"},{"id":"13217969","text":"Ghazala K. Salam [pronounced as G-ah-ZAA-L-aa-] is an Indian born American Muslim activist and philanthropist.  Early life and education Salam migrated to the United States during her fifth grade year with her parents. Her paternal ancestors migrated to India from the Afgan-Persian region, known as the Pashtuns, historically known by the exonyms Afghans. Her name Ghazala is of Arabic origin, meaning the Gazelle. Salam's family settled in Philadelphia, where she attended Catholic, then public school. When she was 15, her parents decided to move to South Florida to be closer to their extended family who had also migrated from India. After raising two children and running her family owned business for 14 years, Salam went back to school in her 40s. She followed her heart with a passion for food and entertainment, to gain a Master of Science degree in Hospitality Management at Florida International University (FIU). Career As the president of the American Muslim Democratic Caucus she is focused on empowering her community through educational events, voter initiatives, and leadership development for the purpose of creating a community of equitable, knowledgeable and motivated citizens. As a certified Government Relations professional her work is geared toward education of lawmakers and stakeholders of the sometimes hidden and damaging ramifications of legislation. Salam also serves as the co-chair of the Annual Florida Muslim Capitol Day, a statewide initiative to empower Florida Muslim communities and youth, to connect and have a voice in Tallahassee where policies and laws are passed. Her background in grassroots activism has led her to work with the League of Women Voters in Broward. Salam's role as the Chair of the Broward Commission on the Status of Women is instrumental in promoting women's rights, documenting the reality of women's lives throughout Broward County, and shaping County wide standards on gender equality and empowerment of women; she has established a model women 4 women forum, bringing together women from across the county to have open dialogue on issues that impact their lives in order to identify gaps and find solutions that can positively affect women in Broward County. As the Co-chair of the Human Relations Committee for the Broward County School Board, she promotes diversity, inclusive educational opportunities from an early age which is crucial for achieving the district's educational and civic character education goals for all the children. Salam advocates for cross‚Äìcultural understanding, breaking down racial and other stereotypes and eliminating bias and prejudice. Salam is the founder of the American Muslim Democratic Caucus This is evident in the 10 out of 15 female majority board of the American Muslim Democratic Caucus of Florida. Democratic advocacy Salam has served at the local, state and national levels in building bridges between the American Muslim Community and the community at large. A decade after the 9/11 attacks, Salam felt the exaggerated fear, hatred and hostility towards Islam and Muslims like never before. A perpetual negative stereotyping resulting from political and media bias, discrimination and the marginalization and exclusion of Muslims from social, political and civic discourse moved her to take action. Salam's work has notably countered misconceptions about Islam and American Muslims while continuing to advocate for civil liberties, religious and civil rights for all. As a progressive American Muslim, Salam is uniquely positioned to bridge gaps of understanding and collaboration in both the Muslim community and the non-Muslim community. Within the Muslim community, Salam works to educate the community on why it's important to have a collective voice, the value of engaging in the political process, to get out and vote. This comes from her belief that for people to effect change in society they must have the means to collectively advocate for that change.  Contribution to the progress and freedom of women Salam has been a strong advocate of educating Muslims and non-Muslims alike on the rights of women in Islam. Lack of understanding and education has led to a great deal of misrepresentation of women's rights. With the belief that injustice anywhere is a threat to justice everywhere, and the understanding that women's issues are linked to many broader problems of social justice, Salam believes that human rights for all are indivisible and she works hard to give active support to the common cause of equity for all, especially those who suffer discrimination and deprivation. Salam's own inspiration are the women's suffrage and civil rights movements which have taken her on a social movement that challenges aspects of traditional gender norms and the larger public knowledge about her faith as a Muslim woman. She currently works on advancing moral and political issues surrounding women's equity, championing the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women (CEDAW), in Broward County.http://citiesforcedaw.org/ Philanthropic work She has chaired the Day of Dignity charitable event in South Florida, working closely with Palm Beach County Homeless Coalition and over 40 other organizations to provide health and human services to marginalized families and homeless individuals in South Florida. Since 2011, the Day of Dignity has served over 4000 individuals in need, with free haircuts, flu shots, HIV screenings, blood pressure and other healthcare screenings, non-perishable groceries, hot meals, bicycles for kids and adults, school supplies, toiletries, and many more. Islamic views Salam is spiritual person attributing her views on faith to her great grandmother, and by extension, her own descent from Sufism. She has liberal world views and tends to accept things in an open, broad-minded way, giving people the benefit of doubt; understanding the views of others. Her belief is that we are all equal in our humanness, humanity and human dignity.

The circumstances of his death have attracted much research and speculation. The principal sources of contention are: (1) Whether Mozart declined gradually, experiencing great fear and sadness, or whether he was fundamentally in good spirits toward the end of his life, then felled by a relatively sudden illness; (2) Whether the cause of his death was from disease or poisoning; (3) Whether his funeral arrangements were the normal procedures for his day, or if they were of a disrespectful nature. There are a range of views on each of these points, many of which have varied radically over time. The course of Mozart's final illness =The traditional narrative= Constanze Mozart by her brother-in-law Joseph Lange (1782) Mozart scholarship long followed the accounts of early biographers, which proceeded in large part from the recorded memories of his widow Constanze and her sister Sophie Weber as they were recorded in the biographies by Franz Niemetschek and Georg Nikolaus von Nissen. For instance, the important biography by Hermann Abert largely follows this account. The following is a summary of this view. When in August 1791 Mozart arrived in Prague to supervise the performance of his new opera La clemenza di Tito (K. 621), he was \\"already very ill\\". During this visit, Niemetschek wrote, \\"he was pale and expression was sad, although his good humour was often shown in merry jest with his friends.\\"Quotation cited from Following his return to Vienna (mid September 1791), Mozart's condition gradually worsened.For this point cites an article in the Berlin Musikalisches Wochenblatt (\\"Musical Weekly\\"), written shortly after Mozart's death. For a while, he was still able to work and completed his Clarinet Concerto (K. 622), worked toward the completion of his Requiem (K. 626), and conducted the premiere performance of The Magic Flute (K. 620) on 30 September. Still, he became increasingly alarmed and despondent about his health. An anecdote from Constanze is related by Niemetschek: Constanze attempted to cheer her husband by persuading him to give up work on the Requiem for a while, encouraging him instead to complete the \\"Freimaurerkantate\\" (K. 623), composed to celebrate the opening of a new Masonic temple for Mozart's own lodge. The strategy worked for a time ‚Äì the cantata was completed and successfully premiered on 18 November. He told Constanze he felt \\"elated\\" over the premiere. The words are as related by Constanze decades later to the visiting English diarist Mary Novello. Mozart is reported to have stated, \\"Yes I see I was ill to have had such an absurd idea of having taken poison, give me back the Requiem and I will go on with it.\\" Mozart's worst symptoms of illness soon returned, together with the strong feeling that he was being poisoned. He became bedridden on 20 November, suffering from swelling, pain and vomiting.Solomon, Maynard. (2005). Mozart: A Life. Harper Perennial, p. 491. From this point on, scholars are all agreed that Mozart was indeed very sick, and he died about two weeks later, on December 5. =Revisionist accounts= The view that Mozart was in near-steady decline and despair during the last several months of his life has met with skepticism in recent years. Cliff Eisen supervised the reissue of Abert's biography in 2007 in a new edition, supplementing it with numerous footnotes. While generally deferential to Abert, Eisen expresses sharp criticism in the footnoting of the section leading up to Mozart's death: In the main biography article of the Cambridge Mozart Encyclopedia, Ruth Halliwell writes of the decline-and-despair account: As for why Constanze might have been \\"prompted by complicated motives both personal and financial\\" (Eisen), Halliwell contends that \\"Constanze and Sophie were not objective witnesses, because Constanze's continuing quest for charity gave her reasons to disseminate sentimental and sensationalist views.\\"From Ruth Halliwell's article \\"Mozart\\" in The Cambridge Mozart Encyclopedia, p. 332. By \\"charity\\" Halliwell may be referring to the many benefit concerts from which Constanze received income in the years following Mozart's death, as well as, perhaps, the pension she received from the Emperor; see discussion below as well as Constanze Mozart. Christoph Wolff, in a 2012 book entitled Mozart at the Gateway to his Fortune, disputes the view that Mozart's last years represented a steady slide to despair and the grave; he also disagrees with interpretations of the music as reflecting late-life despair (for example) \\"the hauntingly beautiful autumnal world of [Mozart's] music written in 1791\\".. The quotation, of H. C. Robbins Landon's book Mozart's Last Year, appears on p. 2. Cause of death Antonio Salieri portrayed by Joseph Willibrord M√§hler =Theories involving homicide= An early rumor addressing the cause of Mozart's death was that he was poisoned by his colleague Antonio Salieri. This rumor, however, was not proven to be true, as the signs of illness Mozart displayed did not indicate poisoning.For discussion, with references, of the poisoning rumor see . The Norton/Grove Concise Encyclopedia of Music states flatly, \\"He was not poisoned\\"; see Despite denying the allegation, Salieri was greatly affected by the accusations that he had contributed to Mozart's death, which contributed to his nervous breakdowns in later life. Beyond the Salieri theory, other theories involving murder by poison have been put forth, blaming the Masons, Jews, or both. One such theory was the work of Mathilde Ludendorff, wife of the German general Erich Ludendorff. Historian William Stafford describes such accounts as outlandish conspiracy theories. =Theories involving disease= Stafford described the effort to determine what disease killed Mozart: In the parish register, the entry concerning Mozart's death states he died of \\"severe miliary fever\\";. Numerous sources, even published biographies (, ), have altered this term to \\"military fever\\". ‚Äì \\"miliary\\" referring to the appearance of millet-sized bumps on the skin. This does not name the actual disease. Mozart had health problems throughout his life, suffering from smallpox, tonsillitis, bronchitis, pneumonia, typhoid fever, rheumatism, and gum disease.For a thorough survey of Mozart's health history, with an M.D.'s proposed diagnoses, see . Whether these played any role in his demise cannot be determined. Conjectures as to what killed Mozart are numerous. The following survey is arranged in rough chronological order. Some ascribe Mozart's death to malpractice on the part of his physician, Dr. Closset. His sister-in-law Sophie Weber, in her 1825 account, makes the implication. Borowitz summarizes: A 1994 article in Neurology suggests Mozart died of a subdural hematoma. A skull believed to be Mozart's was saved by the successor of the gravedigger who had supervised Mozart's burial, and later passed on to anatomist Josef Hyrtl, the municipality of Salzburg, and the Mozarteum museum (Salzburg). Forensic reconstruction of soft tissues related to the skull reveals substantial concordance with Mozart's portraits. Examination of the skull suggested a premature closure of the metopic suture, which has been suggested on the basis of his physiognomy. A left temporal fracture and concomitant erosions raise the question of a chronic subdural hematoma, which would be consistent with several falls in 1789 and 1790 and could have caused the weakness, headaches, and fainting Mozart experienced in 1790 and 1791. Additionally, an episode of aggressive bloodletting used to treat suspected rheumatic fever on the night of December 4, 1791, could have decompensated such a lesion, leading to his death on the following day. In a 2000 publication, a team of two physicians (Faith T. Fitzgerald, Philip A. Mackowiak) and a musicologist (Neal Zaslaw) reviewed the historical evidence and tentatively opted for a diagnosis of rheumatic fever. The hypothesis of trichinosis was put forth by Jan V. Hirschmann in 2001.See , and critical comment with reply at . A suggestion is that Mozart died as a result of his hypochondriasis and his predilection for taking patent medicines containing antimony. In his final days, this was compounded by further prescriptions of antimony to relieve the fever he clearly suffered. A 2006 article in a UK medical journal considered several theories for Mozart's death and, based on his letters from his last year, dismisses syphilis and other chronic diseases. The attending physicians wrote he died with fever and a rash, and a physician they consulted wrote later \\"this malady attacked at this time a great many of the inhabitants and not for a few of them it had the same fatal conclusions and the same symptoms as in the case of Mozart.\\" The article's conclusion was \\"death came as a result of an acute infectious illness.\\"John Jenkins, \\"Mozart, portrait and myth,\\" Journal of the Royal Society of Medicine, June, 2006, 99(6):288‚Äì291, copy available at NIH. In 2009, British, Viennese and Dutch researchers performed epidemiological research combined with a study of other deaths in Vienna at the time of Mozart's death. They concluded that Mozart may have died of a streptococcal infection leading to an acute nephritic syndrome caused by poststreptococcal glomerulonephritis. In Austria this disease was also called \\"Wassersucht\\" (dropsy/edema). In a journal article from 2011, it was suggested that Vitamin D deficiency could have played a role in Mozart's underlying medical conditions leading to his death. Funeral The funeral arrangements were made by Mozart's friend and patron Baron Gottfried van Swieten. Describing his funeral, the Grove Dictionary of Music and Musicians states, \\"Mozart was buried in a common grave, in accordance with contemporary Viennese custom, at the St. Marx Cemetery outside the city on 7 December.\\" Otto Jahn wrote in 1856 that Salieri, S√ºssmayr, van Swieten and two other musicians were present. The common belief that Mozart was buried in a pauper's grave is without foundation. The \\"common grave\\" referred to above is a term for a grave belonging to a citizen not of the aristocracy. It was an individual grave, not a communal grave; but after ten years the city had the right to dig it up and use it for a later burial. The graves of the aristocracy were spared such treatment.\\"Dies irae, dies illa ‚Äì Day of wrath, day of wailing: Notes on the commissioning, origin and completion of Mozart's Requiem (KV 626)\\" by A description of Mozart's funeral, attributed to Joseph Deiner, appeared in the Vienna Morgen-Post of 28 January 1856: As Slonimsky notes, the tale was widely adopted and incorporated into Mozart biographies, but Deiner's description of the weather is contrary to records kept of the previous day. The diarist Karl Zinzendorf recorded on 6 December that there had been \\"mild weather and frequent mist\\". The original French, given by , is \\"temps doux et brouillard frequent\\". The Vienna Observatory kept weather records and recorded for 6 December a temperature ranging from 37.9 to 38.8 degrees Fahrenheit (2.8 ¬∞C‚Äì3.8 ¬∞C), with \\"a weak east wind at all ... times of the day\\". Aftermath Following her husband's death, Constanze addressed the issue of providing financial security for her family; the Mozarts had two young children, and Mozart had died with outstanding debts. She successfully appealed to the Emperor on 11 December 1791 for a widow's pension due to her as a result of Mozart's service to the Emperor as a part-time chamber composer. Additionally, she organized a series of concerts of Mozart's music and the publication of many of her husband's works. As a result, Constanze became financially secure over time. Soon after the composer's death a Mozart biography was started by Friedrich Schlichtegroll, who wrote an early account based on information from Mozart's sister, Nannerl. Working with Constanze, Franz Niemetschek wrote a biography as well. Much later, Constanze assisted her second husband, Georg Nikolaus von Nissen, on a more detailed biography published in 1826. See Biographies of Mozart. Mozart's musical reputation rose following his death; 20th-century biographer Maynard Solomon describes an \\"unprecedented wave of enthusiasm\\" for his work after he died, and a number of publishers issued editions of his compositions. What may have been Mozart's skull was exhumed in 1801,; from Le Charivari and in 1989‚Äì1991 it was examined for identification by several scientists.  Remembrances of Mozart's death  lithograph by Franz Schramm, titled Ein Moment aus den letzten Tagen Mozarts (\\"Moment from the Last Days of Mozart\\"). Mozart, with the score of the Requiem on his lap, gives S√ºssmayr last-minute instructions. Constanze is to the side and the messenger is leaving through the main door. A portrayal by Joseph Heicke of the journey of Mozart's coffin through a storm to the cemetery. Engraving from about 1860, a few years after the Deiner story appeared. Individuals present at the time of Mozart's death eventually committed their memories to writing, either on their own or through interviews by others. The stories they told are often contradictory, which may be due in part to some of the events not being recorded until the 1820s, when the witnesses' memories might have faded. Benedikt Schack, Mozart's close friend for whom he wrote the role of Tamino in The Magic Flute, told an interviewer that on the last day of Mozart's life, he participated in a rehearsal of the Requiem in progress. Schack's questionable account appeared in an obituary for Schack which was published in the 25 July 1827 issue of the Allgemeine musikalische Zeitung: Biographer Niemetschek relates a vaguely similar account, leaving out a rehearsal: The widely repeated claim that, on his deathbed, Mozart dictated passages of the Requiem to his pupil S√ºssmayr is strongly discounted by Solomon, who notes that the earliest reference for this claim dates to 1856. However, S√ºssmayr's handwriting is in the original manuscript of the Requiem and Sophie Weber did claim to recall that Mozart gave instructions to S√ºssmayr. An 1840 letter from the composer Ignaz von Seyfried states that on his last night, Mozart was mentally occupied with the currently running opera The Magic Flute. Mozart is said to have whispered the following to Constanze in reference to her sister Josepha Hofer, the coloratura soprano who premiered the role of the Queen of the Night: Solomon, while noting that Mozart's biographers often left out the \\"crueler memories\\" surrounding his death, stated, \\"Constanze Mozart told Nissen that just before the end Mozart asked her what [his physician] Dr. Closset had said. When she answered with a soothing lie, he said, 'It isn't true,' and he was very distressed: 'I shall die, now when I am able to take care of you and the children.Mozart's financial condition had improved considerably during the year 1791; see Ah, now I will leave you unprovided for.' And as he spoke these words, 'suddenly he vomited ‚Äîit gushed out of him in an arc‚Äî it was brown, and he was dead.'\\" Mozart's older, seven-year-old, son Karl was present at his father's death and later wrote, \\"Particularly remarkable is in my opinion the fact that a few days before he died, his whole body became so swollen that the patient was unable to make the smallest movement, moreover, there was stench, which reflected an internal disintegration which, after death, increased to the extent that an autopsy was impossible.\\" See also *List of unsolved deaths Notes References  *Eisen, Cliff and Simon P.

It is an active aid to navigation. It is also the tallest lighthouse on the Great Lakes.  History  = Overview = The period between 1852 and the beginning of the 20th century saw great activity on the Great Lakes by the United States Lighthouse Board. Between 1852 and 1860 26 new lights were built. Even as the United States Civil War and its aftermath slowed construction, a dozen new lights were still lit in that decade. In the 1870s, 43 new lights were built on the Lakes. The 1880s saw more than one hundred lights constructed.Beacons in the Night, Clarke Historical Library. Central Michigan University.Hyde, Charles K., and Ann and John Mahan. The Northern Lights: Lighthouses of the Upper Great Lakes. Detroit: Wayne State University Press, 1995. . As the new century began, on the Great Lakes the Lighthouse Board operated 334 major lights, 67 fog horns and 563 buoys. During the 19th century design of Great Lakes lights slowly evolved. Until 1870 the most common design was to build a keeper's dwelling with the light on the dwelling's roof or on a relatively small square tower attached to the house. In the 1870s, so as to raise lights to a higher focal plane, conical brick towers, usually between 80 and 100 feet tall were constructed. In the 1890s steel lined towers began to replace the older generation of brick building. See Big Sable Point Light for a striking transition and transformation. The White Shoal Light was the culmination of a 40-year effort from 1870 to 1910, when engineers began to build lights on isolated islands, reefs, and shoals that were significant navigational hazards. To that time, Light ships were the only practical way to mark the hazards, but were dangerous for the sailors who manned them, and were difficult to maintain. \\"Worse, regardless of the type of anchors used lightships could be blown off their expected location in severe storms, making them a potential liability in the worst weather when captains would depend on the charted location of these lights to measure their own ship's distance from dangerous rocks.\\" See, United States lightship Huron (LV-103). Successively, using underwater crib designs, the Board built on a shoal the Waugoshance Light (1851), and demonstrated a \\"new level of expertise\\" in constructing of the Spectacle Reef Light (1874), Stannard Rock Light (1882) and Detroit River (Bar Point Shoal) (also known as the Detroit River Entrance Light) (1885). \\"The long and expensive process of building lights\\" in remote and difficult sites \\"ended in nationally publicized engineering projects that constructed\\" Rock of Ages (1908) and the White Shoal (1910) lights. In the first three decades of the 20th century the Lighthouse Board and the new Lighthouse Service continued to build new lights on the Great Lakes. For 1925, the Board had under its auspices around the Great Lakes 433 major lights, ten lightships, 129 fog signals and about 1,000 buoys. Of these 1,771 navigational aids, 160 stations had resident keepers, as most navigational aids were automated. By 1925 nearly all of the Great Lakes lighthouses that exist today had been constructed, except for Poe Reef Light, Gravelly Shoal Light, and Manning Memorial Light.Wobser, David, Manning Memorial Light, at boatnerd.comLighthouse Central, Photographs, History, Directions and Way points for Robert H. Manning Memorial Light, The Ultimate Guide to West Michigan Lighthouses by Jerry Roach (Publisher: Bugs Publishing LLC ‚Äì 2005). . Another is the William Livingtone Memorial Light, and the Great Lakes light, namely Tri-Centennial Light of Detroit. This is part of a larger pattern of building 14 reef lights around Michigan, which was intended to help ships navigate through and around the shoals and hazards around the Straits of Mackinac.Roberts, Bruce; Jones, Ray. (September 2002) American Lighthouses, 2nd: A Definitive Guide pp. 246-250 Publisher: Globe Pequot Press 304 pp ; ; . = Building the light = Construction of the crib style light began in 1908 and the light was commissioned on September 1, 1910. Final cost of light construction was $225,000.00 (although $250,000 was budgeted for this project). In addition to a fog signal, it also had a submersible bell that would toll the number \\"23\\" to warn off mariners. This early 20th Century technological innovation was an audible precursor to a mid Century innovation using radar, RACON, which was later installed at this location. Because of growing freighter traffic in and through the Straits of Mackinac, this light was part of a larger plan to build lighthouses to protect ships and mariners in the area.*Lighthouses in the Mackinac Straits, Lighthouse Friends. This is one of the first three \\"lightship stations\\" of the Great Lakes. Its construction, along with Waugoshance Light, was a \\"major engineering feat\\" because of its distance and isolation from land. Until 1910, Lightship LV56 served at White Shoal. Construction for this light began in 1908: the crib pier being built in St. Ignace, and transported by ship. The keeper house was accompanied by a fog signal building that housed a diaphone, that has since been removed.

It is based on the life of the real- life French sculptor and graphic artist of the same name. The musical premiered at Goodspeed Musicals in 2003.  Plot  The show's opening scene is in 1913, when Camille was removed from society, then flashes back to 1881 and onward. The plot focuses on Claudel's career and her tempestuous relationship with Auguste Rodin, for whom she was a source of inspiration, a model, a confidante, and a lover. The show opens with Camille's love for her true passion - sculpting (\\"In the Stone\\"). The musical features Camille's sometimes troubling relationship with both her father (who had actually helped her) and brother, Paul Claudel. Despite not being a male, she insists she be allowed to be enrolled at Le Salon (\\"Not a Man\\"), yet she still manages to work and learn under Rodin. Act 1 concludes with Camille deciding she no longer needs Rodin, and attempts to live and create on her own, only to have Rodin tell her that she would be nothing without him (\\"Taking Back My Life\\"). Act II opens with Rodin reflecting on what he has done, and ailing with amiss for Camille (\\"A Trembling Man\\"). Camille now spends a lot of time with her father, and the two discuss older times and are at harmony (\\"Snow Falls\\"). When Paul realizes Camille's downward spiral into the unknown and her relations with Rodin, he attempts to save her and turn her to God, such as he had had his own conversion (\\"Field of Angels\\"). Instead, Camille cannot seem to understand why no one believes in her - including her family (\\"What's Never Been Done Before\\"). Rodin eventually rekindles his love with Camille, but the love is never returned (\\"Learning How to Love You\\"). After several more years, Camille's family decides that she is no longer stable (both emotionally & financially); they announce that her father has passed days earlier, and she is devastated that they did not tell her. Although she fights with Paul that she is not meant to be there, Paul and her mother send her to an insane asylum, where she comes to peace with the news of her father (\\"Snow Falls (Reprise)\\"). At the end of Act II, which switches to modern times, where Camille, now alone, reflects on the life she has lived (\\"Gold\\").  Productions  Goodspeed Musicals in August through September 2003, staged a \\"developmental run\\". Directed by Gabriel Barre and choreographed by Mark Dendy, the cast featured Linda Eder in the title role, Michael Nouri as Auguste Rodin, Matt Bogart as Paul Claudel and Milo O'Shea as Camille's father.Jones, Kenneth. \\"Wildhorn and Knighton's 'Camille Claudel', the Musical, Ends Sept. 7 at Goodspeed\\" playbill.com, September 7, 2003 The musical was presented in a \\"chamber-style\\" form; the cast was minimum, and they attempted to do the most they could with small scale sets. Orchestrations (by Kim Scharnberg) were also on a smaller scale. Instead of bringing in statues, they used dancers to perform, and many of the scenes were strictly dancing for the statues (sometimes accompanied by music). The Waltz was one of these. There were also many book-scenes/moments, more than a common Wildhorn musical. The creators have denounced calling this a \\"tragedy,\\" but rather a celebration of the life of Camille. In 2004 it was presented in the form of a 45-minute reading at The National Alliance for Musical Theatre's 16th Annual Festival of New Musicals.\\"16th Annual Festival of New Musicals, 2004\\" namt.org, accessed March 27, 2012 A studio demo recording was made in 2004, with no plans for a release.

A representative of the efficiency minded thinkers, he specialized in the field of the curriculum.  Early life and education  His parents were James and Martha Bobbitt, he was born in the small town of English, Indiana on February 16, 1876. Bobbitt graduated in 1901 from the Indiana University. He first worked in several rural schools in Indiana. From 1903 to 1907, Bobbitt was a teacher at the Philippine Normal School in Manila. He went to the Philippines as part of a member of a committee sent to draw up an elementary school curriculum for the islands. They had the freedom to form an original curriculum to fit the needs of the population. At first they put together American textbooks which they had been familiar with in United States schools, but a director of education in the Philippines made them look this over. When they saw that their idea did not fit with the social realities, they discarded their original plan. This time they drew up a plan with a variety of things to help the people gain health, make a living, and enjoy self-realization. They got away from the American textbooks and found activities derived from the Philippine culture. This is when Bobbitt realized that there were more useful solutions to forming a curriculum than just using traditional beliefs. Bobbitt went on and received a PhD from Clark University in 1909. From 1909 until his retirement in 1941, Bobbitt worked as faculty at the University of Chicago.  Curriculum  He felt that the curriculum was a way to prepare students for their future roles in the new industrial society. He influenced the curriculum by showing how teaching classical subjects should be replaced by teaching subjects that correspond to social needs. In 1918, Bobbitt wrote The Curriculum: a summary of the development concerning the theory of the curriculum. This became an official specialization in the education sciences. The entrance point of a curriculum was, according to Bobbitt, to see which results have to be accomplished. Bobbitt felt that the curriculum has to adapt to the needs of an individual and to the needs of the new industrial society, people should not be taught what they would never use. They should only learn those skills which were necessary to fulfill their personal tasks. Education was according to Bobbitt primarily a preparation for adulthood and not for childhood or youth. This resulted in an early differentiation in education. Bobbitt was not a supporter of coeducation. In his view girls had a very different future than boys, so they did not need the same sort of education. Bobbitt created five steps for curriculum making: (a) analysis of human experience, (b) job analysis, (c) deriving objectives, (d) selecting objectives, and (e) planning in detail. The first step was about separating all of human experience into major fields. This was followed by step two, where the fields were broken down into more specific activities. The third step was to form the objective from the abilities needed to perform the activities. Next is the fourth step, where the objectives are selected from to find ones that would serve as the basis for planning activities for the students. The last step was to lay out activities, experiences, and opportunities that would be needed to obtain the objectives. Besides a change in the content of the curriculum, Bobbitt was also calling for the elimination of conventional school subjects. He preferred subjects that were themselves areas of living, such as citizenship and leisure (p97). Bobbitt also believed that schools were charged to provide society with what it needed as determined by scientific analyses (p100). Bobbitt realized that there were too many activities (for example related to citizenship, health, spare time, parentship, work related activities and languages) to fit in any curriculum. A part of those activities were well taught by socialization: the so-called undirected experiences. This is why the curriculum has to aim at the particular subjects that are not sufficiency learned as a result of normal socialization, these subjects were described as shortcomings.

An iron gate was installed at the first constriction in 1991 to preserve those of the delicate lava formations or speleothems which hadn't already been destroyed.

Meaning and background When asked by Blistering.com about what happened with his former band Motograter, vocalist Ivan Moody said: \\"The Bleeding\\" was written by Moody about his ex-fianc√© and his former band Motograter. In an interview with Blistering.com, Moody spoke about what \\"The Bleeding\\" is about: When Five Finger Death Punch performed a show in Arizona, the girl who Moody wrote \\"The Bleeding\\" about, his ex-fianc√©, was at the show. It was the first time Moody saw her in about a year. Moody spoke about it, saying: When Moody spoke about the first time he heard \\"The Bleeding\\", he said: Music video Actress Danielle Harris, 2008 A music video for the song, directed by Bradley Scott, was shot in Los Angeles on July 7‚Äì8, 2007. The video features actress Danielle Harris as the actress for Ivan Moody's girlfriend, and writer/director Sxv'leithan Essex, who also appeared in Five Finger Death Punch's video for the song \\"Never Enough\\", and directed the video for their song \\"The Way of the Fist\\". The video was released on July 27, 2007. The video contains cuts of the band performing the song and a troubled couple portrayed by actress Danielle Harris and vocalist Ivan Moody. The video begins with vocalist Moody driving down an alley passing other members of the band and writer/director Sxv'leithan Essex and arriving at his house carrying in a box. When Moody enters the house, he pulls pictures of him and Harris out of the box. It then flashes back to the couple sitting at a table with other members of the band drinking beer, with Moody's girlfriend appearing to be uninterested in talking to Moody. They accidentally spill a beer and the couple then suddenly begin to fight, and bassist Matt Snell then pulls Moody away from his girlfriend. After the fight, it cuts to shots of Harris crying in the mirror and the couple having sex. It then shows Moody reading a letter and Harris taking a large amount of pills. At the end of the video Harris' feet are shown dangling, implying she had hanged herself. The video ends with Moody taking an urn out of the box and spreading her ashes on the bed. Ivan Moody commented on the video concept: \\"The video was a concept of mine. We were sitting around a table wondering how to project the visual for that song. One of our favorite songs of ours. I wanted it to be painful. Danielle Harris is the actress ... she was in The Last Boy Scout and the Halloween movies .. I sat down with her and racked her brain about it. It seemed logical to follow the lyrics and make it about what I went through relationship wise. The suicide part is just reality. There are situations out there that are hard to push through. I wanted that video to reconstruct how I felt when I was writing that song.\\" Versions There are four versions of the song: * Album version ‚Äì This version of the song is included in every edition of The Way of the Fist album. * \\"Screamless\\" version ‚Äì This version of the song is available as a single on the iTunes library and contains none of the screaming from the album version.

Biography James Hay was the son of William Hay, 17th Earl of Erroll and his wife Alicia Eliot (d. 1812). Hay, an ensign in the 1st Foot Guards, was killed at the Battle of Quatre Bras while serving as aide-de-camp to General Maitland. Had he lived, he would have succeeded his father as Earl of Erroll upon his death in 1819; as it was, his brother William succeeded to the title. In 1899 Murray's Magazine published some recollections by Georgiana, Dowager Lady De Ros (a daughter of the Duchess of Richmond) about Duchess of Richmond's ball that took place on 15 June 1815. She recalled \\"I remember being quite provoked with poor Lord Hay, a dashing merry youth, full of military ardour, whom I knew very well for his delight at the idea of going into action, and of all the honours he was to gain; and the first news we had on the 16th was that he and the Duke of Brunswick were killed\\".Georgiana, Dowager Lady De Ros. Circa 1890, Hay's remains were moved to the crypt under The British Waterloo Campaign Monument in The Brussels Cemetery at Evere. Fictional portrayals *In the 1970 film Waterloo, Hay is portrayed by British actor Peter Davies; in contrast with historical events, he is a main character, constantly at Wellington's side on the day of Waterloo. At the Duchess of Richmond's ball, he dances with her daughter Sarah and the two are obviously in love. The Duchess says to Wellington, \\"Don't let young Hay get killed\\", and he is surprised to hear that they have been formally engaged. Later in the film, Hay serves alongside the Duchess' brother, the Duke of Gordon, chieftain of Clan Gordon. Wellington remarks to Hay that he is \\"a lucky fellow, to see such a sight (the French Army) in your first battle\\". The fictional Hay's last words are \\"Think of England, men, think of England!\\" but these are likely to have been fabricated by the scriptwriters. He is struck in the head by a bullet and dies instantly. *He is also portrayed in Georgette Heyer's 1937 novel An Infamous Army, which deals with events of Waterloo through the eyes of fictional characters but describing real people and events.

Slack Farm is located near Uniontown, Kentucky close to the confluence of the Ohio River and the Wabash Rivers. The site included a Native American mound and an extensive village occupation dating between 1400‚Äì1650 CE. Although Slack Farm was long known to be one of the major villages of the Caborn-Welborn people, it became famous when it was very seriously damaged by looters in 1987. Description The Slack Farm site is located on a projecting terrace and adjacent levee from the Ohio River. There was a mound (Site 15 UN 70) located on the bluff overlooking the site. The Slack Farm site itself consisted of 7 discrete village areas surrounding a central plaza and covering roughly 14 ha. A shallow ravine bisects the site running from the west to the south. Houses were typical Mississippian rectangular wall trench wattle and daub structures set in shallow basins. Many had prepared clay hearths. Located near most houses were special pits used to store maize and other dried foods. The pits were large enough to have stored enough grain to feed 7 to 12 people for a year. =Graves= Each section of the large village maintained its own cemetery. Burials were typically in extended positions. They were often laid out in parallel rows and the absence of overlapping burials suggests that they were marked in some way. Grave goods such as limestone disc pipes, shell beads and ear plugs, as well as small pottery jars were often included, usually near the body's upper torso. In Late Caborn-Welborn times, European trade goods such as glass beads, copper/brass bracelets and tubes were deposited in the graves. During the 1987 looting, 650 to 750 graves were opened by the looters. Given the fact that infants and children are under-represented in this total, archaeologists speculate that as many as a thousand or more people could have been buried at the seven cemeteries at the site. 1987 looting and its effects In 1987 the ten looters of Slack Farm paid $10,000 to a new landowner of the Slack Farm property for the right to dig at the site. After renting a tractor, the ten individuals spent two months destroying hundreds of Native American graves, Mississippian culture houses, and unknown other artifacts. Local complaints by the people of Uniontown led to the arrest of the perpetrators for the misdemeanor of \\"desecrating a venerable object\\" (a charge which is now a felony, in part due to the controversy over Slack Farm). Prosecution on this charge was difficult in the late 1980s, in part because this predated the passage of the Native American Graves Protection and Repatriation Act and related state legislation, which made it clearer that such activities were illegal. The looting of Slack Farm contributed to the passage of more stringent laws in the state of Kentucky relating to the protection of burials, sacred grounds, and indigenous/archaeological sites. The damage done to Slack Farm attracted worldwide attention and was written about in National Geographic Magazine,National Geographic Magazine, March 1989 prompting widespread outcry against illicit removal of antiquities. The hundreds of broken bones were reburied by Native American groups. As of May 2007, Native American groups still meet in the area to commemorate the site and mourn the damage done.

He also served as an official within the administration of Tokugawa shogunate, rising through the ranks first as S≈çshaban, Jisha-bugy≈ç, Wakadoshiyori, and finally to the position of R≈çj≈´. Biography Tadanao was the fourth son of Nishio Tadanari, the first daimy≈ç of the Nishio clan at Yokosuka Domain. He was recognized as heir apparent in 1696 and granted courtesy rank and title of junior 5th court rank, lower grade (ju go i no ge Âæì‰∫î‰Ωç‰∏ã), and Harima no Kami in 1703. He became clan leader upon his father's retirement in 1713. In the same year, he received his father's former courtesy title, Oki no Kami. Tadanao entered the service of the Tokugawa administration in the spring of 1732, with his appointment to the offices of S≈çshaban and Jisha-bugy≈ç. After two years in these positions, he was promoted to wakadoshiyori. In 1745, his court rank was raised to junior 4th, lower grade (ju shi i no ge ÂæìÂõõ‰Ωç‰∏ã), and his domain increased by 5,000 koku to 30,000 koku. The following summer, he was made a r≈çj≈´ in the service of Sh≈çgun Tokugawa Ieshige, and served in the position until 1747.Tadanao was also granted the additional courtesy title of jij≈´ (‰æçÂæì) His domains were further expanded by another 5,000 koku in 1749, bringing Yokosuka Domain to 35,000 koku in size. Tadanao resumed his service as r≈çj≈´ in 1751, but fell ill in the spring of 1760, while still serving as r≈çj≈´. He did not recover from his illness, and died at Tatsunokuchi, in Edo, a few days later. He was 72 years old. His grave is located at the Nishio clan temple of Ryumin-ji in modern Kakegawa, Shizuoka. Tadanao's official wife was a daughter of Ky≈çgoku Takatoyo, the daimy≈ç of Marugame Domain in Sanuki province, but he had no son. His adopted son Tadamitsu succeeded him as daimy≈ç of Yokosuka and head of the Nishio clan. Tadanao, like his father Tadanari, is remembered as a patron of culture and the arts. The Enshu-Yokosuka San-Kumano Taisai festival, still held every year during a week in April, was started by Tadanao, who spent much time in Edo and wished to bring something of its culture to Yokosuka.

Its head office is in Amsterdam. History The foundation traces its roots to 1754 when two tailors were sent to Suriname as unsupported missionaries. To earn a living they practiced their craft, using their free time for their missionary work. The business activities of C. Kersten & Co prospered and became one of Surinam's largest commercial enterprises, generating employment and profits. The profits were used to establish other Moravian Church businesses in the Caribbean and Europe. All the businesses were eventually transferred to the Moravian Church Foundation and are now used to finance church work and social and community projects on several continents. Currently The Unity Synod has resolved that the following be supported in order of priority: *Theological training. *The Moravian Church in Suriname for economic, educational and social work. *The Unity Archives in Herrnhut, an annual grant. *The church's work in South Asia, the Star Mountain Rehabilitation Centre and the Unity Fund. *Other projects, at the discretion of the Unity Board. The foundation is staffed and run by professional business and finance people. Its board of directors must include four elected from the church's provinces and who are particularly concerned with the ethical conduct of the foundation's businesses and its social responsibility to the communities in which it operates.
