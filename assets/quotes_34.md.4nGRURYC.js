The museum was founded in 1918 as a part of soviet programme to support unique cultures of USSR subdivisions. Since 1970 the museum is located in the centre of Moscow in the historical building known as the Lunins' House, a private residence built in the early 19th century by the famous architect Domenico Gilardi. The museum has galleries for the art and archaeology of India, Persia, China, Japan, Buryatia, Transcaucasia, and Chukchi Peninsula. Major part of the Persian objects have been donated by General Tardov in 1929. In 2017 the Nicholas Roerich Museum was established as a part of the State Museum of Oriental Art. Named after the prominent Russian artist Nicholas Roerich, the new museum holds more than 800 masterpieces of Western painters from his collection and numerous items of decorative and applied arts, that Roerich family brought from India. History = Establishment = Before the October revolution Moscow had no centres of Oriental studies. When the independent republics were declared within the USSR, the government decided to establish a special museum for the East nations and their heritage. The project was developed by the Russian historian Pavel Muratov and supported by Igor Grabar, who was a leading art historian and a specialist in museum affairs. In a few months they opened ‚ÄòArs Asiatica‚Äô, at first on the premises of the Russian State Historical Museum, then moved to Tsvetkov Mansion on Prechistenskaya Embankment. Fyodor Gogel became the museum's first director. Following the course of Korenizatsiya policy, the exposition was based on the art of the East Soviet nations. In 1925 the museum was renamed into ‚ÄòState Museum of Oriental Art‚Äô. Up to 1929, the organisation balanced on a verge of closure due to low scientific activity. However, in 1929 when the museum was moved to the former Church of Elijah at Vorontsovo Pole street, the personnel finally started full-scale works and research. The very first exhibitions opened in 1930, since then the museum received official governmental support. = Collection = 1491 miniature, collection of the museum The collection includes items from the National Museum Fund, antique shops, and nationalized private collections of noble families, taken by the government after the Revolution. In 1920s some items were transferred from the Polytechnic Museum, the Pushkin State Museum of Fine Arts, and the State Historical Museum. The major part of the collection was donated by private philanthropists. For example, Pyotr Shchukin had a keen interest in Oriental art and gathered a solid collection of old master prints and figurines from China, Iran, and India. In 1910 he established a private museum at Malaya Gruzinskaya street. After the Revolution, it was nationalized and given to the Museum of Oriental Art. The museum also received private collections of Pavel Kharitonenko, perfumer Henri Brocard, Orientalist Alexey Pozndeev, Nikolay Mosolov, and Igor Grabar. The first permanent exhibition was opened in 1919 at the Russian History Museum and included arts from China, Japan and Iran. Since 1924 the museum launched several expeditions to the Far East in order to collect new artifacts. By order of the Soviet government, from 1930 the exhibitions included propaganda materials. In 1926-1928 the second director Boris Deneke launched three expeditions to Old Termez. They provided the museum with unique items from the XII century palace and other historical sites. In 1929 the first buying expeditions were sent to Kurdistan and Tusheti.  Contemporary Activities  Nowadays new valuable items keep coming to the museum's vast collection through private donations and archaeological excavations. As of 2018, the collection includes more than 160,000 artefacts: paintings, graphics, sculpture, clothing, arms, and domestic items. Apart from its permanent exhibitions, the museum manages and co-creates various activities and events with other cultural organizations.

The tower, and the high crosses nearby, are National Monuments. History Kells was founded as a monastic settlement by Saint Columba c. 550 on land that had been gifted to him by the King of Tara - Diarmait mac Cerbaill. Columba was exiled after the Battle of C√∫l Dreimhne (AD 561). The Abbey of Kells was refounded in the early 9th century by monks from Iona. The high crosses were erected in the 9th/10th century and the round tower in the 10th century.http://www.visitingkells.ie/roundtower/ The Annals of Tigernach state that in 1076 \\"Murchadh son of Flann √ì Maolseachlainn, was treacherously killed by Olaf son of Mael√°n, king of the Galenga, in the round tower of Kells, and straightway, through a miracle of St Columcill's, Olaf himself was killed by Maolseachlainn son of Conchobhar.\\" Olaf (note the Norse name) was king of Gailenga Brega, a kingdom located between the River Liffey and Santry. Murchadh was King of Mide for a time in 1073. Maolseachlainn son of Conchobhar was himself later King of Mide, 1094‚Äì1105.

The doorway originally stood about above ground level and was reached by wooden steps or a ladder. Most round towers have four windows on the top level, one for each cardinal direction, but Kells has five, supposedly one facing each road into the town and each town gate. The crosses There are five high crosses: *Cross of St Patrick and St Columba (South Cross): the earliest cross, erected in the 9th century. Carved scenes include Adam and Eve, Cain and Abel, the Three Children in the Furnace and Daniel in the lions' den. *West Cross (Ruined Cross): Adam and Eve, entry into the Promised Land, Marriage at Cana, Baptism of Jesus and his triumphal entry into Jerusalem. Supposedly the cross was damaged by soldiers of Oliver Cromwell. *East Cross (Unfinished Cross): incomplete; it gives an insight into how crosses were carved, with the details being added on site. *Market Cross: : as well as religious scenes (including David with lyre, the Binding of Isaac and the temptation of Saint Anthony) there is depicted a deer hunt, birds, animals and centaurs. * North Cross: only the base remains.

Her boyfriend Seth Turner is a member of the high school football team. She is best friends with the most popular girl in her high school. Katie seems to have the perfect life, but her perfect image has been crafted by a few white lies. She has been making out with a drama club member, Eric Flutely, behind Seth's back. To reach her goal of buying a professional camera, Katie runs for Quahog Princess for Eastport's annual Quahog Festival, even though she dislikes quahogs. However, it seems that Katie's lies will stay intact until Tommy Sullivan returns to Eastport. Katie and Tommy used to be best friends until Tommy became a social pariah after writing an article about football players cheating on the SAT, which caused Seth's older brother to lose a scholarship. To avoid being shunned by association, Katie participated in driving Tommy out of town by helping Seth spray paint Tommy Sullivan is a freak on the exterior of the new gymnasium (it is later revealed that Seth had wanted to spray paint a harsher word than freak, but Katie couldn't let him).

They were developed by Alexia Massalin in 1989 for the Synthesis kernel, and named for the Qua! Machine, a unique hardware platform built by Massalin. The origin of the term 'qua' is unclear; Massalin claims humorously that it is a sound made by koalas. The main purpose of quajects is to provide an abstraction to manage self-modifying code, by allowing runtime code optimizing on a per-object basis. While the original Synthesis kernel required quajects to be written in hand-developed assembly language, this was done to avoid developing a complex compiler; Massalin noted that just-in-time compilation (JIT) for a high-level programming language that permits runtime code generation, as in Lisp or Smalltalk, can also apply this approach, though she also asserted that the complexity of such a compiler was likely to be prohibitive. Quajects differ from more conventional objects in two key ways: first, they always use a form of the dependency injection pattern to manage both interfaces to other quajects, and continuations out of the quaject; the list of callentry references for this is part of quaject creation, and may be updated during the quaject's lifetime. Second, and more critically, a given quaject's set of methods can be unique to the specific quaject; methods for a type or class of quajects are stored as one or more templates, rather than as fixed code. While shared methods can be accessed through a common table of pointers, individual quajects can also have methods that are generated specifically to tailor the performance for that quaject's behavior.

During August 2016, a video was released of Corbyn sitting on the floor of a VTEC train while campaigning during a leadership challenge by Owen Smith. Corbyn said the train was \\"ram-packed\\" and used this to support his policy to reverse the 1990s privatisation of the railways of Great Britain, which created private operators such as VTEC. Controversy developed when Virgin released CCTV images a week later appearing to show Corbyn walking past available seats, leading to accusations that the incident had been staged for political gain, which Corbyn denied, saying \\"Yes, I did walk through the train. Yes, I did look for two empty seats together so I could sit down with my wife, to talk to her. That wasn't possible so I went to the end of the train.\\" Reactions were mixed, with commentators finding both support and damage for all sides involved. Analysis by a media outlet paid by the reelection bid of Jeremy Corbyn in the then-Labour leadership contest of the CCTV footage later claimed to show that the unreserved seats in some of the images were occupied and that other passengers also sat in the vestibules. Background The railways of Great Britain were privatised in the 1990s, passing ownership and operation of trains and track to private companies (although the track was later taken back into public control through Network Rail). Passenger trains continue to be operated by a number of private companies, awarded through a system of franchising. As a result of increased demand on an ageing network largely built in the Victorian era, train overcrowding has become a significant issue and a source of public discontent. Virgin Trains East Coast, a joint venture between Stagecoach Group (90%) and Virgin Group (10%), commenced operating the East Coast franchise in April 2015 after a period of public operation following renationalisation in November 2009 after National Express East Coast defaulted on the previous franchise. As it is one of the more profitable routes, in return for the right to operate the franchise for eight years from 2015, VTEC has committed to pay the government a ¬£3.3 billion premium over eight years, and invest ¬£140 million in improvements. Jeremy Corbyn became leader of the Labour Party in September 2015. Renationalisation had been one of Corbyn's key pledges during his 2015 leadership election and upon its formal adoption at the subsequent Labour Party conference, Corbyn told the audience \\"We will be running our railways in the interests of passengers and taxpayers.\\" According to The Guardian, its adoption as official party policy had been a significant boost for Corbyn, who had suffered a series of setbacks over the European Union and the renewal of the Trident nuclear deterrent. It stated Corbyn believed this showed that policies which had once been dismissed as leftwing, could be \\"hugely popular among mainstream voters\\". The specific policy called for a rolling program of renationalisation, with franchises taken back into public control as and when they reached the end of the term, leading to the prediction of a third of passenger franchises being publicly owned by the end of Corbyn's first full term, if he had won the general election which was at the time scheduled to be held in 2020, but was later brought forward to 2017.  Evolution  = Corbyn video = On 11 August 2016, Corbyn boarded the 11:00 VTEC service from London King's Cross to Newcastle, travelling to a leadership hustings event with Owen Smith in Gateshead. He was accompanied by a team which included his aide Emma Rees and his wife. At 11:30, Corbyn was filmed sitting on the floor of the train at the end of a carriage by a Corbyn supporting freelance filmmaker who was working with Corbyn, and volunteers for his campaign. The story was originally submitted to BuzzFeed News, who rejected the article as its author had \\"attached a load of conditions around the words and he wanted it written his way\\", according to BuzzFeed UK editor-in-chief Janine Gibson. On 16 August, a 26-second clip of the footage with Corbyn delivering a monologue to camera was made public, appearing in a story for the online edition of The Guardian originally headlined \\"Corbyn joins seatless commuters on floor for three-hour train journey\\". In the monologue, Corbyn described the train as \\"ram-packed\\" and said that many passengers face the same problem \\"every day\\". He used the opportunity to call for more trains and to make the case for public ownership of the railways. Later, he said: \\"Is it fair that I should upgrade my ticket whilst others who might not be able to afford such a luxury should have to sit on the floor?\\" Subsequently, The Guardian acknowledged that the text originally submitted to the paper had been clear that Corbyn had later taken a seat, but that this detail had been removed in the editing process prior to publication. The headline on the piece was corrected accordingly, over a month later. = Virgin Trains response = According to VTEC: \\"CCTV footage shows Mr Corbyn returning to Coach H and sitting down at 11:43, shortly after being filmed while sat on the floor and more than 2hrs before his final destination, Newcastle.\\" On 23 August 2016, Virgin Trains East Coast (VTEC) released a statement and CCTV footage from the train, which it said showed Corbyn walking past empty, unreserved seats in coach H prior to him being filmed on the floor, and then, with the assistance of the train crew, walking back to take a seat in Coach H, around 45 minutes into the journey. It also stated there were additional empty seats on the train, which appeared to have been reserved but not taken, and so therefore could have been used by Corbyn. Passengers are allowed to sit in reserved seats as soon as it becomes obvious they have not been taken up, and train conductors will tell passengers on a busy train to do this. The statement also thanked Corbyn for praising their staff, and highlighting the need for new trains, explaining \\"that's why we're introducing a brand new fleet of 65 Azuma trains from 2018.\\" It also said the company would be delighted to work with ministers if they proposed changing the rather \\"blunt instrument\\" of fares regulation so that it allowed the operator more freedom to effectively manage demand during exceptionally busy periods, such as sporting events. The same day minority VTEC shareholder, Richard Branson also tweeted an image of and link to the CCTV footage, with the message \\"Mr Corbyn & team walked past empty unreserved seats then filmed claim train was ‚Äòram-packed\\". With Corbyn's account of events now being questioned, the incident began to be referred to as \\"Traingate\\" by media in the UK and abroad. Subsequent responses from Virgin saw the company highlight its ongoing financial relationship with the Labour Party, offering deals to their annual party conference, and welcoming Corbyn on their service to Glasgow on 25 August (having reserved a seat this time). In response to media speculation that Virgin's response was timed to overshadow their long-term rival British Airways' flight returning Team GB from the Rio Olympics, sources at the company stated the delay was down to the need to review footage and establish a timeline of events. Explaining VTEC's decision to respond to Corbyn's accusations with CCTV footage, Branson stated on 3 September that the company had known from its IT system that there were \\"something like a hundred and forty empty seats on the train\\". = Corbyn response = On 23 August, in response to VTEC's statement, Corbyn's office released a statement that Corbyn had been unable to find an unreserved seat, and had sat in the corridor with other passengers who were also \\"unable to find a seat\\". It added that it was only after a family received an upgrade to First Class, that Corbyn and his team were offered those vacated seats by a member of train staff. It also reasserted the claim that Corbyn's policy of bringing the trains back into public ownership was so popular was precisely because passengers across Britain will have been in similar situations on overcrowded, expensive, trains. Corbyn's aide Emma Rees also stated that what the CCTV did not necessarily show was that seats were being reserved by luggage or small children. The original filmmaker of Corbyn on the floor also claimed some of the empty seats appeared to be occupied due to the presence of bags and coats in contrast to the claims by Corbyn's aide. On 24 August, when questioned about the incident at a press conference, Corbyn told reporters he was there to talk about his National Health Service policies, but then replied to the questioning saying, \\"I am very pleased that Richard Branson has been able to break off from his holiday to take this issue seriously and with the importance it obviously deserves. I hope he is very well aware of our policy, which is that train operating companies should become part of the public realm, not the private sector.\\" He explained that \\"Yes, I did walk through the train. Yes, I did look for two empty seats together so I could sit down with my wife, to talk to her. That wasn't possible so I went to the end of the train.\\", adding that at first the train manager had offered to upgrade him to First Class, before allocating him some seats which he was able to take after 42 minutes. Corbyn's campaign manager and TSSA union officer Samuel Tarry dismissed the row as a \\"spat\\", but asserted that VTEC's response showed that the establishment were \\"absolutely terrified\\" of Corbyn's \\"not particularly radical plans to renationalise\\". Tarry also stated in a radio interview that \\"The bigger story is that a tax exile of more than 10 years decides to lay into [Jeremy Corbyn] on social media in a very public way. Richard Branson is literally laughing all the way to the bank at the British taxpayers' expense. In the last year this chap has made some ¬£53 million directly from the taxpayer.\\" =Data Protection inquiry= In August 2016, the Information Commissioner's Office said that it would look into the release of CCTV footage on data protection grounds. A spokesperson said \\"All organisations have an obligation to comply with the Data Protection Act and must have legitimate grounds for processing the personal data they hold. Where there‚Äôs a suggestion that this hasn‚Äôt happened, the ICO has the power to investigate and can take enforcement action if necessary.\\" In July 2017, the Information Commissioner's Office ruled that Virgin was allowed to correct Corbyn's accusations by publishing the video but \\"should have taken better care to obscure the faces of other people on the train\\".http://metro.co.uk/2017/07/12/virgin-trains-was- right-to-release-footage-of-jeremy-corbyns-crowded-train-last- year-6772947/http://www.cityam.com/268305/information-commissioners-office-no- virgin-trains-didnt Reactions =Corbyn front bench= Writing in the Sunday Mirror on 28 August 2016, Corbyn's most senior ally, Shadow Chancellor John McDonnell, called for Branson to be stripped of his knighthood, describing him as a \\"tax exile who thinks he can try and intervene and undermine our democracy\\". = Owen Smith = On 24 August 2016, Owen Smith said Corbyn had a legitimate point about train overcrowding, but sided with Virgin Trains over the specific incident, stating \\"I think the evidence is there on the CCTV footage, obviously Jeremy did have a seat and went to sit on the floor in order to make a point about overcrowding.\\". He also stated that he was not entirely sure what Corbyn's version of events was, as it had appeared to change a couple of times on 23 August. Responding to calls for Branson to lose his knighthood, he said \\"I can't imagine we'd strip somebody's honours for telling the truth\\". A 24 August tweet, \\"My campaign remains on track. Proud to be genuinely standing up for ordinary people.\\" was interpreted as a reference to the row. = The Guardian = On 28 August 2016, The Guardian, citing leaked internal policy documents and emails, alleged Virgin Trains' release of CCTV footage was \\"in breach of the company‚Äôs own policies\\" and that \\"the managing director of Virgin Trains East Coast told staff that the controversy had highlighted how crowded services can be, and that finding seats could make customers anxious and stressed\\". Virgin declined to comment on the leaks, instead referring the newspaper to its earlier statement thanking Corbyn for highlighting how helpful their staff had been. According to the Guardian's own analysis in the wake of the row, the East Coast route is relatively free of capacity issues compared to other franchises, with 80% of passengers rating it \\"satisfied or good\\" in terms of space to sit or stand, and that it has more issues with the train's other facilities, due to the length of the journey. By comparing the cost of new trains and the money paid on fares, it concluded that taking operators back into state control would not solve much in the grand scheme of things, with savings of hundreds of millions being unlikely to make a dent in costs of tens of billions, and so the answer instead lay in Corbyn finding some way to make taxpayers increase their contribution from the present ¬£3.5 billion a year. It also concluded other avenues, such as cost savings, would also encounter difficulties, as it would require better employee relations (to avoid disputes such as the concurrent Southern strike) or Network Rail taking on more debt. On 7 October 2016, The Guardian published a review of its own coverage of the incident by its readers' editor, Paul Chadwick, which concluded that the paper was to some extent responsible for the story generating the controversy that it did. Chadwick said that the paper should have made clearer at the time that the video and accompanying text had been submitted by a Corbyn supporter rather than as a piece of news reporting by an independent freelance journalist. It also acknowledged that although the original text had been clear that Corbyn had taken a seat later in the journey, this detail was omitted from the published version, and the headline had erroneously suggested that Corbyn had sat on the floor for the entire journey. =Social media= On Twitter, several people who said they were on the train came to Corbyn's defence, backing his account and sharing pictures of them sitting with him in the corridor. Others made the point that many trains are overcrowded, regardless of whether Corbyn's had been. According to The Independent, reactions on Twitter elicited a \\"multitude of viewpoints\\" rather than just the usual pro or anti-Corbyn stances ‚Äì distilling 28 perspectives, ranging from dismissal to conspiracy theorising, even pointing out that \\"ram-packed\\" is not a word (it is either \\"rammed or jam-packed\\"). = Media analysis = Simon Calder, travel correspondent for The Independent, wrote that overcrowding on intercity routes (such as the one Corbyn was travelling on) is much less frequent than on commuter routes, and he argued that in fact the bigger problem for the East Coast franchise was too many empty seats on off-peak trains (making them inefficient) rather than too few. According to The Independent, \\"as the traingate saga seemed to spiral out of control\\" and \\"while Twitter had a field day\\", aides were unable to contact Corbyn for a response to Virgin's claims because he was at home, making jam, making the situation worse in their opinion, as it resulted in confusion and doubt as various different explanations emerged from different team members about what had happened on the train ‚Äì \\"whether there were bags or children on unreserved seats or whether he had just wanted to sit with his wife\\". It argued that this made it an incident which \\"fuels the impression that, at the most critical moments ‚Äì such as during the referendum campaign ‚Äì the Labour leader is absent\\". The BBC postulated various reasons why Branson might have taken the \\"risky gambit\\" of making a public attack on a politician, and more than a week after the event, ranging from a desire to overshadow British Airways, an expected response given his long-standing record of reacting aggressively to attacks on his brand's reputation, or as a method of most effectively quashing the idea of renationalisation which \\"has an appeal to a wide range of voters\\", or because the franchise itself was under financial pressure and any lessening of profits would risk yet another default on this troubled route. Noting its \\"oddly partisan\\" nature, Private Eye also questioned the neutrality of The Guardian's original story, based on research into their bylined Guardian video producer which showed they were a Corbyn supporter and had a working relationship with the freelance filmmaker, something they noted the paper did not disclose. Citing various public relations professionals, PRWeek concluded that the row had caused damage to Corbyn, reinforcing impressions that he is not a capable operator when it comes to media management, made all the worse as it was self- inflicted, and that Virgin had done a good job protecting its reputation by acting decisively and across both traditional and social media in their response, and that ultimately they would still benefit from creating doubt about Corbyn's version of events, even if he was right. =Public opinion= A YouGov poll, on 24 August 2016, found that, of the 4,454 UK adults surveyed, 57% thought that Corbyn was being dishonest, compared with 18% who thought that he was not; 58% thought that the row did matter, compared with 19% who thought it did not. However, amongst current Labour voters, 39% believed him against 34% who did not. Other YouGov polling data showed the row had impacted negatively on VTEC in terms of brand awareness, brand impression and perceptions of value for money among the general public, showing a negative score for the first time in brand impression, although this was balanced by no change when looking only at the views of current customers. =Labour leadership election= Polls showed that 11% of those eligible to vote in the leadership election said that the incident had improved their view of Corbyn, while 20% said that it had given them a more negative view. However, amongst Corbyn supporters, 18% said that it had given them a more positive view of him, against 5% who said that it had given them a more negative view. The Independent suggested that this was due to Corbyn being seen to make a stand against an unpopular operator.

Many opportunistic pathogens for fish species are included in the genus Tenacibaculum including Tenacibaculum maritimum, Tenacibaculum soleae, Tenacibaculum discolor, Tenacibaculum gallaicum, and Tenacibaculum dicentrarchi. These pathogens cause a ulcerative disease known as tenacibaculosis . Characteristics of tenacibaculosis include lesions on the body, necrosis, frayed fin, tail rot, eroded mouth, and sometimes necrosis on the gills and eyes . The disease can lead to mortality and can leave afflicted species susceptible to secondary infections from the open lesions. Tenacibaculosis is also known as salt water columnaris disease, gliding bacterial disease of sea fish, bacterial stomatitis, eroded mouth syndrome, and black patch necrosis .  Etiology  Diagnosis of the disease is conducted through cultivation and biochemical characterization . T. maritimum is also detectable internally through real-time RT-PCR . The bacterium targets teeth, which is high in the calcium needed to promote their growth . T. maritimum can also be isolated from the kidney, suggesting it is systematic .  Affected Species  Many fish species around the world are affected by tenacibaculosis caused by T. maritimum. Species in Japan that are affected by tenacibaculosis include the black sea bream Acanthopagrus schlegei , red sea bream Pagrus major , Japanese flounder Paralichthys olivaceous , Yellowtail Seriola quinqueradiata , and Rock bream Oplegnathus fasciatus .

It operated from 1896 until 1918, when it was closed due to a fall in the price of tin. Background The Basset mines were to the south of Camborne in the parish of Illogan, on the southeast side of Carn Brea. The company was formed in 1896 when six different mining setts that had been operated from the 1830s were amalgamated. The South Wheal Frances, West Wheal Basset and Wheal Basset Mines were all worked for copper in the 18th and 19th centuries. South Wheal Frances adjoins the West Wheal Basset to the north, Wheal Basset to the east and Grenville United to the southwest. South Wheal Frances was named for Frances Basset the only child of Francis Basset (1757‚Äì1835), first Lord de Dunstanville and Basset. West Wheal Basset was started as a copper mine in 1835. Sixty years later, as part of Basset Mines, it employed 300 men, 90 women and 30 boys. Wheal Basset is another of the mines that have \\"Basset\\" in their name, after the Basset family of Tehidy. Between 1815 and 1900 it produced 94,200 tons of 2.5% copper ore and 13,178 tons of black tin. Sections of the Great Flat Lode: South Condurrow/Wheal Granville, West Wheal Basset, South Frances, Wheal Uny Most of the shallow workings were exhausted in the 1820s and 1830s. Steam-powered pumps were used to keep the mines dry as the shafts were sunk deeper. By the 1850s the mines employed several thousand men, women and children. The setts that became the Basset Mines were most profitable in the 1850s and 1860s, extracting copper. Production was cut back in the late 1860s when the price of copper declined, and some mines went below the copper lodes for tin. The tin deposits were deeper and the ores harder to dress than copper, and profits were lower. The Great Flat Lode was reached around 1872‚Äì74. This is a large tin deposit to the south of Carn Brea that is tilted at an average angle of about 32 degrees. Most lodes tilt at 60 degrees or more so the lode is relatively flat, hence the name. The Wheal Basset stamps engine house was built in 1868, with an unusual configuration of two separate beam engines. The new stamps at the West Basset Mine were made by the Tuckingmill Foundry. The settling and buddling floor was opened in 1875. An additional buddle floor opened in 1892. Production of tin steadily grew in the second half of the 19th century, and by the 1880s had overtaken copper. When the old part of the Wheal Basset sett was stopped, flooding from the mine affected West Basset and West Wheal Frances and old Wheal Basset pumping engine was kept working. A massive pumping engine house was built at Pascoe's Shaft at South Wheal Frances. It held an engine, the largest that the St Austell Foundry ever built, that was started in 1888. The South Wheal Frances company reorganised as South Frances United Mines in 1892. South Frances United included South Wheal Frances and West Wheal Basset, which had been running at a loss for several years. Additional buddles and Cornish frames were erected at West Basset in 1892. Combined operation Wheal Bassett Basset Mines Ltd. was formed in 1896 as a union of South Frances United, Wheal Basset (and North Wheal Basset) and West Wheal Frances Mines. Boundary disputes caused by miners accidentally crossing into the sett of a neighbouring mine were resolved by the merger. After the merger the ore was hoisted at South Wheal Frances and crushed and dressed at West Basset stamps about away. The boiler house had a row of six Lancashire boilers and provided steam for the whole operation. A Brunton calciner was installed at Wheal Basset stamps in 1897. Between 1896 and 1899 a major refurbishment of the South Wheal Frances shaft was undertaken, enabling mining down to . By 1900 the Basset Mines manager was no longer able to get the skilled labour need to work the buddles and proposed using vanners in their place. They were installed in a building erected over six of the 1892 buddles just below the stamps. Frue Vanners were installed at the West Basset stamps in 1906. A Frue vanner house was installed below the Wheal Basset stamps in 1908. The \\"Miner Dry\\" at Wheal Francis, a building where miners changed from their working clothes after a shift and hung the clothes to dry on large steam pipes, was completed in 1908. At the time of his death in September 1918 Francis Oats (1848‚Äì1918) was chairman of Basset Mines. Basset Mines shut down in December 1918 due to a slump in the price of tin after the end of World War I (1914‚Äì18). The company failed in 1919. Total output from the mines before and after the merger was 290,118 tons of copper and 43,134 tons of tin. West Bassett Stamps Recent years The area was granted World Heritage status on 14 July 2006. The Great Flat Lode Trail leads around all the major mines in the Camborne-Redruth area, making a circuit of the Carn Brea granite hill, with many information boards explaining the sites. Most of the shafts were plugged by the Kerrier District Council in the 1990s. Many ruined buildings are still accessible to the public. Surviving buildings include the Marriott's Shaft complex of South Wheal Frances, West Basset Stamps and Wheal Basset Stamps. The West Basset Stamps, which had a secondary beam engine to pump water for dressing, stands over an unusually fine example of a 19th-century tin dressing floor. The Marriott's Shaft complex includes the pumping engine house, which held the only inverted beam engine in Cornwall, the houses for the winding, compressor and crusher engines, and the miners' dry.

It is dedicated to the Nativity of Mary and to Elijah. The first church on the site was built around 1640. The ktitor was vistiernic (treasurer) Iordache Cantacuzino, brother-in-law and close adviser to voivode Vasile Lupu. It was located on the city's northern edge and dedicated to the Nativity of Mary. The walls remained, but the church was rebuilt around 1760, and was covered with pine boards in 1797. Andi Emanuel Mihalache, History at the Ia»ôi County Cultural Office site In the 18th century, shoe-sole makers (tƒÉlpƒÉlari) settled in the area, giving rise to the church's popular name. Their guild maintained a candle in the church until the late 19th century; from early on, the church and its parishioners benefited from certain privileges and donations from the princes. Aside from the Cantacuzino family, which offered support to the church for 220 years, other prominent families were benefactors: Beldiman, Scor»õescu, Cazimir, Hermeziu, Burghelea, Gane, Carp, Botezatu, Bosiasa. In 1828, the ban Atanasie Gosan willed the entire MƒÉd√¢rje»ôti estate to the church, as well as land in Bucium (now a neighborhood of Ia»ôi), together with houses and orchards. In July 1827, a devastating fire completely destroyed the church. A descendant of the original founders, vornic Dimitrie Cantacuzino-Pa»ôcanu, rebuilt the structure. He and his wife Pulcheria are depicted in an oil painting, holding the church. During the period, Metropolitan Veniamin Costache, himself related to the Cantacuzenes, was preoccupied by the church's well-being. By 1835, reconstruction was complete, and a liturgy was celebrated in the new building for the opening of the nearby Academia MihƒÉileanƒÉ. Subsequently, the church would serve as a chapel for the school. The church was practically ruined by 1884, when renovations took place, lasting until 1890. The walls were repaired, the walls and ceilings painted in oil, the iconostasis gilt, the balcony, doors and windows redone. The bell tower was also rebuilt, and two pavilions added to the south side of the church: one at the entrance, the other near the altar, above the crypt which contains the graves of benefactors. The church is cross-shaped; the altar has a window on the eastern axis, while the nave had a semi-spherical cupola supported by four semicircular arches. The neo-Renaissance painting, done in 1886, has several large canvases, including two scenes near the entrance: Calvary and Christ Judged by Pilate. The wooden iconostasis is carved in a Baroque style; it has white columns with sculptures of gilt wood. Icons are arranged in the classical style. The exterior walls are decorated in a Constantinople Baroque on three registers of different dimensions. Under the communist regime, the church's assets were seized. It was placed in danger by massive new construction, nearly sharing the fate of Academia MihƒÉileanƒÉ, which was demolished in 1964. In 1953, a second dedication, to the prophet Elijah, was added. This was due to the fact that a filial church by that name, built in 1620, was demolished to make way for apartment blocks. After the Romanian Revolution, some repair work took place, including to the crypt, above which a Byzantine-style mosaic of the Resurrection was placed.

Seethamma was born in October 1841 in the then village of Mandapeta, in Andhra Pradesh, and lost her mother during her childhood.. Dokka Joganna, a rich farmer, married her, and this allowed her to offer food to the poor, which she did for more than 40 years, much of it after her husband's death. At the end of her life, she gave away her possessions and hired a bullock cart driver to take her to Varanasi to die in accordance with her Hindu beliefs, but turned back and hastily cooked a meal with begged ingredients after hearing a family in the next room at the pilgrims' inn talking of being on their way to ask her for food. The British government recognized her charity, and King Edward VII invited her to the celebration of his anniversary along with other guests from India. He ordered the chief secretary of Madras to bring her to Delhi with honor, but Seethamma politely declined the invitation, saying that she was not providing her services for publicity. The Madras chief secretary instead gave King Edward a photograph of her, which he then enlarged to place on the chair where she was to sit during the celebration. Seethamma was honored as a Hindu saint and called Apara Annapurna, a reincarnation of the goddess Annapurna. An aqueduct over the Vynateya river was named for her in 2000 and is marked with a bust depicting her.

Walsh, MD  ASCRS For the main duration of his career, Walsh worked as a neuro-ophthalmologist at the Wilmer Eye Institute of Johns Hopkins Hospital. Walsh is most well known for his textbook Clinical Neuro-Ophthalmology, which contains a compilation of Walsh's case reports and the conclusions he drew from them. Originally published in 1947, the textbook has many updated versions and is still a premier text in the field of neuro-ophthalmology. Walsh is considered by many to be the father of neuro-ophthalmology due to his contributions to the field.  Personal life and education  Frank Burton Walsh was born in Oxbow, Saskatchewan, Canada on October 18, 1895. He comes from English-Irish descent. While he was in school, he participated in musical activities such as piano and clarinet. He also played sports, which included football, baseball and hockey. His other hobbies included hunting and fishing. Queen's University Walsh began his college education at Queen's University (Canada) in 1913. During his time at Queen's, Walsh had to enlist for World War I, where he became a lieutenant in the Canadian Army. Due to a wound at the Battle of Ypres, he was sent home with an honorable discharge. He then went to the University of Manitoba College of Medicine, where he received his medical degree in 1921. While working in private practice, Walsh started to gain interest in ophthalmology. Around this time, the Wilmer Institute of Ophthalmology in Baltimore, Maryland opened, so Walsh wrote to Dr. Wilmer asking for a resident position. Dr. Wilmer was extremely impressed with Walsh and granted him as a position as a first year resident. Walsh moved to Baltimore with his wife, Marion, and his two children, McMurty and Walter, in 1930 at the age of 35. By his fourth year, Walsh was the chief resident. He was almost 40 years old when he finished his residency. Marion died in 1960 of a brain tumor, and Walsh remarried several years later to Josie. Josie worked as the head surgical nurse at the Winnipeg General Hospital.  Career  = Early medical career = Example of an appendectomy Following Walsh's graduation from the University of Manitoba College of Medicine in 1921, he spent nine years in general practice. For the first two years, he was employed as a house officer at Winnipeg General Hospital. In 1923, Walsh moved to Estavan, Saskatchewan, where he delivered babies and performed appendectomies as a general practitioner. In 1930 Walsh went back to school for ophthalmology. = Career in Neuro-Ophthalmology = During Walsh's residency at the Wilmer Eye Institute, Walsh would see patients, teach, and host Saturday morning conferences that allowed ophthalmologists and neurologists to interact and discuss cases. Although Walsh worked in both neurology and ophthalmology, he focused more on ophthalmology and was never formally a neurologist. Walsh first entered the field of neuro-ophthalmology after approaching neuroscientist Dr. Frank Ford about performing joint research relating ophthalmology to the central nervous system during his last year of residency. Walsh's role in the research project included visiting many of Ford's patients and giving full ophthalmologic exams. Walsh then related his findings to many of the neurological findings of Ford. As Ford and Walsh's research project came to a close, Walsh realized he wanted to continue his studies in the relationship between neurology and ophthalmology. He published the Clinical Neuro-Ophthalmology paper in 1936, which was the first research project in the field neuro-ophthalmology. Following his residency, Walsh became a full-time staff member at the Wilmer Eye Institute of Johns Hopkins Hospital. Walsh left the Wilmer Eye Institute in 1945 to go into private practice in Baltimore, Maryland because of financial reasons. Walsh is most well known for coauthoring Clinical Neuro- Ophthalmology in 1947, which is the first textbook on neuro-ophthalmology. The book contained years of Walsh's observations, analysis, and cataloguing of diseases that affect the eye through the nervous system. In the 1960s, there were only 4 neuro-ophthalmologists in the United States. Over the course of Walsh's career, the number of neuro-ophthalmologists greatly increased, and many in the field looked to Walsh's work for their education and training. In 1960, following the death of his wife, Walsh returned as a full-time faculty member at Wilmer, where he remained until his death in 1978. = Research = An example of a Retinoscope, one of the tools Walsh used to diagnose visual syndromes. Walsh's contributions to neuro-ophthalmology extended beyond his clinical work and teachings. Walsh documented and analyzed all of his clinical cases, and used them to perform research. He wrote down many of his major discoveries in published research papers. One of his most cited papers was on Tilted Disk Syndrome. He used many techniques, such as Retinoscopy, Static and Kinetic Golmann Perimetry, Fluorescein angiography, and ocular ultrasonography, to diagnose the syndrome. Walsh discovered several symptoms that could be used as diagnostic tools, such as an obliquely direct axis of the vertical disk. In another one of his most cited articles, Walsh discussed whether oral contraceptives affected or complicated the parts of a patient's brain related to the eyes. Walsh came to the conclusion that, while birth control pills may cause hazards to visions in some extreme cases due to blood clotting, they did not normally cause problems with vision. = Accomplishments and honors = Walsh received the following awards over his career: * Lucian Howe Medal from American Ophthalmological Society * Jules Stein Award from the Jules Stein Institute at the University of California, Los Angeles * Proctor Award from American Medical Association * Karl-Leibrecht Prize from German Ophthalmological Society * Proctor Medical Award from Association for Research in Ophthalmology In addition to receiving these awards, Walsh also held positions within these groups: * President and Member of the Board of Scientific Counselors at National Institutes of Health * President of the American Ophthalmological Society * Vice President of American Academy of Ophthalmology and Otolaryngology * Second Vice President of American Medical Association Walsh was also inducted as an honorary member in these Neurological and Ophthalmological societies: * American Neurological Society * American Association of Neurological Surgeons * Canadian Ophthalmological Society * Australian Ophthalmological Society * German Ophthalmological Society * Irish Ophthalmological Society * Brazilian Ophthalmological Society * Sicilian Ophthalmological Society * Colombian Ophthalmological Society * Mexican Ophthalmological Society * Peruvian Ophthalmological Society * Uruguayan Ophthalmological Society Walsh received honorary Doctor of Science degrees from the University of Western Australia and the University of Manitoba, and honorary Doctor of Law degrees from Queen's University and the Johns Hopkins University. In the October 1962 issue of the American Journal of Ophthalmology, there was a special article about Walsh himself. In the article, Walsh is depicted as the leader of the field of neuro-ophthalmology.  Death and legacy  = Death = In 1978, Walsh realized that he wasn't feeling very well and went to the doctor. A team at Johns Hopkins diagnosed Walsh with oat cell carcinoma, which filled half of his lungs. He remained in Baltimore for about seven months up until his death in November 1978, at the age of 83. = The Frank B. Walsh Neuro-Ophthalmalogy Society = In 1958, Frank Walsh and Richard Lindenberg started collaborating with the goal of forming a society where neuro-ophthalmologists could meet and discuss new ideas and facts. In 1966, Joel Sacks joined Walsh and Lindenberg, and the trio hosted their first meeting in 1969. The first three meetings, which they named the Neuro-Ophthalmic Pathology Symposium, included case presentations, clinical conferences, and discussion with local and visiting experts. These first meetings were small, but they were the first time that neuro-ophthalmologists from North America were able to meet as a group and collaborate. Over the years the society continued to grow, and it allowed experts to exchange information. As one member said, \\"at the Walsh Society we saw and heard the cutting edge of neuro-ophthalmology, one or two years before it made the literature.\\" After Walsh‚Äôs death in 1978, the group was renamed as the Frank B. Walsh Neuro-Ophthalmology Society. For its first 23 years, the society had no formal organization, constitution, bylaws, dues, board of directors, or membership. Rather, it existed as a forum where experts of neurology and ophthalmology could casually collaborate and share experiences and findings. Even after 1990 when the society elected its first board of directors, was formally recognized as a not-for-profit entity by the state of Maryland, drafted a constitution and bylaws, and had a formal member list, the group saw themselves as a \\"happy family\\" rather than professionals meeting in a work environment. Some meetings were even described as \\"raucous,\\" with presentations being full of puns and clinical events so bizarre that the audience had no choice but to laugh. In 1992, the Walsh Society became a subgroup of the North American Neuro-Ophthalmology Society. The integration of the Walsh Society into a larger, more official society, in addition to the creation of a board of directors, constitution, and formal membership, drew criticism from several members. Some believed that the movement to make the society more formal and organized turned a purely academic environment into one diluted by political and economic issues. The society still meets to this day on an annual basis. = Impact on Neuro-Ophthalmology = In the words of a modern neuro-ophthalmologist, \\"Dr. Walsh developed a body of knowledge, recorded that knowledge, and shared it in an organized and systematic fashion which has not been improved upon, even to this day.\\" In 2005, the sixth edition of Clinical Neuro-Ophthalmology was published as Walsh and Hoyt's Clinical Neuro-Ophthalmology in 3 volumes edited by Neil R. Miller and Nancy J. Newman.Nancy J. Newman, MD - Emory Eye Center - Emory University After his death in 1978, the Wilmer Eye Institute established the Frank B. Walsh Chair of Neuro-ophthalmology, the first such chair in the world. Walsh is considered by many to be the father of neuro-ophthalmology, as he both pioneered and promoted the field. = Postmortem honors = In 2000, Frank B. Walsh was inducted into the American Society of Cataract and Refractive Surgery Ophthalmology Hall of Fame.

Modern Muslim female athletes have achieved success in a variety of sports, including volleyball, tennis, association football, fencing, and basketball. In the 2016 Olympics, fourteen Muslim women won medals, participating in a wide range of sports. Still, Muslim women are underrepresented in athletic arenas, from school and amateur sports to international competitions. Causes may include cultural or familial pressures, the lack of suitable facilities and programs, and bans on the hijab, the Islamic headscarf. Muslim women have used sports as a means to empowerment, working towards health and wellbeing, women's rights, and education.  Professional sports  = Association football = Paris Saint- Germain attacking midfielder Fatmire Alushi Several nations that are members of the Organisation of Islamic Cooperation (OIC) have hosted major association football tournaments. UEFA's Azerbaijan hosted the 2012 FIFA U-17 Women's World Cup and set an average match attendance record for the tournament (since broken by Costa Rica in 2014); the official mascot for this world cup was the Top Top Girl (Top Top Qƒ±z), a young girl with the national flag of Azerbaijan painted on her cheeks. Jordan will host the 2016 FIFA U-17 Women's World Cup, the first female soccer world cup to be held anywhere in the Middle East. Additionally, three Asian regions containing significant numbers of OIC member states and/or large Muslim populations have inaugurated women's championships, including South Asia (SAFF Women's Championship, first edition held in 2010); ASEAN (AFF Women's Championship, 2006); and West Asia (West Asian Football Federation Championship, 2005). A number of Muslim female footballers have been prominent players for various UEFA national teams in Western Europe. These include Fatmire Alushi (n√©e Bajramaj), who was a world champion with Germany at the 2007 FIFA Women's World Cup in China and a two-time winner of the UEFA European Women's Championship (2009, 2013), and French national team player Jessica Houara-d'Hommeaux. = Basketball = Unlike many other sports associations, FIBA, basketball's international governing body, prohibits any headgear wider than five inches, effectively prohibiting players from wearing hijabs. Since 2016, the policy has received scrutiny from hundreds of thousands of individuals on social media, a movement that was headed by NCAA players Indira Kaljo and Bilqis Abdul-Qaadir. Fellow players Ezdihar Abdulmula, Asma Elbadawi, Ki-Ke Rafiu, Raisa Aribatul, Raabya Pasha, Merve Sapci, and Noha Berhan have also created petitions asking FIBA to repeal the ban. Both Kaljo and Abdul-Qaadir achieved considerable success in high school and college basketball. Abdul-Qaadir was the 2009 Massachusetts Gatorade Player of the Year, scored over 3000 points during high school (a state record for both boys and girls), and was named to the C-USA All-Academic team during her career at the University of Memphis. Kaljo was a JUCO All-American player who only began wearing the hijab in her late 20s. Both women chose not to pursue a professional basketball career as a result of their religious convictions. = Cricket = Pakistan women's cricket team (in green) after a match against England at the 2009 World Cup In the ICC Women's Rankings, two of the top ten teams (Pakistan and Bangladesh) are from Muslim-majority countries,ICC Women's Rankings, International Cricket Council.

She chose the sport because it was one of the few that she could compete in without altering the uniform. In an interview with Tamerra Griffin, she said that she hoped to be an impetus for diversity in a sphere that has \\"always been a white sport reserved for people with money\\". Ibtihaj was ranked eighth in the world entering the 2016 Summer Olympics, but lost in the round of 16 to France's C√©celia Berder. Tunisian foil fencer In√©s Boubakri won the bronze medal at the 2016 Summer Olympics, defeating Russian Aida Shanayeva in the medal round. She dedicated her medal to all Arab women, saying that she wished her victory to be a message that \\"women exist and they have their place in society\\". = Figure skating = Russian figure skater Alina Zagitova is the 2018 Olympic champion, 2018 European champion, 2017‚Äì18 Grand Prix Final champion, and the holder of the world record scores in both senior and junior ladies' figure skating. In 2012, Zahra Lari became the first figure skater to represent the United Arab Emirates in international competitions; she is also the first figure skater to compete internationally while wearing a hijab and full-body covering. = Ice hockey = Abu Dhabi native Fatima Al Ali plays for the United Arab Emirates women's national ice hockey team. As part of the \\"Hockey is for Everyone\\" campaign in February 2017, she practiced with the Washington Capitals of the National Hockey League and with the Washington Pride of the Junior Women's Hockey League. She hopes to inspire other Muslim women in the United Arab Emirates to play hockey. She also participated in a ceremonial puck drop during a game between the Washington Capitals and the Detroit Red Wings on February 9, 2017. = Martial arts = In the 2016 Summer Olympics, more Muslim women won medals in martial arts events than in any other sport. Majlinda Kelmendi won gold in judo in the 52-kg weight class, the first ever medal for her native Kosovo. Mariya Stadnik (48-kg wrestling) won silver for Azerbaijan, and Iranian Kimia Alizadeh Zenoorin and Egyptian Hedaya Malak tied for bronze in the 57-kg taekwondo event. Other bronze medalists include Azerbaijani Patimat Abakarova (49-kg taekwondo), Tunisian Marwa Amri (58-kg wrestling), and Turkish Nur Tatar (67-kg taekwondo). = Mountaineering = In 2005, Iranians Farkhondeh Sadegh and Leila Bahrami became the first Muslim women to successfully climb Mount Everest. They dedicated their accomplishment to all Muslim women, saying, \\"People often seem to think Muslim women are limited. It would be a good chance to show the world that something like this is possible for us.\\" Raha Moharrak became the youngest Arab and first Saudi woman to peak Everest in 2013. = Tennis = Sania Mirza, a former world No. 1 in women's tennis doubles, is an Indian Muslim. Several OIC member states host professional- level tennis tournaments. As of 2016, there are Women's Tennis Association (WTA) Tour events in Malaysia (Malaysian Open, Kuala Lumpur; inaugurated 2010), Morocco (Grand Prix SAR La Princesse Lalla Meryem, Rabat; 2001), Qatar (Qatar Open, Doha; 2001), Turkey (Istanbul Cup; 2005), the United Arab Emirates (Dubai Tennis Championships; 1993), and Uzbekistan (Tashkent Open; 1999). A number of OIC member states are also experiencing rapid economic development and constructing tennis facilities on a previously unprecedented scale. Notable Muslim female tennis players include Selima Sfar, Aravane Reza√Ø, Dinara Safina, Sania Mirza, Ons Jabeur, and Fatma Al-Nabhani. Reza√Ø, an Iranian-French player, has won four WTA titles and achieved a career-high singles ranking of 15. Primarily a doubles player, Mirza reached a #1 doubles ranking in 2015, winning 40 career titles. She has faced severe criticism from Muslim clerics in her native India, who condemn her decision to wear conventional tennis outfits as \\"indecent\\". = Track and field = At the 2016 Summer Olympics, Dalilah Muhammad became the first American woman to win a gold medal in the 400 metre hurdles, and is the world record holder in the event. Muhammad's parents attribute her success to her \\"Muslim faith, discipline, and talent\\". Other notable Muslim track and field athletes include Sarah Attar, Sifan Hassan, who holds the world record in the Mile, Salwa Eid Naser, Enas Mansour, Dina el-Tabaa, Shinoona Salah Al-Habsi, Kariman Abulijadayel, Kamiya Yousufi, and Sulaiman Fatima Dahman. = Volleyball = Between 2010 and 2016, teams from Turkey and Azerbaijan won five out of seven titles at the FIVB Volleyball Women's Club World Championship. Both nations are part of the OIC. During the same period, in the CEV Women's Champions League, Turkish clubs won five out of six editions from 2010 to 2015. The Turkish women's national volleyball team has enjoyed significant success in the twenty-first century. They won gold at the Mediterranean Games in 2005, finished first in the 2014 European League, and beat Poland 3‚Äì0 in the final of the inaugural European games in 2015. Other notable women's national volleyball teams from the OIC include Azerbaijan, Algeria (who were African champions in 2009 and gold medallists at the 2011 All-Africa Games), and three-times African champions Tunisia. At the 2016 Summer Olympics, Egyptian beach volleyball player Doaa Elghobashy made international headlines for competing in pants, a long-sleeved shirt, and a hijab. While she and her partner Nada Meawad did not advance to the knockout stage of the tournament, she saw the event as a chance to increase the visibility and participation of minorities in sports. = Weightlifting = Until 2011, regulations requiring weightlifters' knees and elbows to be visible prevented conservative Muslim athletes from participating in elite competitions. American weightlifter Kulsoom Abdullah compiled an extensive report to the International Weightlifting Federation arguing that she should be allowed to compete while covering her head, arms, and legs. With the help of Muslim activists, the US Olympic committee, and a lawyer, she was successful in overturning the regulation, and competed in a national championship later that year. Several Muslim women won medals in weightlifting during the 2016 Summer Olympics, including Kazakh Zhazira Zhapparkul, Indonesian Sri Wahyuni Agustiani, and Egyptian Sara Ahmed.  Amateur sports  Maldivian girls' soccer team Researchers have found low participation rates in physical education and school sports among Muslim schoolgirls in both predominantly Muslim and predominantly non-Muslim nations. In a study of Turkish middle schools, H√ºmeri√ß and colleagues found that girls were less likely to attend physical education classes, and were less active on average when they did participate. This discrepancy is often even more pronounced in Western countries, where school policies on dress code and opposite-sex interaction often conflict with conservative Muslim students' values. Muslim girls, for example, may be forced or pressured to remove their head coverings in order to participate in sports. Physical education may also pose problems for Muslim students whose beliefs require them to avoid physical contact with the opposite sex. Sports participation is likely to increase in predominantly Muslim countries, especially Arab states of the Persian Gulf, in the future. Many OIC states have rapidly growing economies and increasingly youthful populations, which may increase market potential for professional sports, athletic products, and community sports organization.  Factors affecting sports participation  = Religious = In the Islamic conception, every human being has a responsibility towards oneself. Since human life is sacred and initially created by divine rather than human agency, people are responsible for trying to keep their bodies and souls healthy, and not causing themselves spiritual or physical harm. Traditions record that Muhammad raced with his wife Aisha, and that he encouraged parents to teach their children swimming, riding and archery. Persian miniatures show Muslim women jointly playing polo with men in the same field. In the twenty-first century, some Muslim sociologists even argue that it should be obligatory for Muslim females to participate in sport of some kind. Female-only gyms and competitions have also emerged as a way to increase Muslim women's participation in sports. In 2014, several members of Sport Against Racism Ireland created Diverse City FC, a football team for Muslim women that competed in the Fair Play Cup. Similarly, in 1993 Faezeh Hashemi founded the Women's Islamic Games, an international event where all athletes, coaches, officials, and spectators were female. Since the hijab is generally worn only in the presence of males outside of the immediate family, this format allows women to compete without facing scrutiny for the way they dress. Some communities have also created female-only gyms targeted specifically at Muslim women. The Islamic Solidarity Games also seek to be compatible with the unique needs of Muslim female athletes, using sport to \\"protect the interests of the Muslim world\\" and \\"promoting international peace and harmony\\". = Family = In a study of young Muslim women living in the United Kingdom, Kay Tess found that family influences heavily impacted their ability to participate in sports. The women spent much of their time within the home, and their outside activities were frequently monitored by their parents. Since there were very few culturally appropriate sports programs within their community, their participation was limited. Managers of sports teams in predominantly Muslim countries also report difficulty in convincing parents to allow their daughters to participate in sports. = Structural = The Iranian women's national football team training in Azadi Stadium Many sports organizations and competitions do not provide the support and resources needed by Muslim female athletes. For example, until 2012, athletes were not allowed to wear the Islamic headscarf, commonly known as the hijab, while competing in the majority of Olympic events. The same year marked the first time that the Olympic Committee took Ramadan into account, scheduling events with fasting athletes early in the morning so that they would be maximally fed and hydrated. Although sensitivity to the needs of Muslim athletes has increased at the elite level, many competitions still include significant structural barriers. The International Basketball Federation, for example, prohibited hijabi athletes from competing in any of its matches or tournaments. The Qatar national team withdrew from the 2014 Asian Games as a result of the ban, as many of their players wore the hijab. This ban was overturned in May 2017. FIFA also instituted a hijab ban in 2011, forcing the Iranian women's team to forfeit an Olympic qualifying match. Such regulations are usually justified based on claims that hijabs are safety threats, increasing athletes' risk of suffocation and heatstroke. To combat this issue, several companies have developed sports hijabs that are no more dangerous than commonplace sports equipment like jerseys and cleats. In response, FIFA has since rescinded its hijab ban and now allows athletes to compete in approved sports hijabs = Cultural = As is the case in many societies, gender roles prevalent in Muslim communities can limit women's participation in sports. Traditional expectations focus on women's roles as wives and mothers, and often see sport as a primarily male domain. Risa Isard found that female footballers and spectators in Iran, Palestine, and Turkey struggle with the popular view of football as a \\"man's game\\" that is unsuitable for women's participation. Turkish national team player Esra Erol also reports that she was allowed to play football as a child, but that she faced greater scrutiny for her athletic pursuits as she reached adolescence and adulthood. At the same time, sociologist Kay Tess observed that some Muslim families view sports as an unnecessary distraction from education, which they see as highly important. Cultural barriers to sports participation are by no means unique to Muslim societies. In a wide variety of contexts, researchers have found gender differences in people's belief in their own athletic abilities. On average, men and boys perceive themselves as more athletically competent than women and girls, which may increase their propensity to participate in sports. In adolescence, girls tend to have lower sports participation rates, and this discrepancy increases with age. Additionally, women who participate in competitive sports are often negatively stigmatized as being lesbians, regardless of their actual sexuality. Muslim women sometimes face cultural barriers to sports participation that are common across societies in addition to those specific to their communities.  Media portrayal  Muslim women's participation in sports is often seen as an indication that they are becoming more liberated and Western. For example, when Afghan sprinter Robina Muqimyar competed in the 2004 Summer Olympics, Western media sources praised her for exchanging the burqa, which they saw as inherently oppressive, for sports attire. Mahfoud Amara labels this type of coverage as \\"orientalist\\" and \\"culturally imperialistic\\", as it measures Muslim women's freedom and wellbeing by whether or not they conform to Western athletic norms and expectations. On the other hand, Muslim female athletes often face criticism and scrutiny when they do not conform to Western athletic ideals. Hijabi athletes were excluded from the Olympic Games until 1996, and debate continues about whether or not head covering is a religious symbol that is out of place in secular athletic spheres. Samie and Sehlikoglu report that media coverage of hijabi athletes at the 2012 Summer Olympics portrayed them as \\"strange, incompetent, and out-of-place\\". Disproportionate attention was given to Muslim nations with a low female-to-male athlete ratio, as well as veiling and Ramadan fasting. Reporters also frequently alluded to exotic sexuality of Muslim female athletes, fetishizing both their covering and their bodies. Some Muslim female athletes have expressed concern that media sources focus on their clothing choices to the exclusion of their athletic achievements. For example, Turkish taekwondo athlete K√ºbra Daƒülƒ± wrote on social media, \\"They don't speak of my success, but of my headscarf. I don‚Äôt want this. Our success should be discussed.\\" Milliyet newspaper columnist Asu Maro documented two distinct sources of criticism K√ºbra Daƒülƒ± faced ‚Äì Muslims who saw taekwondo itself as improper for women, and secular organizations that wanted her to remove her hijab during competitions. He condemned both groups as holding \\"sexist ideologies\\" that are harmful to K√ºbra Daƒülƒ± and other Muslim female athletes. In 2017, Nike unveiled its \\"Pro Hijab\\", a hijab designed for safety and comfort during strenuous exercise. The garment was tested by elite athletes like figure skater Zahra Lari, and is set to be sold starting in early 2018.  Empowerment through sports  Researchers have consistently found significant positive effects of sports participation, both within Muslim communities and in the general population. Specifically, organized physical activity promotes physical, psychological, and social wellbeing, leadership skills, and community involvement. Many women also use sport as a way to challenge traditional gender norms and obtain an education. = Women's rights = Muslim women have used sports as a way to challenge patriarchal norms. In a case study of the Palestinian women's national football team, GieŒ≤-St√ºber and colleagues found that sport had become a \\"social movement for self- determination, agency, peace and friendship\\" in the players' lives. Several of the players also saw their athletics as opportunities to challenge assumptions about the roles and capabilities of women. Specifically, player Jackline Jazrawl wanted to use football to prove that \\"women are free and can do whatever men do\\". Local Palestinian leaders supported this movement by providing free tickets to home matches, and thousands of men and women attended. Some Muslim female athletes also see their athletic success as an opportunity to challenge the way non-Muslim communities view Muslim women. For example, mountain climber Leila Bahrami called her successful ascent of Mount Everest a way to \\"show the world\\" that Muslim women are capable rather than \\"limited\\". = Education = Swimmer Farida Osman cited education as an important factor behind her dedication to sports. Some professional and semiprofessional sports leagues are specifically focused on giving women and girls the chance to receive an education. For example, Sakarya, a women's football club in Turkey, encourages its players to use their stipends to pursue a university education. This opportunity is even influential in convincing families to let their daughters play football, which is traditionally considered to be a man's game. Athletic scholarships can also be influential in Muslim girls' decisions to continue pursuing sports during and after secondary school. Several professional Muslim female athletes, including tennis player Fatma Al Nabhani and swimmer Farida Osman, cited education as important to their athletic careers. Their athletic scholarships allowed them to continue competing while also earning a university degree.

Sac County is named for the Sauk people, Sac being a variant of Sauk. with Lake View is located on Black Hawk Lake, which is named after the renowned Sauk war leader. These names came about as Euro-Americans had a tendency to romanticize Native American peoples who they vanquished in the process of westward expansion. Because neither the county nor the lake were within the Sauk people's territory, it is doubtful that they or Black Hawk ever visited this area. Dr. E.E. Speaker and the Lake View Commercial Club sought to have the statue created in 1932 in conjunction with the effort to establish Black Hawk State Park on the shore of what was then named Wall Lake. Harry E. Stinson, a sculptor and associate professor at the University of Iowa, was chosen to create the statue. After choosing Crescent Park as the location of the statue, Stinson created a model based on the body of a university student and the face of Moses Slick, a Native American from Tama, Iowa. The project became the foundation for the Public Works of Art Project in Iowa, which was funded by the Civil Works Administration, a New Deal program during the Great Depression. Based on this project, the University of Iowa created guidelines for other towns in the state who wanted to participate in the program. The city of Lake View also contributed to the effort, and the Civilian Conservation Corps prepared and landscaped the site. The statue was dedicated on September 3, 1934, Labor Day, in a ceremony where the name of the lake was changed from Wall Lake to Black Hawk Lake. The finished statue is slightly different from the model with the features being narrower and sharper. It references Charles Bird King's painting of Black Hawk from in 1837. The statue was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2000.

Torres illustrated Serrano's text. Serrano and Torres published a second book, Basketball (and Other Things): A Collection of Questions Asked, Answered, Illustrated, in 2017; it also became a Times best-seller. Early life Torres grew up in the Garland suburb of Dallas, Texas. He was drawn to art from early childhood, with friends asking to buy his work as early as middle school. High school was his first encounter with working artists: he told Complex Magazine, \\"I went to this gallery and saw this local artist...I was just amazed by it, because I had never seen a real artist or someone who was doing it for a living.\\" Career Torres began his career working a day job managing a co-working space, but was also pursuing art, including designing flyers for bands and DJs. =Collaboration with Shea Serrano= Writer Shea Serrano saw one of Torres's flyers in the course of writing the text for his forthcoming book, The Rap Year Book. Three months from the due date, Serrano still had not found an illustrator, until he saw a flyer announcing a performance by Dallas rap group The Outfit, Texas. As recounted to Texas Monthly, Serrano thought immediately, \\"This is the exact style that I'm trying to find.\\" He contacted the group's management asking for information about who had made their flyer, then tracked Torres down on social media, and Torres agreed to work on the book. The Rap Year Book: The Most Important Rap Song From Every Year Since 1979, Discussed, Debated, and Deconstructed was published on October 13, 2015, and repeatedly made New York Times best-seller lists. Torres and Serrano continued to collaborate, in 2016 developing a weekly newsletter called \\"Basketball (And Other Things)\\" that had 21,000 subscribers as of May 12, 2016. The newsletter was both ad-free and also free to readers, but the audience continually asked to donate to support the work. Usually offers were staunchly refused (Serrano would post screenshots of PayPal refunds issued to supporters who tried to send money anyway), and when the team has occasionally relented, contributions from readers have often been given away to charity. Torres has also drawn a series of limited edition bookmarks, thus far of NBA players and hip-hop artists. The bookmarks, dispersed via Serrano's Twitter feed in exchange for a small fee covering production and shipping costs, a screenshot of a Rap Year Book purchase or simply given away for free, are often all claimed in less than an hour, but as with the newsletter, income is frequently donated to charitable causes. In August 2016, Serrano gleefully announced to Twitter followers who'd purchased Torres's \\"Vengeance Russell\\" (Westbrook) bookmarks that \\"he'd actually tricked them into doing something nice\\": the income paid for some 150 Houston schoolchildren to have free haircuts the day before school started. Following the announcement that the Westbrook bookmark had been a secret fundraiser, other Serrano and Torres fans asked to pay for catering and music at the event, to feed and entertain kids waiting for a haircut. Torres and Serrano next published a book about basketball, which shares a title with the newsletter. Basketball (and Other Things): A Collection of Questions Asked, Answered, Illustrated was published in October 2017 and reached number one on The New York Times best-seller list for sports and fitness books in November. They have also continued to collaborate at The Ringer, which Serrano joined as staff writer in July 2016. =Visual style= Torres has cited superheros and his favorite childhood cartoons as early visual influences. A review in PopMatters described Torres's Rap Year Book illustrations as \\"bright, colorful, and offbeat cartoons...featuring depictions of Kanye and Jay-Z on a movie poster, Dr. Dre in scrubs, Drake using a pottery wheel, and more.\\" Serrano said he was drawn to the texture Torres developed in his work, telling Complex Magazine: \\"It looked like, even when I was looking at it on my phone or computer, I could rub my fingers across the screen and be able to feel the paper that he drew it on.\\" Bibliography * The Rap Year Book: The Most Important Rap Song From Every Year Since 1979, Discussed, Debated, and Deconstructed (Abrams Image, 2015) * Basketball (and Other Things): A Collection of Questions Asked, Answered, Illustrated (Abrams Image, 2017) References External links * Arturo Torres website Living people Artists from Texas American illustrators Year of birth missing (living people) ","title":"Arturo Torres (artist)"},{"id":"51402130","text":"Elizabeth Conrad Hickox (1872/5‚ÄìJuly 19, 1947) was a Wiyot master basket weaver and was considered one of the finest basket-weavers of her time. Her baskets differ from other Lower Klamath baskets through her own unique use of shape, technique, color scheme and design.Delia Sullivan, Heritage Capital Corporation, 2009, Heritage Auctions American Indian Art Auction Catalog #6029, Dallas, TX, Retrieved August 25, 2016, see page 42  Early life  Elizbeth Conrad Hickox's birth year has been given as 1872 and 1875. Hickox's mother was Wiyot and her father, European-American. It was reported that Hickox's mother, Polly, had been abducted by her later husband, Charles Conrad. When Elizabeth was in her teens, she married Frank Merrill (Karuk), and they had two children together, Jessie and Bruce. She later married Luther Hickox in 1895. Luther Hickox owned a gold mine, was a part owner of a sawmill and later became a justice of the peace. The couple enjoyed a high social status among the Karuk people, as well as financial security. Hickox lived along the Salmon River in Northern California.  Artwork  Hickox used various materials to weave her baskets including grape root twining, white bear grass (Xerophyllum tenax), dyed Woodwardia fern, black maidenhair fern and dyed porcupine quills. She tended to use the fern Adiantum aleuticum, a dark material in contrast to the porcupine quills dyed yellow with Letharia vulpina. The choice to mostly use dark materials contrasted with the yellow was her own choice, and not subject to marketplace demands. Between 1911 and 1934, she made about five baskets a year. Hickox and her daughter, Louise, weaved and sold their baskets to Grace Nicholson, who continued to buy their work even during the Great Depression. Though Hickox was Wiyot, Nicholson marketed her baskets as \\"Karuk\\" because they lived in the Karuk area. Before Hickox met Nicholson, she had already chosen to create fine-art baskets. After Nicholson stopped purchasing baskets in 1934, Hickox continued to weave \\"for pleasure, utility and gift-giving.\\" In 2020, the art of Hickox was exhibited in the exhibition Hearts of Our People: Native Women Artists at the Smithsonian American Art Museum.  Death  Hickox died on July 19, 1947.

Spain has moderate animal protections by international standards.  Regulations  In 1877, Spain passed its first provision on animal cruelty, which prohibited the mistreatment of dogs. The Criminal Code of 1928 was the first law to incriminate the abuse of mistreatment of animals in general. Spain's current Penal Code imposes a penalty of three months to one year for cruelly mistreating pets or unjustifiably causing death or serious physical impairment. This legislation applies only to pets, and it is not clear whether this legislation protects animals from suffering caused by a failure to act. Law 32/2007 provides that the government will take measures to ensure that farm animals are not caused unnecessary suffering, and was enacted in order to comply with European Union requirements on farm animal welfare. Spain has at times been found lacking in the implementation of these provisions; for instance, in 2011 the European Commission issued a reasoned opinion calling on Spain to address deficiencies in complying with legislation on the welfare of animals at slaughter, and in 2012 the Commission called on Spain via letter of formal notice to take action in implementing the ban on barren battery cages. Animal nonprofit Compassion in World Farming has also reported evidence of non-compliance with EU animal welfare law related to pigs, including tail docking, sow stalls, and bedding. Law 32 also provides for the licensing of the use of animals in research, prohibits testing cosmetics on animals, and incorporates the Three Rs principles (reduce the number of animals used, refine methods to minimize suffering, and replace animal models where it is deemed possible). Spain's 17 provincial autonomous communities have power to legislate beyond the Law 32 provisions. In 2014 and again in 2020, Spain received a C out of possible grades A,B,C,D,E,F,G on World Animal Protection's Animal Protection Index.  Animal issues  = Animals used for food =  Animal agriculture  In 2013, Spain was producing approximately 600 million broiler chickens and 35 million egg-laying hens annually; these numbers were fairly constant over the preceding decade. The pig meat production is Spain's largest livestock sector, and it has grown significantly since the 1980s. In 2014 the swine sector accounted for 37% of final livestock production and 14% of final agricultural production in Spain. In 2014, 43,483,000 pigs were killed for food. Between January and October 2015, nearly 2 million cows were killed for food. Figures on the number of marine animals killed for food are not readily available, but in 2013 Spain caught 882,000 tons of wild fish and in 2012 produced 262,000 tons of aquaculture fish. As of a 2012 report by the Food and Agriculture Organization, Spain was the fifth-highest rabbit meat producer in the world, slaughtering around 50 million rabbits per year. In investigations of 72 Spanish rabbit farms and 4 slaughterhouses from 2012-2014, animal activist group Animal Equality found common use of blunt force trauma to kill rabbits, workers throwing live rabbits into waste containers due to over-production, animals with open wounds or infections left in cages without veterinary treatment, cannibalism among some animals due to over-crowding, farms which had never received health and bio-security inspections, and dead animals rotting in cages next to live animals.  Veganism  Figures on the number of vegans in Spain are not readily available. However, in 2007 the EU estimated that 4% of the Spanish population was vegetarian, while a 2012 article placed the proportion at 0.5%. Plant-based diets appear to be gaining in popularity; the number of vegan or vegetarian restaurants listed in Spain increased from 353 in 2011 to 686 in 2014. = Animals used for research = According to official statistics, 821,570 research procedures were performed on non-human animals in Spain in 2014. Mice, rats, fish, and birds accounted for 93% of research animals in Spain. Of these procedures, 53% were categorized as subthreshold or mild, 27% as mild, 8% severe, and 12% non- recovery (i.e. the animal was killed). = Festivals = Approximately 60,000 animals are killed in festivals throughout Spain each year. Activities at these festivals include pulling the heads off live chickens, throwing live turkeys off of a church tower, bullfighting, chasing bulls off of piers into the sea, chasing bulls down the streets with flaming brands attached to their horns, and dragging a bull by its horns and forcing it to bow in front of the statue of a saint before being slaughtered. An estimated 11,000 bulls were tortured and killed in Spanish festivals in 2014. = Animals used for clothing = As of 2013, Spain was producing approximately 700,000 mink pelts annually, with mink fur production rapidly growing. In undercover investigation of the Spanish mink farm Eurozeltifur, animal activist group Animal Equality obtained footage of mink with severed limbs due to cannibalism, and of mink killed by the standard method of gas poisoning, which causes seizures, edema, and bleeding in the lungs before the mink die. = Animal personhood = In 2007, Spain's Balearic Islands province granted legal personhood to great apes. In 2008, Spain's lower house of Parliament passed a non-binding resolution granting legal personhood to apes, but the formal actions needed from the federal government to make this formal law have not been taken.  Animal activism  The first Spanish animal rights group, Association for the Defense of Animal Rights (ADDA), was founded in 1975. The ADDA's activities include lobbying for improved animal welfare policies at local, regional, national, and European levels (e.g. pushing for bans on bullfighting in Barcelona and Catalonia), conducting informational campaigns, and promoting alternatives to animal testing. In 2003, the first political party against animal cruelty, the Animalist Party Against Mistreatment of Animals (PACMA), was founded. PACMA has yet to reach representation in the national parliament. In 2007, Animal Equality activists conducted an open rescue of three pigs from a Spanish pig farm. Also in 2007, eleven Animal Liberation Front activists were detained after releasing roughly 20,000 mink from a fur farm. In 2011, a group of unknown activists removed 36 dogs from Isoquimem, a company which breeds dogs for research, generating one of the largest media responses in the history of the Spanish animal rights movement. The international animal activist nonprofit Animal Equality is active in Spain, having conducted undercover investigations of animal farms, open rescues of farmed animals, bull-fighting protests, distributing leaflets about veganism, and at one point in 2014 having the most social media followers of any non-governmental organization in Spain.

The player climbs six of the world's highest mountains while avoiding trees, animals, falling rocks, and landslides. The mountains in the game are Mount Hood, the Matterhorn, Mount Kenya, Mount McKinley (now known as Denali), Mount Garmo, and Mount Everest. The alpiner cartridge originally retailed for $39.95 (USD). Gameplay After selecting 1-2 players and moving past the main screen with the mountains and elevations the game begins. The player must climb the side of each mountain and make it to the summit in the allotted time. Obstacles placed in the alpiner's way include falling rocks, wild animals, trees, and brush fires that they must avoid to continue up the mountain. In level 7 the avalanche obstacle is introduced and in level 13 the ice falls. Being hit by obstacles will result in sliding down the mountain, some further than others. If the alpiner slides all the way down the mountain one of the lives are lost. Players receive an additional life every time they make it to the top of Mount Everest. There are 18 levels in the game divided into 3 rounds, the player must climb each of the six mountains successfully to continue on to the next round. Sound The game can be played with or without the commentary or voices, but to play with them requires the use of the TI Solid State Speech Synthesizer. The voices and commentary help to warn of approaching obstacles and comment on your progress. The music heard during gameplay is Anitra's Dance from Act IV of Peer Gynt by Norwegian composer Edvard Grieg. The music heard after reaching the top of Mount Everest is a fragment of the Suite No. 2, in D Major II - Alla Hornpipe; from Water Music, by German composer Georg Friedrich H√§ndel. Cheat Pressing the keys \\"*#*\\" (in that exact sequence) on the game's title screen, allows the player to choose how many lives he/she wishes to start the games with. The player can choose from 1 to 9 lives and the level of difficulty (from 1 to 18). Be aware, however, that enabling this cheat displays the word \\"Test\\" on the bottom left of the screen, so you won't fool your friends with the cheat enabled.

Hellenbrand was a case in the U.S. state of New York concerning the admissibility of a prior statement by a person who later refused to testify in court. American law assures a defendant an opportunity to confront people testifying against them (so the prior statement would only be someone's hearsay statement), but prohibits a person from profiting by their wrongdoing so should not be able to avoid the statement if they criminally induced the person to not testify in court.  Holding  In 1983, the Second Department of New York's Appellate Division held that hearsay statements of a declarant who refuses to testify at trial are admissible for the truth of the matter asserted. The Court, while recognizing the Constitutional mandates of the Confrontation Clause, held that a defendant should not benefit from his or her wrongdoing in preventing a witness from testifying against him or her, and hearsay statements of the declarant are thus admissible if the prosecution can meet its burden. Holtzman established the New York precedent of Sirois hearings‚Äîan evidentiary hearing to determine the admissibility of out-of-court statements by an unavailable witness.  Factual Background  The defendant, Mr. Neil Sirois, was charged in Kings County with second-degree murder. Mr. Sirois's wife was present at the scene of the alleged murder on December 6, 1980. Following her testimony before a grand jury, and the subsequent indictment of her husband, Mrs. Sirois partially recanted and informed the Assistant District Attorney that she would not testify. She then fled the jurisdiction.(Holtzman v Hellenbrand, 92 A.D.2d 405, 407 [2nd Dept 1983].) On March 1, 1983, Mrs. Sirois was arrested on a material witness order, in Kings County, where she had assumed a different name. Sirois continued to refuse to testify against her husband. The judge threatened contempt, offered in-camera testimony, and offered transactional immunity, and she continued to refuse to testify. Mrs. Sirois was held in contempt of the court's order and sentenced to 30 days' incarceration and a $250 fine. Based on the incarceration, the People moved to adjourn for the 30 days, which the trial court denied. Without further evidence, the case was dismissed. The People appealed, arguing that U.S. v. Mastrangelo required the court hold a hearing to determine whether or not \\"the defendant by his misconduct had induced his wife to unlawfully refused to testify at trial.\\" References New York (state) state case law Law articles needing an infobox ","title":"Holtzman v.

He specializes in the creation of cultural venues. In 2005 he bought and heavily reformed H√¥tel du Nord, building listed as an historical monument, a place which is known to have inspired the 1938 Marcel Carn√©'s feature film of 1938. Then in 2009 he bought with Abel Nahmias, the Theatre Le Trianon. It carries a heavy restoration of the building. Then it was the turn of the Elysee Montmartre, which he bought in 2014, destroyed after a major fire. He realizes the complete reconstruction of the Theater. Life = Early life = He was born and raised in Paris, France, he began his professional career very young, in different small business, he also directed several short film and music video. Quickly, his professional interests have centered on architecture, this topics has always been an integral part of his life, his father and his mother being architectural book publisher. =Career= Architectural approach Julien Labrousse illustrates the implementation of a modern craft; a shape which is sensitized to innovation. His wish is to be able to control his activities and to live in an environment that he likes, perhaps in an illusory, free and independent way. In fact, he consciously or unconsciously manages his development according to his potential resources, while room operators and operators for cultural equipment are evolving more and more in an institutional and normative environment. Philosophy His philosophy on human resource management avoids any coercive approach, and the approach favours decentralisation, even if the term is a little bit ridiculous, he responds to this idea by saying that; centralization in business management focuses on order, while decentralization focuses on freedom. Decisions are taken collectively and he values every point of view. Julien Labrousse had traveled and done several jobs. As a result, he has a large opening to the world. He is also a self-made man in the sense that he has developed a personality on his own. He has acquired various professional experiences at all levels. Endowed with entrepreneurial skills, focusing on his idiosyncratic skills, he strives to do an original design, what seduces ‚Äúalternative consumers‚Äù or ‚Äúalternative producers‚Äù in other words; he builds ‚Äòhis‚Äô market, without trying to compete directly with existing activities. With this in mind, he combines the mastery of a craft and the knowhow. Reconstruction of Elys√©e Montmartre This is the second time that the French architect and entrepreneur, Julien Labrousse is playing a vital role in the recovery and reconstruction of a theater in Paris, he has been able to bring a soul at his realisation place, something indescribable but that sets apart the Trianon and the Elys√©e Montmartre from other Parisian halls. Elys√©e Montmartre is one of the most famous concert venue in Paris where played many famous artist:, David Bowie, Daft Punk, Bj√∂rk, red hot chili peppers, Wu-Tang Clan, Public Enemy, Cyndi Lauper. Elys√©e Montmartre is a French major cultural venue since 1807. This is where the French Cancan have been created. The soul Aristotle defines as cause of the vital movement among the living. This seems to be the focal point of Julien Labrousse, he defends a musical architecture, for this reason, he can‚Äôt find a better subject than concert halls. It combines a little outdated and stylish pace, materials selected with precision. Project after project, we begin to discern a style in these various achievements.

He is best known for his activities in the late 1960s as an unofficial leader of the Yorkville hippies, founder of the Diggers movement in Yorkville and for staging protests and a sit-in at the Toronto city council chambers in 1967 in an ultimately unsuccessful bid to make Yorkville a pedestrian-only street.Henderson, Stuart R. Making the Scene: Yorkville and Hip Toronto in the 1960s. Toronto: University of Toronto Press, 2011. David DePoe was born in Toronto in 1944 and is the son of well-known CBC journalist Norman DePoe and Madeline DePoe. He joined the Pearson government initiative, the Company of Young Canadians (CYC) project, in 1966. In 1967, under guidance from the CYC, he founded the Diggers in the Yorkville neighbourhood of Toronto.http://www.cbc.ca/archives/entry/yorkville-hippie-haven At this time Yorkville was the hippie capital of Canada and local politicians, the police force and residents were concerned over the developing youth subculture. The initiative was inspired by the Diggers theatre group that was active in the Haight-Ashbury area of San Francisco. The Digger group in Yorkville was concerned with community action and provided support to youth in need of food and shelter. DePoe's activities came to national attention in 1967 prompting the Star Weekly to publish a picture of him on the cover of an issue in September 1967 with the headline \\"SUPER HIPPIE,\\" a title he himself disdained. He was known as the unofficial spokesperson for Yorkville through a number of disputes with Toronto city council over traffic in Yorkville, most famously with former mayor and councillor Allan A. Lamport. DePoe led a series of sit- ins throughout the city during the period of August 17 to August 24, 1967 to try to persuade the city to close Yorkville Avenue to vehicle traffic and create a pedestrian mall as Yorkville was the site of numerous coffee houses, cafes, and shops. Traffic had become a problem as people came to the cruise the strip and gawk at the hippies. The city had grown frustrated with the traffic and a perceived problem with drugs and vagrancy. On August 17 David DePoe and the Diggers were invited to a \\"Talk-in\\" with Allan Lamport. The talks did not go well and on August 20 a sit-in was held in the middle of Yorkville Avenue. After a number of arrests the large group moved to Queen's Park and finally, on August 23 a \\"sleep-in\\" took place in front of Toronto's City Hall. Ultimately these efforts were not successful. The protests were documented by the National Film Board of Canada in their film \\"The Summer of '67\\".

He succeeded his nephew Jayavarman as the ruler of the Jejakabhukti region (Bundelkhand in present-day Madhya Pradesh and Uttar Pradesh).  Early life  Prithvivarman and his elder brother Sallakshanavarman were sons of the Chandela ruler Kirttivarman from the same mother, as stated in the Mau inscription. After Kirttivarman's death, Sallakshana and his son Jayavarman ruled the Chandela king. After Jayavarman abdicate the throne and retired, Prithvivarman became the new king.  Career  Like his predecessors, Prithvivarman issued copper coins featuring the deity Hanuman. He is also known from the four later Chandela inscriptions: * Augasi copper-plate inscription of Madanavarman * Mau inscription of Madanavarman * Ajaygarh inscription of Kalyanadevi (the wife of Viravarman) * Ajaygarh inscription of Ganapati These inscriptions do not mention any glorious achievements of Prithvivarman. However, this does not necessarily mean that he was a weak ruler; it is possible that he did not adopt an aggressive expansionist policy. The Mau inscription states that he handled the hereditary administration well. It also contains a conventional eulogy, describing him as someone who practiced the conduct of the \\"Golden age\\" by hating the ill-behaved persons, delighting those worthy, taking lawful wealth and spending it according to the sacred texts, and protecting all beings. According to the Mau inscription, Prithvivarman appointed Gadadhara as his chief minister. Gadadhara had served as a pratihara (chamberlain) to the previous king Jayavarman, and his father Ananta had served as a chief minister to the Chandela kings before Prithvivarman. An Ajaygarh inscription mentions Gokula of Gauda family as another hereditary minister of Prithvivarman. Prithvivarman is given the usual royal titles Parama-bhattaraka Maharajadhiraja Parameshvara in the Augasi inscription.

Despite this, Hailey begins to be bullied by classmates Theresa (Christy St. John), Sally (Cher Hubsher), and Claire (Priscilla Emprechtinger. While in the bathtub, Shae feels a strange experience, as if her flesh was burning. Proving to be a hallucination, Shae's behavior continues to grow stranger. When relaying this strange behavior to Brett, Hailey is introduced to a story about a little boy who used to live in that house. The boy, named Jimmy Oberest, drowned his baby sister in acid before killing his parents. Mike (Bobby Emprechtinger), Todd's mechanic boss, comes to visit, as he used to date Shae in college. He finds her hovering behind Jessica while holding a scalpel. After this encounter, Mike immediately goes to see Delilah, the property manager, begging her to spare Shae. Delilah refuses this. Later, Mike dies when Todd inadvertently starts a fire in the auto shop. During this, Jessica works in the garden, repeatedly cutting herself and covered in blood. Later on, Todd is seen as a bar. While there, Delilah appears and tries to seduce him. When Todd arrives home, he is then strangely seduced by his wife, who is revealed to be Shae in a type of supernatural disguise. Hailey is introduced to Brett's friend Jenny (Lai-Ling Bernstein). Jenny is said to be psychic and reluctantly decides to help Hailey and her family by going to their house to cleanse it.

Brett reveals that the little boy he was talking about prior, along with his family, practiced black magic in the house. They had opened a portal to Hell. Delilah is uncovered to be Jimmy Oberest's sister, who was not home at the time of Jimmy's murders. Hailey sees two men transporting Jenny's body, cutting her conversation with Brett short in order to follow. Back at the house Shae, fully possessed, attacks Jessica inside the house. Meanwhile, Theresa and her friends confront Brett, badgering him about helping Hailey and getting Jenny involved. Hailey follows the two men, coming upon a makeshift graveyard. There she notices a marker that is reserved with the Jacobson name. Theresa and her friends confront Hailey, revealing the nature of the town and its people. She explains that the townspeople must feed the house or else the evil spirit inside will come after them.

Early life Ram√≥n Laureano is the only son of Nina and Ram√≥n, He was raised in Santo Domingo, Dominican Republic. Career =Houston Astros= Laureano played college baseball at Northeastern Oklahoma A&M; College and was drafted by the Houston Astros in the 16th round of the 2014 Major League Baseball draft. He made his professional debut with the Greeneville Astros in 2014 and batted .189 with one home run and two RBIs in 16 games, and played 2015 with the Quad Cities River Bandits, batting .265 with four home runs, 34 RBIs and 18 stolen bases. Laureano started 2016 with the Lancaster JetHawks and was promoted to the Corpus Christi Hooks in July. Laureano finished 2016 with a combined .319 batting average along with 15 home runs, 73 RBIs and a .955 OPS in 116 total games between both teams. He returned to Corpus Christi in 2017 where he posted a .227 batting average with 11 home runs, 55 RBIs and 24 stolen bases. =Oakland Athletics= After the 2017 season, Laureano was eligible to be selected during the Rule 5 draft. Instead of placing him on the 40-man roster to prevent his selection, the Astros traded Laureano to the Oakland Athletics in exchange for pitcher Brandon Bailey on November 20, 2017. On August 3, 2018, the Athletics called up Laureano and he made his major league debut. His first major league hit that night was a walk-off single to break a scoreless tie in the 13th inning against the Detroit Tigers. Since the RBI became a stat in 1920, Laureano is the first Athletic to hit a walk-off RBI hit as their first major league hit. On August 20, 2018, he hit his first two major league home runs off Bartolo Col√≥n in a 9-0 shutout victory over the Texas Rangers. On September 7, 2018, he hit two more home runs in an 8-4 win over the Rangers, becoming the first player in A's franchise history to have 2 multi-homer games in his first 30 career games, achieving this in 29 games played. On May 7, 2019, Laureano robbed Joey Votto of a home run in the sixth inning against the Cincinnati Reds, which would aid Mike Fiers's second career no-hitter. In 2019, Laureano batted .288/.340/.521 with 24 home runs and 67 RBIs. On defense he led all major league center fielders in errors, with 7, and had the lowest fielding percentage of all major center fielders (.974). In the Wild Card Game, Laureano drove in the Athletics' only run with a sacrifice fly. The Athletics were defeated 5‚Äì1 by the Tampa Bay Rays. On August 9, 2020, Laureano was ejected for the first time in his career for charging at the Houston Astros bench to go after Astros hitting coach, Alex Cintr√≥n, causing the benches to empty. He was suspended six games on August 11 due to the incident. Upon appeal, the suspension was reduced to four games, and began on August 14. In 2020, he batted .213/.338/.366 with 6 home runs, 25 RBIs, and an AL-leading 12 hit-by-pitch. Skills profile Laureano has drawn attention for the strength and accuracy of his arm.

Jews retaliated the next day against Arabs in Tel Aviv killing two in Petah Tikvah.  Incident  On the evening of 15 April 1936, a group of Arabs believed to be followers of Izz al-Din al- Qassam near Anabta constructed a roadblock on the road between Nablus and Tulkarm, stopping about 20 vehicles moving along that road, and demanding arms and cash from the drivers. The Arabs separated two Jewish drivers and one passenger (Israel Hazan) from the others and shot them. Two of the shooting victims died; one survived. The Arabs told their victims that they were gathering the money and munitions to carry on the work of the \\"Holy Martyrs\\" who had worked with Izz ad-Din al-Qassam (then recently killed) with the goal of killing \\"all Jews and Britons in Palestine.\\"\\"Front Page 1 ‚Äì No Title, Wireless to The New York Times\\" 18 April 1936 . One of the other drivers in the convoy was left unharmed when he shouted \\"I am a Christian German,\\" and was told to \\"Go ahead for Hitler's sake.\\" One of the dead, Zvi Danenberg, was driving a truckload of crated chickens to Tel Aviv. Danenberg survived for 5 days before dying of his wounds. Yisrael Hazan, age 70, died immediately after being shot; he had recently immigrated to Palestine from Salonika. He is buried in the Trumpeldor Cemetery.  Funeral and protests  Two Arab laborers were killed on the following night near Petah Tikva, one describing the attackers as Jews before he died. Hazan's 17 April funeral in Tel Aviv was the scene of demonstrations with thousands of protestors marching against the British government of Palestine and against the Arab attacks on Jews. \\"All the stores in the city were closed. The factories also stopped work during the funeral.\\" According to a British report, on 17 April, cases of assault by Jews against Arabs \\"took place in Herzl Street, ha-Yarkon Street, Allenby Road near the General Post Office, outside the Cinema Moghraby and at the seashore bus terminus\\". The Anabta/Tulkarm shooting is widely seen as prelude to or as the beginning of the violence and killings of the 1936‚Äì39 Arab revolt in Palestine, which began on The Bloody Day in Jaffa, 19 April 1936.Mustafa Kabha. \\"The Palestinian Press and the General Strike, April‚ÄìOctober 1936: \\"Filastin\\" as a Case Study.\\" Middle Eastern Studies 39, no. 3 (2003): 169‚Äì89. https://www.jstor.org/stable/4284312. Within days, memorial books were being sold with Hazan's photo on the cover, and a text describing him as \\"the first victim,\\" and promising yizkor memorial prayers along with \\"pictures and facts\\" about Jews killed by Arabs during Nisan 5696 (roughly corresponding to April 1936).  Consequences  In the aftermath of the incidents in April, Britain adopted a form of statutory military law consisting of reprisals and collective punishment, which often served to strike at the population because actual fighters, who were supported by civilians, were difficult to identify. The measures taken included systematic destruction of Arab property during search raids, particularly in the rural areas; house demolitions, often consisting of blowing up the finer houses in the area concerned; the looting of Palestinian property, though officially frowned on; the despoiling of food reserves; collective fines imposed on villages; and setting up military outposts in villages with the residents required to bear the burden by covering the expense. The British heavily censored Arab-language newspapers to conceal reports of their activities: the same did not apply to the Hebrew- language press which managed to get better coverage of the military's actions in the field.Matthew Hughes, 'Lawlessness was the Law:British Armed Forces, the Legal System and the Repression of the Arab Revolt in Palestine, 1936‚Äì1939,' in Rory Miller (ed.), Britain, Palestine and Empire: The Mandate Years, (2010) Routledge 2016 pp.141-156 pp.146-147.

Its workforce provides a variety of direct and indirect services to residents and visitors in all 95 counties of the state.  Purpose  In 2014, some 1.4 million of Tennessee's 6.6 million people received direct services in the 89 rural county health departments or the six metropolitan county health departments. Each year the department, in collaboration with many communities, creates a state health plan to help provide direction for the department.  Organization  The Commissioner of the Tennessee Department of Health is appointed by the Governor and oversees an enterprise affecting population health across the state. The commissioner, in turn, has an executive leadership team reporting directly to him that manages various areas or responsibilities within the department. The department has had 14 Commissioners since its creation in 1923. The current Commissioner is Lisa Piercey, MD, MBA, FAAP. She has served since 2019. The Tennessee Department of Health has seven regional offices located across Tennessee; each of these is responsible for assisting county health departments within their jurisdiction. The TDH commissioner is responsible for appointing both regional and county directors. There are six metro health departments in Tennessee, located in the following counties: Davidson, Hamilton, Knox, Madison, Shelby, and Sullivan. Though not under the direct supervision of the commissioner of the Tennessee Department of Health, metro health department directors and staff members work collaboratively with TDH regional and TDH central office staff on a variety of public health services and functions. By statute, the Commissioner, in consultation with county mayors, appoints each new county director including metros. By tradition, metro health departments are engaged directly in day-to-day pre- decisional tactical operations through the Health Systems Council structure. The metro health departments serve approximately 40 percent of Tennesseans and are another source of population health innovations that are often identified as best practices and adopted by their rural counterparts statewide. In both rural and metro areas, a county board of health, whose members are appointed under their local form of governance and serve varying term lengths without financial compensation, provide oversight of their county's public health department. County boards of health typically include at least one medical doctor. Each county also has a separate and distinct county health council. These positions are also appointed and uncompensated. Metro and rural county health departments routinely engage with the Tennessee Emergency Management Agency in preparedness exercises for both natural and man-made disasters that may affect population health. The Tennessee Department of Health provides staff members for the 24 Health Professional Boards, three committees, two councils and four registries responsible for the licensure and regulation of more than three dozen health and medical professions in Tennessee. Approximately 260,000 individuals are licensed and regulated by the boards. Board members are appointed by the Governor. Tennessee has had a licensing board for health professionals since 1947. Additionally, the Tennessee Office of Health Care Facilities licenses 14 different types of facilities. Currently, more 2,400 facilities are inspected. The Tennessee Department of Health maintains a free online information portal for anyone to review licensure status of health and medical professionals: https://apps.health.tn.gov/Licensure/default.aspx There is also a free online information portal to review status of licensed health-related facilities in Tennessee: https://apps.health.tn.gov/FacilityInspections/  County Health Departments  Tennessee's network of county health departments assures all residents have access to a variety of local health services intended to maintain or improve health. Services include wellchild exams, fluoride varnish applications, immunizations, family planning, control of sexually transmitted diseases, nutrition counseling, the Women, Infants and Children (WIC) program, children's special services, prenatal care, the Help Us Grow Successfully (HUGS) program, Vital Records, Environmental Health Inspection programs and others. In some county health departments, medical staff members are available for diagnosing and treating acute and chronic illnesses; some also provide dental care. County health departments can also assist with those wanting certificates of births and deaths that occur in Tennessee. Records Vital Records pertaining to deaths and marriages are available from the TDH central office in Nashville. For information about genealogy, researchers may also find information at the Tennessee State Library and Archives.  Environmental Health  The Tennessee Department of Health and local county health departments regulate and inspect many locations and establishments. In the case of food, the department partners with the Tennessee Department of Agriculture in licensing and regulating providers. The Tennessee Department of Agriculture (TDA) is responsible for those food service providers that are physically a part of another retail establishment, such as a gas station or convenience store. Establishments, operations and services licensed and regulated by the Tennessee Department of Health include food service providers that are ‚Äòfree-standing‚Äô and not associated with other retail operations; hotels, motels and camps; public swimming pools, spas, hot tubs and camps; body art facilities; correctional facilities; and more. The department maintains efforts to prevent the spread of vector-borne and zoonotic diseases. Tennessee is home to a number of insects or arthropods that are known carriers of disease. Illnesses such as West Nile Virus, La Cross Encephalitis and Rocky Mountain Spotted Fever, though rare, do occur in the state. Rabies, once a scourge in the state, is exceptionally rare thanks to effective vaccination programs for animals and heightened awareness in humans. The Tennessee Department of Environment of Conservation, once a part of TDH, has been a separate department since 1992, providing a range of environment protection services.  Laboratory Services  TDH Laboratory Services provide analytical services of medical and environmental testing at its facilities in Nashville and Knoxville.  Health Matters  As is the case in many states, Tennessee residents are not as healthy as they could be, affecting both the quality and length of life. To address this, the Tennessee Department of Health has put intentional focus on the Big Four: * Increasing physical activity * Decreasing the rate of smoking * Advocating appropriate calorie consumption * Reducing problems associated with inappropriate use of drugs The Tennessee Department of Health created and supports services for any Tennessee resident wanting to end an addiction to tobacco called the Tennessee Tobacco Quitline. 1-800-QUIT NOW. There is also a service to get assistance with the disease of drug addiction in Tennessee, known as the TN Redline at 1-800-889-9789.

Development The Rap Year Book followed Serrano's 2013 project with Houston rapper Bun B, Bun B's Rap Coloring and Activity Book. The Rap Year Book took 15 months to develop, and was still without an illustrator three months before the book's due date. Serrano encountered eventual collaborator Torres via a flyer Torres had designed announcing a performance by Dallas rap group The Outfit, Texas; Serrano told Texas Monthly that on seeing Torres's work, he thought immediately, \\"This is the exact style that I‚Äôm trying to find.\\" Serrano contacted the group's management asking for information about who had made their flyer and eventually tracked Torres down on social media; Torres agreed to work on the book. Publication The Rap Year Book was published on October 13, 2015, by Abrams Image. It is 240 pages with 150 full-color illustrations. Format The book is structured around essays by Serrano selecting the most important rap song for every year from 1979 to 2014. His text is accompanied by illustrations by Torres, \\"bright, colorful, and offbeat cartoons...featuring depictions of Kanye and Jay-Z on a movie poster, Dr. Dre in scrubs, Drake using a pottery wheel, and more.\\" Ice-T wrote the book's preface, and critics, including Wesley Morris and Jessica Hopper, contributed short rebuttals arguing for alternative choices as the most important song of a given year. Reception =Sales= Propelled by Serrano's engagement with his enthusiastic Twitter following, The Rap Year Book repeatedly ranked on 2015 The New York Times best-seller lists. The book's first pressing of 20,000 copies sold out in pre-orders before The Rap Year Book even hit shelves; a mock \\"feud\\" on Twitter between Serrano and Books-a-Million sold out the retailer's stock of the book in one day, and crashed the company's website in the process. =Reviews= PopMatters reviewed the book as \\"both educationally useful and shamelessly fun...tailor-made to counter every criticism levied against routine, overly generalized music retrospectives.\\" In the Los Angeles Review of Books, Oliver Wang said that while Serrano's essays take a position on what constitutes the most important song of each year, \\"he doesn‚Äôt browbeat his reader into agreement; he writes confidently but not condescendingly. More importantly, the main pleasure in reading The Rap Year Book isn‚Äôt in agreeing with Serrano‚Äôs choices but rather in following the elliptical paths he takes to explain them.\\" Adaptation In July 2017, Serrano announced that AMC would produce The Rap Year Book as a 6-part television documentary series with The Roots as executive producers.

Major emphases are on agriculture, forestry, health education, disaster preparedness, advocacy, and literacy.  History  Dr.Qazi Faruque Ahmed established Proshika in 1976 . While working in famine stricken north Bengal of Bangladesh observed that while there was no shortage of food in the market the poor people were unable to buy the food and starving to death in consequence. He also observed that people are not protesting against this gross injustice. From this experience and observation he realised that the cause of poverty and famine is the poor do not have purchasing power and power to protest against the violations of their rights. That is poor do not have economic power nor do they have social and political power. This realisation led him to believe genuine poverty alleviation will occur if poor are involved in a process of economic and social empowerment. Programs of Increasing income and employment will enhance their economic empowerment. Programs of training and education will increase their awareness and ability to organise, hence ensuring social empowerment, and enable the poor and marginalised to take initiative to attain their rights.

These words are referred to by Christ, and used by him to describe the times in which he lived, ; and the prophet may be thought to have an eye to the same, while he is settling forth the badness of his own times; and the Jews seem to think he had a regard to them, since they say,Misn.

The times in which Micah the prophet here speaks of seem to be the times of Ahaz, who was a wicked prince; and the former part of Hezekiah's reign, before a reformation was started, or at least brought about, in whose reigns he prophesied; though some have thought he here predicts the sad times in the reign of Manasseh, which is not so probable.John Gill.

The question seems to recall the prophet's own name (micha-yah), which means, \\"Who is like Jehovah?\\" and the clause in Moses' song (), \\"Who is like unto thee, O Lord, among the gods?\\" Such comparisons are made from the standpoint of the nations who believe in the real existence of their false gods. * \\"That pardoneth\\", and beareth and taketh away also, \\"and passeth by the transgression of the remnant of His heritage\\", that is, His heritage, which is a remnant still when \\"the rest are blinded\\" ; and this, not of its merits but of His mercy; since it is not His nature to \\"retain His anger forever\\"; not for anything in them, but \\"because He delighteth in mercy\\", as He saith, \\"I am merciful, saith the Lord, and I will not keep anger forever\\" . \\"I am He that blotteth out thy transgressions for Mine own sake, and will not remember thy sins\\" .

Beginning with an enrollment of nine students, the NILA MFA program grew to a peak enrollment of 62 students in 2014. Also known as the Whidbey Writers Workshop MFA, the low residency program was taught by the following regular faculty: Kathleen Alcal√°, Bonny Becker, Carmen T. Bernier-Grand, Stephanie Bodeen, Andrea Brown, Lawrence W. Cheek, Gary Copeland Lilley, Jerry Gabriel, Kate Gale, Melissa Hart, Bruce Holland Rogers, Christopher Howell, Andrea Hurst, Kirby Larson, Lisa Dale Norton, Derek Sheffield, Ana Maria Spagna, Wayne Ude, Sarah Van Arsdale, David Wagoner, Carolyne L. Wright, and Susan Zwinger. Each semester began with intensive in-person residencies offering morning classes in craft, workshop, and directed reading, and afternoon sessions on the profession of writing. The three hours of afternoon classes were taught by guest faculty, bestselling authors and renowned agents, editors, and writing industry professionals. At the end of residency, students returned home to complete the rest of the semester via online class forums. The NILA MFA program grew quickly, drawing students to Whidbey Island twice annually from across the U.S. and Canada. Due to multiple contributing factors, however, including a proliferation of low residency MFA programs, lower enrollment, and a lack of core funding, the Northwest Institute of Literary Arts Board of Directors made the decision to cease operations of the MFA program at the close of the 2015-2016 school year. On August 13, 2016, twenty graduates received MFA degrees in Creative Writing, adding to the 65 graduates of the previous nine years. In addition, an Honorary Doctorate was awarded to best-selling author Elizabeth George for her distinguished support of the Northwest Institute of Literary Arts, including annual scholarships to aspiring writers through the Elizabeth George Foundation. NILA students who had not yet completed their creative writing coursework and graduate theses were successfully transferred to other low residency MFA programs. History In 2002, the Whidbey Island Writers Association, founded in 1998, voted to pursue founding a low residency MFA program on Whidbey Island. Celeste Mergens was a driving force in fundraising and getting the program off the ground. Wayne Ude, an author and former university professor who had assisted previously in the creation of MFA programs at Old Dominion University and Colorado State University, became the founding Program Director. In 2004, the Whidbey Island Writers Association received authorization by the State of Washington to found the Whidbey Writers Workshop low residency MFA program, the first in the U.S. to be offered by an organization of writers, and not by a college or university. Originally established as the Whidbey Writers Workshop, this graduate level, state and federally recognized Master of Fine Arts program held its first semester in August 2005 with an enrollment of nine students. The program offered instruction in four different creative writing genres: children/young adult, fiction, nonfiction, and poetry. As a low residency program, each semester opened with intensive writing residencies on Whidbey Island. In 2007, a first graduating class of eight MFA students received Creative Writing degrees. The program was featured that year as one of nine distinctive programs in Poets & Writers magazine. In 2009, the Whidbey Writers Workshop came under the auspices of, and was renamed to, the Northwest Institute of Literary Arts. The program received national accreditation in 2010 through the Distance Education and Training Council, now known as the Distance Education Accrediting Commission (DEAC). By 2011, the Northwest Institute of Literary Arts encompassed the MFA program, the Whidbey Island Writers Association, the Whidbey Island Writers Conference, and Soundings Review literary magazine. By 2014, the Northwest Institute of Literary Arts MFA program was going strong, with a full-time enrollment of over 50 students and a graduation rate of 88%. Nine-day residencies were being held in August and January at the Captain Whidbey Inn near Coupeville, Washington. However, ambitious plans for expansion and an increase in staff coupled with lower enrollment led to a negative balance at the close of that fiscal year. In 2015, the MFA program received renewed accreditation from the DEAC for one year (rather than five), pending evidence of financial stabilization in 2016. On February 29, 2016, the board of directors voted to close the MFA program and negotiated an articulation agreement with Antioch University Los Angeles. As of the final graduation of twenty students in August 2016, the NILA MFA bestowed a total of 85 Creative Writing degrees. NILA alumni have published over 30 books and 200 essays, articles, and poems in periodical publications.

It is located east of the Central Volcanic Zone away from the volcanic arc within the Altiplano-Puna volcanic complex (APVC), close to Zapaleri volcano. The field is formed by seven scoria cones and lava flows, of andesite-basaltic andesite composition. The field was formed by volcanism contemporaneous with the ignimbrite volcanism of the APVC, with Cerro Guacha and La Pacana calderas being located nearby.  Geography and Geology  = Regional setting = Cerro Bitiche is located in the area of the northern Puna-southern Altiplano, within Argentina and close to the tripoint with Bolivia and Chile. The Altiplano-Puna highland with horizontal dimensions of and average altitudes of is the second highest plain in the world. Zapaleri and the Rio Zapaleri are located northwest of Bitiche. The field is located behind the main volcanic arc of the Central Volcanic Zone. The region is the site of the Miocene Altiplano-Puna volcanic complex, one of the world's largest ignimbrite province. The rocks erupted in the complex are derived from the crust and the mantle in equal amounts. A number of mafic volcanic fields and isolated cones are found in the northern Puna. = Local setting = Cerro Bitiche is part of a number of mafic volcanic centres associated with the Altiplano-Puna volcanic complex. The two major calderas La Pacana and Cerro Guacha are close to Cerro Bitiche, the eastern margin of Guacha's oldest caldera is located just east of Bitiche. Ordovician marine sequences form the tectonic basement of the area, but most of it is covered by ignimbrites and lavas between 8.5-4 million years old. The volcanic field covers a surface area of , including lava flows and scoria cones. The highest scoria cone has a height of . These scoria cones are formed by lapilli and pyroclastics with no welding and also contain lava bombs. They are in part constructed on top of pyroclastic and ash beds with some traces of sedimentation. Some cones have assumed a horseshoe shape resulting from the collapse of their flanks during lava emission. The arid climate in the area has preserved the edifices. The lava field has the shape of a plateau that has been modified by later tectonic movements. The lava flows carry pyroclastic mounds probably rafted from the scoria cones and have frequently developed foliations. The volcanic field has erupted andesite and basaltic andesite, which when in lava form is grey to black in colour. Phenocryst composition in the rocks varies, encompassing olivine, orthopyroxene, plagioclase and small amounts of biotite. Chemically, the rocks are -rich -rich calc-alkaline. Ilmenite is an important accessory mineral. Some rocks have undergone palagonite-forming alteration. Xenoliths are also found within the lava, both quartz containing xenocrysts and sedimentary rocks. The magmas that formed the field have compositions indicating they derive from primitive mantle magmas, which formed in the shallow mantle. Based on geothermometer analysis, temperatures of crystallization of the magmas have been obtained ranging and higher. Magma formation was probably influenced by the formation of ephemeral magma chambers and the interaction with crustal components and other magmas.  Eruptive history  The Bitiche lavas cover the 8.4 million years old Vilama ignimbrites and are in part covered by the 3.49 ¬± 0.01 million years old Tara ignimbrite, indicating that the field formed in the late Miocene- early Pliocene at the time where volcanism in the Altiplano-Puna volcanic complex reached its maximum. The volcanic activity that formed the scoria cones was probably mainly strombolian with some lava fountaining. The start of volcanic activity may have been preceded by hydrovolcanic processes that have left characteristic deposits.

Nineveh was situated on the east bank of the Tigris River, whose tributary, the Khosr, flowed through the city. The fall of Nineveh predicted by Nahum took place in only a few years after this prophecy - in 612 B.C, followed by the final destruction of the Assyrian Empire in 609 B.C.

Two were built in 1930. Design The NiD 740 was specifically designed as a postal aircraft for the night mail, though the mail compartment could alternatively accommodate three passengers. It was a three- engined, wooden aircraft with a cantilever high wing of high aspect ratio and elliptical plan out to pointed tips. Mounted without dihedral, the plywood skinned wing was structurally and aerodynamically similar to, though larger than, that of the single-engined Nieuport-Delage NiD 640. Long, narrow, uncompensated ailerons filled much of the trailing edges. Its one-piece fuselage was built on four spruce longerons interconnected by frames and was plywood covered, giving it flat sides and underside but with curved upper decking. The NiD 740's central Salmson 7Ac seven-cylinder radial engine was uncowled in the nose, though diagrams show it enclosed by a narrow-chord cowling. The outboard pair, also uncowled, were mounted well below the wing on parallel and diagonal struts. The enclosed cockpit was at the wing leading edge; in addition to the normal forward and side windows there was a window in the port side fuselage, matched by one in the starboard side door, to improve his downwards and rearward view. The navigator, provided with radio equipment, was in a separate compartment with his own port side, windowed door. Behind him was the volume mail compartment with windowed doors on both sides and further lit by two forward windows. In this area the fuselage was double- walled. The tail was conventional, with well rounded, roughly elliptical surfaces which were ply covered like the rest of the NiD 740. The tailplane was mounted on top of the fuselage; its angle of incidence could be adjusted in flight for trimming. Neither elevators nor rudder were balanced. The latter was large and extended down to the keel, operating in a small elevator cut- out. The NiD 740 had conventional, fixed, independent landing gear, with each wheel mounted at the vertex of a V-strut hinged on the central fuselage underside. These gave the undercarriage a track of and placed the wheels directly below the outer engines. Vertical sprung legs, fitted with Messier shock absorbers, joined wheels and the engine-bearing frames. The wheels had brakes (also by Messier) which could be used differentially for ground steering. There was a short tailskid below the rudderpost. A pair of searchlights were fitted close together below the nose to help with night landings. Development The exact date of the NiD 740's first flight is not known though several early tests had been flown by Fernand Lasne before the end of January 1930. It handled well and it could maintain a fixed altitude of with one engine stopped. Two were built but their later history is not mentioned in the contemporary French aviation literature.

Samuel's will gave Mary a tract of land near the :Atlas Portland Cement Company in Ilasco, Missouri, just outside Hannibal. Sam's children argued that Mary had undue influence over him and the will, pointing to his alcoholism and deteriorating health. This case went to the Supreme Court of Missouri numerous times before it was resolved. This case was well documented in the book, Insane Sisters: Or, the Price Paid for Challenging a Company Town, by Gregg Andrews. Background Samuel Heinbach wrote his will on September 27, 1909 before he died January 3, 1910 in Ralls County, MO. His will left a 26 acre tract of land in Mary's name in an area that Atlas was trying to take control of. He left his property to Mary instead of his children because he felt she was there for him when his children had abandoned him. A local attorney, J.O. Allison contacted Sam's children and asked for a portion of the lot if he could overturn the will. They accepted and the will was rejected by Judge T.E. Allison, J.O's brother on the grounds that Samuel's alcoholism made him not of sound mind, and open to Mary's undue influence. Literature Gregg Andrews wrote 2 books documenting this case, and others like it in Ilasco, Ralls County, MO. Ilasco ceased to exist in 1960 due to economic trouble caused by the Atlas Portland Cement Company. Because both his father and grandfather were employed by Atlas, it influenced him to write about the cement town run by the company and the social issues that occurred. =Books= * City of Dust: A Cement Company Town in the Land of Tom Sawyer.

It is the capital of the Somme department in Nord-Pas-de- Calais-Picardie. The city had a population of 136,105 according to the 2006 census. The first known settlement was Samarobriva (\\"Somme bridge\\"), the central settlement of the Ambiani, one of the principal tribes of Gaul. The town was given the name Ambianum by the Romans, meaning settlement of the Ambiani people. The town has been much fought over, being attacked by barbarian tribes, and later by the Normans. In 1113 the city was recognized by King Louis VI of France, and joined to the Crown of France in 1185. In 1597, Spanish soldiers held the city during the six-month Siege of Amiens, before Henry IV regained control. During the 18th and 19th century, the textile tradition of Amiens became famous for its velours. In 1789 the provinces of France were dismantled and the territory was organised into departments. Much of Picardy became the newly created department of Somme, with Amiens as the departmental capital. During the industrial revolution the city walls were demolished, opening up space for large boulevards around the town centre. The Henriville neighbourhood in the south of the city was developed around this time. In 1848, the first railway arrived in Amiens, linking the city to Boulogne-sur-Mer. During the 1870 Battle of Amiens, when the Somme was invaded by Prussian forces, Amiens was occupied. The town was fought over during both the First and Second World Wars, suffering much damage, and being occupied several times by both sides. The 1918 Battle of Amiens, was the opening phase of the Hundred Days Offensive, which led directly to the Armistice with Germany that ended the war. It was heavily bombed by the Royal Air Force during the Second World War. The city was rebuilt according to Pierre Dufau's plans, with a focus on widening the streets to ease traffic congestion. These newer structures were primarily built of brick, concrete and white stone with slate roofs. The architect Auguste Perret designed the Gare d'Amiens train station and nearby Tour Perret. Prehistory =Paleolithic= The Saint- Acheul axehead ( collection, Mus√©um de Toulouse). The discovery of important prehistoric sites in Amiens contributed to the birth and growth of prehistory, a young science which established itself in the second half of the 19th century. The region of Amiens has enormous potential for Quaternary geology and, more generally, for knowledge of the history of the first settlements in Europe. The wealth and importance of the deposits in the suburbs of Saint- Acheul and Montieres, as well as the quality of the work of and Jacques Boucher de Perthes, considered the founder of prehistory, brought an international scientific reputation to the territory. As the and the Dordogne, the Somme Valley made reference to prehistory and to the study of the Paleolithic. It was at Amiens that, for the first time, was defined one of the most ancient civilisations of humanity: The Acheulean. In 1853, haches taill√©es [carved axes], according to the term of the time, were collected in the old alluvium of the Somme at the level of the suburb of Saint-Acheul, east of the city. This discovery fascinated the greatest international experts of the time, Joseph Prestwich, Hugh Falconer, Charles Lyell and John Evans, who flocked to the site. In August 1859, Albert Gaudry discovered nine \\"carved axes\\" attesting, according to him, of the great antiquity of mankind. These discoveries marked the beginning of the great period of Saint-Acheul which lasted more than three-quarters of a century. Between 1860 and 1880, 20,000 axeheads were thus collected. Saint-Acheul, whose fame became international, attracted many French and foreign specialists and collectors. This success gave rise to a lucrative trade of fake flints. In 1872, Gabriel de Mortillet, who named the great periods of prehistory in France, decided to name the stone tools gathered in large numbers at Saint-Acheul as Acheulean. The Amiens site then became the reference for the main features of the lower Palaeolithic. Today, the Saint-Acheul archaeological garden is open to the public and presents a landscape of the former quarries which were classified as Historic Monuments in 1947. In 2007, archaeological excavations, at the Rue du Man√®ge, uncovered the earliest traces of human occupation in Amiens, in an alluvial aquifer perched at above the bottom of the current valley. The age of the remains collected during this intervention is dated to approximately 500,000 to 550,000 years ago. =Mesolithic= In 2006, when housing was under construction, excavations revealed MesolithicMesolithic going from 9600 to 5500 BCE. sites on positions of ancient banks of the Somme and the Selle. =Neolithic= The Neolithic period the territory of Amiens has not been the subject of intensive research as the Paleolithic. However, a large deposit in the Montieres-Etouvie sector has delivered an extensive Neolithic industry with yellow flint of excellent craftsmanship. Renancourt brickworks also updated important remains attributable to the Neolithic or Chalcolithic, evidenced by the boat-shaped double axe exhibited at the Mus√©e de Picardie. Antiquity The first known settlement is Samarobriva (\\"Somme bridge\\"), mentioned for the first time in the Commentarii de Bello Gallico of Julius Caesar. Some forty years later, it was the central settlement of the Ambiani, one of the principal tribes of Gaul, who were issuing coinage, probably from Amiens, in the 1st century BC. It was a large town which controlled the passage of the Via Agrippa connecting Lyon to Boulogne-sur-Mer. The Ambiani derived their name from the Gaulish word ambe, meaning river ‚Äì a reference to the Somme that flows through Amiens. The town was given the name Ambianum by the Romans, meaning settlement of the Ambiani people. Samarobriu (Samarobriva Ambianorum) appears on the Tabula Peutingeriana. By tradition, it was at the gates of Amiens that Saint Martin of Tours, at the time still a Roman soldier, shared his cloak with a naked beggar. Excavations near the city hall and the Palace of Justice revealed the foundations of the forum, the thermal baths and amphitheatre built for a population greater than that of either Londinium or Lutetia. During the late Roman Empire, the walled city was one of the main rear Roman bases facing the Barbarian Invasions. After Nero's death, it was a centre of equipment of Britannia and saw a flow of legionaries and merchants. The enclosure of the late Empire protected an area of .G√©rard Coulon, Les Gallo-Romains : vivre, travailler, croire, se distraire - de 54 av. J.-C. √† 486 ap. J.-C.. Paris, Ed. Errance, 2006, Collection Hesp√©rides, , p.21. The prosperity of the city made it a target for barbarian tribes such as the Alans, the Burgundians or the Vandals, who attacked the city several times. During the development of the ZAC de Renancourt in 2012, archaeologists (INRAP and Drac Picardie) excavated a Gallo-Roman rural area of , from after the conquest (1st and 2nd centuries). The occupation of the 1st century discovered (La T√®ne culture). In 2006, during the construction of buildings in the Cathedral , excavations were used to study a portion of the wall erected at the end of the 3rd century in Samarobriva. In 367, Valentinian I moved to Amiens to organise a maritime defence system, known as the . Valentinian I was proclaimed Augustus along with his son Gratian the same year. Also in 367, it was from Amiens that Count Theodosius restored Roman order in Brittania. In 383, in contrast, Amiens, like all towns in the area, was taken by Magnus Maximus, proclaimed emperor by the legions in Britain. Middle Ages Saint Louis mediating by Georges Rouget (1820). During the 5th century, Chlodio rose to power among the Franks, and Merovech was elected in Amiens by his comrades in arms. Saint Honorius (Honor√©) (d. 600 AD) became the seventh bishop of the city. Normans sacked the city 859 and again in 882. During the second sacking, the city's cathedral was burned. During the early part of the 10th century, Count Herbert de Vermandois united the regions of Amiens, Vexin, Laon, and Reims.http://www.picardie.fr/en/applis/frise_en/frise_en.swf In 1095, the people of Amiens began to form a rough municipal organization. In 1113, the municipality was sworn with the agreement of the Bishop and subsequently recognised by the King of France. Other cities in the region (Beauvais, Cambrai, Laon, Noyon, Saint-Quentin) moved up in the field of municipal liberties. On Palm Sunday 1115, King Louis VI was present in Amiens, to support Bishop Geoffroi and the residents against the Count Enguerrand de Coucy who refused to recognise the communal institution. The city was joined to the Crown of France in 1185. In 1218, lightning destroyed the archives of the bishopric and chapter, and destroyed the cathedral which had been rebuilt after the invasion of the Normans. In 1264, Amiens was chosen as the seat of arbitrations when King Louis IX of France settled the conflict between King Henry III of England and his rebellious barons, led by Simon de Montfort. The arbitrations led to Louis deciding on the Mise of Amiens ‚Äì a one-sided settlement in favor of Henry. This decision almost immediately led to the outbreak of the Barons' War. The blue of Amiens produced from woad (Isatis tinctoria) known as the Pastel des teinturiers et de waide [Pastel of dyers and of woad] in Picard, a dye plant, made the fortune of merchant woad producers, and the city, in the 12th and 13th centuries. The wealth generated by the proceeds from the sale of this dye contributed to the financing of the reconstruction of the cathedral. Today, the heritage, cultural and economic exploitation of woad is still topical. Amiens is indeed the leader of the European cooperation project \\"beyond the blue - Woad: heritage and creation\\". In 1435 the city was among the possessions granted to Philip the Good of Burgundy by the Congress of Arras. It was re-acquired again by King Louis XI in 1477 after the death of Charles the Bold. Louis XI authorised two annual fairs in Amiens, by its letters patent, so that not only the city gains but that it does not now encourage the flight of currency from the kingdom, due to the powerful fairs of Antwerp and Bruges. Early Modern era Henry IV at the Siege of Amiens (Anonymous, Museum of Versailles) On 11 March 1597, the Spanish attacked by surprise. The soldiers of Count Pedro Henriquez de Acevedo of Fuentes, disguised as peasants came before the gates of the walls with walnuts and apples. The hungry people of Amiens then opened the gates and the Spaniards entered and took over the city. The six month siege of Amiens by Henry IV with the assistance of English troops sent by Elizabeth I subsequently took place. A large Spanish relief force was defeated in September following which the Spanish garrison surrendered. The victory led to the Edict of Nantes and the Peace of Vervins the following year. Henry took over the city, putting an end to its autonomous rule. During the 18th and 19th century, the textile tradition of Amiens became famous for its velours. The Cosserat family rose to prominence as one of the wealthiest of Amiens' textile manufacturing families. In 1789 the provinces of France were dismantled and the territory was organised into departments. Much of Picardy became the newly created department of Somme, with Amiens as the departmental capital. Amiens' 18th-century City Hall 19th century In November 1801, British and French delegates began discussing terms of peace at the Amiens Congress. On 25 March 1802, the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland and the First French Republic signed the Treaty of Amiens at the town hall, putting an end to the Second Coalition against France. During the 19th century, Amiens began to feel the effects of the industrial revolution, an became known worldwide thanks to the quality of its textile production. The city walls were demolished, opening up space for large boulevards around the town centre. The Henriville quarter in the south of the city was developed around this time, on the plots of the hospices of Amiens, far from the suburbs of Saint-Honore and Saint-Acheul. The Rue de la R√©publique was created and became a street of power and knowledge, with the erection of the municipal library and the Picardie Museum, as well as the installation of the prefecture. In 1849, as in all the communes in France, the adult male population could, for the first time, vote through the introduction of universal suffrage. The city was hit by an outbreak of cholera in 1866. The first railway through Amiens was built in 1846, with the first station, known as Gare du Nord: It allowed the city to connect to Paris.This is the current Paris‚ÄìLille railway, which hasn't passed through the station of Amiens since March 1849, the month a direct connection to Longueau was commissioned. A second line opened from 1847 to Boulogne-sur-Mer,This is the current Longueau‚ÄìBoulogne railway. with Gare Saint-Roch; then, in 1874, the was put into service. Some old ditches, adjacent to the city walls, were used for the passage of railway routes. This progress changed the geography of the city, which now turned away from the Somme, like the city hall which moved its entrance from the Place au fil, to the current Rue des Trois-Cailloux. After this time, the city began to grow beyond the river and into the surrounding hills. During the 1870 Franco-Prussian War, Somme was invaded by Prussian forces and Amiens was occupied. Early science fiction author Jules Verne took up residence in Amiens in 1871, having met his wife there at a wedding in 1856. He was later elected city councilman in 1888. In 1889, Jules Verne presided over the opening of the Amiens circus, including a courthouse, a police station and a museum dedicated to the history of Picardy.

Given the need to accommodate the newcomers, the city transformed and enriched its heritage, especially valuing its centre, while retaining traces of its past with its plan leaving the imprint of the successive walls. The city extended first south and then north, especially in the Saint-Pierre quarter where many \\"Jacobins\\" houses were built. The Nouvelles Galeries, which opened their doors in 1895 on the Rue des Trois-Cailloux, competed with small trade. In 1902, Henri installed his first ready-to-wear store in this iconic shopping street. Beginning in 1905, Victor Commont, called \\"the founding father of modern Prehistoric science,\\" performed important archaeological work in the Picardy area. In 1906, the CGT held an historic congress which developed the Charter of Amiens, signed on 13 October 1906, a constitution of French syndicalism defining its independence from political parties. The Picardy capital was a vibrant city, rich with sports and cultural activities. Evidenced by the international exhibition held in July and August 1906 in the Park of the Hotoie with its 1.3 million visitorsBeno√Æt Delespierre, Lorsqu'Amiens accueillait son \\"village s√©n√©galais\\", Le Courrier picard of 7 April 2013. or the Grand Prix of France in 1913 and its 100,000 spectators.

The Saint-Leu and Saint-Pierre quarters and the suburb of Hem dominated the textile industry, contrasting with the prosperity of the city centre and uptown by concentrating poverty and substandard housing. With the declaration of war in the summer of 1914, Amiens, which geographical determinism placed to protect the capital, suffered the brunt of the horrors of war. =First World War= A general view of Amiens in May 1918, during Operation Michael. At the start of the war, in August 1914, Amiens had been the Advance Base for the British Expeditionary Force. It was captured by the German Army on 31 August 1914, but recaptured by the French on 28 September. The proximity of Amiens to the Western Front and its importance as a rail hub, made it a vital British logistic centre, especially during the Battle of the Somme in 1916. The city was to the immediate rear of the Allied front during most of the war. With 93,000 inhabitants at the start of the war, the population increased to 110,000 during the conflict because of the presence of Allied troops. The population and industries suffered heavy privations (gas, coal, bread, etc.), leading to several strikes, twenty-five alone in 1917. Facing regular bombings, the municipality implemented measures for the protection of historical monuments, such as the cathedral, as early as 1915. Amiens was one of the key objectives of the German Spring Offensive which was launched on 27 March 1918 as Operation Michael. The German 2nd Army pushed back the British 5th Army, who fought a series of defensive actions. Eventually, on 4 April, the Germans succeeded in capturing Villers-Bretonneux which overlooked Amiens, only for it to be retaken by an Australian counterattack that night. This was also stopped by the Canadian Cavalry brigade (Lord Strathcona's Horse (Royal Canadians)) at Villers-Bretonneux and Moreuil. During the fighting, Amiens was bombarded by German artillery and aircraft; more than 2,000 buildings were destroyed. In August, the British Expeditionary Force of Field-Marshal Sir Douglas Haig led the offensive which would become the Battle of Amiens. The attack was intended to release a large part of the railway line between Paris and Amiens. On 8 August 1918, a successful Allied counter stroke, the battle took place and was the opening phase of the Hundred Days Offensive, which led directly to the Armistice with Germany which ended the war. At the end of the First World War, the civilian toll was 152 killed and 213 wounded, property damage included 731 buildings completely destroyed and nearly 3,000 damaged, in addition to looting.Albert Chatelle, Amiens pendant la guerre 1914-1918. A reconstruction plan was arranged by , replaced in 1921. In 1924, the State rejected the request for war damages made by the municipality. A less ambitious reconstruction began in 1925, as evidenced by a few Art Deco fa√ßades. File:Amiens.

During the Battle of France, Amiens was reached by the German Army's 1st Panzer Division on 20 May 1940, following two days of heavy air raids. The Germans gradually penetrated the city and two other armoured divisions supported the offensive. French and British units were installed in positions to the south of Amiens, and discharged field guns upon the city on 5 June. A last offensive of German armour in numeric superiority, committed from 6 to 8 June, overcame the Franco-British lock, the city definitely fell on 8 June and the Wehrmacht continued its breakthrough in the direction of its next target, Paris. However, the German losses were high: Nearly 200 tanks. Despite the later fighting, the cathedral and a few neighbourhoods were spared, including those Henriville and Saint-Leu. It had been defended by a battalion, the 7th Battalion, Royal Sussex Regiment, a Territorial infantry battalion of the British Army. Of 581 men with the battalion, 132 men are commemorated in CWGC burials, 165 are known to have become prisoners of war and many escaped back to Britain and formed 109th Light Anti-Aircraft Regiment, Royal Artillery. In 1942, the first reconstruction plans were underway by German officials, and by Pierre Dufau. On 4 January 1944, the Germans initiated an organised round-up, which resulted in the arrests of 21 Amiens Jews, joined by Jews from the Department. First held in Drancy internment camp, most were deported to Auschwitz-Birkenau by Convoy no. 66. There was only a single Amiens survivor, from this convoy, at the end of the war: Ren√©e Louria, who recounted her terrible fate in the Courrier Picard in May 1945. On 18 February 1944, British aircraft bombed the prison in Amiens as part of Operation Jericho. The raid was intended to aid the escape of members of the French Resistance and political prisoners being held there. In all, 258 prisoners escaped. Prior to the Normandy landings of 6 June 1944, Allied aircraft concentrated on disabling communications in occupied France, and the railway junction at Longueau to the south east of Amiens was attacked by 200 bombers of the Royal Air Force on the night of the 12 and 13 June. There was much damage in the town itself. Amiens was liberated on 31 August 1944 by the 11th Armoured Division, part of 30 Corps commanded by Lieutenant-General Brian Horrocks. =Post-war period= The city was rebuilt according to Pierre Dufau's plans, the reconstruction and development plan was adopted as early as July 1942. With a focus on widening the streets to ease traffic congestion. These newer structures were primarily built of brick, concrete and white stone with slate roofs. The Place Gambetta was furnished by the architect Alexandre Courtois, the architect Auguste Perret designed the Gare d'Amiens railway station, the Place de la Gare, and the nearby Tour Perret. Meanwhile, Dufau focussed on the market square and the cathedral square.Joseph Abram, L'Architecture moderne en France. Du chaos √† la croissance, 1940-1966, √©d. Picard, 1999, p.28-31. On 2 June 1960, the new region of Picardy was formed from the departments of Aisne, :Oise and Somme. A wind of protest which blew over France and the world at the end of the 1960s, also affected Amiens. First, a demonstration opposing the Vietnam War was organised on 21 October 1967. Then, while the hosted the National Education Minister Alain Peyrefitte in mid-March 1968, at a symposium on education, Amiens students followed suit from the events in Paris by marching in protest on 6 and 7 May. Factory and the railway workers in the city joined them a few days later on 17 May. The next day, the Longueau railwaymen blocked points, Ferodo workers occupied their factory from 20 May for five weeks. Although not experiencing clashes comparable to those in Paris, the city was quickly paralysed. The absence of household waste collection gave the streets a foul odour, and the department was short of petrol from 22 May. Against this movement of left, the extreme right was not absent: While militants had thrown an explosive device in protest at the Communist permanence of the city on 23 December 1967, members of Occident opposed students on 21 May, in front of the Picardy cinema. During the night of 27‚Äì28 May, students tried to take the House of Culture. In the aftermath of President Charles de Gaulle's radio address, his supporters in Amiens demonstrated in the streets on 31 May, while recovery was committed the following week. Faure law promulgated, the University of Amiens was created on 26 October,Antoine Caux, Jean-Christophe Fouquet et Nicolas Lejeune, ¬´ 2008, souvenirs de mai ¬ª, JDA M√©tropole no.487 of 28 May 2008. founded on a campus in the southwestern suburbs of the city. =Since the 1970s= The city suffered the loss of many jobs as manufacturing plants in the region closed during the late 1970s and 1980s. Despite the hardships, the city made an effort to renovate the degraded area of St-Leu during this time. The 1990s saw a great period of rebirth in the city. The St- Leu renovations were completed, the parc Saint-Pierre was redesigned and part the University of Picardy moved into new buildings in the city centre. The Vall√©e des Vignes commercial district was developed in the south of the city, and large parts of the city center were converted to pedestrian areas. Since 2006, there has been a comprehensive programme for the restructuring of the station quarter, the Gare la Vall√©e project, is in progress. Since June 2008, the vast architectural transformation of the station square facilitates access to the station for people with reduced mobility and pedestrian continuity between the city hall and the station. The Gare du Nord has been renovated with a controversial new glass roof. The Tour Perret was renovated as well and a new cinema complex was built, reorganising the area around the railway station.

As both teams finished with identical 89‚Äì73 records, a tiebreaker was used to determine the host team. In accordance with MLB tiebreaking rules, the Blue Jays earned the right to host the game by winning their season series against the Orioles 10‚Äì9. The Blue Jays beat the Orioles, 5‚Äì2, in extra innings. Background This was Toronto's first appearance in the Wild Card Game and their first overall appearance as a wild card (when it was first introduced in 1995), and their second consecutive postseason appearance after winning the AL East Division the previous season. It was the second appearance in a Wild Card Game both for Baltimore and its manager Buck Showalter. Showalter's Orioles defeated the Texas Rangers in the inaugural AL Wild Card Game in 2012. This was the first postseason meeting between the two teams. The game was played at 8:00 pm EDT on October 4, 2016 at Rogers Centre in Toronto, with the winner advancing to play the first-seeded Texas Rangers in the Division Series. It was televised in the United States on TBS, while Sportsnet, a property of Blue Jays owner Rogers Communications, simulcast the TBS production in Canada. The retractable dome at Rogers Centre was open for the game, the first time this was done for a postseason contest at the venue. This was the second Wild Card Game played between teams with identical regular season records, and the second time for the Baltimore Orioles. Under the 1995-2011 playoff format, the teams would have played a one-game playoff to determine the Wild Card team. Game results =Line score= Toronto and Baltimore turned to their Opening Day starters, as Marcus Stroman and Chris Tillman took the mound for their respective teams. The Blue Jays scored first with a home run by Jos√© Bautista leading off the second inning. The Orioles responded two innings later with a go-ahead two-run homer from Mark Trumbo. The Blue Jays recorded three hits in the fifth on their way to scoring the tying run. The Toronto Blue Jays won the game 5‚Äì2 in the 11th inning when Edwin Encarnaci√≥n hit a walk-off three-run homer off Ubaldo Jim√©nez. Zach Britton, the Orioles' closer and 2016 American League Reliever of the Year, controversially did not appear in the game. The Blue Jays advanced to the American League Division Series to face the Rangers for the second consecutive time in the postseason; their first meeting was in the previous year's American League Division Series. Encarnaci√≥n became only the fourth player to end a winner-take-all postseason game (that is, a game in which one team or the other was sure to be eliminated) with a walk-off home run, joining Bill Mazeroski (1960 World Series), Chris Chambliss (1976 ALCS) and Aaron Boone (2003 ALCS).= References External links *2016 Major League Baseball season schedule *Schedule for 2016 Postseason American League Wild Card Game 2016 American League Wild Card Game Baltimore Orioles postseason Toronto Blue Jays postseason 2016 in Toronto October 2016 sports events in Canada ","title":"2016 American League Wild Card Game"},{"id":"51403716","text":"The given name or nickname AJ may refer to: In arts and media * AJ Alexander (born 1980), American model and Playboy Playmate * A.

She was a specialist sprinter who excelled over the minimum distance of five furlongs. She showed promise as a two-year-old in 2013, winning two minor contests and twice finishing second in Listed races. In the following year she improved to win four of her five races including the Scarbrough Stakes and World Trophy. As a four-year-old she made only three appearances but was rated the best female sprinter in the world after wins in the Prix de Saint-Georges and the Nunthorpe Stakes. In 2016 she struggled for form in the spring but then won the Sapphire Stakes before becoming the first horse in over thirty years to win a second consecutive Nunthorpe Stakes at York. Background Mecca's Angel is a grey mare bred in Ireland by Yeomanstown Stud & Doc Bloodstock. In October 2012 the yearling filly was sent to the Tattersalls sales and was bought for 16,000 guineas by the trainer Michael Dods. The filly entered the ownership of Paul Metcalfe and was trained by Dods at Denton, County Durham. She has been ridden in most of her races by Paul Mulrennan. The Angel part of her name came from her sire Dark Angel, from whom she inherited her grey colour whilst Mecca is Paul Metcalfe's nickname. Dark Angel won four races including the Mill Reef Stakes and the Middle Park Stakes as a two-year-old in 2007 before beginning his stud career in the following year. Dark Angel's other offspring have included Lethal Force, Gabrial (Lincoln Handicap), Estidhkaar (Champagne Stakes) and Bronze Angel (Cambridgeshire Handicap). Mecca's Angel's dam Folga, a daughter of the Prix d'Arenberg winner Desert Dawn, was a durable sprinter who won six minor races from thirty-five starts between 2004 and 2007. As a broodmare, Folga has also produced Markaz (also by Dark Angel), the winner of the Criterion Stakes and the Chipchase Stakes. Racing career =2013: two-year-old season= After finishing fourth on her racecourse debut at Thirsk Racecourse in May, Mecca's Angel recorded her first success in a maiden race over five furlongs at Haydock Park on 22 June. The filly's next appearance came in a nursery (a handicap race restricted to two-year-olds) on the fibresand surface Southwell Racecourse on 9 July. Carrying top weight of 133 pounds she took the lead soon after the start and drew away from her six opponents to win by twelve lengths. In her three remaining races Mecca's Angel was moved up to Listed class. She finished second to Hot Streak (later to win the Cornwallis Stakes and the Temple Stakes) in Roses Stakes at York in August, second to Hurryupharriet in the Harry Rosebery Stakes at Ayr in September and fourth to Ventura Mist in the Two-Year-Old Trophy over six furlongs at Redcar on 5 October. The Redcar race remains the only time that Mecca's Angel has raced over a distance beyond five and a half furlongs. =2014: three-year-old season= Mecca's Angel began her second season in a minor handicap race at Thirsk on 12 April and won by four and a half lengths under 133 pounds. On 4 May she started 10/11 favourite for the Tangerine Trees Stakes at Hamilton Racecourse. She took the lead approaching the final furlong and accelerated away from her rivals to win by eight lengths. Eight days later she was sent to France for the Listed Prix Texanita over 1100 metres at Maisons-Laffitte and sustained her only defeat of the season as she finished fifth behind Rangali. After a break of almost four months, Mecca's Angel returned in the Listed Scarbrough Stakes at Doncaster Racecourse on 10 September and started the 7/1 third favourite behind Reckless Abandon and Steps (Achilles Stakes) in an eleven-runner field. After racing close behind the leaders she took the lead approaching the final furlong and won by two and a quarter lengths from Reckless Abandon. Paul Mulrennan described the winner as \\"a very smart filly\\". Ten days after her win at Doncaster Mecca's Angel was moved up to Group race class for the first time when she started 13/8 favourite for the World Trophy at Newbury. The most fancied of her rivals was the King George Stakes winner Take Cover, whilst the other seven runners included Justice Day (third in the Middle Park Stakes), Dinkum Diamond (Cammidge Trophy) and Scream Blue Murder (Phoenix Sprint Stakes). After racing in second place Mecca's Angel took the lead two furlongs out, accelerated clear in the closing stages and won by two and a half lengths from Justice Day. =2015: four-year-old season= On her first appearance as a four-year-old, Mecca's Angel was sent to France for the Prix de Saint- Georges over 1000 metres at Longchamp Racecourse on 10 May. She started the 4/1 second favourite behind Catcall, a six-year-old gelding who had won the race in 2013 and 2014. Also in the field were Hot Streak, Maarek (Prix de l'Abbaye), Mirza (Prix du Petit Couvert) and Spirit Quartz (Prix du Gros Ch√™ne). Mecca's Angel was among the leaders from the start and won \\"comfortably\\" by two lengths from Robert Le Diable. At the Curragh in July, the filly started odds-on favourite for the Sapphire Stakes but was beaten a neck by the six-year-old gelding Stepper Point. Dods was later to say that the ground in Ireland had been too firm for the filly to produce her best form. On 21 August Mecca's Angel was stepped up to Group One level for the first time for the Nunthorpe Stakes at York and started the 15/2 third favourite behind the American-trained two-year-old filly Acapulco and the King George Stakes winner Muthmir. Acapulco had easily defeated the Dods-trained Easton Angel when easily winning the Queen Mary Stakes. Stepper Point and Justice Day were again in opposition with the other fourteen runners included Sole Power, Goldream, Mattmu (Crit√©rium de Maisons-Laffitte), Pearl Secret (Temple Stakes) and Move In Time (Prix de l'Abbaye). Mecca's Angel tracked the leaders down the centre of the course before making rapid progress in the final furlong. She moved into second place behind Acapulco before overtaking the America filly fifty yards from the finish and won by two lengths. Mattmu finished third ahead of Sole Power and Goldream. Interviewed after the race Michael Dods said \\"It's marvellous for the north and everyone involved\\"..\\" =2016: five-year-old season= On her first appearance in nine months, Mecca's Angel started favourite for the Temple Stakes at Haydock on 21 May. She disputed the lead from the start and went to the front a furlong out but was carried left and bumped by the four-year-old colt Profitable before being beaten a neck into second place. In the King's Stand Stakes at Royal Ascot she started 6/4 favourite but produced one of her worst performances. After being repeatedly obstructed as she attempted to obtain a clear run she was eased down by Mulrennan and finished sixteenth of the seventeen runners behind Profitable. In July the mare was dropped to Group Three class and sent to Ireland for the Sapphire Stakes at the Curragh add started 5/4 favourite ahead of five opponents including Sole Power, G Force (Haydock Sprint Cup) and Brando (Sprint Stakes). She race close behind the leaders, took the lead two furlongs out and drew away to win by three lengths from Brando. Explaining the mare's improvement from her previous start, Dods said that Mecca's Angle had been in season at Ascot as well as being unsuited by the ground conditions. On 19 August Mecca's Angel attempted to become the first horse to win back-to-back runnings of the Nunthorpe Stakes at York since Sharpo recorded his third consecutive success in 1982 (Borderlescott had won the race in 2008 and 2009 but the first of his victories came when the race was run at Newmarket). In a nineteen-runner field she started second favourite behind Limato, a four-year- old gelding who had won the July Cup on his previous start. The other runners included Profitable, Sole Power, Goldream, Brando, Pearl Secret, Take Cover (King George Stakes) and Danzeno (Chipchase Stakes). Mecca's Angel was among the leaders from the start before taking the lead in the last quarter mile. She kept on strongly in the closing stages and won by two lengths from Limato with Take Cover another two lengths back in third. After the race Mulrennan admitted \\"I‚Äôd love to say she's complicated and I have to do this and that, but I just have to point her. At the two pole, I said ‚Äògo‚Äô, and she did.\\" Dods, discussing the mare's future said \\"At her age, it's not fair to race her next year and she‚Äôll be sold to go to stud. I‚Äôll be keen to try her over six before she retires. There's the sprint at Ascot on Champions Day and also the Abbaye.\\" On 2 October Mecca's Angel started the 1.7/1 favourite for the Prix de l'Abbaye over 1000 metres at Chantilly Racecourse. After chasing the leader she took the lead in the closing stages but was overtaken 75 metres out and finished third, beaten three-quarters of a length and a short head by Marsha and Washington, D.C. In the British Champions Sprint Stakes two weeks later she started at odds of 8/1 in a thirteen-runner field. Racing over six furlongs for the first time in more than three years she tracked the leaders on the stands-side but faded in the last quarter mile and finished twelfth behind The Tin Man, beaten thirteen lengths by the winner. Assessment In the 2015 edition of the World's Best Racehorse Rankings Mecca's Angel was assigned a rating of 120, making her the world's leading female sprinter and the 42nd best racehorse in the world of any age or sex.

King Hans jad a vinyard at the site which in turn gave it its name. It is believed that its cellar was the first home of the Royal Mint in Copenhagen. In 1541 the Royal Mint relocated to the nearby grounds of the former St. Clare's Monastery, which had been confiscated in 1536 when Denmark officially became a Lutheran nation. The street was completely destroyed in the Copenhagen Fire of 1795. The name was spelled Ving√•rdsstr√¶de until the 1930s. All the buildings at the eastern end of the street were greducally acquired by Danske Bank and several of them were replaced by modern office buildings in the 1970s.

Merigan's research first focused on viral pathogenesis, basic and clinical studies of interferon, and then developing the first systemic antiviral drugs including those effectively treatIng HIV/AIDS. He is also credited with helping to develop the use of interferons as antiviral and antitumor therapies. Merigan joined the Stanford faculty in 1963 and assumed full emeritus status in 2007. In 2004 he was also identified as one of the 250 most cited investigators in clinical medicine over the last 20 years by the Institute for Scientific Information. He had over 90 postdoctoral fellows, students and visiting scientists with whom he published 576 papers, 24 books and published symposia, and held 11 US patents. His students have become leaders in the fields of infectious diseases and microbiology. He was a board member of 28 journals and a member of 23 learned societies. He told his life story in a book entitled Pioneering Viral Therapy,a Life in Academic Medicine, published by Amazon/Kindle/CreateSpace in 2017. Education Merigan was an undergraduate at the University of California, Berkeley and graduated with honors in 1955. He attended medical school at the University of California, San Francisco,where he was elected to Alpha Omega Alpha Honorary Medical Society and received his M.D. in 1958. He did his internship and residency on the Harvard medical services at Boston City Hospital and then moved to the National Institutes of Health, where he trained in protein chemistry in Nobelist Christian Anfinsen's laboratory. Academic career Merigan joined the faculty at Stanford in 1963. His first sabbatical leave was spent at the MRC Common Cold Unit in Salisbury England in 1970 with David Tyrell and Sir Christopher Andrews under a Guggenheim fellowship. He received the Borden Award for outstanding research from the Association of American Medical Colleges in 1973. Another overseas sabbatical was spent studying interferon with Charles Chany in Paris. He became involved in administration at Stanford and headed the Division of Infectious Diseases there, founded the Stanford University Hospital Clinical Virology Laboratory in 1969, one of the first of its type in the world and in 1988 founded the Center for AIDS Research at Stanford. The antivirals he collaborated in the development of included those directed against herpesviruses (CMV, VZ and HSV), hepatitis B, papovaviruses, rhinoviruses, HIV, and rabies.They were carried out not just at Stanford but on 6 of the 7 continents of the world. His interferon studies included finding the first positive treatment results in multiple sclerosis which encouraged others to find even better effects in this disease with even less toxic drugs. His group also developed and holds patents thru Stanford University on the methods for monitoring the effects of treatment of HIV which are still used today. Due to his involvement in the study of HIV/AIDS, he also became involved in government initiatives; he was a principal investigator and initial chair of the Primary Infection Committee in the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID) AIDS Clinical Trials Group which evaluated the first active antiviral drugs against HIV and proved the better action of combination over mono therapy of HIV infection in large scale multinational studies. He served on several NIH study sections and as a member of NIAID's Board of Scientific Counselors. He held grants from that Institute from the day in 1963 he started at Stanford until he retired nearly 45 years later. In 1988 he received a ten year MERIT award from the NIAID and received the Maxwell Finland Lectureship award from IDSA. He gave a number of named endowed lectureships and also on several occasions testified before congressional committees on the subject of federal funding for AIDS and cancer research. In 1980 Merigan became the first George E. and Lucy Becker Professor of Medicine and was elected to the National Academy of Medicine. He was made a fellow of the American Association for the Advancement of Science, American Society for Microbiology, Infectious Diseases Society of America, and American Society of Virology as well as elected into Honorary membership in the International Society for Interferon and Cytokine Research in 2001 . He served as a member of the Council of the American Society for Clinical Investigation and a member of the Association of American Physicians. Tom served as a member of several scientific award groups including the Lasker Awards Committee. He also was boarded in Internal Medicine. Merigan was among the group of American virologists who helped organize and became the founding members of the American Society for Virology. Merigan was also interested in entrepreneurship throughout his career and served on the scientific advisory boards of a number of big pharma and biotechnology companies, Including that of Cetus Corporation in 1979. In 1994 he was honored when his friends and fellows established an annual lectureship in his name which supported over 23 visiting lecturers to date. In 2004, Merigan assumed active emeritus status in the Stanford faculty, celebrated by a Festschrift in his honor later published in the Journal of Infectious Diseases.(2) He remained active in research until he retired fully in 2007.

Domestic violence is an issue that affects people of any sexuality, but there are issues that affect victims of same-sex domestic violence specifically. These issues include homophobia, HIV and AIDS stigma, STD risk and other health issues, lack of legal support, and the violence they face being considered less serious than heterosexual domestic violence.Anderson, Kristin L. \\"Theorizing gender in intimate partner violence research.\\" Sex roles 52, no. 11-12 (2005): 853-865.Barnes, Patricia G. \\"'It's Just a Quarrel': Some states offer no domestic violence protection to gays.\\" ABA Journal 84, no. 2 (1998): 24-25.Helfrich, Christine A., and Emily K.

Moreover, the issue of domestic violence in same-sex relationships has not been studied as comprehensively as domestic violence in heterosexual relationships. However, there are legal changes being made to help victims of domestic violence in same-sex relationships, as well as organizations that cater specifically to victims of domestic violence in same-sex relationships.  Relationship prevalence =General= The Encyclopedia of Victimology and Crime Prevention states, \\"For several methodological reasons ‚Äì nonrandom sampling procedures and self-selection factors, among others ‚Äì it is not possible to assess the extent of same-sex domestic violence. Studies on abuse between gay male or lesbian partners usually rely on small convenience samples such as lesbian or gay male members of an association.\\" =Gay males and lesbians= Some sources state that gay and lesbian couples experience domestic violence at the same frequency as heterosexual couples, while other sources state domestic violence among gay, lesbian, and bisexual individuals might be higher than among heterosexual individuals, that gay, lesbian, and bisexual individuals are less likely to report domestic violence that has occurred in their intimate relationships than heterosexual couples are, or that lesbian couples experience domestic violence less than heterosexual couples do. By contrast, some researchers commonly assume that lesbian couples experience domestic violence at the same rate as heterosexual couples, and have been more cautious when reporting domestic violence among gay male couples. According to a 2012 report from the National Coalition of Anti- Violence Programs (NCAVP) of Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, Transgender, Queer, and HIV-Affected Intimate Partner Violence Gay men were more likely to require medical attention and suffer injuries as a result of IPV. Gay men were close to two times (1.7) more likely to require medical attention and 16 times more likely to suffer injury as compared to individuals who did not identify as gay men. \\"Who is Doing What to Whom?

In a 2010 Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) study, reporting on domestic violence in the U.S., 26% of gay men and 37.3% of bisexual men said that they experienced physical violence, stalking, or rape by their partners of which 90.7% and 78.5% (respectively) were male.Walters, Mikel L., Jieru Chen, and Matthew J. Breiding. \\"The National Intimate Partner and Sexual Violence Survey (NISVS): 2010 findings on victimization by sexual orientation.\\" Atlanta, GA: National Center for Injury Prevention and Control, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention 648, no. 73 (2013): 6. 29% of heterosexual men reported similar violence in the same study (with 99.5% of perpetrators being female). The CDC also stated that 43.8% of lesbian women reported experiencing physical violence, stalking, or rape by their partners. However, the study notes that, out of those 43.8%, only two thirds (67.4%) were female (as lesbian women tend to be in heterosexual relationships before they come out), which would narrow the actual statistic down to 29.6%. In contrast, 35% of heterosexual women and 61.1% of bisexual women reported physical violence, stalking, or rape by their partners in the same study with 98.7% and 89.5% (respectively) of perpetrators being male. Literature on intimate partner violence (IPV) among same-gender female couples; researchers found that internalized homophobia and discrimination were correlated with IPV. In addition, in research done on psychological aggression of lesbian relationships, researchers found that internalized homophobia and social constraints in talking with friends about sexual identity issues showed correlation with IPV. Literature on intimate partner violence (IPV) among same-gender male couples, SES, attachment orientation, HIV status, and public outness, and internalized homophobia showed relationship with intimate partner violence in gay men. Similarly, a study conducted on the predictors of IPA of gay men found a correlation between public outness, alcohol consumption, and internalized homophobia =Bisexual= Although bisexual people may be in relationships with people of any gender, they are often victims of domestic violence. The CDC reported that 61% of bisexual women said they experienced physical violence, stalking, or rape by their partners. For men in the same study, 37% reported having experienced similar violence. For both men and women, the percentage of bisexual people who have experienced domestic violence is higher than either gay men or lesbians. The high rate of domestic violence faced by bisexual people may be in part because of the specific challenges bisexual people face in receiving help, as bisexuality is often misunderstood, even by those who administer domestic violence help professionally. =Transgender= Transgender people may be in relationships with people of any gender, but they experience high rates of domestic violence. Comparatively, little research has been conducted on domestic violence towards transgender individuals, especially within the context of romantic relationships. In a 2009 United States study, 56% to 66% of transgender individuals reported experiencing violence within their homes, though not necessarily by a romantic partner.  Influences and factors  = Legal issues = Members of same-sex relationships who face domestic violence often have issues accessing legal recourse, as domestic violence laws are often drafted in such a way as to only include different sex partnerships. Some are worried about being involved in the legal system because they are afraid they will be mistreated or dismissed due to their sexual orientation. Although often the abuser can still be arrested or tried for assault or similar crimes, not classifying the crime as domestic may change how it is dealt with in the court system and change how the victim is treated. Also, studies have shown that law enforcement officers do not treat domestic violence in same-sex relationships as seriously as domestic violence in heterosexual relationships. Victims of domestic violence in same sex relationships do have legal rights afforded to them in some U.S. states, whether or not they are married to their partner, although the requirements and protections vary by state. Some of these rights include having a civil protection order or restraining order placed on the abuser to keep them from stalking or harassing the victim. Some cities and states in the U.S. are working to improve the legal situation for LGBT victims of domestic violence, through policy change and police training. In Washington D.C. the city has created an LGBT unit of their police department to combat homophobic violence and to deal with violence against transgender people by professionals who are also members of the LGBT community. = HIV/AIDS = Pride Parade HIV/AIDS may create additional problems for those in violent relationships, financially, emotionally, and health wise, whether it is the perpetrator or the victim who is living with HIV or AIDS. This specifically affects those in same-sex relationships because men who have sex with men, no matter how they identify, are significantly more likely to have HIV or AIDS than others. Those living with HIV are often financially dependent on their partners, making it more difficult to leave abusive relationships. If it is the victim who has HIV or AIDS the abuser may take control of their finances in order to have even more control over their life. This issue is compounded by the fact that those living with HIV or AIDS may often become too sick to work and support themselves, and that even when they are able to work they often face discrimination in the workplace or in the hiring process, even though this is technically illegal under the Americans with Disabilities Act. Abusers may use emotional tactics to exert control over their partners, whether it is them or the victim who has HIV or AIDS. Some abusive partners may threaten to reveal their partner's positive HIV status to others as a form of control, as there is a stigma surrounding HIV and AIDS that could affect a victim's life. If it is the abuser who has HIV or AIDS, the victim may fear that leaving someone who is sick makes them seem shallow, uncaring, or discriminatory, or the abuser may insinuate that if their partner leaves the relationship the abuser will become sicker as a result. Oppositionally, if it is the victim who has HIV or AIDS, the abuser may imply that the victim will be unable to find another partner due to their positive HIV status or that they will die alone. The abuser may also claim that it is the victim's fault that the abuser has HIV or AIDS, essentially emotionally blackmailing them to stay in the relationship. There are many health related ways that HIV or AIDS can affect domestic violence in same-sex relationships. Some perpetrators of domestic violence purposefully try to transmit STDs to their partner or to transmit their partner's STD to themselves, as a tactic to control their partner. Additionally, many people in same-sex relationships who experienced domestic violence experienced violence specifically because they had asked their partners to use condoms or other prophylactics, which are known to limit the spread of HIV. In conjunction with this, abusers may tamper with their partner's pre-exposure prophylaxis medications that prevent the spread of HIV, or may use the social stigma surrounding the use of pre-exposure prophylaxis to convince their partner not to use it. The abuser may also tamper with their partner's or their own HIV medication, or keep their partner from receiving health care in other ways. Furthermore, those with HIV or AIDS may be more affected by physical violence than those who are healthy, as their immune systems are weak and physical injuries will be harder to recover from. Those living with HIV or AIDS may also be more affected by emotional trauma for the same reason. = Homophobia = Homophobia plays a role in causing domestic violence in same-sex relationships as well as being a systemic issue as to why victims of same-sex domestic violence lack access to resources. One way this occurs is through the fear of being \\"outed,\\" as abusers may use this fear of being outed to control their partners or an abuser may use the fact that they are not out to limit their partner's exposure to other LGBT people who would recognize that their relationship is unhealthy. Another way homophobia plays a role in domestic violence is that people in same-sex relationships may feel that they have a duty to represent the LGBT community in a positive manner, and that if their relationship is abusive it is proof that homosexuality is inherently wrong, immoral, or otherwise flawed. Further, the abuser may frame the abuse as justified because of the victim's Sexual orientation, or imply that no one will help the victim because of their sexual orientation. On a systematic level, many resources offered to victims of domestic violence are not offered to victims of domestic violence in same-sex relationships. This refusal to help victims of same-sex domestic violence victims occurs both by private domestic violence help centers and by law enforcement, who may not treat same-sex domestic violence as seriously as domestic violence in heterosexual relationships. = Gendered expectations = Historically, domestic violence was viewed by many feminists as \\"a manifestation of patriarchal power.\\" This definition saw domestic violence as a phenomenon acted out by men onto women, therefore leaving out male victims of domestic violence and victims of domestic violence in same-sex relationships. Some abusers even capitalize on the idea that domestic violence cannot occur in same-sex relationships to convince their partner that the abuse is normal or non-abusive. One idea that persists and is harmful to lesbians, is that sexual assault is less serious or aggressive when perpetrated by women. However, being sexually assaulted can be traumatic to victims regardless of the gender of the perpetrator. Similarly, women stalking other women or men seem as less threatening than the same actions being perpetrated by men, so lesbian victims of stalking may be ignored by law enforcement and other individuals. Part of this problem that specifically impacts lesbians is that lesbians are assumed to have perfect relationships specifically because there is no man involved in the situation. This idea of a \\"lesbian utopia\\" makes it more difficult for lesbians to report domestic violence, because often people do not believe it can be true. Gay men may feel that being battered is a threat to their masculinity, and thus are hesitant to report domestic violence. Some abusers may frame the abuse as simply an \\"expression of masculinity,\\" which normalizes the physical violence. = Data collection issues = There are several problems with data collection about domestic violence in same-sex relationships, including lack of reporting, biased sampling, and lack of interest in studying same-sex domestic violence. For example, if samples are taken at a center that caters to LGBT individuals, the results may be artifactually high, as those who use these services may also be those in need of help, or artifactually low, as abusers often limit their partner's exposure to others, especially those who may recognize their relationship as abusive.  Organizations  = National Coalition of Anti-Violence Programs (AVP) = The National Coalition of Anti-Violence Programs (AVP) is an organization which \\"works to prevent, respond to, and end all forms of violence against and within LGBTQ communities.\\" This organization has member organization in 26 U.S. states, Washington D.C., and Canada, which help connect people to resources when they have been abused in a same-sex relationship, been sexually assaulted, or been a victim of a homophobic hate crime. = Community United Against Violence (CUAV) = CUAV is an organization based in San Francisco that has a broad mission of seeking to track anti-LGBT violence and offer support to those affected by it. They offer support groups and counselling for those who are victims of same-sex domestic violence. = New York State Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, Transgender & Queer Intimate Partner Violence Network (\\"The Network\\") = \\"The Network\\" seeks to advocate for victims of same-sex domestic violence within the state of New York, and hope that through supporting victims of same-sex domestic violence in the social and political realm that they will then have greater access to resources that victims of domestic violence may need. = Montrose Center = The Montrose Center is an organization in Houston, Texas that began as a counselling center for LGBT individuals. The Montrose Center offers many services to LGBT individuals, including servicing victims of domestic violence by finding them housing and providing counselling.Tasha Amezcua et al. (2011). Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, Transgender, Queer and HIV-affected Intimate Partner Violence 2011. New York City, New York. National Coalition of Anti-Violence Programs. Although there are other domestic violence shelters in the Houston area, the Montrose Center feels like they can cater better to men, transgender individuals, and lesbian victims of domestic violence.

She was married to archaeologist Sir Charles Leonard Woolley.  Personal life  = Early life = Katharine Menke was born in Birmingham, England in June 1888 to German parents. Her father was Carl Menke, a Consul for Germany. She studied Modern History at Somerville College in Oxford, but did not complete her education there due to health issues.Ur Online, a collaboration between the British Museum and the Penn Museum. = First Husband: Bertram Keeling = On 3 March 1919 she married Lieutenant Colonel Bertram Keeling, the Director-General of the Survey of Egypt and the President of the Cotton Research Board but he committed suicide by gunshot at the foot of the Great Pyramid of Giza on 20 September 1919. The reason for his sudden suicide is unknown. Some have suggested that it was during a temporary fit of insanity due to the discovery that Katharine was suffering from Androgen insensitivity syndrome and would be unable to have children. Reports mention that after Katharine fell ill one day, the doctor met with Colonel Keeling for 20 minutes, and after this point he committed suicide in the Giza desert. With androgen insensitivity syndrome, patients do not have uteruses or menstruate, and if untreated may find sexual intercourse quite painful. = Second Husband: Leonard Woolley = Members of the third season‚Äôs expedition, 1924-25. Left to right: probably J. Linnell, Katherine Keeling (later Woolley), Leonard Wooley, and Father Leon Legrain, the expedition epigrapher and curator and curator of the Babylonian section at the University of Pennsylvania Museum. Excavating grave material, 1928-29. In center foreground, Katherine and Leonard Wolley. Expedition house and staff, 1928-29. Max Mallowan (third from left), Hamoudi, Leonard Wolley, Katherine Wolley, Father Eric R. Burrows. She met her second husband, Leonard Woolley working as a field assistant at the archaeological excavations at Ur in 1924. When she first arrived at the site, as a young single woman, the presence of the widowed Mrs.Keeling stirred up controversy among Penn's trustees. Officials at the University of Pennsylvania, particularly George Gordon, the University Museum Director, were concerned that it was inappropriate for a single woman to be living at the site among unmarried men. He noted, ‚ÄúPerhaps the presence of a lone woman with four men in camp makes a more interesting figure for some of them than the outline of ziggurats.\\" To this Woolley responded, \\"...I do think that the presence of a lady [Katharine] has a good moral effect on the younger fellows in the camp & keeps them up to standard.‚Äù Nonetheless, under pressure from these financial backers, and in desperate need of Katharine on the excavation, Woolley and Keeling married on 11 April 1927. Leonard initially had a favorable opinion of his wife, writing to George Gordon. He notes, ‚ÄúMrs. Keeling was at first very much hurt to think that her name could be so talked about: perhaps that is still the price which women may have to pay for cooperation in scientific work. Of course it‚Äôs all wrong.\\" Interestingly, the Woolley marriage was never consummated, as an archived 1928 letter from Leonard Woolley to a legal adviser suggested. This is apparently due to Katharine only accepting marriage on the condition that they never slept together. While this must have been acceptable for some time, in 1929, Leonard sent his attorney a letter requesting divorce papers for Katharine, since she refused to consummate the union. The divorce never happened, which has been suggested as being due to Katharine's diagnosis of multiple sclerosis. = Death = She died of multiple sclerosis on 8 November 1945 in The Dorchester, where she and her husband had been living for several years. She had all her personal documents burned upon her death, thereby erasing any first-hand accounts of her experiences. Her obituary on 12 November 1945 in the London Times reads, > \\"Katharine Woolley was an archaeologist, like her husband, and shared with > him the work of excavation at Ur of the Chaldees, at Al Mina, on the North > Syrian coast, and at Atchana (Alalakh), in the Hatay, until the outbreak of > war. She was jointly responsible with him for the report published in 1939 > on the Archaeological Survey of India. From 1943 onwards, when he was > appointed archaeological adviser to the War Office, she was his assistant. > In spite of illness, constant pain, and growing weakness, she carried on her > work there until two days before her death, which came on November 8. Men > and women of many Eastern European countries, refugees after the last war, > have reason to remember her sympathy and her vitality. To none will she > always be so alive as to the Arab diggers with whom she worked for 15 > years.\\" Career = Red Cross = She served as British military nurse in the Red Cross during World War I. This position required her to hide her German heritage. Shortly after joining the Red Cross in 1915, she was sent to Egypt to work in a hospital in Alexandria. Afterward, she went to Poland where she worked in a former concentration camp which housed over 7,000 Bolshevik soldiers. She served in Poland until 1919, when she returned to London. In 1919, Katharine moved back to Cairo after marrying Colonel Keeling. After her husband‚Äôs sudden death, she remained in Cairo and resumed her work as a nurse. = Excavation at Ur = In 1924, her work as a nurse brought her to Baghdad, where she stayed with the Director of the Iraq State Railways, Lieutenant Colonel J.R. Tainsch and his wife. Tainsch brought her to visit the dig at Ur, where the Museum of the University of Pennsylvania in partnership with the British Museum, was conducting excavations led by famed British archeologist, Charles Leonard Woolley. Katharine volunteered as an illustrator for the objects catalogue. The following season, in 1925, Woolley offered Katharine an official position as an illustrator for the excavation. She remained a volunteer until 1926, when she began receiving a salary for her work. She continued working there until 1934, by which time she was the primary assistant on site. Her drawings of the site were an important contribution and her work was featured in the Illustrated London News, a magazine which publicized important archeological discoveries of the time. Her drawings were used to publicize the discoveries to donors as well as the public. In addition, she assisted with the reconstruction of various objects exhumed from the site. Most notably, she helped with the restoration of Queen Puabi‚Äôs headdress. Queen Puabi‚Äôs headdress was one of the most opulent findings at Ur and has proved crucial to understanding royal life in ancient Mesopotamia. It now resides in the Penn Museum. The famous theory put forth by Leonard Woolley that the massacred attendants at the \\"Royal Cemetery of Ur\\" committed mass suicide by poisoning is said to have been a suggestion of Katharine, though death by poisoning has been since debunked.  Reputation Among Contemporaries  Woolley was described as \\"demanding\\", \\"manipulative\\" and \\"dangerous\\" by those who knew her. Many of the workmen on Ur's excavation were supposedly terrified of her, though her obituary would claim otherwise. The unfavorable opinions of her were perhaps due to her role as an authoritative woman, serving as Ur's excavation leader in its final year in 1931. Known as a \\"taskmaster\\" by those she worked with, her drive and skills of organization made her extremely competent in a male-dominated discipline. Supposedly, Leonard Woolley's biographer referred to Katharine as \\"demanding,\\" \\"ruthless\\" and calculating.\\" = Gertrude Bell = Gertrude Bell was a renowned and highly influential archaeologist in the Middle East. Gertrude is said to have called Katharine \\"dangerous\\" and capable of ending a dispute among the workmen by merely showing up. The specifics nature of the relationship between Bell and Woolley is unclear. = Agatha Christie = Woolley was the inspiration for the murder victim Louise Leidner in the novel Murder in Mesopotamia by Agatha Christie. The novel has been described as \\" ‚Äúa study of the persona of Katharine Woolley.\\" Max Mallowan claimed that \\"Katharine did not recognize certain traits which might have been taken as applicable to herself, and took no umbrage\\", though in a 2012 lecture at the British Museum Henrietta McCall said that Katharine was aware Leidner was based on her and apparently enjoyed the notoriety, despite the character's portrayal as difficult. Christie's second marriage in 1930 was to Max Mallowan, Sir Leonard Woolley's assistant at Ur. In her autobiography, Christie refers to Woolley: > \\"Katharine Woolley, who was to become one of my great friends in the years > to come, was an extraordinary character. People have been divided always > between disliking her with a fierce and vengeful hatred, and being entranced > by her possibly because she switched from one mood to another so easily that > you never knew where you were with her. People would declare that she was > impossible, that they would have no more to do with her, that it was > insupportable the way she treated you; and then, suddenly, once again they > would be fascinated. Of one thing I am quite positive, and that is if one > had to choose one woman to be a companion on a desert island, or some place > where you would have no one else to entertain you, she would hold your > interest as practically no one else could. The things she wanted to talk > about were never banal. She stimulated your mind into thinking along some > pathway that had not before suggested itself to you. She was capable of > rudeness in fact she had an insolent rudeness, when she wanted to, that was > unbelievable but if she wished to charm you she would succeed every time.\\" = Max Mallowan = Famed archaeologist Sir Max Mallowan initially appeared to have a civil relationship with Katharine. In 1926, Mallowan helped build an extension to the expedition house at Ur to include a women's restroom for her use. However, Mallowan noted that Katharine \\"...had the power of entrancing those associated with her when she was in the mood or on the contrary of creating a charged poisonous atmosphere; to live with her was to walk on a tightrope.‚Äù He likewise referred to her as ‚Äúpoisonous‚Äù with a ‚Äúdominating and powerful personality.‚Äù While Agatha (Mallowan's wife) and Katharine were good friends, it is said that their friendship subsided after Mallowan and Agatha married, presumably due to Mallowan's poor opinion of Katharine. Conversely, an account by author Henrietta McCall notes that Agatha Christie felt that Mallowan was too close with Katharine, and that he had a liking for her. After Mallowan and Christie were coupled, both were unwelcome at Ur.  Publications  Although published under her husband's name, she was jointly responsible with him for the publication of the Archaeological Survey of India (link) in 1939. In 1929 she published a romantic adventure novel, Adventure Calls, set in the contemporary Middle East. The book's central character is a woman who presents as a man in order to live a life of freedom and excitement.  Other Work  She and her husband also excavated at Alalakh and Al-Mina.\\"Obituary.\\" Times [London, England] 12 Nov. 1945: 7. The Times Digital Archive. Web. 24 Aug. 2016. During World War II, her husband Leonard Woolley worked with Winston Churchill to monitor Nazi looting of museums, galleries and archives; she assisted with this work.  In Popular Culture  Apart from her connection with the Louise Leidner character in Murder in Mesopotamia, Katharine Woolley (played by Katherine Kingsley) appears as a character in the 2019 TV movie Agatha and the Curse of Ishtar. The relationship between the Woolleys in the television version does not appear to reflect the circumstances of their marriage.

He became a Jesuit priest and devoted himself to the evangelization of Muslims. He is then considered by Westerners of his century as a symbol of the \\"superiority of Christianity over Islam\\". Biography Muhammed came from a noble Muslim family, founder of Zaouia of Dila. He considered himself as \\"son of the Emperor of Morocco.\\" In 1654, he went on pilgrimage to Mecca. El Attaz was captured and all his company by the Christian fleet of Balthazar Mandols before the Cap Bon. Captive in Malta, he was released in 1656, once paid his ransom.

Originally part of the Hollywood Park Racetrack, the casino moved to a new building in 2016 after the closure and demolition of the racetrack in 2013. History The original casino owners were the Hollywood Park Operating Co., which also owned the race track. Afterwards the casino went through a series of owners including Churchill Downs. In 1994, a casino called the Hollywood Park Casino, with a poker card room, was added to the Hollywood Park Racetrack complex. The racetrack was sold and shut down in December 2013 though the casino operations continued while the current casino building opened in October 2016. The casino is part of the Hollywood Park development which also features SoFi Stadium, home to the Los Angeles Rams and Los Angeles Chargers of the National Football League and will later include multiple housing, business parks, luxury hotels, a movie theatre, and an open-air shopping center. It was the first building of the complex to be constructed and opened. =Stockbridge Capital Group= The current owners are Stockbridge Capital Group, a San Francisco-based land developer which purchased the casino and then the racetrack in 2005 for nearly $260 million. Stockbridge, in addition to owning the casino, is also the land developer for the former racetrack site and a joint partner in the NFL stadium. It is planned that the new casino, entertainment complex and NFL stadium will improve the finances of the casino, which had been on a downturn since the Los Angeles Kings and Los Angeles Lakers left The Forum in May 1999. New Casino building The Hollywood Park Casino contains 125 tables for both Poker and California Games including chandelier lighting and big-screen HD televisions on the walls. There was even a new sports bar called Century Bar & Grill. There are separate rooms for high-stakes players and celebrity poker tournaments. It also features high scale sit-down restaurant and sports bar. Like its predecessor, only card games are allowed in the casino. Off-track betting Located in the casino is the Hollywood Park OTB which continues from the former track. It features races from all over North America and Australia on big screens.

He was head of the Third Bureau of the Ustasha Surveillance Service (), and was also a member of the Main Usta≈°e Headquarters, one of the two main deputies of Paveliƒá.  Murder of Toni ≈†legel  On 22 March 1929, Babiƒá and Matija Soldina murdered Toni Schlegel, the chief editor of Novosti and president of Jugoslovenska ≈°tampa, in Zagreb. At that time, Babiƒá was a chauffeur for the Siemens plant in Zagreb and, according to official reports, he murdered one and wounded another of the policemen who came to arrest him, and managed to escape. Babiƒá fled to Italy where he stayed until Yugoslavias entry into World War II. Italian police considered Babiƒá a very dangerous man who was capable of the worst crimes.  Planning  While in Italy, Usta≈°e spent years planning for a genocidal campaign in their native country and trained a small band of followers for a takeover. As early as 1932, Babiƒá, as one of the propagandists of Paveliƒá, had written:  Concentration camps  Babiƒá participated in preparations for the establishment of Danica concentration camp. At the end of May or beginning of June 1941, he went to Pag island, based on the order of Andrija Artukoviƒá, where he established Slana concentration camp. Babiƒá also organized the Kru≈°ƒçica concentration camp near Travnik.  Blagaj massacre  Babiƒá had an important role in the Blagaj massacre on 9 May 1941. Against Paveliƒás order, Babiƒá brought several trucks of Usta≈°e from Zagreb to massacre 520 Serb peasants in the region of Kordun, where they had lived together with Croats for many centuries.  Killing of Serbs in Eastern Herzegovina  Organized by Babiƒá, Ivo Herenƒçiƒá, Jure Francetiƒá and other Usta≈°e officers, killings of Serbs were extensive in Eastern Herzegovina. In June 1941, Babiƒá and a group of Usta≈°e officers, based on the order of Andrija Artukoviƒá, went to Herzegovina to organize killings of its Serb population. On 16 or 17 June 1941, Babiƒá came to ƒåapljina. He and other Usta≈°e commanders had been instructed to suppress rebellions and undertake the complete extermination of the Serb population of the region and settle people from other parts who would be loyal to the Usta≈°e movement.  June 1941 uprising in eastern Herzegovina  Babiƒá and a group of Usta≈°e officers were organizing a struggle against rebels during the June 1941 uprising in eastern Herzegovina. According to Vladimir Dedijer, Babiƒá was killed by a rebel unit commanded by Dukica Graovac.: \\"And a week later the Ustase criminal, Mijo Babic, was killed by Dukica's command.\\" Babiƒá's machine gun, a present from Ante Paveliƒá, was first taken by Vlado ≈†egrt and later by Spira Srzentiƒá. Babiƒá held the rank of Major at the time of his death.: \\"He held the rank of Ustasha major when he was killed in Bcrkovici near Stolac, Herzegovina, on 3 July 1941 \\" His body was transported through Sarajevo to Zagreb where Paveliƒá ordered eight days of mourning for members of his Bodyguard Battalion. A newspaper in Croatia dedicated a whole page to Babiƒá's \\"heroic\\" death in a battle against \\"Serbian Chetniks\\".: \\"Most of page five of the paper was dedicated to the death and funeral of an Ustasha officer, Mijo Babic, who had died \\"heroically\\" on July 3, 1941, in a battle with \\"Serbian Chetniks.\\" The Chetniks were originally irregular army units that played ...\\"  References   Sources     * 1903 births 1941 deaths People from Nova Bukovica People from the Kingdom of Croatia-Slavonia Usta≈°e Croatian people of World War II Independent State of Croatia Croatian exiles Anti-Serbian sentiment ","title":"Mijo Babiƒá"},{"id":"51404047","text":"Chanev () is a surname.

The project aims to \\"Create an open and accessible technology aiding everyone to grow food and to grow food for everyone.\\" FarmBot is an open source project allowing hardware, software and documentation modifications and additions from users.  History  FarmBot creators Rick Carlino (left) and Rory Aronson (right) building a FarmBot in Chicago, Illinois The FarmBot project was started in 2011 by American Rory Aronson whilst studying mechanical engineering at California Polytechnic State University. Aronson attended an elective course in organic agriculture where he learned about a tractor that used machine vision to detect and cover weeds which removed the need for herbicides or manual labour, the tractor cost over $1 million USD. In September 2013 Aronson published a white paper outlining the goals of the project to \\"Grow a community that produces free and open- source hardware plans, software, data, and documentation enabling everyone to build and operate a farming machine.\\" The project is a response to the 60% increase food production needed due to the growth in world population to between 7 - 9 billion by 2050 and the potential of precision agriculture to reduce the environmental impacts of farming by reducing water use, energy, transportation, petrochemicals and time required to grow crops. In March 2014 Aronson began working on the project full-time funded by a grant from the Shuttleworth Foundation. Firmware developer Tim Evers and software developer Rick Carlino later joined the project as core developers and the open source community Farmbot.cc was created to support the development of the project. In March 2014 Rory Aronson created the company Farmbot.io to provide hardware kits and software services and to serve as a funding source to maintain the open source community. In 2014 and 2015 FarmBot was entered into the Hackaday Prize where it became a finalist in 2015. Farmbot.io began preorders of the first commercially available version of FarmBot, the FarmBot Genesis, the ninth iteration of the design in July 2016.  Farmbot Genesis  = Capabilities = The FarmBot Genesis is able to plant over 30 different crops including potatoes, peas, squash, artichokes and chard in an area of 2.9 meters √ó 1.4 meters with a maximum plant height of 0.5 meters. It can cultivate a variety of crops within same area at the same time and is able to operate indoors, outdoors and covered areas. It is estimated that the FarmBot Genesis produces 25% fewer carbon dioxide emissions than standard US food production.

Conceived in 1994, the project's ambition was to restore and maintain a significant amount of the forestry in the Scottish environment, and secondly to reestablish the link between local communities and the environment that surrounded them. The project's nationwide appeal led to many local communities, farms and established natural projects (such as the National Trust for Scotland and the World Wildlife Fund) investing time and money in restoring and maintaining many areas of natural importance throughout Scotland. As a result of the initiative, it is estimated that the project has restored over 22,000 hectares of forest and natural land and created 200 kilometers of new hiking trails. Some locations that the project has helped include: *Balmaha Millennium Forest Park, Balmaha *The Millennium Forest, Borgie, Sutherland *Mugdock Country Park, Milngavie *Cashel Millenium Forest, Loch Lomond *Angus Millennium Forest, Angus *Edinburgh (urban forest project) Although the project was aimed for the turn of the millennium, the efforts and investment in the project lasted over a period of 12 years, with many of the benefits still being felt today.

It is a rhizomatous perennial endemic to Lebanon. It has long narrow leaves, short stem, and flowers with a white background which is covered with very small dots or veins of dark maroon, purple, purplish-maroon, or almost black. It has a dark maroon signal patch with a brownish or purplish beard. It is rarely cultivated as an ornamental plant in temperate regions, as it needs very dry conditions during the summer. It is listed as critically endangered by the IUCN. Description Iris cedreti has a compact, pale yellow rhizomes about wide, and has 8 or 9 leaves, which are up to long and wide. It is narrowed to the tip, with an acute apex, or is narrowly obtuse. It is considered to be a dwarf plant, rarely exceeding in height, and is normally between tall. It has inflated, green spathes (leaves of the flower bud), that are long, and the perianth tube is about in length. The dwarf stems hold a terminal (top of stem) flower, blooming in May. The flowers are in diameter and have a white background which is covered with very small dots or veins of dark maroon, purple, purplish-maroon, or almost black. Like other irises, it has 2 pairs of petals, 3 large sepals (outer petals), known as the \\"falls\\", and 3 inner, smaller petals (or tepals), known as the \\"standards\\". The ovate shaped falls are between long and wide. In the centre of the falls is a rounded, dark maroon signal patch which is long and wide. Also, in the middle of the falls, is a row of short hairs called the \\"beard\\", which are brownish (rusty brown), purplish, or mottled. The obovate (narrower end at the base) standards are up to long and wide and they have a channeled claw (narrow section of petal closest to the stem). They have a triangular and 6 lobed, long ovary and long stamens, creamy-white anthers. The dark maroon-purple style branches are long and wide, with bi-lobes and a keel (ridge) with a small crest. After the iris has flowered, it produces an inflated, lobed seed capsule, which is narrowed toward both ends and is long. It contains many seeds which are arillated. =Biochemistry= As most irises are diploid, having two sets of chromosomes, this can be used to identify hybrids and classification of groupings. It has a chromosome count: 2n=20, counted by Awishai & Zohary in 1980. In August 2016, a study was published that focused on the karyological and cytogenetic characters of Irises in Lebanon (including Iris cedreti) as compared to Iris germanica and Iris mesopotamica. Taxonomy The species was first described by John Edward Dinsmore and published in 1972 by Shaukat Ali Chaudhary in Botaniska Notiser (Bot. Not.), Vol. 125, Issue 4, page 497. The specific epithet is cedreti refers to The Cedars, Lebanon, where the iris was found. Similar to Astragalus cedreti, and Verbascum cedreti,Palestine Exploration Fund (Compiled by Henry C Stewardson) it can be commonly misspelt as I. cedretii (with 1 t and 2 i's), or as I. cedretti (with 2 t's and 1 i). and it is known in Arabic as ÿ≥Ÿàÿ≥ŸÜ ÿßŸÑÿ£ÿ±ÿ≤. The name was verified by United States Department of Agriculture and the Agricultural Research Service on 4 April 2003 and then updated on 2 December 2004. Distribution and habitat =Range= Iris cedreti is native to temperate Asia. It is endemic to Lebanon, and found along the Mount Lebanon mountain chain, including the Bsharri District. =Habitat= It grows on the mountains, at the sub-alpine zone. on rocky slopes (of inclines up to 45¬∞) that have good drainage, and in terra rossa soil on a karstic substrate. It can be found at an altitude of above sea level. Synecology In the Bsharri District, it grows with four other endangered species: Carlina involucrate libanotica in Hadchit, and Potentilla libanotica, Arenaria libatonica, and Astragalus pinetorum in Bcharre. It can be found with Fritillaria hermonis, Romulea nivalis, Corydalis, and Tulip species growing on the higher slopes of the mountains. Conservation Iris cedreti is highly threatened. In 1996, Mouterde published that it had a wide range and found populations near the Cedars, between Ehden and the Cedars, and near Hasroun. But by 2001, Tohme and Tohme published that only populations near the Cedars were found. In 2009, it was listed as Endangered, as 50% of the known populations of the iris had been lost. By 2016 it was listed as critically endangered by the IUCN. Among the factors which threaten its survival are housing and road construction (or urbanization) which are the most severe, as they destroy natural habitats; this separates populations over wide areas and inhibits the movement of pollinators. The urbanization includes developments for winter tourism such as ski resorts, which cause desiccation on the slopes. Other habitat threats are agriculture and grazing by sheep and goats, flower picking (which stops seed development), and, in one site, the presence of an old sand quarry. Climate change also serves to reduce snow cover, and the plant can not adapt very easily to changes. In Lebanon, no conservation measures are in place to protect this species. A reserve at Jabal El Makmel of 400 hectares was created between 2006 and 2007 to stop grazing and allow the natural regeneration of the forest. It benefited trees of Juniperus excelsa and Acer tauricolum, as well as the iris. In 2009, only 2.5% of Lebanon's mountainous area was protected by nature reserves. A population of I. cedreti in Hasroun was reported extinct in 2009. As part of a conservation plan, seeds of I. cedreti (in 2004) and I. sofarana subsp. kasruwana (in 2001 and 2003) were collected by the Lebanese Agricultural Research Institute (LARI) and stored at the Millennium Seed Bank in Wakehurst Place, part of the Royal Botanic Gardens at Kew. Cultivation Iris cedreti prefers to grow in a sunny, well drained, rocky habitat. A study was carried out on Pancratium maritimum and I. cedreti in 2004 to find out the best forms of growing new embryos of the rare plants. It was found that a sucrose concentration (of 10%) used in an in-vitro culture worked best for the iris. Collar thickness, root system branching, and the number of leaves were also important factors for successful transplanting of seedlings. Seedlings can be grown in a mixture of peat moss, perlite, and sandy loam in clay pots within a greenhouse. An herbarium specimen of the iris exists in the National Museum of Natural History, Paris. =Propagation= Irises can generally be propagated by division or by seed growing. Irises generally require a period of cold, then a period of warmth and heat; they also need some moisture. Some seeds need stratification (the cold treatment), which can be carried out indoors or outdoors. Seedlings are generally potted on (or transplanted) when they have 3 leaves. Toxicity Like many other irises, most parts of the plant are poisonous (rhizome and leaves). If mistakenly ingested it can cause stomach pains and vomiting. Handling the plant may cause skin irritation or an allergic reaction.David G Spoerke and Susan C. Smolinske Culture The iris has inspired a fragrance perfume called Infusion d'Iris Cedre from Prada. One of a set of six released in 2015, the perfume contains scents of iris, neroli, cedarwood, vetiver, incense, and benzoin. References Other sources * Mathew, B.

Technology  The idea of transferring styles from the works by famous artists to images was first mentioned in September 2015 after the publication of Leon Gatys's article \\"A Neural Algorithm of Artistic Style\\", where he described the algorithm in detail. The major shortcoming of this algorithm is its slow performance, which is up to dozens of seconds depending on the algorithm's settings. In March 2016, Russian researcher Dmitry Ulyanov's article was published, where he invented a way to improve the generation of stylized pictures using additional neuron generator network training. With this approach, stylized images can be generated within just dozens of milliseconds. Seventeen days after Ulyanov's article, Justin Johnson published an article containing an identical idea, the only difference being the structure of the generator network. The Artisto application was developed using these open-source technologies, which Mail.ru Group's machine learning specialists improved for faster video processing and better quality.

During the last century alone, it has been a staging ground for Italian initiatives in East Africa, collateral of Britain‚Äôs colonial politics, and victim of the expansion of Ethiopia‚Äôs empire until 1993 when it finally became the new and sovereign state of Eritrea. Only the large cluster of buildings built in the style of the Avant-Garde betrays the multifaceted history of this strange city and its urban core almost entirely unchanged for over seventy years. Asmara ‚Äì developed as a European city ‚Äì is, today, an Eritrean city. Even though city planners, architects, and engineers were largely European, and members of the indigenous population were largely used as construction workers, Asmarinos still identify with their city‚Äôs legacy.Jan K√∂rting & Neysan Z√∂lzer (2012): Heritage and Daily Life in the Historic Urban Core of Asmara (Original: Erbe und Alltag im historischen Stadtkern Asmaras) (Dissertation). Technische Universit√§t Berlin.  Etymology  The name Asmara derives from 'Arbate Asmara', the name given to a village on today's site of Asmara. The name means ‚Äúthe women have united the four villages‚Äù and relates to a foundational story in which women forced the men of four villages to consolidate their villages into one.  Antiquity to 1922  = Pre-Colonial Asmara = Asmara village in the 1890s Asmara was the perfect place to build a settlement; it had fertile soil, a mild climate because of its location on the plateau, and regular precipitation. While remains of prehistoric peoples have been found near Asmara; the ancient Aksum Empire ruled closeby; Islam had made inroads in the Horn of Africa from the region; and ruins of small villages found around present-day Asmara indicate the existence of peoples who had settled in the area long before the development of a city in the regionCurtis and Schmidt describe archeological findings from the agro-pastoral settlements, which arose between the 8th and 4th centuries BC. It is possibly that Asmara was already an important trade center even before the Axum Empire. (Cf. Curtis, Schmidt: Urban Precursors in the Horn: Early 1st Millennium BC Communities in Eritrea, pg. 849.), it can be said that the history of Asmara began around four hundred years before the effects of European colonization began to take hold. According to oral traditions, there were once four villages on Asmara‚Äôs plains. Attacks by wild animals and raids by other indigenous groups prompted the women of the neighboring villages to come together to discuss solutions that would help to ensure the protection of their families, properties, and belongings. The women decided that they would not serve lunch to the men of their villages until they agreed to consolidate the four villages into one. The men fulfilled the women‚Äôs wishes and built one united village, which they named Arbate Asmara.Yosief, The Story of Asm√§ra [sic] (Cited in: Melchers: Asmara ‚Äì Afrikas heimliche Hauptstadt der Moderne, pg. 10) Eritreans today enjoy relaying this tale about the founding of their city, as it serves as an example of how Eritrean people have been able to come together and persevere even under the harshest conditions. Asmara's market in the 1890s From this point on, the new village of 150 inhabitants lay in the medieval Medri Bahri Kingdom, until, after a short period when it was ruled by the Ottomans and later the Egyptians, it fell into the hands of Ethiopian Emperor Yohannes IV in the middle of the 19th century, who chose his trusted General Ras Alula to be governor of the newly-occupied kingdom. Alula declared Asmara the capital of the province, and within just a few years had increased the population of the small village to more than 5,000 inhabitants. A buoyant weekly market drew traders and builders from all over the surrounding region. Political and military conflicts between the local warlords of the Hamasien Plateau compelled Alula to station 12,000 soldiers in Asmara, so that the small city soon took on the appearance of a military camp. During the 1870s, there were at least two battles between Alula and these warlords, both of which essentially destroyed the city. Asmara‚Äôs weekly market, however, continued to take place. Emperor Yohannes IV called Alula and his troops up to Addis Abeba in 1889 to support him in his fight against the Mahdi uprisings. = Italian invasion = On August 3, 1889, Italian troops took advantage of Alula‚Äôs absence, the power vacuum left as a result of Emperor Yohannes‚Äô death, and the havoc wreaked by three years of famine and took over the small city.Tesfagiorgis: Eritrea ‚Äì Africa in Focus, pg. 34 They built their fort on a hill in the village of Beit Mekae, forcing the inhabitants of this village to resettle elsewhere. At the time of General Baldisera‚Äôs arrival, the small town had 3000 inhabitants and consisted of traditional mud huts, Agdos and Hidmos. Above all, the military fort at Beit Mekae was a strategic point when it came to controlling the local population; it also served as a military strongpoint from which local uprisings, which were largely directed against the government‚Äôs power of eminent domain, could be suppressed.Gebremedhin: Asmara ‚Äì Africa‚Äôs Secret Modernist City, pg. 5 Eritrea officially became an Italian colony in 1890 and Massawa ‚Äì already the seat of the colonial administration since 1885 ‚Äì was declared the capital. At this time, because of the danger of insurrection in the highlands, Asmara was not even in the running to become the capital of the new colony. Furthermore, Bizzon explains that Asmara was not developed enough to serve as the capital: ‚ÄúPolitically, militarily, and even logistically, the distance between Massawa and Asmara is greater than the distance between Italy and Massawa.‚ÄùBizzoni: L‚ÄôEritrea ‚Äì nel passato e nel presente (Quoted in: Denison et al.: Asmara ‚Äì Africa‚Äôs Secret Modernist City, pg. 24) The lack of an infrastructural link to Massawa prevented Asmara from developing quickly. 400x400px That, despite all of this, Asmara rose to significance has to do with the goals of Italian colonization. The interest in the occupation of Eritrea lay, on the one hand, in the settlement of Italian citizens who were able to strengthen the economy of their motherland through development of the colony, and on the other hand, to use Eritrea as a military base from which the expansion of the colony could take place.Almedom: Re-reading the Short and Long-Rigged History of Eritrea 1941‚Äì1952: Back to the Future?, pg. 108 The Ethiopian Empire was one of the last uncolonized regions of Africa, and the vision of a strong, modern Italian nation after the successes of the Risorgimento, would require the acquisition of colonies if the country to become a European superpower, and to affirm the autonomy of the young kingdom.Fuller: Italy's Colonial Futures: Colonial Inertia and Postcolonial Capital in Asmara, pg. 2 Colonial politics brought about the government‚Äôs claim to eminent domain as well as the realization of many noteworthy infrastructure projects. As a result of the takeover of Asmara by foreign militaries and because of the employment opportunities within infrastructure projects throughout Eritrea, the population of Asmara itself shrunk from 5000 to 800 inhabitants during the first five years of the Italian occupation. However, it remained an important market town on the Hamasien Plateau.Tesfagiorgis: Eritrea ‚Äì Africa in Focus, pg. 39 The construction of the Massawa-Asmara-Railroad as well as a funicular railroad built along the same stretch that could transport heavy loads, finally allowed the Italians to use Asmara as a new base in the highlands. = Becoming the Capital of Eritrea = Map of Asmara in 1895 With the arrival of the first governor, Ferdinando Martini, in 1897 and after advances in the invasion of the highlands, Asmara was declared the capital of the colony of Eritrea. Asmara offered a strategic military position in the highlands opposite Massawa, fortifications at the residences of Alula and Baldissera, and an increase in the quality and quantity of transportation connections in the region.Gebremedhin: Asmara ‚Äì Africa‚Äôs Secret Modernist City, pg. 5 The potential that the city could become a cultural-historical hub did not play any role in the decision to make Asmara into the capital. Only a few modern buildings like the Commissariato, a small jail, the troop commanders‚Äô Villa, a club for Italian officers, and several houses were built before 1900.Tesfagiorgis: Eritrea ‚Äì Africa in Focus, pg. 41 These buildings surrounded the old post office building in the city neighborhood known as Mai Bela, remembered for its narrow streets and short blocks, symbols of the beginnings of modern Asmara. In 1900, a fire destroyed large parts of neighborhoods inhabited mostly by indigenous people, which would have given colonial city planners the chance to reorganize these areas in accordance with European criteria had they taken the opportunity. Early urban development as well as the construction of two fortresses in addition to Fort Baldisera took place along the East-West line, which later became the city‚Äôs central avenue, today called Harnet Avenue. = Racial Segregation and the First City Plan = The first city plan for Asmara was introduced under Martini in 1902. At the center of the plan was a grid system, even though the topography of the city was not ideal for such a road system, as the following report describes: > ‚ÄúI say the ‚Äòflat ground‚Äô of the city, but instead it is anything else but > flat. Light undulations, little hills, mounds, bumps, dips and little > valleys in the ground bring a truly picturesque variety to the buildings and > to the streets, which therefore never appear similar to one another. They > offer suitable areas and remarkable positions in which to make public > buildings prominent. In short, it is a ground so made that it would be the > torment of a builder from Turin, the horror of an engineer from America, but > would be dreamt of by an architect who is truly artistic, a lover of the > picturesque, and an enemy of uniformity.‚ÄùThe visitor was R. Paoli. A > translation of a selection from his travel logs can be found in Denison et > al.: Asmara ‚Äì Africa‚Äôs Secret Modernist City, pg. 33 Nevertheless, Italian planners chose to implement a grid system for Asmara‚Äôs roads. It would be a symbol of how the ‚Äúcivilized‚Äù brought order to the organically developed neighborhoods of the nativesThe fact that the local districts would emerge \\"organically\\" was less of an urban strategy than a neglect of the Eritreans by the Italian colonial administration (See Asmara ‚Äî Africa's Secret Modernist City, pg. 33), and would, in this way, highlight the so-called superiority of the colonizers. Urban Plan for Asmara in 1913 Above all, the first city plans should be seen as an expression of the power relations between two groups. The plan from 1902 had already divided the city into three zones: a zone for Italians which included the city center, a zone centered on the traditional market meant for other European groups like Greeks and Jews, and an unplanned zone for indigenous folks, located outside of the northern city border.Tesfagiorgis: Eritrea ‚Äì Africa in Focus, pg. 42 A fourth zone for industry was envisaged in the next plan of 1908.Gebremedhin: Asmara ‚Äì Africa‚Äôs Secret Modernist City, pg. 6 Additional plans by planner Cavagniari, which were decided upon in 1913 and 1916 respectively, strengthened the principle of racial separation, which then became increasingly more rigid during the beginning of the fascist era in the 1920s.Rodwell: Asmara: Conservation and Development in a Historic City, pg. 5 The plans saw Asmara first and foremost as a new home for qualified skilled laborers from Italy. The spatial model of the garden city would be applied to the new European quarter, and would include broad, tree-lined boulevards, residential streets, and houses situated behind Bougainvillea hedges, built so that they did not crowd one another. Similarly, Asmara became an Italian city, prompting Eritrean journalist Emanuel Sahle to say: ‚ÄúNow Eritrean mothers who travel to Rome to see their relatives there wonder at how the citizens of Rome dared imitate ‚Äòour dear and beautiful Asmera [sic].‚Äô‚Äù The fact that Eritreans could express appropriation and affection in this way may sound astonishing, as Asmara was not only predominantly Italian, but Eritreans themselves could only make limited use of the capital. The institutionalized racial separation central to Italian colonial politics was not designed to account for the indigenous population, who would be displaced as the expansion of the industrial zone reached the unplanned quarters to the north.Gebremedhin: Asmara ‚Äì Africa‚Äôs Secret Modernist City, pg. 7 Eritreans who owned property in the city center, or the European quarter, were forced to move out and sell their land. In 1908, the Governor issued a decree that, in the interest of promoting and maintaining ‚Äúpublic order‚Äù, declared that the first zone was meant only for Italians and citizens from other European countries, whereas the sudditi coloniali, or the ‚Äúcolonial subjects‚Äù, were only allowed in the indigenous quarter and the mixed Market zone.Chelati Dirar: From warriors to urban dwellers: Ascari and the military factor in the urban development of colonial Eritrea, pg. 533 Only the Askari, indigenous soldiers who served in colonial troops, were allowed to build their huts in areas near the Italian residences, where conditions were better than those endured by their compatriots.The campi-famiglia directive allowed each Askari to build their own house. Under the supervision of Italian engineers, the soldier was to build the house with local building materials. In: Chelati Dirar: From warriors to urban dwellers: Ascari and the military factor in the urban development of colonial Eritrea, pg. 533 The untypical proximity of the Askari to the Italians illustrates the deep trust of the Italian administration in the indigenous troops. In 1926, colonial minister, Luigi Federzoni, described the Eritrean regiments as ‚Äúthe most solid, effective and safe pillar of our military might in all our African colonies.‚ÄùFrom a letter from Federzoni to Mussolini, dated November 24, 1926. Source: Palumbo: A Place in the Sun: Africa in Italian Colonial Culture, pg. 88 This relationship lasted throughout the Italian occupation of Eritrea, and is more than likely an important factor in determining the good-naturedness of Eritreans toward Italians today. Asmara Theatre in the 1920s The first plans led to a phase of intensive building, which ultimately resulted in an increase of Asmara‚Äôs population from between 800 and 1,900 peopleTesfagiorgis: Eritrea ‚Äì Africa in Focus, pg. 39 to more than 8,500 people in 1905, of which around 1,500 were white. This dramatic population increase exacerbated both a growth in trade and a rise in employment opportunities, as well as an upsurge in the number of people moving from rural areas to cities. In 1910, the city‚Äôs population had grown to around 37,000 people.Tesfagiorgis: Eritrea ‚Äì Africa in Focus, pg. 44 During this period of growth, many important buildings cropped up, including the Palast des Gouverneurs (today the residence of the president), the first Italian school, the cathedral, the theater, and the high court, all of which are located on the centralized Corso del Re, later known as the Viale Mussolini, and even later as Harnet Avenue. Asmara‚Äôs road system and the important connections between Asmara and the cities of Keren and Decamhare were also built during this time period, along with the Massawa-Asmara-Railroad Line, which was finally finished in 1911.  Asmara under Mussolini (1922-1941)  = Development under Mussolini's fascism = Asmara in 1928 With Mussolini‚Äôs rise to power in 1922, Asmara began a new chapter in its history. During the fascist occupation, the construction that took place in the city was by far the most formative. With Mussolini‚Äôs efforts put toward building an Italian empire, the Eritrean capital became increasingly important in the years that followed, and in the 1930s, it became one of the most important sites in Italian East Africa. The construction boom, which has left its mark on Asmara evident even today, did not begin immediately upon Mussolini‚Äôs rise to power in 1922. Asmara was initially little more than a some military installations and a colonial settlement. It grew into a small town by the 1920s.Rausch: Rescuing Modernity: Global Heritage Assemblages and Modern Architecture in Africa, pg. 4 Despite the strategic location of Asmara, at first, the capital was really only used as an administrative headquarters for the Italian colonial regime. Contrary to the statement that Asmara had already grown to the size of a small city 30 years before, Bodenschatz claims that Asmara was only the size of a small village until the Ethiopian invasion in 1935.Bodenschatz: St√§dtebau f√ºr Mussolini, pg. 371 According to Bodenschatz, in the 1920s Asmara had around 18,000 inhabitants, of whom 3,000 were Italians. The focus on city development centered on the erection of administrative buildings and accommodations for the political and military elite. Modern architecture, equally lauded by architecture aficionados and city historians, slowly found its way to Eritrea in the 1920s. At this time in Italy, architecture was relatively uninfluenced by European avant-garde modernism which had taken hold in Holland, Germany, and France in particular.Akbar, Gebremedhin: Ein Weltkulturerbe It wasn‚Äôt until 1927 that Gruppo 7The members of Gruppo 7 were Luigi Figini, Ubaldo Castagnoli, Guido Frette, Sebastiano Lorco, Gino Pollini, Carlo Enrico Rava and Guiseppe Terragni., a coalition of young architects from Milan, developed the Italian variation of avant-garde modern architecture called Rationalismo. Until 1935, the majority of structures in Asmara were built in traditional styles from established architecture schools like Novecento and the Scuola Romana, both of which appropriated certain formal elements from the Italian Gothic, the Renaissance, the Baroque, the Romantic, and the Classical time periods. The architecture remained largely traditional and was based mostly on the models of the Italian motherland. In Asmara‚Äôs most representative buildings built before 1935, this historicism is especially apparent. Asmara‚Äôs theater exhibits stylistic elements from both the Romantic and Renaissance periods.Denison et al.: Asmara ‚Äì Africa‚Äôs Secret Modernist City, pg. 107 The Bank of Eritrea‚Äôs building is built in the Neo-Gothic style, and the Governor‚Äôs Palace as well as the post office building were constructed using neoclassical elements. To position Mussolini‚Äôs rule within the time period when modern architecture found its way to the Eritrean highland is, at least for the first half of his reign, incorrect. In reality, nearly all of the avant-garde structures were conscripted and built between 1935 and 1941. Even if the building boom did not begin until the middle of the 1930s, Mussolini‚Äôs fascist ideology would have already influenced the urban development plans during the 1920s and the beginning of the 1930s. Former Mayor's Villa in Asmara. Today, it is a Bed & Breakfast. At the beginning of the 20th century, the citizens of Asmara were separated by race. Neighborhoods for indigenous and European populations were clearly delineated from each other, however a public area could be used by everyone. The preliminary plans to separate people from different ethnic groups were expanded and concretized under Mussolini. The improved plans from 1930 laid out how the city would be divided into four clear and separate zones: the residential quarter for the indigenous population in the north, where there were already high population densities and erratic structures; the diagonal blocks of the industry zone; the ‚ÄúVilla quarter‚Äù for the Europeans, located south of present-day Harnet Avenue; and, the mixed zone around the market. Located in the market zone were administrative and commercial entities that were of equal significance for both groups of people (i.e. the indigenous and the European). Additionally, this zone housed centralized cultural institutions, and was interspersed with additional housing.Melchers: Asmara ‚Äì Afrikas heimliche Hauptstadt der Moderne, pg. 6 The categorization of inhabitants by race reached its peak under fascism, with the strict separation of indigenous folks and occupiers. = Growth as an Italian Military Base = Asmara in the 1930s With the plan to raid Abyssinia and to incorporate it into the African colony, Asmara‚Äôs cityscape began to change. More and more soldiers were being stationed in Eritrea, and the city had only a short time to manage a rapid increase in its population. Between 1932 and 1936 alone the number of inhabitants rose from 18,000 to 98,000 people.Bader: Faschistische Moderne in Afrika ‚Äì Auto und Architektur in Asmara, pg. 353 Until 1935, administrative and commercial structures were expanded in order to build up Asmara as a military base for the upcoming war. The village became a bustling administrative city and a trading hubBodenschatz: St√§dtebau f√ºr Mussolini, pg. 371, that required its new inhabitants address its rising sanitation, building, transportation, and safety needs. And so, housing, businesses, recreation services, as well as churches appeared out of thin air in a matter of a few short years. Before delving deeper into the details of Asmara‚Äôs development, a brief summary of the origin and evolution story of this Italian colony on the Horn of Africa should be given in order to better contextualize, and hopefully make clearer, Asmara‚Äôs extreme growth at the end of the 1930s. In 1935, Italy, a significant colonial power, had already occupied Eritrea for nearly 40 years. The fascist regime nevertheless aspired to expand its colony located on the Horn of Africa. Already in 1896, Italy had unsuccessfully battled Adwa with the aim of taking Ethiopia. Driven by this disgrace, in 1935 Italian troops invaded the Abyssinian empire without any declaration of war. Asmara, because of its location in the highlands, was an ideal military location, which offered Europeans a relatively comfortable climateAsmara has a dry climate with moderate temperatures. In contrast to the year-round sultry harbor town of Massawa, the climate of Asmara offered ideal conditions for the rejuvenation of the Italian armed forces. and was a good site strategically. And so, Asmara became the main supply base for the Italian offensive during the Abyssinian War.Mattioli: Unterwegs zu einer imperialen Raumordnung in Italienisch- Ostafrika, pg. 329 With a vengeance, the regime under Mussolini set their sights on taking the kingdom. With nearly 400,000 men and 450 aircraft ‚Äì these were half of the Regia Aeronautica ‚Äì the Italian forces were far superior to the Abyssinians. The Italians also had the support of the Askari, who followed the Italian troops during the war.According to the relevant literature, from context it can be inferred that these Eritrean soldiers served more to make the Italian army look somewhat inclusive, and to harbor Eritrean support, than to add a significant amount of force to the already powerful Italian army. Our research in Asmara showed, however, that the elders were very proud to have fought alongside the Italians and that they feel connected with the former occupiers through their military service. During the war against Ethiopia, 60,000 Askari fought on the Italian side.Denison et al.: Asmara - Africa‚Äôs Secret Modernist City, pg. 55 In the almost one-year-long fight, during which even poison gas was used, around 150,000 Abyssinians were killed.Woller: Geschichte Italiens im 20. Jahrhundert, pg. 150 Historian Hans Woller marks the war in Abyssinia as the bloodiest military conflict to take place after WWI. After claiming victory following the bloody siege of Addis Abeba in May 1936 that ended the war, the African colony ‚Äì called Orientale Italiana by Italians ‚Äì now included Eritrea, Ethiopia, and extensive stretches of land along the coast of Somalia; it was, as a result, the third largest colonial empire in the world.Mattioli: Unterwegs zu einer imperialen Raumordnung in Italienisch-Ostafrika. In: F√ºr den Faschismus bauen, pg. 330 On May 9, 1936 from the Palazzo Venezia, Benito Mussolini announced to a jubilant crowd: ‚ÄúL‚ÄôItalia ha finalmente il suo Impero‚Äú [Italy finally has its empire].Bader: Faschistische Moderne in Afrika ‚Äì Auto und Architektur in Asmara. In: F√ºr den Faschismus bauen, pg. 353 ‚ÄúIm Konzert der M√§chte trat das faschistische Kriegsregime fortan als zweites Imperium Romanum auf, das in Ostafrika ‚Äì wie einst die R√∂mer rund um das Mittelmeer ‚Äì eine, wie sie es nannten ‚ÄöZivilisierungsmission‚Äô zu erf√ºllen h√§tte.‚ÄùMattioli: Unterwegs zu einer imperialen Raumordnung in Italienisch-Ostafrika. In: F√ºr den Faschismus bauen, pg. 329 Only ten days after the proclamation of the Empire, Mussolini ordered the construction of a new transportation infrastructure in East Africa. A road network 2850 kilometers long would expand across the entire colony. At last, the hour of city planning and designing had arrived. Mattioli labels Italian East Africa as ‚Äúa playground for architects and city planners.‚Äù After the war, Italian East Africa was to become a settlement colony. With its six administrative districts, anywhere between 1 and 6.5 million Italians from the motherland could reside in the city. The effort to colonize the Horn of Africa with Europeans required an enormous amount of infrastructure planning. Streets, administrative facilities, housing, and commercial buildings had to be planned out and built. Additionally, engineers, architects, and urban planners who had invested interests in living out their creative urges on the playground of East Africa were needed. Just a week after the proclamation of the empire, the most influential architect in the regime, Marcello Piacentini, turned to Mussolini and proposed that he be hired to coordinate the necessary construction projects under one general plan. Never before in history had such an opportunity presented itself: to systematically control the architectonic aspects and urban development of a territory that had been, until this time, completely untouched by any previous ‚Äúcivilization initiatives‚Äù, Piacentini said. = Deepening Racial Segregation = An avenue in Asmara. This avenue served to segregate two sides of the city. An announcement made in 1936 stipulated that Italian architects and city planners would not just be those who were marginally aligned with fascist ideology, but those who wholeheartedly support it. In his speech, the architect Carlo Quadrelli outlined the basic principles that architects in the colonies should follow when handling the housing issue, which he formulated as follows: > ‚Äú[...] I consider the following basic principles to be essential: # Without > question, the conviction that the white man is the ruler and therefore has > the right to all conceivable privileges; # That, consequently, the law [j]is > one thing for the whites, and another thing for the natives; # That the > houses and dwellings of whites are always the first priority when solving > any architectonic problem; indigenous dwellings, on the other hand, are only > of interest to the whites if solving a problem with them would improve the > wellbeing of the white population; # That there are to be no whites and > coloreds living together in the same house; # That the white man‚Äôs house > must be outfitted with the best comforts available as it is preferable if he > can enjoy his time in the colony, and because he should be able to enjoy the > privileges that come with being white.‚ÄùSantoinianni: Il Razionalismo nelle > colonie italiene 1927-1943 ‚Äì La ‚Äûnuova architettura‚Äú delle Terre > d‚ÄôOltremare, pg. 120 (Quoted in Erbel: Die Architekturmoderne in Asmara vor > dem Hintergrund von italienischem Faschismus und Kolonialismus) But it was not only Italian architects who sought council with Mussolini in hopes of having their ideas realized under the Duce‚Äôs rule. Le Corbusier wanted his own plans implemented on the East African ‚Äúplayground‚Äù, and from 1932 onwards, he continuously pursued the opportunity to meet privately with Mussolini. His attempts were made in vain, however, and so he wrote to the Italian ambassador in Brazil and recommended that the social structure of the residential city of Addis Abeba be abolished. He made concrete plans for a dominant central axis that would strictly separate the Europeans‚Äô residential neighborhoods from the indigenous population. This abrasive plan based on segregation did not take any of the local traditions nor the existing city structure into account.Mattioli: Unterwegs zu einer imperialen Raumordnung in Italienisch-Ostafrika. In: F√ºr den Faschismus bauen, pg. 332 Housing for the local population (Askari) Independent of Le Corbusier, the policies requiring the strict racial separation of the population were followed. Not only was the separation of races of the utmost importance when writing development policy for implementation in East Africa, the urge to perpetuate fascist ideology through urban planning without regard for existing structures and cultures was as well. Just as in Italy, architecture and urban construction policies were deployed in the colony in a dialectic of destruction and radical new design. The concepts of dominance, order, and racial segregation were to be inscribed in the cities of the Impero.Mattioli: Unterwegs zu einer imperialen Raumordnung in Italienisch-Ostafrika. In: F√ºr den Faschismus bauen, pg. 339 ‚ÄúIn the second half of the 1930s, Mussolini's urban planners designed projects that treated settlements in Italian East Africa not as historic cities but as tabula rasa.‚ÄùMattioli: Unterwegs zu einer imperialen Raumordnung in Italienisch-Ostafrika. In: F√ºr den Faschismus bauen, pg. 342 They regarded the people of East Africa as ‚Äúbarbarians‚Äù who did not live in real cities, and who did not have the right kind of housing nor culture. In order to realize the plans of an imperial spatial order, planners under Mussolini did not hesitate to destroy entire historical districts. From 1935 to 1940, one large project known as Africa Orientale Italiana consumed about twenty percent of the entire Italian national budget.Mattioli: Unterwegs zu einer imperialen Raumordnung in Italienisch-Ostafrika. In: F√ºr den Faschismus bauen, pg. 337 These enormous financial expenses illustrate the importance of the little colony on the Horn of Africa. Mussolini was obsessed with the idea of the Impero, not least of all because it brought him great sympathy in his home country. When looking at the importance of the colony for the fascist regime as well as for the Italians, it quickly becomes clear that Asmara was not a meaningless colonial city ‚Äújust somewhere‚Äù in Africa. Asmara stood for colonial triumph. The attention that the city attracted in the Eritrean highlands provided an ideal platform from which to demonstrate political, economic and social superiority. = Formative Years and a Building Boom = Viale Mussolini (today Harnet Avenue) in 1930s Asmara After 1936, the cities in East Africa experienced a genuine building boom. As stormy as the city can be because of its location 2,350 meters above sea level, urban development did not take off anywhere else during the Africa Orientale Italiana project like it did in Asmara.Mattioli: Unterwegs zu einer imperialen Raumordnung in Italienisch-Ostafrika. In: F√ºr den Faschismus bauen, pg. 345 The victory over Abyssinia represents a turning point in the history of Asmara, and the years up to 1941 were to become the Eritrean capital‚Äôs most formative. In order to meet the demand for new buildings, many workers were brought to Asmara. There was plenty of work from 1935 to 1941 in the city whose ability to grow seemed limitless. Initially, locals were only hired to complete menial tasks. This changed, however at the end of the 1930s, as the high number of European workers was simply too expensive. Funds for construction work were mainly provided by the Italian state. Asmara soon became known as the most advanced center of the Impero and was celebrated as Piccola Roma.Guida dell‚ÄôAfrica Orientale Italiana, pg. 199 In a guidebook from 1938, Asmara was presented as the most graceful Italian city with an average population size; it was portrayed as being completely new and full of youthful energy directed towards achieving a truly imperial future.Guida dell‚ÄôAfrica Orientale Italiana, pg. 200 This youthful energy was especially reflected in the funicular railroad built in 1937. It was the longest cableway in the world at that time and connected Asmara with the harbor town of Massawa. In Asmara, as in other Italian colonial cities, there was no consideration given to the existing settlement structures of the local population. Nearly all traditional huts - the Agdos and Hidmos - were demolished to clear the way for new construction projects. Only in the north, in the official indigenous settlement, did Agdos and Hidmos remain untouched and isolated from the development taking place elsewhere in the city. After the destruction of most of the huts in Asmara, 45,000 local residents were moved to the citta indigene.Mattioli: Unterwegs zu einer imperialen Raumordnung in Italienisch-Ostafrika. In: F√ºr den Faschismus bauen, pg. 366 In the 1930s, the city map became the most important topic of discussion in the field of modern architecture. From the point of view of the international representatives of the New Building (Neues Bauen) Movement, cities had not yet adapted to the demands of the machine age. The architects and planners of this movement criticized the orderlessness of the cities and warned that the basic biological, psychological, and hygienic needs of the inhabitants were at risk.Melchers: Asmara ‚Äì Afrikas heimliche Hauptstadt der Moderne, pg. 5 To them, this lack of order in Asmara always meant that the plans for complete racial segregation had not yet been fully implemented. With the resettlement of the locals and the demolition of the Agdos and Hidmos, developers had gained additional room for growth in the middle of the 1930s. Italian architects were faced with a wealth of new, extensive building tasks. The designers of the New Building Movement deliberately broke away from the tradition of classical Italian architecture, but also from local African architecture. In Asmara‚Äôs historic city center, there is only one building that is recognizable as Eritrean architecture and as stemming from Eritrean culture.Built in 1917 by architect Oduardo Cavagnari, the Degghi Selam Chapel is the only building in the historic city center that includes any traditional Eritrean architectural or cultural elements. Traditional motifs have been integrated, the roof is reminiscent of an Agdo (a traditional Eritrean hut), and the painted pillars are reminiscent of the Byzantine style. It cannot be said that Asmara is a fusion of modern architecture and African highland cultureDenison et al.: Asmara ‚Äì Africa‚Äôs Secret Modernist City, pg. 16, as Edward Denison writes. Aram Mattioli finds much more critical words: \\"In Asmara, it was not a question of fusing together different cultures, and certainly not an aesthetic, creative reception of European-influenced modernism by African architects, but an imperial and racist societal experiment that used a modern design vocabulary.\\"Mattioli: Unterwegs zu einer imperialen Raumordnung in Italienisch-Ostafrika. In: F√ºr den Faschismus bauen, pg. 347 From the end of the thirties, when the war against Abyssinia had ended, the Italians concentrated on the expansion of civilian institutions. Soldiers and craftsmen had families that had followed them, thus the city had to move forward with the expansion of educational institutions and housing. At that time, ideas about a policy of racial segregation were being articulated more and more clearly. This was, however, not only the tenor of Italian politicians; racial separation was the standard for all European colonial powers in Africa. In 1937, a law came into effect that criminalized cohabitation of Italian citizens and black women.Woller: Geschichte Italiens im 20. Jahrhundert, pg. 152 One year later, the regime‚Äôs implementation of radical racial laws followed. The laws took into account all areas of life, and were not only meant to pursue social and political objectives, but also biological and economic goals.Schneider: Mussolini in Afrika, pg. 157 Above all else, though, they served to emphasize the superiority and the racialized hierarchical position of the occupiers, as well as to secure a place among the privileged for the future. And so, it was hardly surprising that the architect Cafiero was commissioned in 1938 to create a new development plan for Asmara. He was to express the new racial laws in a plan and to rearrange the city with a vision of racial segregation in mind. Therefore, in Asmara, racial segregation was pursued from the legal level as well as from the different but intersecting level of urban planning. = Imposition of Radical Racial Policies = However, the restructuring of Asmara was difficult. Asmara had grown rapidly in recent years, and urban life had already taken hold in most parts of the city. In order to carry out the separation of races, Cafiero used the pre-existing zones. The mixed neighborhood around the market square now served as a buffer zone to clearly distinguish the settlements of the natives in the north from the neighborhoods of the occupiers in the south and west. This buffer zone, consisting of the industrial and commercial sectors, was to be the only area in the city where white and black people could meet. However, access was permitted only to educated Eritreans.It is still unclear what made uneducated Eritreans distinguishable for educated Eritreans. In both the German and English literature, there is also no mention as to how the majority of indigenous servants gained access to the European zone. German and English literatures are not to be found in the same way as most of the indigenous servants have access to the European quarters. In addition, a green stripe was painted along what is now known as Segeneyti Street, which served as an additional barrier that locals were not allowed to cross. Cafiero anticipated that one hectare of land would be allocated for every 380 locals, while only 140 Italians would inhabit the same amount of space in their zone.Denison et al.: Asmara ‚Äì Africa‚Äôs Secret Modernist City, pg. 58 Not just the residential areas would be separated from each other according to racial doctrine. Planners ensured that there were racially segregated restaurants, theaters, infirmaries, churches, brothels, and sometimes even separate access routes to the different functional zones of their cities.Schneider: Mussolini in Afrika, pg. 198 > ‚ÄúMussolini‚Äôs racial laws called for a complete separation of the population > along racial lines. This new strategy was far more brutal and saw the > persecution of Eritreans taken to a new level.‚ÄùDenison: Eritrea, pg. 84 Fearing that political antagonists might begin to pop up among the educational elite, Eritreans‚Äô access to schools was reduced to a minimum. There could be no doubt as to who was the master and who was the slave, and to ensure this remained the case, an educational system was set up which limited the entire school career of black children to three years. There were absolutely no other schools for these children to attend.Woller: Geschichte Italiens im 20. Jahrhundert, pg. 152 The living conditions for the Eritrean population in Asmara were bad. The locals‚Äô quarters were completely neglected in the plans of the architects and city planners. There are no avant-garde buildings erected by the young aspirants of the 1930s; the roads remained unpaved and the connections to the electricity and water supply did not find their way into the neighborhoods in the northNothing has changed to this day.; there was no foundation for establishing an intact infrastructure for medical, educational, or sanitation facilities. The Italian population lived only a few meters away. By 1941 water connections and a sewer system were installed in the Europeans‚Äô zones. Medical infrastructure was secured, and people enjoyed strolling up and down the streets, which were lined with trees and plants, and always guarded by patrolling police. = Architectural Development under the Italian Regime = Cinema Impero (1930s) The Italian occupiers designed Asmara according to their ideas. So that they did not miss anything while in the East African colony, bars, restaurants, brothels and cinemas sprouted up all over the city. The high density of cinemas in Asmara is still as impressive today as it was back then. At the end of the 1930s, numerous cinemas had been built, all within the shortest possible timeframe, including Cinema Impero (1937), Cinema Capitol (1938), Cinema Roma (1937) and Cinema Odeon (1937). All of these cinemas were accessible exclusively to Europeans. However, locals were also to have their own cinema. In 1936, the architect Inginio Marabelli built Cinema Hamasien in the city‚Äôs northern zone.Denison et al.: Asmara ‚Äì Africa‚Äôs Secret Modernist City, pg. 62 Over time, the number of leisure activities meant to entertain the colonial masters increased exponentially. There were golf courses, tennis clubs, soccer tournaments, bicycle racing clubs, and motorsport events. Fiat Tagliero petrol station in Asmara Motorsport events were held in Asmara for a reason. At the end of the 1930s, the number of Italian-made automobiles exported to Eritrea had exploded. Within a few years, the traffic volume in Asmara was higher than it was in Rome.Denison et al.: Asmara ‚Äì Africa‚Äôs Secret Modernist City, pg. 59 With approximately 50,000 cars in Asmara in 1938, there were officially enough for each Italian in the city to have one.Bodenschatz: St√§dtebau f√ºr Mussolini, pg. 376 In the years 1936-1938, 15,158 cars and 13,719 motorcycles from different manufacturers were delivered to East Africa. This constituted about a fifth of the auto industry‚Äôs total exports in 1938, and in 1937, about half.Bader: Faschistische Moderne in Afrika ‚Äì Auto und Architektur in Asmara. In: F√ºr den Faschismus bauen, pg. 365 The automotive industry flourished in Asmara. Not only did the number of domestic car imports grow steadily in Italy, automobile companies themselves built prestigious branches in the Eritrean highlands to improve their image and sales as well. In the 1930s, for example, these automobile companies commissioned architects to design their representative offices in Asmara. Oftentimes, unknown architects and engineers were planning and constructing state-of-the-art buildings for the most important automobile companies in the world. Among the clients were Agip, Pirelli, Alfa Romeo, Lancia, and, of course, Fiat. Even the leading automobile club in Italy, RACI, opened a branch in the Eritrean capital to attract new members from the growing group of citizens with cars. The use of avant-garde architecture was a convenient means through which to attract the attention of potential car buyers, and the colony in East Africa offered the most ideal conditions for creating such striking structures. In Italy, architects had to tolerate the limitations of old building structures. In Asmara, on the other hand, the designers had no specific restrictions. Far from the what the motherland was able to provide, Eritrea offered the best conditions for innovative and experimental architecture. It is not the case that Asmara consists only of buildings commissioned by Mussolini or his governors. It is true, however, that all town measures, including development plans, were always managed by the occupying regime, which included what was possible and permissible in terms of building development. In reality, private individuals and, above all, industry, owned a large share of the city, including many individual buildings that still characterize the cityscape of Asmara to this day. Built in 1938, the Fiat Tagliero petrol station is a particularly impressive building in the capital city, and is perhaps the most famous. Designed by Italian architect Giuseppe Pettazzi, the gas station takes the form of an airplane with its 30-meter-long, cantilevered, tapered concrete wings, which extend from a tower-like central structure. The aircraft was an important symbol for the futurists at this time because it symbolized progress and speed. Frequently, architects used the symbolism of the airplane to demonstrate how superiority was achieved through progress.Bader: Faschistische Moderne in Afrika ‚Äì Auto und Architektur in Asmara. In: F√ºr den Faschismus bauen, pg. 361 Buildings that were meant to symbolize the progress of the time were the Shell Service Station (1937), which is reminiscent of a passing vessel with its porthole- shaped windows and its curves, or the Bar Zilli building, which is shaped like a radio from the thirties. From the main entrance, the same number of windows and doors appear at regular intervals, distributed in perfect symmetry. The round windows are meant to remind onlookers of radio knobs. Another one of Asmara‚Äôs symbolic buildings is the former headquarters of the Fascist Party; today it houses the Ministry of Education. The house looks like an ‚ÄúF‚Äù lying on its back. This was no coincidence, as the ‚ÄúF‚Äù in this case stood for Fascismo. Time and again, the Italian architects designed buildings that stood for progress. Unlike in Italy or in Nazi Germany, there were no over-sized monumental buildings constructed in Asmara. Nevertheless, the architectural styles and currents of the time are very present, and by taking a look at the context in which these buildings were constructed, the fascist ideology is also reflected in the present-day city landscape. In this demonstrative way, the modern was vividly juxtaposed with the unmodern, symbolizing the so-called superiority of the Italians over the Eritreans. Unlike Hitler, Mussolini was open to modern architecture. He had a passion for speed, automobiles, and airplanes, which is reflected in many of Asmara‚Äôs buildings. Mussolini stood for classical tradition and, simultaneously, for modernism as it was conceived of by futurists and rationalists.Ernesto Galli Della Loggia, Der Marsch auf Rom In the years between 1935 and 1941, numerous buildings in the styles of Rationalismo and Novecento were erected within a area, and although many others were planned, they would never be realized. The buildings ranged from small, one-story apartments to giant high-rise office buildings.Denison et al.: Asmara ‚Äì Africa‚Äôs Secret Modernist City, pg. 63 About 10 years after Gruppo 7 had outlined its basic principles for reforming Italian architecture in La Rassegna Italiana magazine, numerous buildings were built in Asmara according to these specifications. The group‚Äôs principles were based on the idea that architecture had to be rational and reduced to simple forms, and that all architectural ornamentation had to be renounced.Bader: F√ºr den Faschismus bauen, pg. 366 Piazza Roma in Asmara (1930s) In addition to numerous buildings, the colonial administration also built roads and squares, which were also supposed to represent the fascist regime and its power over the Eritrean population. The Viale Mussolini (today Harnet Avenue), the Piazza Roma (today Post Square) and the Viale de Bono (today Semeatat Boulevard) were built to unite the masses and to display the power of the occupiers in the form of festivals, parades and marches.Denison et al.: Asmara ‚Äì Africa‚Äôs Secret Modernist City, pg. 61 With its administrative buildings, the Cinema Impero, the theater, St. Joseph's Cathedral, high-rise apartment buildings, and numerous bars and shops, Viale Mussolini was the center of the city. As the day faded into the night, Viale Mussolini was used as a promenade ‚Äì the so-called Passeggiata. Italians walked up and down the street without any particular aim.The ‚ÄúPasseggiata‚Äù, that is, ‚Äúthe strolling‚Äù, was a pastime passed on to the Asmarinos by the Italians, and is still celebrated in the evening hours on today's Harnet Avenue The indigenous population, however, had no access to the palm-lined boulevard during the day or at night. The idea that Asmara would continue to grow steadily was not in question; more and more Italians were moving to the Eritrean highlands. In 1939, 98,000 people were already living in Asmara. Of these, 53,000 were Italians and 45,000 were Eritrean.Mattioli: Unterwegs zu einer imperialen Raumordnung in Italienisch- Ostafrika. In: F√ºr den Faschismus bauen, pg. 347 At the end of the 1930s, the population of Italians living in Asmara peaked around 70,000.Denison et al.: Asmara ‚Äì Africa‚Äôs Secret Modernist City, pg. 55 However, growth would soon come to a screeching halt. During the Second World War, the Great Powers, Italy and the UK, fought battles all across Eritrea. After a nearly one-year- long military operation, Mussolini's troops were finally defeated by the British in 1941. Until the fall of his Empire, Mussolini had never before set foot in Italy‚Äôs small colony on the Horn of Africa. The British must have been very impressed by this European city in Africa. After the capture of Asmara, the British Information Ministry reported that they had conquered a European city with extensive boulevards, fantastic cinemas, outstanding fascist buildings, cafes, shops, two-laned streets, and a first-class hotel. With the British takeover, the compulsive need to build in the Eritrean capital came to an abrupt end. To this day an outstanding and perhaps unique collection of modern buildings gives impressive insight into the world of Italian modernist architecture of the 1920s and 1930s. In particular, the avant-garde buildings, which were created between 1935 and 1941 and were designed and realized according to rationalist principles, are looking for their equals across the world. But equally important for the time of the Duce was the policy of racial segregation, especially in Asmara, which was refined in the urban development plans and which led to a complete separation of natives and occupiers by the end of the 1930s.  British Military Administration (1941-1952)  = Asmara under the BMA = On April 1, 1941, after the Allies‚Äô victory in Eritrea, Italy was forced to awaken from the dream of having the ideal colony in East Africa, which was already taking shape in Asmara. A transitional administration under British control was established immediately to organize the former colony. As the Second World War came to a close, this administration was renamed the British Military Administration (BMA). The task of officials in the BMA was to oversee the transition of the Italian colony to an undefined political entity. The British occupation did not bring about any significant changes in the construction of cities nor in the architecture of Asmara, but it did mean the beginning of the struggle for independence for the Eritrean people, which was to last 50 years. It would have a decisive impact on the identity of the Asmarinos, especially regarding their relationship to the Italian colonial period, and to a lesser degree on the structural form of Asmara. The British Empire had no interest in managing the country as a separate colony, and instead spoke of the \\"Eritrean eradication\\".Almedom: Re- reading the Short and Long-Rigged History of Eritrea 1941‚Äì1952: Back to the Future?, pg. 110 The land of the Eritreans was to be divided and distributed to other countries. The highlands, whose population was only referred to as the ‚ÄúAbyssinians‚Äù ‚Äì with the same term they used to refer to the Ethiopians ‚Äì was to be incorporated into British Sudan, while the lowlands, which the British simply said to be ‚Äúinhabited by Muslims‚Äù, would be given to Ethiopia.Almedom: Re-reading the Short and Long-Rigged History of Eritrea 1941‚Äì1952: Back to the Future?, pg. 120 It was as a result of these designations that the chief commander of the East Africa Command wanted only to provide 19 military officers to the administration of Eritrea, including Brigadier General Kennedy-Cooke, eight British officers including Major J K Harvey, and nine Sudanese police officers. Major Harvey was Chief Custodian of Enemy Property and was one of the few Officers of the British Army to be the recipient of an illuminated address from the people on the enemy side.This tribute he received at the close of a distinguished career in Eritrea. Trevaskis: A Colony in Transition: 1941‚Äì52. Quoted in: Almedom: Re-reading the Short and Long-Rigged History of Eritrea 1941‚Äì1952: Back to the Future?, pg. 112 Since the British were still in the middle of the war and resources were needed in other places, the Italian administrators, who had for the most part not left Asmara, decided to continue to manage the country ‚Äì now under the supervision of the British. All departments except the police were left to the Italians. Through the use of anti-fascist propaganda, an agreement was made with the Italian population, which consisted of approximately 60,000 people suffering from food and water shortages.Rodwell: Conservation and Development in a Historic City, pg. 8 The 100,000 Eritreans in Asmara suffered from the same shortages, lived under poorer sanitary and building conditions, and had to accept displaced people from all over Eritrea, but were hardly supported by the BMA.Tesfagiorgis: Eritrea ‚Äì Africa in Focus, pg. 55 At the beginning of the 1940s the Askari, who had supported the Italian war in Somalia and Libya, returned.Chelati Dirar: From warriors to urban dwellers: Ascari and the military factor in the urban development of colonial Eritrea, pg. 175 The disrespect for the Eritrean population was demonstrated in part by the deployment of the divide et impera [divide and conquer] strategy. The traditional system rooted in an understanding of the importance of citizen participation, which to a certain extent had survived the Italian colonial era, was undermined by the BMA.Tesfagiorgis: Eritrea ‚Äì Africa in Focus, pg. 56 Political divisions were encouraged in order to prevent the population from engaging in decision-making processes. In Tessenei, for example, while political groups were allowed to meet separately, a conference aimed at discussing the future of the region open to all groups was strictly prohibited.Almedom: Re-reading the Short and Long-Rigged History of Eritrea 1941‚Äì1952: Back to the Future?, pg. 124 The British administration implemented a policy aimed at rigorously dismantling the country, before handing Eritrea over to Ethiopia, during which it systematically sold manufacturers and their equipment off, sending them abroad or to other British colonies. Among other things, the dry docks in Massawa, a cement factory in Massawa, the Gura airport, the Massawa-Asmara funicular railroad, and parts of the railroad line from Massawa to Asmara were dismantled and shipped to Sudan, Egypt and India. A statement from the terrified council of elders of the former industrial city of Decamhare reads: ‚Äúthe English did not leave behind even pins, not even needles from our factories, they took away everything.‚ÄùAlmedom: Re-reading the Short and Long-Rigged History of Eritrea 1941‚Äì1952: Back to the Future?, pg. 129 Despite this loss of valuable industrial faculties, Asmara retained its importance as a commercial center. = Abolishing Racial Segregation in Asmara = Among the British, racial separation was at least partially abolished. A training program for civilian administration was offered to Eritreans for the first time, and the first Eritrean teachers' schools were set up. As a result, from 1943 onwards, schools were open and institutionalized education made accessible for local children at last.Denison: Eritrea, pg. 18 Under Italian rule, Eritrean children had been prohibited from attending elementary schools. For this reason, a secret school, which was hidden in the bell tower of the Protestant church, had been established.Denison et al.: Asmara ‚Äì Africa‚Äôs Secret Modernist City, pg. 73 By 1954, the British Administration had built over 100 schools for locals. In addition, an active public press that published in Tigrinya, Arabic, and English was launched. An outstanding example of how Italian racial segregation was overcome began on an early morning in 1943. Eritrean workers found no seats on a bus that was to take them from Asmara‚Äôs outskirts to work in the city center, and decided to take the places normally reserved for Italians. As those Italians who were running late began to arrive and find that their seats had been taken, they became outraged, and a fight broke out. The problem was ultimately brought to the British administrator. He stated that he could not initiate any changes as long as the Italian laws were still on the books, but suggested that the Eritreans organize their transport independently. Within a few days, the locals had collected enough money, bought a truck, and nailed benches to the truck bed. Due to a loss of business, the Italian owner of the bus had no choice but to sell his bus to the Eritreans. The Eritrean workers were now the proud owners of a bus and had free seats.This ancedote comes from Memher Yeshak, an Eritrean teacher, and is recounted and recorded in Denison et al.: Asmara ‚Äì Africa‚Äôs Secret Modernist City, pg. 73 = Repression by the BMA = With the end of the Second World War, Eritrea was experiencing a severe crisis that had led to rising unemployment. While the Italian population was supported by subsidies, the local population had to fight for survival. This meant that they were stuck trying to reclaim their lands which were formerly expropriated by the Italians and now managed by the British.Tesfagiorgis: Eritrea ‚Äì Africa in Focus, pg. 59 A deep resentment began to develop from the resulting anger within the indigenous community. In the eyes of the Eritreans, the British Military Administration was worse than the Italians, which they perceived as less duplicitous and sneaky.Almedom: Re-reading the Short and Long-Rigged History of Eritrea 1941‚Äì1952: Back to the Future?, pg. 116 The BMA seldom kept their promises and used the Eritreans, for example, by imposing high fines if Eritreans peacefully sought to use their right to expression; this led more and more frequently to the development of protests into riots. In 1946, Sudanese soldiers serving under British mandate massacred 70 Christian residents in the poor Abbu Shaul district. Rapid military intervention on the part of the British would have been the only way this tragedy could have been prevented.Almedom: Re-reading the Short and Long- Rigged History of Eritrea 1941‚Äì1952: Back to the Future?, pg. 124 At the funeral of the victims, Eritrean Bishop Markos laid an accusation against the British: > ‚ÄúWe AbyssiniansAccording to Almedom, the British translator incorrectly used > the term 'Abyssinians'. However, it is more likely that the bishop used > 'Eritreans'. had longed for the British to come and liberate us from [our] > Fascist yoke. We had trusted you to lead us to freedom.

The hope of liberation, which the Eritreans had once associated with the takeover of the British, gave way to disappointment. At the same time, Markos‚Äô words were those of a well-meaning Ethiopian. A long-standing desire for political change was palpable: \\"[...] most Eritreans (Christians and Muslims) were united in their goal of freedom and independence.\\"This quotation comes from the former head of the Eritrean Constitutional Committee Bereket Habte Selassie. (Habte Selassie: Eritrea and the United Nations) The voices of the local population were, however, split between separatists and supporters of reunification with Ethiopia. Separatist movements gained ground, however, according to a classified estimate by the US Department of State in August 1949, and about 75% of Eritreans supported independence.Merrill to US-Secretary of State: Telegram #171, August 22, 1949. Quoted in: Gebre-Medhin, Peasants and Nationalism in Eritrea, pg. 142 An Eritrean delegation to the UN General Assembly in 1952 noted that the ideas presented there regarding Eritrea‚Äôs future strongly suggested that Eritrea be given to the US-backed Ethiopia. Haile Selassie had already spent a lot of energy on building a positive relationship with the United States. In 1950, he had sent members of his own security service to support U.S. troops in the Korean War, and in the same year had signed a contract that would allow the U.S. to build a strategically- located military command center in Eritrea.Connell, Killion: A Historical Dictionary of Eritrea, pg. 526 The United States itself did not recognize Eritrea as a sovereign nation, instead saw it for its strategic value: ‚ÄúFrom the point of view of justice, the opinions of the Eritrean people must receive consideration. Nevertheless, the strategic interests of the United States in the Red Sea basin and considerations of security and world peace make it necessary that the country has to be linked with our ally, Ethiopia.‚ÄùHeiden: The Eritrean Struggle for Independence, pg. 15 Finally Ethiopia‚Äôs wish was fulfilled and Eritrea became an Ethiopian province.  Ethiopian Occupation and War (1952-1993)  = Asmara loses status as capital = Two assumptions have dominated the discussion about the relationship between Ethiopia and Eritrea over the past 70 years. First, during Haile Selassie‚Äôs regime, the Ethiopian people and the international community first became aware of the idea that Eritrea is a natural and logical part of Ethiopia. A common history, religion and culture, as well as the belief that Eritrea is Ethiopia's access to the sea, were ideas used to serve as support for this viewpoint. The second premise, supplemented by the first, is that Eritrea was economically weak and its survival was dependent on Ethiopian resources. The country had been cut off ethnically and linguistically, and was merely an \\"Italian creation without the conditions for a state.\\"Tesfai: The Cause of the Eritrean-Ethiopian Border Conflict Leading world powers like the United States and Great Britain supported this viewpoint in order to meet their own strategic needs, thereby leading the still relatively young UN in initiating a process of federation through which Eritrea would be subsumed under the Ethiopian crown. Thus, according to a federal act passed in 1952 in the United Nations, Eritrea was to be bound to Ethiopia as an autonomous region, despite the fact that this did not at all reflect the will of the people. Asmara had to give up its title as a capital, and subsequently sank slowly into provinciality in the years that followed. Referring to the question of Eritrea's federation with Ethiopia, journalist John Gunter noted in 1955 that \\"a joke of the period said that the solution finally adopted was 'a Bolivian concept of a Swiss federation adapted to an African absolute monarchy,'\\" in reference to the Bolivian United Nations commissioner Eduardo Anze Mateinzo. Though Asmara did not undergo any noteworthy changes to its appearance during Ethiopian occupation, the shift in how Eritreans understood their identity was dramatic as they struggled under new foreign rule. The almost 40 years from 1952 to independence in 1991 were decisive in terms of understanding what is happening with policy in Eritrea today, and thus also for dealing with the country‚Äôs legacy. Ethiopia has consistently interpreted Federalism in ways that have benefited itself. The Ethiopian state did not leave Eritrea any room for development, although according to the Eritrean Pact, the responsibilities of each of the three branches of government in the separation of powers model were to be carried out independently.Negash: Eritrea and Ethiopia - The Federal Experience, pg. 188 The President of the Eritrean National Council, Ali Redai, filed a complaint against the British Consul: \\"Ethiopians never answered letters, never gave answers to specific queries, and in fact ignored the Eritrean government.\\" Almost all of the administrative bodies and offices were occupied by Ethiopian officials and the Ethiopian military was reportedly in Eritrea for security reasons.Yared: Resistance of our people living under the enemy Customs, postal, telecommunications, railway, defense, justice, and transportation operations were all run by Ethiopians - most of them inefficiently.Negash: Eritrea and Ethiopia - The Federal Experience, pg. 89 = Stagnation in Urban Development = Government officials in Addis Abeba constantly introduced ever-stricter laws. Eritrean political parties were banned, the Eritreans were prohibited from collecting their portion of customs and tax earnings, and Eritrean newspapers were censored.Tesfagiorgis: Eritrea ‚Äì Africa in Focus, pg. 66 While the early years of the Selassie regime saw some significant developments in Asmara, such as the construction of churches, mosques, schools, and hospitals, later a lack of investment and a decline in industrial activities led to the stagnation of urban development in the city.Denison et al.: Asmara ‚Äì Africa‚Äôs Secret Modernist City, pg. 74 The few industries remaining after the retreat of the British were dismantled and relocated to Addis Abeba to ensure that every economic capacity of the country was undermined. In 1959, native languages Tigrinya and Arabic were forbidden as instructional languages in schools and universities, and instead Amharic was introduced; for many Eritreans, this meant that making any progress in their education had become impossible.Denison: Eritrea, pg. 5 Student protests and boycotts called by civil officials and factory workers were answered by the Ethiopian police with increasing violence. A general strike in 1958 left many dead and injured, and in other protests Eritreans were arrested or forced into exile. Appeals to the United Nations were ignored.Tesfagiorgis: Eritrea ‚Äì Africa in Focus, pg. 60 The change of the road names in Asmara also had a significant impact on the city‚Äôs identity. In honor of a visit by the British Queen in 1965, Haile Selassie renamed Viale de Bono, now Nakfa Avenue, Queen Elizabeth II Avenue. The central Corso Italia, today Harnet Avenue, which was still called Viale Benito Mussolini before the British occupation, was renamed Haile Selassie I Boulevard. Almost all of Asmara‚Äôs street names were changed during Ethiopian occupation in order to repress the memory of the Italian past and to establish Ethiopian authority in regard to the city‚Äôs identity itself.Denison et al.: Asmara ‚Äì Africa‚Äôs Secret Modernist City, pg. 74 = Annexation by Ethiopia and Emerging Resistance Movement = View of Asmara Haile Selassie, in an open policy, did not hide the fact that Ethiopia \\"is interested in the country and not in the people of Eritrea\\"Abbay: Identity Jilted or Re-imagining Identity?, pg. 209, especially with regard to Muslim communities, whose villages were systematically burnt down by Ethiopian troops, and whose inhabitants were massacred throughout the 1950s, 1960s, and during the first half of the 1970s.Killion, Connell: Historical Dictionary of Eritrea, pg. 270 Haile Selassie dissolved Eritrea‚Äôs autonomy bit by bit, for example, through the demotion of the autonomous government to a mere administrative body in 1960. Two years later, with the United Nations' approval, Ethiopia decided to ultimately end the federation. Through the besiegement of Asmara, Ethiopia forced the Eritrean parliament to dissolve itself completelyNegash: Eritrea and Ethiopia - The Federal Experience, pg. 143, and subsequently annexed the whole of Eritrea. Soon after, Eritrean opposition leaders came to the conclusion that the only hope of resisting Ethiopian rule lay in armed struggle. In 1974, when Haile Selassie was overthrown, the resistance movement was fighting not only a daring guerrilla war against the Ethiopian army, but also a bitter internal struggle. The movement had long since broken apart into hostile factions, mostly because of differing political views. The Eritrean People's Liberation Front (EPLF), which was founded around 1970, finally succeeded in recruiting many former enemy fighters. Fighters‚Äô passion was for the war of independence and less so for handling the movement‚Äôs internal conflicts, so the fragmentation had no lasting effect on the unity of the Eritreans. The central strength of the resistance‚Äôs struggle for independence was the active encouragement of members from all religious communities associated with the movement to participate.Denison: Eritrea, pg. 18 In the meantime, the Derg, the Ethiopian military junta from 1974 to 1987, had a similar Eritrean policy as its predecessor, Haile Selassie, though with much more brutal means and the support of the Soviets, Cubans and East Germans. Asmara was transformed from an attractive city into a largely isolated military camp through what was known as the \\"Red Terror\\". Ethiopian army divisions occupied entire districts, displacing inhabitants.Tesfagiorgios: Eritrea ‚Äì Africa in Focus, pg. 66 Italian buildings were turned into prisons. Yet, Asmara's importance as a trade center grew and, contrary to all expectations, was left almost unscathed. Building activity in Asmara even recovered slowly, with the construction of individual high-rise buildings, as well as an expansion of the city administration building and the Ambassador Hotel located on present-day Harnet Avenue.Denison: Eritrea, pg. 85 Perhaps it was the limitations on urban development during this period that ultimately saved Asmara‚Äôs character. Particularly noteworthy is the monumental stadium on Bahti-Meskerem Square at the eastern end of Harnet Avenue. The monstrous concrete terraces were originally supposed to stand on both sides of the square to allow room for the communist rulers‚Äô political and military to take place. However, only one part has been completedDenison: Eritrea, pg. 108, so that today there is mostly just a barren landscape - an appropriate memorial to the iron-fisted Derg regime. = End of Ethiopian Occupation = Towards the end of the 1980s, the Soviet Union decided against extending the cooperation agreement with Ethiopia. Without the resources of the Soviet Union, and due to a drought and simultaneous economic crisis in both countries, the morale of Ethiopian soldiers fell. Many of them served as mercenaries without real conviction for the fight against the Eritrean resistance, which allowed members of the sworn EPLF to edge their way into Ethiopian positions. In May 1991, under the pressure of the Ethiopian opposition the Derg regime finally fell. EPLF talks with the Ethiopian Transitional Government were successful, thereby allowing Eritrea to hold a referendum on its independence. The overwhelming majority, 99.83% of Eritrean people, voted for their country‚Äôs independenceTesfagiorgis: Eritrea ‚Äì Africa in Focus, pg. 73, and on May 24, 1993 Eritrea was declared an independent country. A new parliament was established and then elected Isayas Afewerki, prominent head of the EPLF, as president. Monument to independence fighters in Asmara The armed conflict between Ethiopia and Eritrea lasted for almost 30 years. It is a remarkable history of human resistance on the one hand, and of terrible loss suffered by two of the world's poorest countries, on the other. The Eritrean people, themselves the product of a compulsory unification carried out by an outside power, fought, for the most part, alone against the statistically superior and better equipped Ethiopian armyDenison: Eritrea, pg. 33, while both Ethiopian regimes were ready to do their own as well as the Americans‚Äô and the Soviets‚Äô bidding in the most brutal ways, at least until the fall of Haile Selassie. What made this conflict even more destructive was that the Eritreans fought each other during the war for a long time. Unified in the desire to gain control over their own country, however, they were able to create a coherent ideological framework within a short period of time. Considering the fact that Eritrea is a land of unequal tribes, three religions, and both urban and nomadic cultures, the successful outcome of the war, the unification of its many diverse people, and the declaration of the country‚Äôs independence, were all tremendous achievements. And with the coronation, regarded by some as the ultimate paradox of war and by others simply as a miracle, Eritreans‚Äô capital, Asmara, survived the many years of warfare almost entirely unscathed. Its inhabitants today still reaffirm the unifying aim of the struggle: ‚ÄúAsmara is what we fought for.‚ÄùFuller: Italy's Colonial Futures: Colonial Inertia and Postcolonial Capital in Asmara, pg. 8  Post-Independence Asmara (1993-Today)  = Post-War Asmara = More than 50 years had passed since the last time Italian planners were given free reign to explore their creative drives. Almost 10 years under British occupation and another 10 years in a repressive federation with Ethiopia followed 30 years of bloody fighting, at the end of which the country would be freed of foreign domination. Asmara remained standing, having seen little fighting within its city limits. Afterwards, however, the city was in a state of deterioration and chaos: > ‚ÄúScenes of boys and girls carrying barrels of water on improvised carts, > military ramparts on top of apartment buildings, and bricked-up windows with > broken glass and barbed wire fortifying residences facing the street are > still vivid in the minds of residents of Asmara. The euphoria of victory did > not remove the foul smell from clogged sewage, and the many beggar women and > children indicated widespread poverty. Many colourless, decaying buildings > attested to the neglect and destruction of the years of Ethiopian > occupation. The basic infrastructure of Asmara was largely in need of a > complete overhaul.‚ÄùDenison et al.: Asmara ‚Äì Africa‚Äôs Secret Modernist City, > pg. 76 It was a picture with scenes of joy about the country‚Äôs newly-acquired sovereignty and, at the same time, scenes of a city‚Äôs degeneration. The fact that no intensive fighting had taken place in Asmara, could not prevent the city‚Äôs utter breakdown. Moreover, the already ruinous state of the city could not be overcome during the course of the war after the dismantling policy of British and Ethiopian occupation. Eritreans queuing at petrol station due to rationing = Return as political capital = The population increased due to a flood of refugees arriving from rural regions, as well as the return of many from the diaspora. Asmara, newly renamed the capital, became the political heart of Eritrea once again. During the years that followed, Eritrea experienced an economic upturn and countless investments that, together with its renewed function as the capital, led to the city‚Äôs dramatic growth. While the pattern in many other African cities saw a rise in poor and illegal settlements, Asmara‚Äôs development could be relatively controlled. Enormous challenges lay ahead; perhaps above all else, inhabitants of Asmara faced the problem of accessing clean drinking water, and of the lack of an adequate sewage system, as the infrastructure was still mostly in ruins following the long war. A strong desire for self-driven development after decades of foreign rule gave rise to a debate about the colonial legacy of Asmara‚Äôs architecture. It is important to note here that for the first time ‚Äì and this was 50 years after the end of Italian occupation ‚Äì that Asmara‚Äôs city center was recognized as having a legacy at all. Although it could have been expected that the modern architecture left behind by the Italians would be perceived as a symbol of an imposing foreign culture, it was more often the case that people saw it as a reminder of the turbulent history of the country. Asmara‚Äôs citizens fought for the preservation of the old buildings they saw as monuments, instead of trying to erase the history of foreign rule through demolition and reconstruction. Subsequently, the construction of a four-floor office building at the site of Caserma Mussolini across from the catholic cathedral was thwarted through a citizen initiative, and the barracks were spared.Denison et al.: Asmara ‚Äì Africa‚Äôs Secret Modernist City, pg. 54 = Preservation of the city = There was awareness that Asmara‚Äôs city center should be preserved, but at the same time, it needed to serve the community‚Äôs economic, social and political needs. In 1997, the Eritrean government established the Cultural Assets Rehabilitation Project (CARP) under the strategic direction of the World Bank, to coordinate the preservation and rehabilitation of cultural goods, especially Asmara‚Äôs architecture. Through CARP, a survey was conducted, and in 2001 an historic city center, an area of approximately 4km2, was identified and placed under protection. The hope was that this unique urban area could be protected by persuasively articulating its legacy, by proposing ways to ensure its preservation, and by paying close attention to maintaining the buildings‚Äô integrity, and thus the area would be added to the list of protected UNESCO World Heritage Sites. In the hope of making the city more accessible to tourists in the future, a map of Asmara was developed, today still the only official map of the city. In addition, the authors of the CARP independently published a book called Asmara: Africa‚Äôs Secret Modernist City, which provides an overview of the development of the modern city and its buildings. The book was published in 2003, and has inspired increased worldwide interest in Asmara and its architecture, which has been satisfied quite often through exhibits meant to expand upon the book‚Äôs contents. The project failed, however, and was abandoned by the government early on. Due to an unexpected political shift, Eritrea is now slipping deeper and deeper into a dictatorial and patriarchal state system, in the center of which is President Isayas Afewerki, surrounded by other autocratic leaders with vested interests in holding onto power. Although the first steps towards democratization were made in the mid-1990s, including economic reforms and the formulation of a constitution, today it seems as if all of this had been done in order to legitimize the actions of the political elite.Ogbazghi: Personal Rule in Africa: The Case of Eritrea, pg. 6 Bereket Habte Selassie, a former member of the Eritrean Constitutional Committee, has also criticized this abrupt change in the trajectory of Eritrea‚Äôs politics: ‚ÄúIt seems to me [that] the rule of law has gone to the dogs in Eritrea. There was a very good beginning, a very promising beginning. We all hailed Isaias [sic] Afewerki and his colleagues in creating an enabling environment to lead to democracy and we were waiting for that when he and his group ‚Äì in my view ‚Äì hijacked the constitution.‚ÄùQuoted in: Ogbazghi: Personal Rule in Africa: The Case of Eritrea, pg. 6 Eritrea still does not have a viable constitution. Since the border war of 1998-2000 with Ethiopia, Eritrea has been in an official state of emergency, its citizens effectively living under Martial Law. The political elites‚Äô control of the nation has far-reaching consequences, such as the repudiation of freedom of speech, of assembly, and of the press. The Washington Post published an article saying, ‚ÄúWhile striving to be an egalitarian, self-reliant utopia, Eritrea has become the most unapologetically repressive country on earth.‚ÄùMcCrummen: As thousands flee regime, Eritrea would go it alone The population is faced with a steady political and cultural indoctrination, relying upon the rhetoric of nationalism and devoted to the idea of its superiority over Ethiopia.Ogbazghi: Personal Rule in Africa: The Case of Eritrea, pg. 5 A state-controlled economy that encompasses agriculture, industry and construction, is heavily dependent on the recruitment of conscripts who serve in national service, often for life. Asmara Market (2013) = Financial support for the urban historic core = In addition, Afewerki has introduced a strict policy of self-sufficiency. Under the pretext that Eritrea has historically refused to fall victim to the strategic desires of other nations, which is an idea that is not totally unfounded, Afewerki rejects any kind of help from abroad. In 2007 alone, the President turned down 200 million dollars meant to aide in the country‚Äôs relief efforts.Sanders: Struggling Eritrea puts Self-Reliance Before Aid This has fatal consequences when it comes to caring for Asmara‚Äôs heritage, something one of the poorest nations in the world cannot do alone. As mentioned above, the CARP, with its $5 million budget allotted by the World Bank, was abandoned. Another project with the purpose of renewing Asmara‚Äôs city center, this time sponsored by the European Union, together with other EU aid programs were accounted for in 2011.Berhane: A Week in the Horn of Africa Other programs aimed at preserving Asmara‚Äôs city center are not on the table at the moment, and it is difficult to imagine that Afewerki will bypass his tendency toward isolationism and accept the necessary financial and technical assistance from abroad that could revive such programs. It is difficult to say whether Asmara had more hope for improvement under the rule of its oppressive archenemy, Ethiopia, or if anything can be said of hope at all under its current dictator. In 2017, the historical core of Asmara was finally included on the UNESCO World Heritage List.  See also  * Asmara * Timeline of Asmara * History of Eritrea  References   Bibliography  * Abbay, A.

Byrd after the U.S. Supreme Court decisions in Brown v. Board of Education. Early and family life Hutcheson was born in Boydton, Virginia to Herbert Farrar Hutcheson (1869-1934, the clerk of the Mecklenburg County and a former state delegate as well as farmer and justice of the peace) and his wife, the former Mary Young. Joseph was named after his grandfather, a substantial landowner and justice of the peace, but who failed his one attempt at election to the Virginia General Assembly. Three of his six brothers also became lawyers; the family also included Mildred Alice Hutcheson (1908-1940).https://www.findagrave.com/memorial/75194501 After graduating from Boydton High School, Hutcheson attended the Virginia Episcopal School in Lynchburg, then went to the University of Virginia in Charlottesville. He received an undergraduate degree, then a law degree in 1930, having passed the Virginia bar exam the previous year. He never married. Hutcheson served in the U.S. Navy in World War II, and then the U.S. Naval Reserve. One branch of the family moved to Houston, Texas after the American Civil War, so he is related to Judge Joseph Chappell Hutcheson. Political career Upon returning from his wartime service, Hutcheson was elected mayor of Lawrenceville, Virginia, and served from September 1, 1946 until December 31, 1947. In 1947, he was elected Commonwealth's Attorney for Brunswick County, Virginia, and served for a decade, including a term as president of the Commonwealth's Attorney Association.legislative bio When Albertis Harrison was elected Attorney General, Hutcheson ran for the vacant seat and was elected and re-elected three times. This was a part-time position, and he also had a private legal practice with Larry N. Jones. However, his district's boundaries and number changed, both as a result of the Massive Resistance controversy engulfing Virginia, as well as reapportionments necessitated by census changes, the Voting Rights Act of 1965 and U.S. Supreme Court decisions (especially Davis v. Mann in 1963). In 1957 and 1961, District 7 encompassed Brunswick, Lunenburg and Mecklenburg Counties. For the 1965 election, the city of Petersburg, Virginia and Dinwiddie County were added to the district and Lunenberg county moved into the 4th senatorial district. Major restructuring after the 1970 census for the 1971 elections moved Petersburg into the 16th district and Dinwiddie county into the 15th district; Brunswick, Lunenburg, Mecklenburg counties were combined with Amelia, Cumberland, Powhatan and Chesterfield Counties as the 17th District.Cynthia Miller Leonard (ed), The General Assembly of Virginia, 1619-1978: A Bicentennial Register of Members (Richmond: Virginia State Library 1978) at pp. 722, 727, 733, 739, 744, 750, 756, 763 James T.

Prehistory A small anthropomorphic stele discovered during an archaeological excavation on the Rocher des Doms The site of Avignon has been occupied since the Neolithic period as shown by excavations at Rocher des Doms and the Balance district.Tell me about Avignon, Towens and Country of Art and history, Ministry of Culture, consulted on 17 October 2011 In 1960 and 1961 excavations in the northern part of the Rocher des Doms directed by Sylvain Gagni√®re uncovered a small anthropomorphic stele (height: 20 cm), which was found in an area of land being reworked. Carved in Burdigalian sandstone, it has the shape of a \\"tombstone\\" with its face engraved with a highly stylized human figure with no mouth and whose eyes are marked by small cavities. On the bottom, shifted slightly to the right is a deep indentation with eight radiating lines forming a solar representation - a unique discovery for this type of stele. Compared to other similar solar figures this stele representing the \\"first Avignonnais\\" and comes from the time period between the Copper Age and the Early Bronze Age which is called the southern Chalcolithic. This was confirmed by other findings made in this excavation near the large water reservoir on top of the rock where two polished greenstone axes were discovered, a lithic industry characteristic of \\"shepherds of the plateaux\\". There were also some Chalcolithic objects for adornment and an abundance of Hallstatt pottery shards which could have been native or imported (Ionian or Phocaean). Antiquity Greek stele from Avignon, at the Lapidary Museum. Roman remains from the 1st century, behind the Palais des papes The name of the city dates back to around the 6th century BC. The first citation of Avignon (Aouen(n)ion) was made by Artemidorus of Ephesus. Although his book, The Journey, is lost it is known from the abstract by Marcian of Heraclea and The Ethnics, a dictionary of names of cities by Stephanus of Byzantium based on that book. He said: \\"The City of Massalia (Marseille), near the Rhone, the ethnic name (name from the inhabitants) is Avenionsios (Avenionensis) according to the local name (in Latin) and Auenionit√®s according to the Greek expression\\".√âtienne de Byzance, The Ethnics in summary, Aug. Meineke, Berlin, 1849 This name has two interpretations: \\"city of violent wind\\" or, more likely, \\"lord of the river\\". The Celtic tribes named it Auoention around the beginning of the Christian Era. Other sources trace its origin to the Gallic mignon (\\"marshes\\") and the Celtic definitive article.History of the origin of the name, Avignon official website, consulted on 17 October 2011 Roman forum of Avignon, currently the Place de l'Horloge Avignon was a simple Greek Emporium founded by Phocaeans from Marseille around 539 BC. It was in the 4th century BC that the Massaliotes (people from Marseilles) began to sign treaties of alliance with some cities in the Rhone valley including Avignon and Cavaillon. A century later Avignon was part of the \\"region of Massaliotes\\" or \\"country of Massalia\\". Fortified on its rock, the city later became and long remained the capital of the Cavares.Pliny the Elder in his Naturalis Historia and Pomponius Mela in his Of Choregraphia depicted Avignon as the capital of Cavares. With the arrival of the Roman legions in 120 BC. the Cavares, allies with the Massaliotes, became Roman. Under the domination of the Roman Empire, Aouenion became Avennio and was now part of Gallia Narbonensis (118 BC.), the first Transalpine province of the Roman Empire. Very little from this period remains (a few fragments of the forum near Rue Moli√®re). It later became part of the 2nd Viennoise. Avignon remained a \\"federated city\\" with Marseille until the conquest of Marseille by Trebonius and Decimus Junius Brutus Albinus, Caesar's lieutenants. It became a city of Roman law in 49 BC.The Origins of Avignon, horizon-provence website, consulted on 17 October 2011 It acquired the status of Roman colony in 43 BC. Pomponius Mela placed it among the most flourishing cities of the province.Pomponius Mela, Description of the World, Book II, V. Over the years 121 and 122 the Emperor Hadrian stayed in the Province where he visited Vaison, Orange, Apt, and Avignon. He gave Avignon the status of a Roman colony: \\"Colonia Julia Hadriana Avenniensis\\" and its citizens were enrolled in the tribu.French article on the Tribu Following the passage of Maximian, who was fighting the Bagaudes, the Gallic peasants revolted. The first wooden bridge was built over the Rhone linking Avignon to the right bank. It has been dated by dendrochronology to the year 290. In the 3rd century there was a small Christian community outside the walls around what was to become the Abbey of Saint-Ruf. Early Middle Ages The historical town centre bounded by its ramparts Although the date of the Christianization of the city is not known with certainty, it is known that the first evangelizers and prelates were within the hagiographic tradition which is attested by the participation of Nectarius, the first historical Bishop of Avignon on 29 November 439, in the regional council in the Cathedral of Riez assisted by the 13 bishops of the three provinces of Arles. The memory of St. Eucherius still clings to three vast caves near the village of Beaumont whither, it is said, the people of Lyon had to go in search of him in 434 when they sought him to make him their archbishop. In November 441 Nectarius of Avignon, accompanied by his deacon Fontidius, participated in the Council of Orange convened and chaired by Hilary of Arles where the Council Fathers defined the right of asylum. In the following year, together with his assistants Fonteius and Saturninus, he was at the first Council of Vaison with 17 bishops representing the Seven Provinces. He died in 455. Clovis, King of the Franks, laid siege to Avignon in 500. Invasions began and during the inroads of the Goths it was heavily damaged. In 472 Avignon was sacked by the Burgundians and replenished by the Patiens, from the city of Lyon, who sent them wheat. In 500 Clovis I, King of the Franks, attacked Gundobad, King of the Burgundians who was accused of the murder of the father of his wife Clotilde. Beaten, Gondebaud left Lyon and took refuge in Avignon with Clovis besieging it. Gregory of Tours reported that the Frankish king devastated the fields, cut down the vines and olive trees, and destroyed the orchards. The Burgundian was saved by the intervention of the Roman General Aredius. He had called him to his aid against the \\"Frankish barbarians\\" who ruined the countryside. In 536 Avignon, following the fate of Provence, was ceded to the Merovingians by Vitiges, the new king of the Ostrogoths. Chlothar I annexed Avignon, Orange, Carpentras, and Gap; Childebert I took Arles and Marseilles; Theudebert I took Aix, Apt, Digne, and Glandev√®s. The Emperor Justinian I at Constantinople approved the division. Despite all the invasions, intellectual life continued to flourish on the banks of the Rh√¥ne. Gregory of Tours noted that after the death of Bishop Antoninus in 561 the Parisian Father Dommole refused the bishopric of Avignon after Chlothar I convinced him that it would be ridiculous \\"in the middle of tired senators, sophists, and philosophical judges\\" St. Magnus was a Gallo-Roman senator who became a monk and then bishop of the city. His son, St. Agricol (Agricolus), bishop between 650 and 700, is the patron saint of Avignon. The 7th and 8th centuries were the darkest period in the history of Avignon. The city became the prey of the Franks under Thierry II (Theodoric), King of Austrasia in 612. The Council of Chalon-sur-Sa√¥ne in 650 was the last to indicate the Episcopal participation of the Provence dioceses. In Avignon there would be no bishop for 205 years with the last known holder being Agricola. In 734 it fell into the hands of the Saracens, and it was destroyed in 737 by the Franks under Charles Martel for having sided with the Saracens against him. A centralized government was put in place and, in 879, the bishop of Avignon, Ratfred, with other Proven√ßal colleagues, went to the Synod of Mantaille in Viennois where Boso was elected King of Provence after the death of Louis the Stammerer. The Rh√¥ne could again be crossed since in 890 part of the ancient bridge of Avignon was restored at the pier No. 14 near Villeneuve. In that same year Louis, the son of Boson, succeeded his father. His election took place in the Synod of Varennes near Macon. Thibert, who was his most effective supporter, became Count of Apt. In 896 Thibert acted as plenipotentiary of the king at Avignon, Arles, and Marseille with the title of \\"Governor-General of all the counties of Arles and Provence\\". Two years later, at his request, King Louis donated B√©darrides to the priest Rigmond d'Avignon. On 19 October 907 King Louis the Blind became emperor and restored an island in the Rhone to Remigius, Bishop of Avignon. This charter is the first mention of a cathedral dedicated to Mary. After the capture and the execution of his cousin, Louis III, who had been exiled to Italy in 905, Hugh of Arles became regent and personal advisor to King Louis. He exercised most of the powers of the king of Provence and in 911, when Louis III gave him the titles of Duke of Provence and Marquis of the Viennois,Mc Kitterick, 267. he left Vienne and moved to Arles which was the original seat of his family and which now was the new capital of Provence. On 2 May 916 Louis the Blind restored the churches of Saint-Ruf and Saint-G√©ni√®s to the diocese of Avignon. On the same day Bishop Fulcherius attested in favour of his canons and for the two churches of Notre- Dame and Saint-√âtienne to form a cathedral. A political event of importance took place in 932 with the reunion of the kingdom of Provence with Upper Burgundy. This union formed the Kingdom of Arles in which Avignon was one of the largest cities. At the end of the 9th century, Muslim Spain installed a military base in Fraxinet since they had led the plundering expeditions in the Alps throughout the 10th century. During the night of 21 to 22 July 972 the Muslims took dom Mayeul, the Abbot of Cluny who was returning from Rome, prisoner. They asked for one livre for each of them which came to 1,000 livres, a huge sum, which was paid to them quickly. Ma√Øeul was released in mid-August and returned to Cluny in September. Map of the Kingdom of Arles, which was attached to the Holy Roman Empire in 1003. In September 973 William I of Provence and his brother Rotbold, sons of the Count of Avignon, Boso II, mobilized all the nobles of Provence on behalf of dom Ma√Øeul. With the help of Ardouin, Marquis of Turin, and after two weeks of siege, Proven√ßal troops chased the Saracens from their hideouts in Fraxinet and Ramatuelle as well as those at Peirimpi near Noyers in the Jabron valley. William and Roubaud earned their title of Counts of Provence. William had his seat at Avignon and Roubaud at Arles. In 976 while Bermond, brother-in-law of Eyric was appointed Viscount of Avignon by King Conrad the Peaceful on 1 April, the Cartulary of Notre-Dame des Doms in Avignon says that Bishop Landry restored rights that had been unjustly appropriated to the canons of Saint-√âtienne. He gave them a mill and two houses he built for them on the site of the current Trouillas Tower at the papal palace. In 980 these canons were constituted in a canonical chapter by Bishop Garnier. In 994 Dom Ma√Øeul arrived in Avignon where his friend William the Liberator was dying. He assisted in his last moments on the island facing the city (the √éle de la Barthelasse) on the Rhone. The Count had as successor the son he had by his second wife Alix. He would reign jointly with his uncle Rotbold under the name William II. In the face of County and episcopal power, the town of Avignon organized itself. Towards the year 1000 there was already a proconsul B√©ranger with his wife Gilberte who are known to have founded an abbey at \\"Castrum Caneto\\". In 1032 when Conrad II inherited the Kingdom of Arles, Avignon was attached to the Holy Roman Empire. The Rhone was now a border that could only be crossed on the old bridge at Avignon. Some Avignon people still use the term \\"Empire Land\\" to describe the Avignon side, and \\"Kingdom Land\\" to designate the Villeneuve side to the west which was in the possession of the King of France. Late Middle Ages Siege of Avignon in 1226 (on the left), the death of Louis VIII the Lion and crowning of Louis IX (on the right). After the division of the empire of Charlemagne, Avignon came within the Kingdom of Arles or Kingdom of the Two Burgundies, and was owned jointly by the Count of Provence and the Count of Toulouse. From 1060, the Count of Forcalquier also had nominal overlordship, until these rights were resigned to the local Bishops and Consuls in 1135. With the German rulers at a distance, Avignon set up an autonomous administration with the creation of a consulat in 1129, two years before its neighbour Arles. In 1209 the Council of Avignon ordered a second excommunication for Raymond VI of Toulouse.Chronology of the cathars At the end of the twelfth century, Avignon declared itself an independent republic, and sided with Raymond VII of Toulouse during the Albigensian Crusade. In 1226, the citizens refused to open the gates of Avignon to King Louis VIII of France and the papal legate. They besieged the city for three months (10 June-12 September). Avignon was captured and forced to pull down its ramparts and fill up its moat. At the end of September, a few days after the surrender of the city to the troops of King Louis VIII, Avignon experienced severe flooding. In 1249 the city again declared itself a republic on the death of Raymond VII, his heirs being on a crusade. On 7 May 1251, however, the city was forced to submit to two younger brothers of King Louis IX, Alphonse of Poitiers and Charles of Anjou (Charles I of Naples). They were heirs through the female line of the Marquis and Count of Provence, and thus co-lords of the city. After the death of Alphonse in 1271, Philip III of France inherited his share of Avignon and passed it to his son Philip the Fair in 1285. It passed in turn in 1290 to Charles II of Naples, who thereafter remained the sole lord of the entire city. The University of Avignon was founded by Pope Boniface VIII in 1303 and was famed as a seat of legal studies, flourishing until the French Revolution (1792). Avignon papacy Milestone delineating the limit of the Papal State and the Comtat Venaissin Palais des papes and the city of Avignon, by the Boucicaut Master at the beginning of the 15th century. In 1309 the city, still part of the Kingdom of Arles, was chosen by Pope Clement V as his residence at the time of the Council of Vienne and, from 9 March 1309 until 13 January 1377, Avignon, rather than Rome was the seat of the Papacy. At the time the city and its surroundings (the Comtat Venaissin) were ruled by the kings of Sicily of the House of Anjou. The French King Philip the Fair, who had inherited from his father all the rights of Alphonse de Poitiers (the last Count of Toulouse), made them over to Charles II, King of Naples and Count of Provence (1290). Nonetheless, Philip was a shrewd ruler. Inasmuch as the eastern banks of the Rh√¥ne marked the edge of his kingdom, when the river flooded up into the city of Avignon, Philip taxed the city since during periods of flood, the city technically lay within his domain. Avignon became the Pontifical residence under Pope Clement V in 1309. His successor, John XXII, a former bishop of the diocese, made it the capital of Christianity and transformed his former episcopal palace into the primary Palace of the Popes. It was Benedict XII who built the Old Palace and his successor Clement VI the New Palace. He bought the town on 9 June 1348 from Joanna I of Naples, the Queen of Naples and Countess of Provence for 80,000 florins. Innocent VI endowed the ramparts. Under their rule, the Court seethed and attracted many merchants, painters, sculptors and musicians. Their palace, the most remarkable building in the International Gothic style was the result, in its construction and ornamentation, of the joint work of the best French architects, Pierre Peysson and Jean du Louvres (called Loubi√®res) and the larger frescoes from the School of Siena: Simone Martini and Matteo Giovanetti. The papal library in Avignon was the largest in Europe in the 14th century with 2,000 volumes Around the library were a group of passionate clerics of letters who were pupils of Petrarch, the founder of Humanism. At the same time the Clementine Chapel, called the Grande Chapelle, attracted composers, singers, and musiciansRaymond Dugrand and Robert Ferras, The Great Encyclopedia, Larousse, Paris, 1972, Vol. III, p. 1355, including Philippe de Vitry, inventor of the Ars Nova, and Johannes Ciconia. As Bishop of Cavaillon, Cardinal Philippe de Cabassoles, Lord of Vaucluse, was the great protector of the Renaissance poet Petrarch. Urban V took the first decision to return to Rome, to the delight of Petrarch, but the chaotic situation there with different conflicts prevented him from staying there. He died shortly after his return to Avignon. His successor, Gregory XI, also decided to return to Rome and this ended the first period of the Avignon Papacy. When Gregory XI brought the seat of the papacy to Rome in 1377, the city of Avignon was administered by a legate. The early death of Gregory XI, however, caused the Great Schism. Clement VII and Benedict XIII reigned again in Avignon Overall therefore it was nine popes who succeeded in the papal palace and enriched themselves during their pontificate. From then on until the French Revolution, Avignon and the Comtat were papal possessions: first under the schismatic popes of the Great Schism, then under the popes of Rome ruling via legates until 1542, and then by vice-legates. The Black Death appeared at Avignon in 1348 killing almost two-thirds of the city's population. In all seven popes and two anti-popes resided in Avignon: *Clement V: 1305‚Äì1314 (curia moved to Avignon March 9, 1309) *John XXII: 1316‚Äì1334 *Benedict XII: 1334‚Äì1342 *Clement VI: 1342‚Äì1352 *Innocent VI: 1352‚Äì1362 *Urban V: 1362‚Äì1370 (in Rome 1367-1370; returned to Avignon 1370) *Gregory XI: 1370‚Äì1378 (left Avignon to return to Rome on September 13, 1376) ;Anti-Popes *Clement VII (1378-1394) *Benedict XIII (1394-1403) The walls that were built by the popes in the years immediately following the acquisition of Avignon as papal territory are well preserved. As they were not particularly strong fortifications, the Popes relied instead on the immensely strong fortifications of their palace, the \\"Palais des Papes\\". This immense Gothic building, with walls 17‚Äì18 feet thick, was built 1335‚Äì1364 on a natural spur of rock, rendering it all but impregnable to attack. After its capture following the French Revolution, it was used as a barracks and prison for many years but it is now a museum. Avignon, which at the beginning of the 14th century was a town of no great importance, underwent extensive development during the time the seven Avignon popes and two anti-popes, Clement V to Benedict XIII, resided there. To the north and south of the rock of the Doms, partly on the site of the Bishop's Palace that had been enlarged by John XXII, was built the Palace of the Popes in the form of an imposing fortress consisting of towers linked to each other and named as follows: La Campane, Trouillas, La Glaci√®re, Saint-Jean, Saints-Anges (Benedict XII), La G√¢che, La Garde-Robe (Clement VI), Saint-Laurent (Innocent VI). The Palace of the Popes belongs, by virtue of its severe architecture, to the Gothic art of the South of France. Other noble examples can be seen in the churches of Saint-Didier, Saint-Pierre, and Saint Agricol as well as in the Clock Tower and in the fortifications built between 1349 and 1368 for a distance of some flanked by thirty-nine towers, all of which were erected or restored by the Roman Catholic Church. The popes were followed to Avignon by agents (or factors) of the great Italian banking-houses who settled in the city as money-changers and as intermediaries between the Apostolic Camera and its debtors. They lived in the most prosperous quarter of the city which was known as the Exchange. A crowd of traders of all kinds brought to market the produce necessary for maintaining the numerous courts and for the visitors who flocked to it: grain and wine from Provence, the south of France, Roussillon, and the country around Lyon. Fish was brought from places as distant as Brittany; rich cloth and tapestries came from Bruges and Tournai. The account-books of the Apostolic Camera, which are still kept in the Vatican archives, give an idea of the trade of which Avignon became the centre. The university founded by Boniface VIII in 1303 had many students under the French popes. They were drawn there by the generosity of the sovereign pontiffs who rewarded them with books or benefices. Paul V's coat-of-arms on a building located opposite the Papal Palace. Early modern period After the restoration of the Papacy in Rome the spiritual and temporal government of Avignon was entrusted to a Legate, notably the Cardinal-nephew, who was replaced in his absence by a vice-legate (unlike the legate he was usually a commoner and not a cardinal). Pope Innocent XII abolished nepotism and the office of Legate in Avignon on 7 February 1693, handing over its temporal government in 1692 to the Congregation of Avignon (i.e. a department of the papal Curia which resided in Rome), with the Cardinal Secretary of State as presiding prefect, who exercised their jurisdiction through the vice-legate. This congregation, to which appeals were made from the decisions of the vice-legate, was linked to the Congregation of Loreto within the Roman Curia. In 1774 the vice-legate was made president thus depriving him of almost all authority. The office was done away with under Pope Pius VI on 12 June 1790. The Public Council, composed of forty-eight councillors chosen by the people, four members of the clergy, and four doctors from the university, met under the presidency of the chief magistrate of the city: the viquier (Occitan) or representative of the papal Legate or Vice-legate who annually nominated a man for the post. The councillors' duty was to watch over the material and financial interests of the city but their resolutions had to be submitted to the vice-legate for approval before being put in force. Three consuls, chosen annually by the Council, had charge of the administration of the streets. Avignon's survival as a papal enclave was, however, somewhat precarious, as the French crown maintained a large standing garrison at Villeneuve-l√®s-Avignon just across the river. On the death of the Archbishop of Arles, Philippe de L√©vis in 1475, Pope Sixtus IV in Rome reduced the size of the diocese of Arles: he detached the diocese of Avignon in the province of Arles and raised it to the rank of an archbishopric in favour of his nephew Giuliano della Rovere, who later became Pope Julius II. The Archdiocese of Avignon had canonic jurisdiction over the department of Vaucluse and was an archdiocese under the bishoprics of Comtadins Carpentras, Cavaillon, and Vaison-la-Romaine.Catholic Church in Avignon - Historical Notice, Diocese of Avignon, consulted on 17 October 2011 From the fifteenth century onward it became the policy of the Kings of France to rule Avignon as part of their kingdom. In 1476 Louis XI, upset that Charles of Bourbon was made legate, sent troops to occupy the city until his demands that Giuliano della Rovere be made legate. Once Rovere was made a cardinal he withdrew his troops from the city. In the 15th century Avignon suffered a major flood of the Rhone. King Louis XI repaired a bridge in October 1479 by letters patent. Letters patent of Louis XI, Plessis-du-Parc-l√®z-Tours, 10 October 1479 In 1536 king Francis I of France invaded the papal territory, in order to overthrow Emperor Charles V, who was emperor of the territory. When he entered the city the people received him very well, and in return for the reception the people were all granted to them the same privileges that French subjects enjoyed, such as being able to hold state offices. In 1562 the city was besieged by the Fran√ßois de Beaumont, baron des Adrets, who wanted to avenge the massacre of Orange. Charles IX passed through the city during his royal tour of France (1564-1566) together with his court and nobles of the kingdom: his brother the Duke of Anjou, Henry of Navarre, the cardinals of Bourbon and Lorraine The court stayed for three weeks.

In 1663 in retaliation for the attack led by the Corsican Guard on the attendants of the Duc de Cr√©qui, the ambassador of Louis XIV in Rome, the King of France attacked and seized Avignon, which at the time was considered an important and integral part of the French Kingdom by the provincial Parliament of Provence. In 1688 yet another attempt was made to occupy Avignon, however the attempt failed, and from 1688 to 1768 Avignon was at peace with no occupations or wars during that time. At the beginning of the 18th century the streets of Avignon were narrow and winding but buildings changed and houses gradually replaced the old buildings. Around the city there were mulberry plantations, orchards, and grasslands.Description of Avignon, 1829 On 2 January 1733 Fran√ßois Mor√©nas founded a newspaper, the Courrier d'Avignon, whose name changed over time and through prohibitions. As it was published in the papal enclave outside the kingdom of France and Monaco, the newspaper escaped the control system of the press in France (privilege with permission) while undergoing control from papal authorities. The Courrier d'Avignon appeared from 1733 to 1793 with two interruptions: one between July 1768 and August 1769 due to the annexation of Avignon to France and the other between 30 November 1790 and 24 May 1791.Eug√®ne Hatin, Historical Bibliography and critique of the French periodical press, Firmin Didot Fr√®res, Paris, 1866, p. 306, consulted on 17 October 2011 King Louis XV occupied the Comtat Venaissin from 1768 to 1774 and substituted French institutions for those in force with the approval of the people of Avignon; a French party grew up.

On the night of 16 to 17 October 1791, after the lynching by a mob of the secretary-clerk of the commune who was wrongly suspected of wanting to seize church property, the event called the Massacres of La Glaci√®re took place, when 60 people were summarily executed and thrown into the dungeon of the tower on the Palais des Papes. On 7 July 1793 federalist insurgents under General Rousselet entered Avignon. During their passage along the Durance to retake the city by troops from Marseilles one person was killed: Joseph Agricol Viala. On 25 July General Carteaux appeared before the city and it was abandoned the next day by the troops of General Rousselet as a result of a misinterpretation of orders from Marseille. On 25 June 1793 Avignon and Comtat-Venaissin were integrated along with the former principality of Orange to form the present department of Vaucluse with Avignon as its capital. This was confirmed on 19 February 1797 by the Treaty of Tolentino in which Article 5 definitively sanctioned the annexation stating that: \\"The Pope renounces, purely and simply, all the rights to which he might lay claim over the city and territory of Avignon, and the Comtat Venaissin and its dependencies, and transfers and makes over the said rights to the French Republic.\\" On 1 October 1795 Alexandre Mottard de Lestang, a Knight, captured the town for the royalists with a troop of 10,000 men. The mission representative Boursault retook the city and had Lestang shot. Before the French Revolution Avignon had as suffragan sees Carpentras, Vaison and Cavaillon, which were united by the Napoleonic Concordat of 1801 to Avignon, together with the Diocese of Apt, a suffragan of Aix-en-Provence. However, at that same time Avignon was reduced to the rank of a bishopric and was made a suffragan see of Aix. On 30 May 1814 the French annexation of Avignon was recognized by the Pope. Ercole Consalvi made an ineffectual protest at the Congress of Vienna in 1815 but Avignon was never restored to the Holy See. In 1815, Bonapartist Marshal Guillaume Marie Anne Brune was assassinated by adherents of the royalist party during the White Terror. The murder took place in the former Hotel du Palais Royal that was located Place Crillon in front of today's Hotel d'Europe. In the years 1820-1830 Villeneuve was forced to yield part of its territory to Avignon: the part called the √éle de la Barthelasse. The Archdiocese of Avignon was re-established in 1822, receiving as suffragan sees the Diocese of Viviers, Valence: (formerly under Lyon), N√Æmes, and Montpellier (formerly under Toulouse). On 18 October 1847 the Avignon - Marseille railway line was opened by the Compagnie du chemin de fer de Marseille √† Avignon (Marseille to Avignon Railway Company). In 1860 the current Avignon Centre railway station was built. In November 1898 the tramway network of the Compagnie des Tramways √âlectriques d'Avignon (Electric Tramways Company of Avignon) was opened to replace the old company of horse-drawn transport.

From the beginning of the 20th century to today Arrival at Avignon of Raymond Poincar√©, President of the Republic, on 14 October 1913. The newly elected President of the Republic at the beginning of the year 1913, Raymond Poincar√©, visited Provence in mid-October. He wrote in his book In the Service of France: Europe under arms: 1913, a description of his successive visits. The primary purpose of the visit was to verify in situ the state of mind of the F√©librige in the likely event of a conflict with Germany. He met, at Maillane and at S√©rignan-du-Comtat, the two most illustrious people Fr√©d√©ric Mistral and Jean-Henri Fabre. Between these two appointments he paused at Avignon where he was received triumphantly at the Town Hall. Already the reception he had received at the Mas du Juge from the poet and the communal meal they had taken in the presidential train at Graveson had reassured him of the patriotism of Provence. It was, therefore in these terms that he spoke on the Nobel Prize in Literature: \\"Dear and illustrious master, you who have pointed out imperishable monuments in honour of French land; you who have raised the prestige of a language and a literature that has a place in our national history to be proud of; you who, in glorifying Provence, have braided a crown of olive green; to you, august master, I bring the testimony of the recognition of the Republic and the great motherland\\".Raymond Poincar√©, In the service of France: Europe under arms: 1913 Conservatory of documents and culture, Fr√©d√©ric Mistral: 1913-2013: There are 100 years, the last triumphant The TGV double viaduct at Angles, bridge on the LGV M√©diterran√©e over the Rh√¥ne.

It is dedicated to Lazarus of Bethany and to Catherine of Alexandria. The first church on the site was built of wood in 1703-1704 and was dedicated to Lazarus. Its ktitor was Prince Mihai Racovi»õƒÉ. Located near the princely customs house and close to Racovi»õƒÉ's family homes, it was situated atop a hill which at the time adjoined the eastern edge of the city. Its location gave it the nickname of Customs House Church (Biserica de la VamƒÉ). It is mentioned in the chronicle of Ion Neculce, and in several documents of the 18th century. The church was burned by the Ottomans. It was rebuilt in brick, on a stone foundation, in 1785, the new ktitors being Sandu and Luca Grigorie. The same year, it was turned into a monastery dedicated to the Holy Sepulchre. Greek monks moved in, building residences and cells on the ruins of the Racovi»õƒÉ properties. The Greeks also brought relics of Saint Charalambos, Theodore Stratelates and a Saint Michael; these are kept today in the nave, in a silvered box with Greek inscriptions. There is a piece of the True Cross in the altar. Outside the church, near the north wall, there is a marble gravestone inscribed in the Romanian Cyrillic alphabet. The church burned around 1822 and was repaired by Luca Grigorie working with one Sandu; they fixed the roof, siding and adjoining buildings. In 1863, following the secularization of monastic estates in Romania, the monastery was closed, its properties seized, and the Greek monks departed. It became a filial holding of the Barnovschi Church and was subsidized by Ia»ôi City Hall. According to historian N. A. Bogdan, at the beginning of the 20th century, the remains of walls and foundations belonging to the Racovi»õƒÉ properties were still visible. The church suffered serious damage during the 1940 Vrancea earthquake and the 1977 Vrancea earthquake; it underwent major repairs in 1967, during the 1980s and from 2006 to 2009. As a result of construction in the surrounding area between 1977-1987, excavations were performed that unearthed several hundred human skeletons. These were later reburied. The shape of the church is rectangular, with a semicircular altar wall. The interior has a foyer, vestibule, nave and altar; the foyer is lower and separated from the vestibule by several steps. The vestibule features a lengthy list of the church's benefactors. History at the Saint Lazarus parish site The church is listed as a historic monument by Romania's Ministry of Culture and Religious Affairs.

Geology and geography  The Cerro Morado volcanic field is located in northwestern Argentina, in the Jujuy Province. The town of is located within the volcanic field. The frontier with Chile lies approximately west of the volcanic field. The Altiplano and the adjacent southern Puna has experienced mafic volcanism during the Cenozoic. Most of this volcanism occurred in the southern segment, but the northern segment has also experienced mafic volcanism mostly associated with major volcanic centres and smaller volcanic fields such as Cerro Morado and Cerro Bitiche. Mafic lava flows however tend to constitute the minority of volcanic rocks in this region; the bulk of the volcanic rocks are dacitic-rhyolitic in composition. Present day volcanism occurs in the volcanic arc called the Central Volcanic Zone approximately farther west. The basement in the Cerro Morado area is formed by Ordovician rock formations and older lava flows of the Pairique volcanic complex and the Patahuasi flows. Volcanism in the area has been influenced by faults. The field covers a surface area of , alternatively stated as . Eight scoria cones form the volcanic field, but there may be more. With exceptions erosion has buried their bases. Layered deposits containing ash, lava bombs and lapilli are found around them. These cones are frequently aligned and an average diameter of and the heights range . Other structures associated with the cones are clastogenic lava flows and eroded pyroclastic mounds, as well as dykes that cut the cones. The volcanic field is dominated by a plateau made of lobate lava flows, typically having thicknesses of . The lava flows contain folding and flow structures. Various layers of lava flows lie on top of each other and on the basement, and pyroclastic deposits can also be found. The volcanic field has a north-south extension. The volcano has erupted andesite and basaltic andesite. Most cones are constructed from basaltic andesite, most lava flow lithofacies are andesitic. The andesites have a dark-blue to gray colour, with variable amounts of vesicles. Minerals found in the rocks include bytownite, clinopyroxene, - oxides, labradorite, orthopyroxene and plagioclase. Olivine is more common in the basaltic andesite than the andesite. Overall, the composition is -rich calc-alkaline. Xenoliths of quartz are contained in the andesite. Some of the rocks that form the cones are hydrothermally altered. The volcanic field was formed during the Upper Miocene. Dates of 6.7 ¬± 0.4 million years ago have been obtained. The field was formed by energetic effusive eruptions; lava supply rates of up to and an emplacement time of 84-18 months for the northern and 48-7 months for the southern parts of the field have been estimated. The field was probably formed by Strombolian eruptions accompanied by lava fountaining. Magma was transported along fractures and faults, resulting in the eruption of several different batches of magma without long stalling in the upper crust.

Murray (1842 ‚Äì February 17, 1917) was an abolitionist, journalist, phrenologist, and civil rights activist who spent most of his career in St. Louis, Missouri. He grew up in Reading, Pennsylvania, where he participated in the abolitionist movement in that region. During the US Civil War he continued his work and served as a recruiting officer to help enlist blacks into the Union Army. After the war, he focused on journalism. In 1867, he established the first black newspaper in Kentucky, The Colored Kentuckian. He later moved to St. Louis where he continued to work in journalism and as an advocate for black education and civil rights. He was also the president of the first Negro Press Association.\\"P. H. Murray Passes Away\\", Washington Bee (Washington (DC), District of Columbia), Saturday, February 17, 1917, p. 1.  Early life  Philip Houston Murray (or Murry) was born in Reading, Pennsylvania in 1842. His parents were Samuel and Sarah Murray. His father was born a slave in Kent County, Maryland, on the Eastern Shore of that state. His mother was mixed black, Native American, and Irish. His mothers paternal grandfather reportedly was half African American and half Native American and paid for a woman to be brought from Ireland and made his wife. Philip's father considered schools for black children to be poor and Philip was only permitted to attend school for a week before he was put under private education by Father Patrick Keevil, a graduate of Minonth College, England. By the age of fifteen, Murray began to study physiology and the physical brain, which would influence his later work in phrenology.Simmons, William J., and Henry McNeal Turner. Men of Mark: Eminent, Progressive and Rising. GM Rewell & Company, 1887. p97-102 Philip had 13 brothers and sisters.  Civil War  Before the Civil War, he became involved in abolitionism and worked with many abolitionists of the era. He also delivered a series of well-received lectures on \\"Cerebral Physiology\\" throughout New England and was an active practitioner of phrenology. During the civil war, he spent some time travelling in the South and working as a correspondent for northern newspapers. He endeavored to organize a company to join the Union Army when General Robert E. Lee's Confederate forces invaded Pennsylvania, but was refused by Governor Andrew Gregg Curtin. In 1864 he was a delegate to the convention at Syracuse, New York and was chosen chairman of the Pennsylvania delegation. That meeting was an important early meeting of the Colored Conventions Movement. He later did serve as a recruiting officer helping to enlist black soldiers.  Threats of violence  After the war, he frequently gave speeches in the upper South on black education and progress. He also spoke out against the treatment of blacks in the South by former Confederates immediately after the Civil War.Slavery Not Dead, New Orleans Tribune (New Orleans, Louisiana) July 14, 1865, Page: 3 He was frequently threatened by whites in the South for his speeches.

At about that time he held the position of inspector of public improvements under a board of public improvements. Outside of journalism, he also worked as a teacher. During his life he taught school in Pennsylvania, Kentucky, Virginia, and Missouri. In 1876 he attended a convention of teachers at Jefferson City, Missouri and was influenced to work to help hire black teachers and establishing black schools in St. Louis and throughout Missouri. He moved to Missouri that year and served under Chauncey Ives Filley in the Money Order Department of the Post Office and also worked for some time in the Comptrollers Office. He immediately started to fight to establish black schools and employ black teachers. He continued his journalism work in St. Louis as a writer for The Truth which he purchased in 1881 and changed the name to The Advance. The paper was published until about 1916.

Rulers East Timor rulers East Timor ","title":"List of rulers of Timor"},{"id":"51404750","text":"Eloise Andrews Kruger (June 26, 1914 ‚Äì November 19, 1995) was an American miniature collector from Lincoln, Nebraska who was known for her collection of historically-accurate American miniatures.  Early life  Kruger was born in Lincoln, Nebraska on June 26, 1914 as the eldest of Vernon and Luella Dierks Andrews's four daughters. Her cousin, Carl Rohman, acclaimed supporter of the Sheldon Memorial Art Gallery, remembers her being a very confident young woman. Prior to the Depression, she was exposed to a high level of living. She was a passionate reader, especially on the subjects of interior design and miniature collecting. She graduated from Lincoln High in 1932 and enrolled at the University of Nebraska. She only attended until 1934 because she wanted to help support her mother and sisters after her father abandoned the family for another woman. She lived with her aunt and uncle to help her three sisters pay for college, all of whom graduated. She married Carl Kruger in 1939, and soon after became interested in miniature figures. Miniature Furniture  Career  She worked as a secretary, then was quickly promoted to executive secretary. Lee Syndicate hired her as an accountant, despite her lack of knowledge in the area. After buying books and studying she became adept at the trade. During World War II, when most men were drafted, she was given war-time orders to hire and train women. Eventually she ran an all-woman accounting office until the war ended. Even once her collection started, she still worked these jobs and helped her husband manage Paramount Laundry. She was interested in sketching plans; she drew the house her mother built at 1935 Dakota Street. Her accounting job allowed her to travel a lot. Her cousin, Carl (Ky), claimed that she would find many pieces for her collection on these trips.  The collection and collecting methods  \\"When she undertook something she did it right. She studied and studied until she got it right\\" attested Carl Rohman Jr. She began collecting in the 1930s. The height of her collecting took place in the 1970s and 1980s. She became a published author in Miniature Magazine, commissioned outstanding miniature makers to create models from the American Neoclassical era, and reached out to collectors all over the country. After assessing the number of American Neoclassical, American colonial and Victorian pieces that she commissioned, it can be assumed those were her favorite eras. Her attention to detail was remarkable, as well as her records, documentation, and effort to learn as much about the eras as possible. All of the models were created at 1:12 scale. The pieces ranged from furniture, decorative arts, and accessories, from nearly every English and American design style, from Renaissance to Early Modern, all of which she commissioned to look as accurate to the real pieces as possible. Model in Kruger Gallery In 1968 alone, she wrote eighty-five different letters to collectors and artists across the country. The relationships represented varied in scope and familiarity. The key trends of these letters include writing multiple letters in one day (44% were written on Thursdays), and the increase of letters per month increasing to 34% in February. The patterns correlate with events that transpired in 1968, like the Chicago riots, her battle with undiagnosed dizzy spells, and a sprained arm that prevented her from writing. In many of her letters she mentioned that she had an interest in creating 1:12 miniature rugs, many of which she gave away, despite the hours of work one required. She worked on the Chippendale Back Stool that model maker, Eric Pearson, made custom for her. The flamestitch upholstery took 40 stitches per inch. In February, Eloise told Eunice Tuttle \\"the upholstery in this case is driving me to despair.\\" Her two main correspondents were Thomas Devereux and Ellen Krucker, and these letters included more personal information, like politics and new cars, much more than simply invoices for her collection. Krucker was one of the two artists (aside from Pearson) that Eloise's husband thought made \\"worthwhile miniatures\\". Eloise rented the apartment across the hall from her home, just for storing her miniatures. Top artists are Eric Pearson with 236 pieces, Eugene Kupjack, Bob Carlisle, Warren Dick, Mell Prescott, and Betty Valentine. E. Pearson, 1964  Death and legacy  Kruger died on November 19, 1995 at age 81. She was survived by her sister Jean, nephews Donald Campbell and Bob Campbell, and cousin Carl Rohman. Her collection was donated to the University of Nebraska - Lincoln in 1997 and is now held in the Kruger Gallery inside the College of Architecture. This contribution included over eight hundred books on the subjects of architectural detailing, to histories in ceramics, iron work, interior design, and kitchen space planning, as well as her miniature collection of over 20,000 pieces, valued at $500,000. The Kruger Gallery now uses her collection to increase awareness of architectural and interior eras, and in the field of material culture. \\"I think it's great [to be at UNL]. She valued education, she would be terribly pleased\\" said her nephew Bob.

In 2013, the company's two banking subsidiaries, Pacific Trust Bank and The Private Bank of California, were merged to form the Banc of California. The bank also hired former Los Angeles mayor Antonio Villaraigosa as a strategic advisor. In 2014, Banc of California bought 20 bank branches in Southern California from Popular, Inc., a Puerto Rico-based bank, for $5.4 million. The move doubled the number of branches the bank owned and brought its assets to $5 billion. On January 23, 2017, CEO Steven Sugarman resigned amid an investigation by the Securities Exchange Commission (SEC) over the bank's alleged links to a convicted fraudster. An internal investigation by the bank found no legal issues, but attracted criticism from the CalSTRS over its poor oversight of deals signed that benefited Sugarman and his associates. After Sugarman's resignation, the bank shifted its focus from growth to profitability, including laying off 139 workers at its corporate offices. As of September 2017, financial analysts had cut Banc of California's earnings estimates per share, despite the new strategy's focus on profitability. Sponsorships Since 2014, the bank has been the official bank of the USC Trojans, the athletic program of the University of Southern California. In 2016, the Banc of California announced a partnership with Los Angeles FC, an upcoming Major League Soccer franchise, and a 15-year, $100 million deal with the club for the naming rights to their stadium Banc of California Stadium in Los Angeles, scheduled to open in 2018. The deal was described as \\"a little out of the mold for a bank of our size\\" by then-CEO Steven Sugarman, with other observers noting that the bank was not well known nationally. The company paid $20 million for early termination of the naming rights deal in 2020, citing a shift in focus.

Swimming career Nir began swimming at age 11, and became the Israeli national champion within six months. She competed for Israel at the 1965 Maccabiah Games, winning the gold medal in the women's 200 metre breastroke as a young teenager. Nir competed for Israel at the 1968 Summer Olympics, at the age of 15, in Mexico City. Swimming in the Women's 100 metre Breaststroke she took 3rd in her heat with a time of 1:20.9. Swimming in the Women's 200 metre Breaststroke she took 5th in her heat, again with a time of 2:58.5. She competed for Israel at the 1970 Asian Games in Bangkok, Thailand.

Nir had planned to return to Israel soon after swimming her last race, to marry her fianc√©. But the Israeli team head asked her to wait, to fly back with an injured fellow Israeli athlete. On that day others on the Israeli team were attacked in their dorms, and taken hostage by Palestinian terrorists. Nir wasn't taken hostage, because she was staying in another building. The following day, German authorities took Nir and the remaining Israeli team members and coaches to the ninth floor of the building. From a window, Nir watched as two helicopters landed on the Olympic Village lawn. The helicopters were supposed to take the terrorists and the Israeli hostages to F√ºrstenfeldbruck Air Base, and from there they were to fly to Cairo. Nir said: > \\"We watched from the ninth floor window as the two buses arrived. Four > blindfolded athletes with their hands tied together got off the first bus. > They were put on the first helicopter. Then, another five hostages got off > the second bus and climbed onto the second helicopter. That was the last > image we saw. Although we were on the ninth floor, we could still see it > well.‚Äù All nine hostages were killed in a failed German rescue operation at the airbase. A total of 11 Israelis were killed by the Palestinian terrorist Black September group. For a year Nir kept having nightmares that she was \\"running away from the Arabs,\\" underneath the Olympic Village. \\"I saw this place, the same location all the time, I couldn't run out of it. I would always be running, and terrorists with masks were chasing me.\\" Since the 1972 Munich Games, Nir has regularly attended commemorations for the killed athletes and met with fellow survivors.

Composed mainly of elm, oak and ash, the site is semi-natural and now recovering from the removal of planted conifers. Location and natural features Briarwood Banks is situated in the south-west of the county of Northumberland, some south-south-east Bardon Mill and west south-west of Haydon Bridge. The site occupies the banks of a fan of north-east running tributaries of the north-running River Allen including Farnalees Burn, Black Sike and Kingswood Burn, and its north-east boundary is formed by the Allen. The designated woodland area is in length and up to wide, covering and falling from above sea level in the south-west to at the Allen confluence. It is one of a number of SSSIs on the River Allen; to the south are Stewardpeel Woods starting upstream and the Allen Confluence Gravels some upstream. Vegetation A number of distinct assemblages of flora are observed at Briarwood Banks. Dominant on lower slopes is wych elm (Ulmus glabra), beneath which are found dog‚Äôs mercury (Mercurialis perennis), woodruff (Galium odoratum), wood melick (Melica uniflora), giant bellflower (Campanula latifolia), enchanter‚Äôs nightshade (Circaea lutetiana) and wood avens (Geum urbanum). Oak (Quercus petraea) predominates the higher slopes with creeping soft-grass (Holcus mollis), false brome (Brachypodium sylvaticum), wood sorrel (Oxalis acetosella) and broad buckler-fern (Dryopteris dilatata); and on very acid soil beneath oaks, great wood-rush (Luzula sylvatica), bilberry (Vaccinium myrtillus) and common cow-wheat (Melampyrum pratense) are found. Ash (Fraxinus excelsior) is found site-wide, together with occurrences of downy birch (Betula pubescens), bird cherry (Prunus padus), yew (Taxus baccata) and alder (Alnus glutinosa). Beech (Fagus sylvatica) and sycamore (Acer pseudoplatanus) in the woods are thought to survive from a historic management regime. Shrubs found in the woods include hazel (Corylus avellana), holly (Ilex aquifolium) and hawthorn (Crataegus monogyna). Rocky outcrops on the site support hard shield-fern (Polystichum aculeatum) and hart‚Äôs-tongue (Phyllitis scolopendrium). By contrast, wet flushes on the site support giant fescue (Festuca gigantea), tufted hair-grass (Deschampsia cespitosa), bugle (Ajuga reptans), yellow pimpernel (Lysimachia nemorum) and meadowsweet (Filipendula ulmaria). Dark and damp areas of the woodland give rise to rare lichens such as (Biatorella monasteriensis), (Lobaria laetevirens) and (Leptogium teretiusculum), as well as mosses and ferns including epiphytic polypody (Polypodium vulgare) and oak fern (Gymnocarpium dryopteris). Other plant species noted are rare wood fescue (Festuca altissima) found amongst moss on screes, mountain pansy (Viola lutea) on alluvial deposits on the bank of the Allen; and reflecting the influence of heavy metals leachate from the Northern Pennine Orefield, alpine penny-cress (Thlaspi alpestre) is found. The condition of Briarwood Banks was judged to be 'unfavourable-recovering' in 2010 & 2012 inspections, as actions to remove non-native species and exclude grazing take effect. Fauna Northumberland Wildlife Trust asserts that the woods are one of the most northerly habitats for dormice. Other species associated with the woods include roe deer and red squirrel. Bird species include the pied wagtail and the greater spotted woodpecker. Access Northumberland Wildlife Trust manages of the site as a nature reserve with full public access, including provision for wheelchair users.

The reduction in the basic-pay, the established basis of determining rank equivalences between armed forces officers and civilian and police counterparts, altered long established historical grade-pay equivalences or parities between armed forces officers and police officer, which was an accepted principle since 1947 for determination of armed forces grade pay, and which was 'further cemented' in 1973, by the 3 Central Pay Commission (3CPC). The reduction in grade-pay apart from causing asymmetries in rank equivalence between the officers from the Indian Police Service and armed forces affected the basic pay, allowances, entitlements, promotion prospects, status, and pension of thousands of officers in the service in January 1986, and the decades after that. In 2012, reduction in armed forces grade-pay, which was a subject of litigation since 1994, was declared illegal by the Supreme Court of India, which in a landmark judgement ordered the government to pay arrears to the more than 20,000 affected officers of the armed forces. The 'rank-pay' scheme apart from provoking contentious litigation, was one of the causes that fueled protracted protest by veterans over One Rank, One Pension (OROP); and, in the estimate of former chiefs of the armed forces, the degradation of armed forces ranks which rank-pay deductions from basic pay caused, affected armed forces morale and national security, about which they wrote letters to the Prime minister, including Narendra Modi. The legacy of reduction of grade-pay of armed forces lingers, and has variously affected the outcomes of the 5th, 6th and 7th Central Pay Commission. Measures Rank-Pay implemented in 1986, was initiated and conceived during the tenure of S K Bhatnagar, Defence Secretary (July 1984-May 1988). It was implemented by the Government led by Rajeev Gandh who was both Prime Minister, and Defence Minister (1985-1987), and R. N. Kao, the PM's, police, security and intelligence adviser. Rank-Pay measures include [a] Implementation of a new pay system termed 'integrated running pay scale' ( Rs. 2300-100-3900-150-4200-EB-150-5100, covering a span of 28 years) for all ranks from Second Lieutenant till Brigadier( while retaining the existing system for civil services, including the Police) ; [b] the new basic-pay for captains till brigadier is depressed to the extent it excludes the rank pay component, which has been deducted; (c) rank-pay( which varies from Rs 200 to 1200 depending on rank) is explained by the 4CPC as well as the MOD as 'additional element', and not some thing that was deducted from the basic-pay; (d) in the MOD, and police led security apparatus, functional relationships between armed forces officers and police officers are reconfigured on the basis of the existence of new armed forces 'basic-pays'( i.e., basic-pay minus rank pay); [d] the new parities, are, however, not defined. The new reduced basic-pay distorts long established historical basic-pay parities between the armed forces officers, and defence civilians officers, and the police led security and intelligence bureaucracy.  Impact  The impact of the implementation of rank-pay on serving officers and veterans are diverse, lingering, and many of which are still unresolved. Rank-pay moderated basic- pay, the impact of which was neither properly examined or explained, affects armed forces organizational structure, functions, morale, and civil-military relations, especially military-police relations. Some of the major affects are of 'Rank pay', implementation are: [a] It degrades armed forces ranks including the highly selective ranks of lieutenant colonels, colonels, and brigadier; [b] Rank Pay deductions roils the Armed Forces, and distorts 'historical parities', and established pay based-status and protocol equations. [c] 'Rank-pay', affects the over all morale of the young officers, as its impacts most directly officers in crucial first 20 years of service; [e] Armed forces officers who had had an edge of two years over the police at the 13 year of service were 'demoted' and made equal in basic-pay to those with 4 years of service;[f] Colonel of the army, Group captain of the airforce, and captains of the navy, who had, since the inception of the police rank of Deputy Inspector General (DIG) (as the second senior most rank in the police), had had a higher pay grade, were placed in lower grade than DIGs, which had been made into a time scale appointment to which every one was automatically entitled on completion of 14 years of service; [g] armed officers, find it difficult to understand why the government has chosen to fix the basic pay of police officers and defence civilians, including auditors, with 13 years of service, at a higher level than of army, navy, and airforce officers with similar number of years of service; [h] It promotes bureaucracy rivalries, and unsustainable false equations and parities; [i] The new debased basic-pay for the armed forces with all its potential for distortions spawns resentment and protracted litigation, starting in 1996, which goes on desultorily for almost two decades. (j) In 2006, following the 6 CPC, the Government lends support to the false equation sought to be imposed by the Rajeev Gandhi Government in 1986, as Major Navdeep, a specialist on military pays, explains. In 1973, after the 3rd CPC, Lt Colonels were in the scale Rs 1750-1950, about the same as Civil Selection Grade Scale of 1650-1800 (3rd CPC). In 2006, following the 6CPC, and on the promptings of MOD, lieutenant colonels were demoted to Pay-band 3 with Grade pay of 7600, in comparison with civil and police counterparts who were placed in Pay Band-4 with Grade Pay of Rs 8700. This demotion was partially corrected after an unseemly stand off, and lieutenant colonels, wing commanders of the airforce, commanders of the navy, were reluctantly moved up to Pay Band-4 with Grade Pay Rs 8000, still Rs 700 below similarly placed officers with same length of service from civil services like the Indian Defence Accounts Service, and police service.  Litigation  Rank-pay deductions from basic-pay, apart from being a cause of dismay, distress, and confusion in the armed forces, provoke decades of rancorous litigation between armed forces veterans, including widows, and the Ministry of Defence (MOD), exposing, very publicly, the distrust which the armed forces harbors against the MOD. Maj AK Dhanapalan, who first 'discovered' the flaws in rank-pay, and 4CPC, in 1996, went to court to seek legal redress. In 1997, after he retired, he spent the next ten years litigating 'rank pay' in the face of relentless opposition by the MOD. He wins his first case in 1998, but that is to no avail, as the Ministry of Defence appeals against the court decision. After protracted legal struggle, despite remorseless appeals by the MOD, the high court, in a landmark decision, declares 'rank-pay' deductions from basic-pay illegal. The Supreme Court concurs with high court decision that the 'rank pay' was wrongly deducted from basic pay. \\"KA Abdul Gafoor, and JM James, Judgment Rank Pay\\", 4 July 2003 Legacy The legacy of 4CPC and rank-pay lingers according to Navdeep Singh, a lawyer and expert on military pays, who closely follows issues affecting armed forces pay and pensions, lingers. Even after the 'rank-pay' deductions from basic-pay are held to be illegal by the highest court, the MOD continues its efforts to reconfigure military ranks: in 2006, after 6CPC, the new 'grade pay' is configured to achieve the intent of the rank-pay, triggering a storm of protest; and again, in 2016, after 7CPC, the BJP Government, implements differentiated pay matrix-es for the defence-civilians, police, and others, and the armed forces, the underling intent of which is the same as the introduction 'rank-pay' by the congress government, in 1986. Former Chief of Indian Army Ved Malik, and others, recognizing the intent of the BJP government decision, calls the decision blatantly 'discriminatory' and intended to degrade armed forces ranks in comparison with police time scale ranks. The BJP, despite its public protestations, has lent support to embedded legacy of the Rank-Pay, by deciding in favor of what have been called biased and discriminatory pay scales by the armed forces headquarters, and the Chiefs of the three services. It has yet to explain its stand or examine the larger issues represented by the continuing sense of unease in the armed forces. Timeline February 1996 Major (retd) Dhanapalan, who took premature retirement in 1997, files petition in the High Court of Kerala, challenging his \\"re-fixation of pay' following the implementation of 4CPC by MoD.\\" 19 December 1997 MoD issues Special Army Instructions (SAI) No. 2/S/1998 (and corresponding special instructions for the Navy and Air Force) on incorporating the impugned formula of 4CPC for re-fixation, recommended by the 5th CPC, which had submitted its report in September 1997. 5 October 1998 Single Judge issued a judgment in favor of Maj Dhanapalan. MoD files Writ Appeal before the High Court‚Äôs Division Bench against the order of the Single Judge. 4 July 2003 The Division Bench confirms the judgment of the Single Judge. 2006 MOD agrees to pay Major Dhanapalan his arrears. While conceding that it acted wrongly in the case of Major Dhanapalan, opposes extending the benefits to other similarly affected officers, compelling them, and the many widows, to go to court at their own cost, to seek their dues. 8 March 2010 Supreme Court of India rules in favour of all the Armed Forces officers eligible to be paid Rank Pay. It agrees with \\"the High Court of Kerala that the amount equivalent to Rank Pay should not have been deducted and the MoD should pay arrears with an interest of 6 percent per annum from 1.1.1986 i.e. the date from which Rank Pay was authorised by the Govt of India. Instead of implementing the Supreme court ruling, MoD files an \\"Interlocutory Application\\" praying to the Supreme Court to \\"recall, re-hear, modify,\\" its order of 8 March 2010, \\"utilising recommendations of a High Powered Committee (HPC) comprising Pradeep Kumar (IAS), then Defence Secretary, Secretary Defence (Finance), and Secretary Expenditure to impress upon the Court that it would entail an expenditure of Rs 1623.71 crores if the order was implemented as it would lead to re-fixation of emoluments of Armed Forces officers for the periods of 4th, 5th and 6th CPC. What was left unsaid was that it was the faulty interpretation and delays in implementation by MoD that led to the situation\\". 4 September 2012 A Bench of three Judges of the Supreme Court of India upholds the Court‚Äôs order dated 8 March 2010 with the proviso that interest to be paid from 1.1.2006, the date when the first of several writ petitions were filed by affected Armed Forces officers, instead of 1 January 1986, the date on which rank-pay was implemented. The Court also directed the Government to complete payment of arrears and interest within 12 weeks from 4 September 2012. 17 October 2012 Rohinton F Nariman, Solicitor General of India, advises the MOD to implement the Court‚Äôs order dated 4 September 2012 in letter and spirit. 27 December 2012 MoD, agrees to pay part of the arrears from 1.1.1986 to 31.12.1995 but objects to paying arrears from 1.1.1996 to 31.12.2005 on the ground that Supreme Court orders lacked clarity for payment and re-fixation from 1.1.2006 See also * One Rank, One Pension * One Rank One Pension Scheme * Sixth Central Pay Commission * 7th Central Pay Commission (CPC) and Defence Forces * Defence pensions, India References External links * Keeping the Ld Solicitor General Informed - Rank Pay Case - Update * Rank Pay, Uniform Grade Pay, and the Facts from Courts‚Äô Orders * Report of the Fourth Central Pay Commission Ministry of Finance * Report of the Sixth Central Pay Commission Ministry of Finance * Report of Seventh Central Pay Commission Department of Expenditure, Ministry of Finance Military history of India Military of India Military pay and benefits Ministry of Defence (India) Pensions in India Veterans' affairs in India ","title":"Rank Pay"},{"id":"51404837","title":"Akin Famewo"},{"id":"51404838","text":"Barco is a surname.

The driving hours of commercial drivers (truck and bus drivers) are typically regulated by a set of rules known as the hours of service (HOS) in the United States and as Drivers' working hours in Europe. The Commercial Vehicle Driver Hours of Service Regulations vary in Canada and the United States.Hours of Service: Canada/U.S. Comparison Published on August 1, 2014, retrieved via the Wayback Machine on July 1, 2019 An ELD monitors a vehicle‚Äôs engine to capture data on whether the engine is running, whether the vehicle is moving, distance driven, and duration of engine operation.What is an electronic logging device (ELD)? Previously, paper logs or electronic on-board recorders (EOBR) were used for hours-of-service tracking. Even though recorder logs improve the accuracy of the data, the lack of a consistent data format meant that the logs needed to be regenerated to an equivalent hardware (\\"paper\\") format for review and enforcement. The Record of Duty Status (RoDS) definition within the ELD legislation defines a consistent format for enforcement personnel to review, so the ELD Mandate was created. The Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration (FMCSA) announced the Final Rule of the ELD mandate, and ELD regulations being implemented in several phases with a compliance date of 18 December 2017. Fleets had until December 2017 to implement certified ELDs to record hours.

Wagner (1923-2001) was an American virologist who spent time on the faculty at Yale University, Johns Hopkins University, and finally the University of Virginia School of Medicine, from which he retired as professor emeritus in 1994. His research focused on the vesicular stomatitis virus. Wagner died of cancer in 2001. Education Wagner attended Columbia University as an undergraduate and received his bachelor's degree in 1943, after which he began medical school at Yale Medical School and received his M.D. in 1946. Following his internship, he joined the U.S. Navy Medical Corps, where he was first exposed to virology research while assigned to the U.S. Navy Medical Research Institute in Bethesda, Maryland. After his time in the Navy, Wagner moved to England to work as a postdoctoral fellow with Christopher Andrewes. Academic career Wagner joined the faculty at Yale University in 1951 and then moved to Johns Hopkins in 1957, where he became the director of the Infectious Disease Division and later the head of the Division of Virology. In 1967 Wagner moved to the University of Virginia School of Medicine to serve as the chair of the Department of Microbiology. Under his leadership the department expanded dramatically, both in number of faculty and in breadth of research. Wagner also became the director of the newly created University of Virginia Cancer Center and was appointed the Marion McNulty and Marvin C. Weaver Professor of Oncology in 1984. Following a brief stint as the virology section editor for the Journal of Bacteriology, run by the American Society for Microbiology, Wagner served as the founding editor-in-chief of the Journal of Virology, working with fellow editors Lloyd Kozloff and Norman Salzman. The journal launched in 1966, and Wagner continued in his role for 15 years, overseeing a large expansion in the size of the journal before stepping down in 1982 and being succeeded by Edward M. Scolnick. With Heinz Fraenkel-Conrat, Wagner collaborated in editing a vast 19-volume treatise called Comprehensive Virology. The first volume was reviewed in 1975 as somewhat difficult to understand for those unfamiliar to the field, but likely valuable as a reference work. In the early 1980s, Wagner was among the group of American virologists who helped organize and became the founding members of the American Society for Virology. Wagner retired and assumed professor emeritus status at the University of Virginia in 1994, though he continued to be an active member of the community. His department - now the Department of Microbiology, Immunology, and Cancer Biology - awards the Robert R. Wagner Prize to excellent graduate students. Research Wagner has been recognized as a major contributor to the development of molecular virology. During the early 1960s, while at Johns Hopkins, he became involved in research on interferons, which eventually entered clinical use. Much of his research focused on the molecular biology of the vesicular stomatitis virus. With student Alice S. Huang, Wagner characterized what are now known as defective interfering particles.

Biography Alessandro Cesarini was born in Rome, Italy in 1592, the son of Giuliano Cesarini, marquis of Civitanova e Montecorato, and Livia Orsini. His family produced a number of cardinals including his great-grand uncle Cardinal Alessandro Cesarini, seniore (installed 1517); Giuliano Cesarini, seniore (installed 1426); and Giuliano Cesarini, iuniore (installed 1493).

Founded in 2008, DxOMark was originally owned by DxO Labs, part of DxOMark Image Labs SAS, a French engineering and consulting company, which is headquartered in Boulogne-Billancourt, Paris, France. DxOMark Image Labs was separated from DxO Labs in September 2017, and was later re-branded to DxOMark in 2019. DxOMark is now a wholly independent privately-owned company. DxOMark scores are used in many independent news publications and specialist media sites, including: The Washington Post, The New York Times, Die Zeit, Le Monde, Les Numeriques, NDTV, India Today, The Indian Express, China Daily, Forbes, Wired, ZDNet, Extreme Tech, Tech Crunch, Tech Radar, CNET, PC World, Gizmodo, Endgadget, Digital Trends, The Next Web, The Verge, GSM Arena, Android Authority, Mac Rumors, Digital Photography Review, Shutterbug, Imaging Resource, Trusted Reviews, T3, XDA-Developers, First Post, Xataka, PetaPixel, Tom's Guide, BGR, Sina, and Sohu. DxOMark rating systems The score(s) awarded by DxOMark are based upon a comprehensive and highly-documented, but commercially secret methodology. An overall 'headline' (v) score is awarded, but that is based upon an aggregated overview of a number of other very specific and detailed test attributes, although the actual weighting of those individual attributes is unknown. DxOMark themselves stress that \\"the overall score is not a weighted sum of the sub-scores. It is a proprietary and confidential mapping of sub-scores into a combined score\\". DxOMark also highlight that they consult directly with the equipment manufacturers, with the objective of helping them make better cameras. In respect of specific score figures, it is not clear what headroom or ceiling level is available to the DxOMark scoring system. Some early high performers might have suggested an upper limit of 100 points, yet later high performers are awarded scores in excess of 100. It is also important to note that the DxOMark score is not based on any averages. =Camera sensor rating= The DxOMark Sensor Score measures several important image quality metrics of the RAW image captured by the camera's sensor. The overall score is a confidential combination of three sub-scores: *Colour depth, measured in bits, called a Portrait score; *Dynamic range, measured in stops of dynamic range, called a Landscape score; *Low- light performance, measured in an ISO equivalent, called a Sports score. Another metric, the Perceptual MegaPixel (P-MPix), defined as 'the unit of a sharpness measurement', is used to rate the resolution a camera produces when paired to a particular lens. DxOMark claims that P-MPix is a more accurate and relevant value for photographers to consider than alternate measures of sharpness when evaluating camera and lens image quality. As of December 2015, the Canon EF 300mm f/2.8L IS II USM lens mounted on a Canon EOS 5DS R has the highest measured P-MPix (45 P-MPix), followed by the Carl Zeiss APO Sonnar T* 2/135 ZE (41 P-MPix on Canon EOS 5DS R and 36 P-MPix on Nikon D800E). =Camera lens rating= The DxOMark Lens Score provides ratings for camera lenses, as tested using its proprietary tool-set in combination with various camera models. As with the DxOMark Sensor Score, the DxOMark Lens Score is an aggregation of five separate sub-scores; namely: sharpness, distortion, vignetting, transmission, and chromatic aberration. =Smartphone camera rating= As smartphones began to overtake point-and-shoot cameras, DxOMark began testing smartphones and other mobile devices in 2011, and introduced DxOMark Mobile in 2012. A major update was made in September 2017, adding tests designed to stress the capabilities of current-model smartphones, including those with dual lenses; such as lower-light shooting, telephoto zoom, depth effect, and bokeh. In September 2019, the DxOMark Mobile score was renamed DxOMark Camera. DxOMark Camera Overall Score is the headline number reported for each tested device, and consists of a proprietary combination of DxOMark Camera Photo, and DxOMark Camera Video category scores. DxOMark's Camera Photo score is a proprietary combination of nine category sub-scores: *Exposure and contrast *Colour *Auto-focus *Texture *Noise *Artifacts *Night (enhanced from Flash, September 2019) *Zoom *Bokeh *Wide (added September 2019) DxOMark's Camera Video score includes six of the same sub-scores as DxOMark's Mobile Photo score (Exposure, Colour, Auto-focus, Texture, Noise, and Artifacts), along with Stabilisation. DxOMark's tests are conducted by the company's technical staff under a variety of lighting conditions; ranging from low-light 1 Lux, to bright daylight outdoors. Sub-scores are combined using a proprietary and confidential mapping into an overall score. Tests are also confined to default modes, except for Zoom and Bokeh, which has caused reviewers to be cautious when using them. =Selfie-camera rating= On 22 January 2019, DxOMark started to release the results of a new metric; testing the front-facing 'selfie' cameras on smartphones. These new standalone DxOMark Selfie tests are undertaken for both Photo and Video, though the 'headline' DxOMark Selfie score will combine both. For DxOMark Selfie Photo, there are sub-scores for Exposure, Colour, Focus, Texture, Noise, Artifacts, Flash, and Bokeh. For DxOMark Selfie Video, sub-scores include Exposure, Colour, Focus, Texture, Noise, Artifacts, and Stabilisation. =Smartphone audio rating= On 10 October 2019, DxOMark introduced a new Audio benchmark for smartphones. Phones are tested for playback using their internal speakers, and for recording using their built-in microphones. DxOMark Audio tested categories include: *Timbre (frequency response, treble/mid-range/bass, total balance, volume dependency) *Dynamics (attack, bass precision, punch, volume dependency) *Spatial (wideness, balance, distance, localisation) *Volume (maximum, minimum, user volume consistency) *Artifacts (noise, pumping, clipping, user artifacts, other artifacts) For recoding only: *Background (directivity, noise profile, artifacts) Comparison tool Users of the DxOMark website can select several devices of the same class, and have the website display a comparison of their test scores and graphical versions of the actual test data. Analyzer Analyzer is a suite of software tools published by DxOMark, that includes test targets and test equipment. It is used by camera companies, as well as press publications and websites; to test sensors, lenses, and standalone cameras, as well as mobile devices with cameras. Testing can be performed on both RAW and JPEG images, as well as video. Analyzer is also the analysis engine behind DxOMark.com Results can be displayed either numerically or graphically. Originally introduced by DxO Labs, Analyzer is now a product of DxOMark, which has been separated from DxO. Analyzer includes modules for testing optics, sensors, stabilisation, video, timing, and 3D features. Usage in industry DxOMark ratings are often used by the press to describe the image quality characteristics of their cameras and mobile devices. High DxOMark Camera ratings have also been featured as hallmarks of quality in vendor announcements and marketing materials, although reviewers are careful to note that the ratings only reflect image quality. DxOMark also provides consulting services to hardware manufacturers, related to image quality.

Early life and education Ida Alison Brown was born 16 August 1900 in Paddington, Sydney, New South Wales. She was educated at Fort Street Girls' High School, and went on to study her B.Sc. at the University of Sydney, graduating with Honours, winning the University medal in geology and the Deas Thomson scholarship in 1922.  Career  Giving up the scholarship in 1922 at the request of Professor Edgeworth David, she worked as a demonstrator in geology and petrology at the University until 1927, and researched the minerals of Broken Hill and geology of the south coast of New South Wales. After being awarded a Linnean-Macleay Fellowship from 1927-1931 she further worked on the geology of this region, undertook extensive mapping, travelled overseas visiting research institutes and attending scientific congresses. Brown took her D.Sc. in 1932, the second woman to do so at the University of Sydney, and then found work hard to find. She was unable to work for mining companies because women were forbidden from working underground. She again worked as a demonstrator until 1934, when she became Assistant Lecturer in palaeontology, following the illness of W.S. Dun. She spent considerable time developing her knowledge of palaeontology to the exclusion of other geological research, as well as carrying a full teaching load. Brown was promoted to full lecturer in 1940, and published a paper on the fossiliferous Silurian and Devonian sequences of the Yass district with Germaine Joplin, in 1941. She attempted to work with colleague, Dorothy Hill from the University of Queensland to publish internationally, but mainly focused on Australian publications and her teaching responsibilities. Moving from hard rock to soft rock studies, Brown's research evolved into the study of Palaeozoic invertebrates, specifically brachiopods, as well as stratigraphical studies. Her mapping skills were praised, and her Taemas map continues to be of use. She became a Senior Lecturer in 1945, but like many women, Ida Brown resigned from teaching in 1950, with her marriage to fellow geologist and colleague, William Rowan Browne.  Later life  William and Ida Browne worked from their home residence, undertaking fieldwork when required up until 1965. She published ten papers after her marriage to Browne. She assisted him on his field trips to Kosciusko and he assisted her on field trips to Yass and other regions of New South Wales. She was a member of the Royal Society of New South Wales and Linnean Society of New South Wales, and was the first woman president of the Linnean Society in 1945. She was Vice President of the Royal Society of New South Wales from 1942‚Äì1950, Honorary Editorial Secretary from 1950‚Äì1953 and first woman President in 1953. She was a member of the Australian National Research Council, ANZAAS and Geological Society of Australia. She was a generous donor of books to the Australian Museum and University of Wollongong libraries. She also supported the creation of the William Rowan Browne medal to honour her husband's legacy. Browne suffered from a paralysing illness from 1970 and died 21 October 1976 in Edgecliff, New South Wales. Her husband had predeceased her the previous year.

He served as executive director of the Virginia section of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People in his native Virginia from 1943-1976. Early and family life Banks was born in Lunenburg County, Virginia, to William Walter Banks and Daisy Hill Banks. His family moved to nearby West Virginia when he was a child. He attended public schools in Alderson in Greenbrier County and Bluefield in Mercer County. He attended Bluefield State College, that state's first college serving African Americans (founded 1895) and graduated with a major in physical science. Banks returned to Virginia, in 1935 taking a teaching job in Halifax County, and also served as that nonwhite school's principal. He then became a principal of Ruthville High School for African Americans in Charles City County, Virginia. In 1940, Banks married Vera Louise Bowman of Charlotte County, Virginia; they had one daughter. Career The NAACP had been fighting racial discrimination in Virginia, and the Banks family were members. In 1942, Oliver W. Hill, a Virginia native and NAACP lawyer who had recently won a lawsuit requiring equal pay for black teachers in Norfolk, Alston v. School Board of Norfolk, 112 F.2d 992 (4th Cir. 1940). met Banks, then a principal, about filing a similar lawsuit in Charles City County. However, before the lawsuit could actually be filed, both were drafted (although Hill was then 36 years old and seemed too old to be drafted).Oliver Hill, The Big Bang (Granthouse Publishers, 2007) pp. 184-85 Thus, both served in the U.S. Army during World War II. Banks became a sergeant and served in the Pacific Theatre. Shortly after they both returned from their wartime service, Banks agreed to serve as Executive Director of the NAACP's Virginia chapter, which was the largest in the county. The chapter's original president, Dr. Jesse Tinsley, had a dental practice (and several others held the office after 1954) and Hill had a legal practice, so Banks handled the chapter's day to day activities. The chapter had a very active legal arm, filing lawsuits against segregated public transportation, and later against Virginia's historic underfunding of black schools compared to schools serving only white children (the Virginia Constitution adopted in 1902 required segregated schools). Banks became heavily involved in school desegregation efforts, including in Davis v. County School Board of Prince Edward County, filed in 1951 and which became a companion case to Brown v. Board of Education. After U.S. Senator Harry F. Byrd declared a policy of Massive Resistance to Brown (which led to schools closing in several Virginia Communities and remaining closed for five years in Prince Edward County), two Virginia legislative committees (headed by John B. Boatwright and James M. Thomson) took aim at the NAACP, seeking both to force disclosure of its membership lists (which could lead to retaliation) and to curtail efforts by Banks and others to recruit plaintiffs. Before those committees became active, in the spring of 1956, Banks claimed the NAACP had 84,000 members in the state, divided among 107 branches (of 72,063 \\"Negroes\\" registered and qualified as voters of 827,835 voters in the state for the January 6, 1956 referendum on the tuition grants in the Stanley Plan). Charles City County (his base and where many blacks had paid the poll tax and voted), voted against the proposed tuition grants (which supported segregation academies), unlike the rest of the Commonwealth.Robbins L. Gates, The Making of Massive Resistance: Virginia's Politics of Public School Desegregation 1954-1956 (University of North Carolina Press, 1964) pp. 145 Banks became an important witness in the ultimately successful NAACP efforts to strike down those laws, showing the organization's membership dropped precipitously after the state legislative committees subpoenaed NAACP membership lists. Banks also consistently sat with the organization's white attorneys in Virginia courthouses, thus helping desegregate them. The United State Supreme Court ultimately reversed all those anti-NAACP laws in Scull v. Virginia ex rel. Committee on Law Reform and Racial Activities (1959) and NAACP v. Button (1963). Despite the hatred expressed by some white Virginians for the NAACP, Banks drove around the state in a car with a NAACP sticker, and was not afraid to act alone. He was arrested for trespass on October 17, 1961 in Lynchburg, after he sought and was refused service in the \\"Whites Only\\" section of the Norfolk and Western Railway Company restaurant. In 1963, a white sawmill worker assaulted Banks for sitting in the white section of a Charlotte County restaurant. Banks was also involved in the sit-ins by Virginia Union University students (where Dean Thomas Henderson also supported desegregation efforts).Hill at p. 189, 296 Death and legacy Banks retired on December 31, 1976 and the following year moved with his wife to California where their daughter lived with her family. He died of kidney and heart failure in an Ingleside, California hospital in 1986, and was buried at Inglewood Park Cemetery. The Virginia NAACP honored Banks at its conference celebrating Brown's 59th anniversary, shortly before his death, and in 1992 posthumously awarded him its Civil Rights Emancipation Emeritus Award.

Gameplay  The goal of the game is to build up both your stats and your relationship with your club-mates so that you can become close friends with one, ask them to go to Prom with you, and face down Chad, your rival, at last. The game divides the player's attributes into three - Cool, Nice, Tough - and various decisions throughout the game, such as on the weekends or in classes, influences this rating. While the player is never told the level of attributes precisely, they can ask the mysterious lunch server, the Collector, to give them a relative understanding of how high each one is. There are six clubs to choose from divided between AM clubs - Sports, Study Hall, and Music - and PM clubs - Art, Drama, and Magic. Choice of club determines the possible friends the player will have access to. (The player is not allowed to switch clubs once they have been chosen) There are three characters in each club - one for each of the attributes the player can raise. Club sessions appear at various points throughout the year, as well as school-based events and holiday festivals. The player can gain points with characters by picking a selection they like in club sessions, or selecting them in events/festivals. If the player raises an associated attribute high enough and interacts with a character enough, they'll be given an opportunity to invite them over to their house. Once there, the character will ask the player a question: sometimes, this will be harmless, and will result in the player and character becoming friends no matter what - but prouder or more abrasive characters may entirely break off a potential friendship if the player gives the wrong response.  Development and release  The game was announced in PC Gamer a day before its release on Steam, along with details on the second game it was meant to raise funds for - PANIC in the Multiverse!. A widescreen update later on also released the game on Google Play, making it available on Android systems like phones and tablets. The music was composed by Lena \\"Raine\\" Chappelle.

It was renamed the Center Theater, following a renovation in 1951. In 1983, the theater closed and the building was demolished. Early years Shea's Hippodrome Theatre was designed by architect, Leon H. Lempert, Jr. and constructed in 1914. It was located at 580 Main Street in downtown Buffalo now known as \\"Theatre Historic District\\". The theater was entertainment mogul, Michael Shea's first movie house in Buffalo with 2,800 seats and a staff of nearly 100 employees. It was a state-of-the-art facility for its time and was designed and furnished with little concern for expense. Shea's Hippodrome Theatre was praised for the convenience and comfort it provided for its patrons. A custom pipe organ was designed and installed in 1922 by The Rudolph Wurlitzer Co., model: Opus 585. In 1957, the organ was sold and changed owners several times in the ensuing decades. In 2005, the organ was purchased and restored by the Colonial Theatre in Phoenixville, Pennsylvania and is currently operational.  Renovation  In 1951, in an effort to modernize the facility, Shea's Hippodrome Theatre underwent a major renovation designed by architect Michael J. DeAngelis. The original marquee was replaced with modern signage and the building was renamed the \\"Center Theater\\", after being sold by Shea to Paramount decades earlier. Possibly by design, many of the original architectural details were unable to be seen, due to the darkness of the renovated interior spaces. It remained a movie theater until it closed in 1983.  Shea's Performing Arts Center  Shea's Performing Arts Center is located in Buffalo's Theatre Historic District and is comprised 3 theaters in close proximity to each other on Main Street, where Shea's Hippodrome Theatre once stood. The three theatres are: Shea's Buffalo Theatre, Shea's Smith Theatre, and Shea's 710 Theatre.

The situation is essentially similar to that in the other former Soviet republics of Central Asia. Reliable specifics about corruption can be difficult to come by, however, as can hard information about the effectiveness of supposed anti-corruption initiatives. Corruption, according to a 2015 article in The Diplomat, is present in every aspect of Tajikistan's culture. Examples include students paying bribes for better grades, bribes for the release of prisoners, and ‚Äúsmugglers tipping border guards to look the other way‚Äù as well as many others. Freedom House said much the same thing in 2016, calling corruption a problem affecting every aspect of Tajik society. According to Transparency International, citizens of Tajikistan consider government bureaucrats and services to be the most corrupt institutions, with police, customs, and tax-collection authorities at the top of the list, followed by college and hospital administrators. In a 2010 survey, Tajikistanis said they were most likely to be confronted with bribery during dealings with the traffic police (53.6%), followed closely by land purchases (53.3%) and dealings with universities (45.4%). Almost two-thirds believed that the level of corruption in the country was high and unlikely to change soon; about half thought that most officials take bribes; and about half viewed corruption negatively. Transparency International's 2017 Corruption Perception Index ranks the country 161st place out of 180 countries Background Tajikistan gained independence in 1991, when the Soviet Union collapsed, and the ensuing civil war, waged from 1992 to 1997, left the people largely apathetic and passive in the face of government authority. Landlocked and poor in natural resources, Tajikistan remains the poorest and least developed of the former Soviet republics, with half of the inhabitants living on less than 2 USD a day. Many Tajiks have emigrated to Russia or Kazakhstan, and the large amounts of money they send back home make Tajikistan one of the more remittance-dependent countries on earth. There are, moreover, major problems with organized crime, drug trafficking, religious extremism, and drug abuse. Scale of corruption The 2012 Corruption Perception Index, published by Transparency International, gave Tajikistan a score of 22 out of 100, placing it in 157th place out of 176. Several of its neighbors received similar scores: Pakistan (27), Uzbekistan (17), Turkmenistan (17), and Kyrgyzstan (24). Afghanistan did considerably worse, scoring only 8 points. Tajikistan received a score of 9 out of 100, for control of corruption on the World Bank‚Äôs 2009 Worldwide Governance Indicators (WGI). This score represented a drop from 18 in 2007. =Perceptions= In a 2010 survey by the United Nations Development Programme, almost 80% of respondents said their country was corrupt. Government corruption President Emomali Rakhmon with President Barack Obama and wife Michelle Obama Tajikistan is not considered a free country; Freedom House has called the country's multi-party system a \\"democratic fa√ßade.\\" Government employees and officials often extort money from citizens, especially from civil servants. For instance, some public employees were required to buy shares in the Rogun Dam in order to keep their jobs. Owing to corruption, incompetence, and a lack of public resources and facilities, the country's government administration is highly inefficient, and bribery is common. Farmers and entrepreneurs in particular have to deal with corrupt officials on a regular basis. The current regime is awash in patronage, cronyism, and self-enrichment. Political and economic power is concentrated the hands of the family of Emomali Rakhmon, president since 1992. The government has ties to organized crime and accountability is rarely present. U.S. diplomatic cables leaked in 2010 noted that members of Rakhmon's family and inner circle are widely viewed as being the most corrupt people in the country. An example of the problem of nepotism at the highest level is Rakhmon's son Rustam Emomali, who by his mid-20s had already been a member the Dushanbe city council, head of the Tajikistan Football Federation, owner of a major football club, head of the Customs Service, and head of the country's anti-corruption agency. In January 2017, Rustam Emomali was appointed Mayor of Dushanbe, a key position, which is seen by some analysts as the next step to the top of the government. Similarly, the president made his daughter Ozoda Emomali as the deputy minister of foreign affairs in 2009, and five years later appointed her as first deputy minister. Her husband, Jamoliddin Nuraliyev, became first deputy finance minister in 2008 and a deputy chairman of the National Bank in 2015. Generally speaking, details of government budgets are not made available to the public. Government officials and high- level employees are required by law to disclose their assets, but their declarations are never audited. Corrupt Tajik officials have siphoned billions of dollars from state-owned banks and enterprises into offshore accounts. According to the IMF, about $3.5 billion, or more than a third of the country's annual GDP, has ended up in such accounts. The state-run Talco aluminum smelter is owned by British Virgin Islands-based firms, and its revenue, instead of being returned to the state budget, has been used as a slush fund for Tajik officials. =Elections= Elections are characterized by massive fraud, and members of opposition parties are routinely bought off, threatened, exiled, or imprisoned. While the law limits donations allowed to be made to political parties from a person and candidates, the financial accounts of parties and politicians are not audited. =Judiciary= Although the judiciary is nominally independent, in practice it is under the control of the president, who has the power to hire and fire judges at will. President Rakhmon's power over the courts has intensified over time. Judges are widely viewed as incompetent, and many of them solicit illegal payments in order to settle cases or release inmates from prison. Conflicts of interests in legal cases are common, with no safeguards readily available. =Impunity= The degree to which corrupt leaders in Tajikistan enjoy impunity is reflected in the case of Muradali Alimardon. Despite being found in 2009 to have made $550 million in illicit loans to family-related projects, Alimardon was promoted from National Bank chairman to deputy prime minister, after which, according to The Economist, he took a $120 million more in unauthorized loans from state-owned Agroinvestbank. Police Police officers, especially traffic police, are viewed as being highly corrupt. In particular, they are seen as catering to elites, who are virtually immune from arrest and prosecution, rather than serving citizens. Police salaries, moreover, are low, and officers routinely solicit bribes to supplement their incomes. Many members of the police force also collaborate with organized criminals, notably drug smugglers. As of 2012, about a third of Tajikistan‚Äôs GDP came from heroin trafficking, which, according to the U.S. State Department, occurs with the aid of law enforcement and government officials. Business Business executives in Tajikistan, according to the World Economic Forum‚Äôs 2013 Global Competitiveness Report, view corruption as the fourth largest obstacle to business in Tajikistan, behind tax rates, government regulations, and poor access to financing. In 2015, Tajikistan ranked at 166th out of 189 countries on the World Bank‚Äôs Ease of Doing Business ranking place, placing it at the bottom of the Europe and Central Asia region. According to a 2008 World Bank survey, over 44% of business people say they were expected to present civil servants with ‚Äúgifts,‚Äù and over a third had experienced bribery demands during the previous year. Healthcare Health workers are generally not well paid, and rely on gifts and bribes to supplement their income. Many citizens must pay bribes in order to receive supposedly free medical care or to secure a hospital bed. Since many healthcare professionals received their degrees as a result of payment instead of education, the quality of care is often poor, and the best practitioners can demand an even higher bribe than might otherwise be asked. Conventional knowledge is that those who can afford it would better spend their money bribing a customs official for a visa to Russia to access healthcare there. Universities As a rule, young people must pay sizeable bribes to get into universities and receive better grades. A salient example of this is the Tajikistani healthcare system. Many healthcare professionals in Tajikistan receive their degree in medicine via a two-year university correspondence course, at the end of which there is a single in-person exam. It is understood that the cash turned in to the proctor determines the grade rather than the actual exam result. This is one of numerous factors contributing to the low quality of healthcare in Tajikistan. The universal corruption in Tajikistani universities is part of the reason that no universities in the country are internationally accredited. Unfortunately, it is also common in secondary and even elementary schools. Teachers or professors who require more bribes from their students are able to bribe their supervisors more and receive promotions whereas teachers or professors who do not accept or offer bribes can be overlooked for promotion or simply fired to be replaced with someone that has bribed school officials. Since all university qualifications are merely purchased, professors and teachers often have no knowledge of their field or teaching ability. Anti-corruption activities U.S. diplomatic cables written in 2006 and 2007 and leaked in 2010 called ‚Äúanti-corruption‚Äù a new buzzword in Tajikistan, but suggested that there was little substance to the government's purported efforts on this front. A law passed in 2008 professes to set in place strong safeguards and to protect whistleblowers, but in practice corruption continues to flourish. Similarly, another law professes to guarantee access to government information, but in practice it is difficult for most citizens to gain such access. The Office of the Human Rights Ombudsman was established in 2008, but the government and judiciary pay little heed to complaints submitted to it. Although the Ombudsman is nominally independent, he is personally appointed by the president and can be replaced by him. There are laws supposedly requiring transparency in political party financing, but they tend to be ineffective. Other laws require that announcements and tenders be published and that public procurement officials declare their assets, but they are not properly enforced. The Anti-Corruption Network (ACN) for Eastern Europe and Central Asia was founded by the OECD, European Union, and several banking and business organizations in 1998 to support anti-corruption efforts in the region. In 2003, the ACN launched an initiative which involves producing country reviews for Tajikistan and seven other countries. Tajikistan has been a member of the United Nations Convention against Corruption (UNCAC) since 2006. Since 2012, the OSCE's Tajikistan office has contained a Good Governance Unit, which seeks to work with the government to fight corruption. Also, Tajikistan is one of four countries in the region chosen by the World Bank to test its Country Governance and Anti-Corruption process. The ineffectiveness of purported anti- corruption efforts is reflected in the fact that the nation's agency for the state's control of its budget and opposing corruption is generally viewed as one of the country's most corrupt institutions. Most of those who are prosecuted for corruption by the agency are employed in the lower rungs of the civil service, with the bulk of prosecutions occurring in the health, education, and agriculture sectors. This agency, formed in 2007, is under Rakhmon's control, not parliament's, guaranteeing that no one will be prosecuted for corruption without his personal approval. In an example of the high-level nepotism that is well-nigh ubiquitous in Tajikistan, the agency has been headed since March 2015 by Rakhmon's son Rustam. A June 2015 report noted that Rustam had just arrested Hasan Rajabov (sometimes transliterated as Khasan Radzhabov), an adviser to the president, on corruption charges. Rajabov was accused of massive embezzlement and soliciting bribes. Also arrested was Izzattullo Azizov, a member of the state religious affairs committee, who was accused of soliciting $2,000 bribes from Muslims wanting to travel to Mecca for the hajj. In addition, Rustam has arrested several other senior officials for corruption. One problem with anti-corruption efforts is that persons in power routinely use corruption allegations to try to bring down their political opponents. In June 2016, a government newspaper accused Muhiddin Kabiri, the exiled leader of the opposition, of illicit property purchases, and he has avoided prosecution only by staying abroad. Zaid Saidov, a former industry minister who had attempted to establish an opposition party, was targeted with corruption charges in 2013, and was arrested and sentenced to 51 years in prison. A May 2014 OECD report called on Tajikistan to step up its fight against corruption. While praising the country for passing anti- corruption laws, the OECD urged the regime to enforce those laws.

The only species known in the genus is Lohuecotitan pandafilandi, described and named in 2016.. Discovery and naming The geography of Villalba de la Sierra, where remains of Lohuecotitan have been found The fossil remains of Lohuecotitan were discovered in the site of Lo Hueco, Fuentes, Cuenca, which is part of the Villalba de la Sierra Formation. The formation dates from the Upper Campanian to the Lower Maastrichtian, and would have represented a muddy coastal floodplain. Multiple partial sauropod skeletons have been discovered at this site, with the teeth and braincases recovered representing at least two distinct types of titanosaur. The holotype specimen of Lohuecotitan, HUE-EC-01, is a disarticulated partial skeleton consisting of cervical, dorsal, sacral, and caudal vertebrae, ribs, an ulna, both ischia, a pubis, a femur, a fibula, and a tibia, along with some indeterminate remains. The name of Lohuecotitan combines a reference to the type locality with titan (which refers to the Greek titans). The specific name, pandafilandi, is derived from the name of a giant, Pandafilando de la fosca vista, in the novel Don Quixote. Description Statue of adult Lohuecotitan and juvenile outside the Castilla-La Mancha Paleontological Museum Lohuecotitan was recognized by its describers as having a number of unique characteristics (autapomorphies) not seen in other titanosaurs. In the dorsal vertebrae, the edges of the postspinal laminae extend outwards. In the first several caudal vertebrae, the medial spinoprezygapophyseal and spinopostzygapophyseal laminae respectively connect to the prespinal and postspinal laminae on the bottom surface. In addition, due to the way that the prespinal and postspinal laminae project upwards, the neural spine of the vertebra appears to be V-shaped from the side, and resemble a Greek cross in cross-section. Each middle caudal vertebra has two roughened structures that extend from the top of the back face onto the top surface of the vertebra. Finally, the bottom portion of each half of the haemal arches in the posterior caudal vertebrae is split fully into two articular facets. These traits form a unique combination not seen in other titanosaurs, along with the centrodiapophyseal laminae being widened on the top and bottom edges in the front and middle dorsal vertebrae (as also seen in Saltasaurus), and a rounded protrusion being present between the front and side trochanters of the fibula (also seen in Jainosaurus). A number of the bones of Lohuecotitan were internally pneumatized, including the cervical vertebrae, sacral vertebrae, and ilium. As is common in somphospondylans, the pneumatic fossae on the cervical vertebrae are shallow; this was also the case in the dorsal vertebrae. The cervical and dorsal vertebrae are opisthocoelous; the caudal vertebrae were procoelous (a characteristic common in Lithostrotia). The seventh and eighth tail vertebrae are fused together; this probably represents a pathology. As in other titanosauriforms, the dorsal ribs are compressed and blade-like. The ulna was robust, and the bottom surface of the tibia was oval-shaped, as is common in titanosaurs. Classification Lohuecotitan was in 2016 recovered as a lithostrotian titanosaur, more derived than Malawisaurus. Its position among the lithostrotians is supported by the sharp angle of its zygapophyseal articulations. The consensus of the 20 most parsimonious phylogenetic trees recovered is shown below.

The sports car is a product of collaboration between Aston Martin and Red Bull Racing to develop a track-oriented car entirely usable and enjoyable as a road car, conceived by Dr Andy Palmer, Christian Horner, Adrian Newey and Simon Sproule in The Birch Gastropub Woburn over sausage and mash. The car's makers claim the title of fastest street- legal car in the world for it. Adrian Newey, Red Bull Racing's Chief Technical Officer and the world's most successful F1 designer aided in the design of the car. Its main competitor is the Mercedes-AMG One. Before the start of the 2019 Formula One British Grand Prix, the car made a lap of the Silverstone circuit for the first time.  Nomenclature  The original codename was Nebula, an acronym for Newey, Red Bull and Aston Martin. The name AM-RB 001 was chosen as the final codename, and was decided since Aston Martin and Red Bull Racing had collaborated all throughout the project. AM stands for Aston Martin, and RB stands for Red Bull. 001 may be a possible reference to it being the first production car the two have collaborated on. In March 2017, Aston Martin revealed that the car would be named Valkyrie, after the Norse mythological figure. According to Red Bull, the name was chosen to continue the tradition of \\"V\\" nomenclature of Aston Martin's automobiles and to distinguish the vehicle as a high-performance car (the \\"V\\" was used as the distinguishing factor).  Design  = Exterior = Rear view A show car was initially unveiled to the public in order to give the public an idea of its design. The design was nearly finished at the time in a near-production-ready form. The exterior of the car is extremely aerodynamic for a sports car, with an extensively open underfloor, that works on the principle of the venturi effect, that can fit an entire person, and is capable of producing of downforce at high speed. Gaps on top of the car (for example, the above the front axle and the roof intake) and a large front splitter aid in generating downforce. The wheels are also designed to manage the airflow and be as light as possible at the same time. = Interior = Interior The interior design was leaked online on 20 June 2017 and gave a preview of the car's design. The interior has no gauge cluster, but rather a collection of screens. By the left and right corners are the screens for the camera side mirrors. One screen sits at the top of the center console, which may have a collection of live vehicle information, and regular vehicle controls, but this is not confirmed. A screen is used on the race-inspired steering wheel and acts as the driver gauge cluster. Dials and switches sit beside the wheel screen to allow for easier changes without driving interruption. The seats, formed from hollow carbon fibre straight into interior perimeter, are bucket variants, and have two seat belts for each car seat. Because of the extremely small interior and doors (which are practically roof-only hatches), each seat is designed specifically for the owner's body shape through 3D scanning. A removable steering wheel provides slightly more space for entry and exit.  Specifications  = Valkyrie = In February 2017, Aston Martin revealed most of the vehicle's specifications. The final specifications were revealed later in the year. Several manufacturers (other than Aston Martin and Red Bull) have taken part in the Valkyrie's construction, those being Cosworth, Ricardo, Rimac Automobili, Multimatic, Alcon, Integral Powertrain Ltd, Bosch, Surface Transforms, Wipac, and Michelin. The car contains a 6.5-litre naturally- aspirated V12 engine tailored by Cosworth, which produces around at 10,500 rpm, with a redline of 11,100 rpm. This will make it the most powerful naturally-aspirated engine ever to be fitted to a production road car, as well as the highest-revving. KERS-style boost system akin to those fitted to F1TM cars, the Aston Martin Valkyrie‚Äôs hybrid system has been developed by two main technical partners; Integral Powertrain Ltd, who supplied the bespoke electric motor, and Rimac for the lightweight hybrid battery system.https://media.astonmartin.com/aston-martin-valkyrie-the-ultimate- hybrid-powertrain-for-the-ultimate- hypercar/https://integralp.com/communication/aston-martin-valkyrie-the- ultimate-hybrid-powertrain-for-the-ultimate-hypercar/ As a result, the full hybrid system contributes an additional 160bhp of power and a further 280Nm of available torque with the certified max power output of Aston Martin Valkyrie standing at a stunning 1,160bhp @ 10,500rpm. Equally, with the full hybrid system, peak torque will stand at 900Nm @ 6,000rpm At the same time the power output figures were released, the weight was announced to be , surpassing the intended 1:1 power-to-weight ratio with per ton. The car can accelerate to 60 mph (97 km/h) from a standstill in a time of 2.6 seconds. The exhausts exit at the top of the car, near the engine, similar to those of Formula One cars and the Porsche 918 Spyder. Bosch supplies the Valkyrie's ECU unit, traction control system, and ESP. The braking system is provided by Alcon and Surface Transforms. The front and rear lights are manufactured by Wipac. The car has all-carbon fibre bodywork and is installed with a carbon fibre Monocell from manufacturer Multimatic. Michelin supplies the Valkyrie with the company's high-performance Sport Cup 2 tyres, having sizes of 265/35-ZR20 at the front and 325/30-ZR21 at the rear. The wheels are constructed out of lightweight magnesium alloy (20\\" front, 21\\" rear) with race-spec centre-lock wheel nuts to reduce mass. In 2020, after Red Bull Racing's Red Bull Racing RB16 had its first shakedown in Silverstone Circuit, drivers Max Verstappen and Alexander Albon drove the car around the track. = Valkyrie AMR Pro = The track only variant of the Valkyrie called the Valkyrie AMR Pro was introduced at the 2017 Geneva Motor Show. Only 25 units will be produced, all of which have already been sold. The AMR Pro uses the same 6.5-litre naturally-aspirated V12 engine as used in the Valkyrie road car along with the Rimac Energy Recovery System, although the KERS system will be reprogrammed in terms of its control systems. The engine will also be modified, which means the AMR Pro will have increased engine power output figures than its road legal counterpart. The AMR Pro uses smaller 18-inch wheels at the front and rear. This is to allow the Michelin racing tyres (based on LMP1 race cars) to actually fit the car, with F1-inspired carbon-carbon brakes to aid braking performance. The air- conditioning system and infotainment screens have been removed, and have been replaced with racing counterparts. The car will be able to generate 3.3 g lateral force during cornering and 3.5 g during braking. Its top speed is intended to be higher than the road car, at . The car's exhaust will have very minimal parts to silence the engine. The AMR Pro will have a significantly more aggressive design, with a LMP1-style rear aerodynamic fin, a large dual- element rear spoiler, and a large rear diffuser. Production The road car's production will be limited to 150 units at a unit price of USD3 million. The AMR Pro production will be limited to 25 units at a unit price of USD3.5 million. Both versions have sold out.  Resale policy  Aston Martin CEO Andy Palmer enlisted a policy in a Twitter post on 4 July 2017, stating that if the owner were to \\"flip\\" the car (buy and sell quickly to make a profit), the owner would not be provided the opportunity to buy any further special edition models from Aston Martin.

Annie lived in Columbia, Missouri, and worked for prominent families as a cook until she started her own catering business. Annie became famous in Missouri for her widely sold beaten biscuits. Through her cooking, Annie amassed a sizable fortune and purchased rental properties and farms in and around Boone County.  Early life  Annie \\"Knowles\\" Fisher was born on December 3, 1867, in Boone County. She was one of eleven children born to former slaves Robert and Charlotte Knowles . From an early age, Annie was put in charge of cooking for the family. Although Annie attended school for a short time, she eventually quit school to help support her family. Annie found her love of cooking while working in kitchens of wealthy white families in the Columbia area. She was paid little and received second hand clothing as one of the \\"perks\\" of the job. Annie noted later in life for a newspaper article that although she was grateful for the second hand clothing, she wanted to make a good living so that she could afford new clothes. Annie went to work for the Lenoir-Nifong family of Maplewood. In 1890, Annie began to work for George Bingham Rollins and the Sigma Alpha Epsilon fraternity at the University of Missouri.  Cooking, catering and entrepreneurship  Annie saved most of the money she made cooking to start her catering business which she operated out of her restaurant, the Wayside Inn, which was located at the sight of her childhood home behind Grindstone schoolhouse. She reportedly had over 1,000 place settings of china and handled many large catered events for the University of Missouri. One of her largest banquets at an Alumni dinner for the University of Missouri she was paid 1,200 dollars at a price of two dollars per plate. Annie's beaten biscuits became so popular that Missourians who had moved out of state would mail order her biscuits to be delivered to states as far away as New York and California. Annie cooked in what she referred to as, \\"old Missouri style,\\" which meant she used local ingredients to give her food a distinct flavor and her cooking became so popular that she began endorsing local businesses such as the Boone County Mill's H-P flour which she used in her famous biscuits. In 1911, a Sedalia hostess who handled catering for the Missouri State fair made sure Fisher's biscuits were on the presidential table for William Howard Taft's visit. Fisher's ingenuity didn't end in the kitchen, she invented a specific cutter for her biscuits that would keep them from sticking to the surface of the cutter and after Fisher's mail order business had taken off, she incorporated a biscuit brake to meet the demand for her biscuits. In a news article, Fisher reported she usually makes around one million biscuits a year and around 50 dozen biscuits every hour with the help from her daughter. By 1919, Fisher was making 500 dollars a month on selling her biscuits alone, she sold them for 15 cents a dozen. Using the profits from her cooking and catering businesses, Fisher bought her first house in 1901 and paid it off in two years. After her first property purchase, Fisher went on to buy 18 rental properties in the downtown Columbia area, most of which were along what is now Ash street and fifth street. Later after Fisher's catering business had become quite successful, she purchased a 58-acre farm outside of Columbia where she raised livestock and crops to use in her cooking. = \\"Old Missouri Style\\" Beaten Biscuit recipe = Fisher's recipe included 1 quart of sifted flour, 1/3 cup of pure lard, 1/3 cup of butter, 1 cup of sweetened water, and salt to taste. Ingredients are mixed thoroughly and beaten for 15 minutes to make biscuits light and fluffy. Fisher said beating the biscuits was meant to, \\"put life into them.\\" Published in the University Missourian on March 17, 1919  Personal life  Fisher was considered by those who met her to be a strong, witty businesswoman who was not afraid to speak her mind. In 1919, Fisher gave a speech at a meeting of the National Negro Business League. In her speech, Fisher told those assembled how to make a profit from catering and about her life growing up. She said she was a 57-year-old woman who was not afraid to tell her age. In 1907, Fisher divorced her husband William and offered him a little over 100 dollars to not contest the divorce in court. William refused and was awarded nothing by the court system. Fisher said that her marriage wasn't a success and that for her to be successful she had to believe in herself and no one else. Fisher put her daughter Lucille through college and a music conservatory with the profits from her catering business. Fisher's first home was a 16-room house on Park Avenue which stood until 1960. In the 1920s she had a house built along Old Highway 63. During construction, she bought the materials, hired her own workers, and stayed on the property in a tent to oversee construction. Fisher was a celebrated personality in Columbia, with multiple articles written about her in the University Missourian. One particularly interesting article was her suggestions for Thanksgiving dinner. Fisher rented her properties out to black families who couldn't find housing easily in 1913. Annie gave out her recipes freely, but noted that she couldn't teach the common sense needed to cook her food. In a 1927 article in the Springfield Leader, Fisher's estimated net worth was approximately 100,000 dollars. Fisher was buried in a modest grave in 1938 at the Memorial Park Cemetery in Columbia. Columbia University Missourian, September 20, 1914, Page 6  Legacy  Annie Fisher's legacy lives on during black history month when a Columbia woman dresses as Fisher and visits schools to share her story with children to share with them how local African American's have helped to shape the history of Boone County.

Several miles of the railroad were built, and financial troubles or some unknown reason were the cause of its demise.  History  In 1884, it was planned that a railroad be built from Murphy's station along the Southern Pacific Railroad tracks to Saratoga, with the long-term goal of building a collective 22 miles of track in order to reach the mines of New Almaden. At least five miles of track were laid, and the railroad was likely built from Murphy's station all the way to Saratoga. If this were the case, the name \\"Saratoga and Almaden Railroad\\" may have been chosen to garner support for the unbuilt section of the line. Currently, the most identifiable features along the old right of way are a creek channel owned by the Santa Clara Valley Water District and Blaney Road in Cupertino.  Funding and late history  The railroad had at least $200,000 in capital at their disposal, which came at least in part from 150 gold bonds issued around 1885 that were signed by the company president D.M. Pyle and the company secretary. These gold bonds expired twenty years later, but the railroad ran into financial troubles as soon as 1886. Notably, the Southern Pacific Railroad and Peninsular Railway began service on the Mayfield Cutoff in 1908, just three years after the gold bonds expired.

It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2014. The park consists of the Chautauqua Auditorium, Asa Platt gates, Metcalf cabin, a fish house, a small stone bridge, and a shelter house. History The Sac City Chautauqua Association was formed in December, 1904 with 120 people buying subscriptions. Chautauqua programs were held at the fairgrounds in 1905, 1906, and 1907. In 1908 they bought the property between the fairgrounds and the North Raccoon River for $1,275. The Des Moines architectural firm of Proudfoot & Bird designed the auditorium and it was built by local contractor W.J. Gordon. It was completed in time for the 1908 Chautauqua. The structure resembles a Chautauqua tent. It features an octagonal front, pillars and open rafters, ceiling, open sides, and glass windows in the upper tier that provide ventilation when open. It originally had a dirt floor. By 1926 the Chautauqua movement was over here, and the following year the Sac City Park Board assumed the ownership of the park. The other elements in the park generally date from after the Park Board's ownership of the park. The gates are named for Asa Platt, who built the first house in Sac City and was known for his philanthropy, including the local Chautauquas. They were built sometime before 1931. Changes in streets and the entrance to the park have subsequently by-passed the gates. Built by David Metcalf in 1854, the Metcalf cabin was the first residential building in what would become Sac County. It was moved to the park about the time the city took control of it. The simple frame fish house is a place for anglers to clean their fish. A fish pond was located near the auditorium, and the stone walking bridge crossed it. The bridge was built sometime before 1935, and the pond was removed in the 1970s. The stone shelter house is a picnic shelter that was built by the Works Progress Administration in 1939.

It was discovered in 2011 and is a component of the skin flora in healthy adults. Discovery HPyV9 was first discovered in 2011 by generic PCR used to screen clinical samples from patients who were immunocompromised for various reasons. The virus was identified in a sample from a kidney transplant recipient and sequenced to reveal a genome of typical polyomavirus structure, particularly closely related to the African green monkey lymphotropic polyomavirus (LPV). Previous studies had found up to 30% seroprevalence of antibodies to LPV, which was interpreted as possibly indicating that LPV could infect humans as well as monkeys. Experiments revealed that LPV and HPyV9 antibodies can cross-react, supporting the hypothesis that the LPV observations represent HPyV9 seropositivity. Taxonomy HPyV9 was reported to have 75% sequence identity to the African green monkey lymphotropic polyomavirus. In the 2015 taxonomic update to the polyomavirus group, the International Committee on Taxonomy of Viruses classified HPyV9 as a member of the genus Alphapolyomaviridae, whose type species is murine polyomavirus (Mus musculus polyomavirus 1). Prevalence All known human polyomaviruses are fairly common in healthy adult populations and are usually asymptomatic. In studies that profile polyomavirus seroprevalence, or prevalence of detectable antibodies against viral proteins indicating either past or present exposure in immunocompetent adults, HPyV9 tends to have a relatively lower prevalence compared to other human polyomaviruses. Estimates of HPyV9 prevalence have ranged from approximately 30‚Äì50%, with conflicting evidence about the presence of any effects of gender and age on observed seroprevalence. Studies of the prevalence of HPyV9 DNA‚Äîindicating actively replicating virus‚Äîsuggest that this is quite rare, around 1%. HPyV9 infections that persist over time and involve continuous shedding have not been observed, although this does occur for other human polyomaviruses. Clinical manifestations As with many recently discovered human polyomaviruses, the clinical significance of HPyV9 is poorly characterized. Attempts to detect polyomaviruses in a variety of tumor types have consistently found that HPyV9 is either absent or present at very low viral loads, indicating that it is unlikely to be causally related to the tumor.

He joined a volunteer battalion in 1791 and transferred to a light cavalry regiment as a junior officer in 1793. He earned promotion to squadron commander and was acting commander of his regiment at Hohenlinden in 1800. After serving in a staff position at Austerlitz in 1805, he led a light cavalry regiment at Jena in 1806. Promoted to general of brigade he led his horsemen at Abensberg, Raab and Wagram in 1809. During the French invasion of Russia he fought at Ostrovno, Smolensk and Borodino in 1812. During the 1813 German Campaign he led a cavalry brigade at Dennewitz and Leipzig. After being appointed general of division he fought at Second Bar-sur-Aube and Saint-Dizier in 1814. During the Hundred Days he rallied to Napoleon and led a light cavalry division in the Waterloo campaign. After 15 years of inactivity, he was restored to favor in the 1830s. Thereafter he held a number of commands and was appointed to the Chamber of Peers. His surname is one of the names inscribed under the Arc de Triomphe, on Column 20. Revolution Jacquinot was born in Melun on 3 August 1772. After attending military school at Pont-√†-Mousson he joined the 1st Battalion of Meurthe Volunteers as a lieutenant in 1791. He transferred to the 1st Chasseurs √† Cheval Regiment as a sous-lieutenant in 1793. Two years later he was appointed aide-de-camp to Pierre de Ruel, marquis de Beurnonville as a lieutenant. During the War of the First Coalition, the 1st Chasseurs fought at the battles of Arlon in 1793, Fleurus in 1794, Altenkirchen in 1796 and Neuwied in 1797. During the War of the Second Coalition the regiment fought at the battles of Ostrach and Stockach in 1799. During the 1800 campaign, Jacquinot received a battlefield promotion from captain to major after an action at Erbach an der Donau. He was wounded at the Battle of Hohenlinden on 3 December 1800 while acting commander of the regiment in the absence of Colonel Louis-Pierre Montbrun. At Hohenlinden the 610-strong 1st Chasseurs served in Antoine Richepanse's division. The regiment fought at the front of Richepanse's decisive attack on the rear of the main Austrian column. Subsequently he led the 1st Chasseurs in clashes at Schwanenstadt and V√∂cklabruck on 18 December. At Schwanenstadt, the French captured 700 Austrian cavalrymen and at V√∂cklabruck they made prisoners of General Franz von L√∂pper, two cannons and most of two battalions of infantry. Subsequently, Jacquinot transferred to the 5th Chasseurs √† Cheval. Empire =1805‚Äì1809= At the Battle of Austerlitz on 2 December 1805, Jacquinot served as an aide-de-camp to G√©raud Duroc who led a formation of grenadiers. He became colonel on 13 January 1806, taking command of the 11th Chasseurs √† Cheval Regiment. He led his regiment at the Battle of Jena on 14 October 1806 and was wounded by several saber cuts. At Jena, the 11th Chasseurs were in Pierre Margaron's light cavalry brigade of the IV Corps under Marshal of France Jean-de-Dieu Soult. He was raised to the dignity of Baron of the Empire on 26 October 1808. Jacquinot received promotion to general of brigade on 10 March 1809. He received command of a brigade of cavalry in Montbrun's light cavalry division in the III Corps of Marshal Louis-Nicolas Davout. On 16 April he had 1,797 troopers under his command in the 1st, 2nd and 12th Chasseurs √† Cheval Regiments. On 20 April, Napoleon formed for Marshal Jean Lannes a provisional corps made up of Jacquinot's detached brigade, two III Corps infantry divisions and two cuirassier divisions. In the Battle of Abensberg Lannes' corps drove the Austrian left wing back and inflicted losses of 2,700 killed and wounded and 4,000 captured on their foes. Jacquinot's brigade fought at the Battle of Raab on 14 June under Montbrun's command. On this occasion, it included the 7th Hussars in place of the 12th Chasseurs. During the battle, the divisions of Montbrun and Emmanuel Grouchy routed the Austrian left flank cavalry. Still in Montbrun's division, Jacquinot led his 1,219-strong brigade at the Battle of Wagram on 5‚Äì6 July where it formed part of the right wing cavalry under the orders of Davout. On the second day, Davout's cavalry gained the upper hand despite the intervention of the Austrian reserve cavalry personally led by Archduke Charles, Duke of Teschen. =1812‚Äì1814= During the 1812 French invasion of Russia Jacquinot led a brigade composed of the 7th Hussar and 9th Chevau-l√©ger Lancer Regiments. The 3rd Light Cavalry Brigade was part of Jean Pierre Joseph Bruy√®re's 1st Light Cavalry Division in √âtienne Marie Antoine Champion de Nansouty's I Cavalry Corps. During the campaign, he led his brigade at the battles of Ostrovno, Vitebsk, Smolensk and Borodino. Near Mozhaysk his brigade fought off Matvei Platov's Don Cossacks. Jacquinot is the 5th name under the Arc de Triomphe's Column 20, at right. Jacquinot was wounded while leading a charge against a Swedish battalion at the Battle of Dennewitz on 6 September 1813. During the action, he led the 12th Light Cavalry Brigade which was made up of the 5th and 13th Chasseurs √† Cheval Regiments. The brigade was part of Jean Thomas Guillaume Lorge's 5th Light Cavalry Division in Jean-Toussaint Arrighi de Casanova's III Cavalry Corps. At the Battle of Leipzig on 16‚Äì19 October he led the same brigade, to which was added the 10th Chasseurs √† Cheval. He was promoted general of division on 26 October 1813. On the night of 31 December 1813, Russian troops under Emmanuel de Saint-Priest executed a successful assault crossing of the Rhine River and captured Koblenz at 4:00 am on 1 January 1814. The commander of the Russian 17th Infantry Division, Igor Maximovich Pillar sent 200 j√§gers, 25 Cossacks and one cannon to seize a convoy near Remagen on 2 January. The convoy was intercepted, but the officer directing the column continued marching toward Bonn where he bumped into a large French force under Jacquinot and Joseph Jean-Baptiste Albert. The Russians were routed, losing 120 men and the artillery piece, the first cannon lost by the Army of Silesia. At that date, Jacquinot's heavy cavalry division in the III Cavalry Corps had two weak brigades composed of single-squadron regiments. Marc Fran√ßois J√©r√¥me Wolff's brigade counted 368 officers and men from five dragoon regiments. Jean Charles Quinette de Cernay's brigade numbered 467 troopers from five dragoon and one cuirassier regiments. By mid-January, the French forces under Marshal Jacques MacDonald, which included III Cavalry Corps, were in full retreat through Namur and headed for an intended rendezvous with Napoleon at Ch√¢lons-sur- Marne. After detaching garrisons, MacDonald's command numbered no more than 11,000 men. From Ch√¢lons, MacDonald's force was chased to the west by the Army of Silesia. Around this time, Napoleon reorganized his cavalry into four corps plus an independent division and the III Cavalry Corps was suppressed. Jacquinot was placed in command of the two-brigade 4th Light Cavalry Division in the new VI Cavalry Corps under Fran√ßois √âtienne de Kellermann. Auguste Jean Ameil's 979-strong 7th Brigade included six regiments of chasseurs √† cheval while Wolff's 686-man 8th Brigade comprised three hussar, one chevau-l√©ger lancer and two chasseurs √† cheval regiments. On 25 February 1814, Napoleon decided to leave the pursuit of the Army of Bohemia to his subordinates. The emperor assigned Jacquinot's division and Kellermann's corps to Marshal Nicolas Oudinot while distributing other cavalry units to MacDonald. Jacquinot's division fought at the Battle of Bar-sur-Aube on 27 February and at the Battle of Saint-Dizier on 26 March. During Napoleon's bid to cut the Allied communications in the last week of March, he sent the light cavalry of Jacquinot and Hippolyte Pir√© ahead of the army, provoking panic. At Saint- Dizier, Napoleon's cavalry routed Ferdinand von Wintzingerode's 10,000 cavalry, but it proved to be a hollow victory because the Allied generals ignored the threat to their supply line and marched on Paris. The Allies won the Battle of Paris on 30 March 1814 and this event ended the war. By 4 April the 4th Cavalry Division had shrunk badly. Ameil's brigade counted only 331 officers and men while Wolff's brigade numbered only 244. Later career During the Waterloo Campaign, Jacquinot commanded the 1st Cavalry Division which was attached to the I Corps of Jean-Baptiste Drouet, Comte d'Erlon. The 1st Brigade of Adrien Fran√ßois de Bruno consisted of the 3rd Chasseurs √† Cheval and 7th Hussar Regiments. The 2nd Brigade of Martin Gobrecht was made up of the 3rd and 4th Chevau-l√©ger Lancer Regiments. During the Battle of Waterloo on 18 June 1815 Jacquinot supervised his own and the light cavalry division of Jacques Gervais, baron Subervie. After the British heavy cavalry routed d'Erlon's infantry, the Royal Scots Greys charged through the French grand battery, only to be counterattacked by Jacquinot's lancers and cut to pieces. At Waterloo the Greys lost 102 killed and 97 wounded out of 396 officers and men. After Waterloo, Jacquinot was placed on the inactive list. Years later he emerged as an inspector general of cavalry. In 1833 he was appointed to command the camp of cuirassiers at Lun√©ville and the following year he commanded the camp of dragoons. In 1835 he was assigned to lead the 3rd Military Division at Metz. He became a member of the Peerage of France on 3 October 1837; that year he went on the inactive list again. According to the law of 4 August 1839 he was appointed to the second section of the Army General Staff. On 14 April 1844 he received the Grand Cross of the L√©gion d'Honneur. He died on 25 April 1848 at Metz. JACQUINOT appears on the east side of the Arc de Triomphe.

Jose Miguel‚Äôs father and his uncle, Felipe Arciniega were mounted lancers in the Second Flying Company of San Carlos de Parras.Muster Roll of the Second Flying Company of San Carlos de Alamo de Parras; http://www.tamu.edu/faculty/ccbn/dewitt/adp/history/hispanic_hispanic_period/muster/chart/html The name of their Spanish regiment was Alamo de Parras. They traveled from the pueblo San Jose y Santiago de Alamo, near Las Parras, Coahuila to La Villa de San Fernando, present day San Antonio. Their assignment was to secure the Louisiana; United States borders in order to keep the Americans out of Texas, and to stop the livestock smuggling.SECOND FLYING COMPANY OF SAN CARLOS DE PARRAS, Texas State HIstorical Association This regiment was the only protection that Texas had. The United States insisted the Louisiana border extended to the Rio Grande taking the Gulf of Mexico‚Äôs ports from Spain. King Carlos IV disagreed and sent his seasoned mounted lancers from the garrison of Alamo de Parras to protect Texas from being taken over. The mounted lancers of Alamo de Parras were also commissioned to stop the Indian raids from penetrating the Interior Provinces of New Spain, in turn the soldiers were able to start a settlement, become merchants, civil workers, ranchers and farmers. The barracks for the presidio soldiers were in ruins leaving the mounted lancers to live in the Alamo with their families. Jose Miguel was only nine years old when he went to live in the Alamo. He lived in the Alamo until he turned seventeen years old when his father Gregorio had retired for serving thirty-two years in the Spanish regime. In 1811, Gregorio received a Spanish land grant in the center of present-day San Antonio.Bexar Archives LGS 40, \\"Gregorio Arciniega\\", 4 pages, Bexar County Courthouse, Spanish Archives; San Antonio, TX. The San Antonio Mission‚Äôs name was changed to the Alamo because of this Spanish regiment; Alamo de Parras. Jose Miguel de Arciniega was the third Arciniega generation as a mounted lancer. His son, Jose Miguel Cristoval also became a mounted lancer, making him the fourth generation. Jose Miguel was a mounted lancer from 1810-1836. The Second Flying Company of San Carlos de Parras disband in 1836 after the formation of the Republic of Texas. Within these years, Jose Miguel was an emissary for Spain and captain of a military exploratory party. By the year 1819 there were still French settlers in Louisiana living among Anglos. Jose Miguel was linguistic. He was assigned as a secret agent by Spain to gather information on the whereabouts and the movements of both enemies of Spain; France and the United States making it essential for Jose Miguel to be fluent in Spanish, English and French. Jose Miguel also had fluency in several different dialects of native Indians. Moses Austin made a contract with Spain to colonize southeast Texas, however, he died before he could start his venture in colonization. His successor was his son, Stephan F. Austin, who came to Texas at the end of the Mexican revolutionary war. Austin was disappointed to find that his father‚Äôs contract to colonized was null and void after Spain no longer had jurisdiction over New Spain, now Mexico. Austin continued on with his quest with Mexico, and renegotiated a contract that lasted for almost two years to colonize the first ‚ÄúOld 300‚Äù families in southeast Texas in 1823. Jose Miguel Arciniega fought in the Mexican revolutionary war with his father Gregorio Arciniega and uncle Felipe Arciniega. The people of Texas, Mexico, had to build their newly won motherland. The state of Coahuila and the state of Texas were joined together as one state. Texas was now Coahuila and Texas. Coahuila and Texas was an untamed frontier land. Throughout many years of wars, skirmishes, and Indian deprivations, the land needed to be settled throughout. The Tejanos did not have the money to restore their new state and country. The continuous Indian raids made it difficult to colonize Coahuila and Texas. Jose Miguel had been commissioned by the Mexican Supreme Government to have peace talks with the hostile Native Indians to promote peace with the Indians so they could all live together. = Career as a politician = On October 21, 1822 Jose Felix Trespalacios was the Political chief for the Province of Texas and a veteran as a revolutionary leader for the Mexican movement for independence against Spain. Trespalacios opened the first ‚ÄúBanco Nacional de Texas‚Äù. This was the first chartered bank west of the Mississippi. Councilman Jose Miguel Arciniega, Councilman Vicente Travieso, Alcalde (Mayor) Jose Salinas and Trespalacios had to sign the currency in order for it to become legal tender. Jose Miguel launched his career as a governmental and political leader for Mexico from this time. Jose Miguel‚Äôs father died in 1822 from a tooth infection and Jose Miguel inherited his father, Gregorio‚Äôs property in downtown San Antonio. In 1823, Jose Miguel was a Legislator for the State of Coahuila and Texas. He served with Felipe Enrique Neri also known as the Baron de Bastrop who was Jose Miguel‚Äôs dear friend, fellow legislator, and next door neighbor. The Baron was instrumental to the formation of Texas as it is today. The Baron spoke on behalf of Moses Austin to the Spanish government to approve his contract. When Moses died the Baron of Bastrop continued to assist Stephen Austin and diligently served Texas a short time as Austin‚Äôs land commissioner and legislator for the State of Coahuila and Texas until his death in Saltillo, on February 23, 1827. Jose Miguel served from 1828 and again in 1829 with Jose Antonio Navarro. In 1826 Arciniega was ordered to have peace talks with Chief Richard Fields of the Cherokee Indians. He was then sent to the Las Lagunas de Gallinas to continue his mission to have peace talks with the Comanche, Tahuallaces, Tejas and Caddo Indians. It took Miguel from January 21 to June 15, 1826 to complete this mission. In 1830 Jose Miguel was appointed Land commissioner for Austin‚Äôs colonies by the Mexican Supreme Government Jose Miguel had the authority vested in to him by the Mexican Supreme government in conformity with the Colonization Law of March 24, 1825 in Article 11 and Article 34 to establish a new town to serve as a seat in the Austin‚Äôs colony. In 1832 Jose Miguel Arciniega was the founder of the Town of Bastrop. He named this town in memory of his longtime friend and fellow legislator, the Baron de bastrop. Samuel May Williams served as Austin‚Äôs secretary who wrote the title for the Town of Bastrop out as Williams did with all of Austin‚Äôs land title. Williams wrote them out for Jose Miguel to validate them. Samuel P. Brown was the surveyor of the four league town. Arciniega served as the public treasurer, political chief, judge, captain of the militia, general inspector of arms, and Alcalde of San Antonio in 1830 and 1833. He assisted Austin to convince the Tejano Leaders in San Antonio to side with Austin in the convention of 1833 to separate Texas from Coahuila. It was in this year that Jose Miguel wrote a letter to State Representative, Juan Vicente Campos requesting that Compos would present Jose Miguel‚Äôs proposal with the support of Francisco Xavier Bustillos, Ignacio Chaves, Jose Flores, Jose Maria de Cardenas to place Maritime Customs Houses; one at the Bay of San Bernardo, one at the port of Galveston, and a land check point at the border with Nacogdoches hoping to populate these areas. Custom houses and the check point were to stop pirates, and contraband from coming in and to increase the commerce for Coahuila and Texas in the import and export industries within a few years. From 1832 to 1835 Jose Miguel was approved by the Mexican Supreme Government to purchased 11 leagues of land that is equivalent to 48,703 acres of land in the neutral land or buffer zone between Northern Texas and Louisiana‚Äôs US border. The 48,703 acres of lands were split up in present-day Hunt, Grayson, and Harrison Counties in northern Texas and in Natchitoches, Louisiana. He raised goats and had many forests along a canyon by the Sabine River, Red River and south of Lake Sciodo. On December 11, 1835 Jose Miguel was appointed by General Martin Perfecto de Cos to be his interpreter for the Capitulation between him and General Edward Burleson after the Siege of Bexar was won by the Texians and the Tejanos who supported the Texians. Jose Miguel continued to serve in the military for the Republic of Texas with his son Jose Miguel Cristoval. Jose Miguel‚Äôs son, Jose Miguel Cristoval served under Juan Seguin‚Äôs company in 1839. Jose Miguel was very active during the Republic of Texas era and served as a probate and an associate judge, Bexar County Commissioner, Alderman, secured the borders at the Rio Grande under the instructions of President David G. Burnet, and was a well-known lifelong merchant of sugarcane, potatoes and corn. He made and sold carts for horses. In 1846 during the Mexican War and the Annexation of the Republic of Texas to become Texas, United States, Arciniega secured the Rio Grande border for United States as a Captain. On May 13, 1849 Arciniega died an untimely death at the age of fifty-six only a few blocks from his home in downtown San Antonio. His exact final resting place is unknown. He is in the vicinity of the hallowed ground of the old Campo Santo Cemetery; currently, under Benjamin Milam Park and the Santa Ana Hospital in San Antonio, Texas.  Legacy  There is an unfinished fountain on the west side of the park that was built in the 1990s by the City of San Antonio. The face of the fountain has a summary of the history and a long list inscribed of the Tejano residents of San Antonio who were laid to rest in what used to be Campo Santo Cemetery. At this present day they are still underneath the downtown Benjamin Milam Park and the Santa Rosa Hospital. Jose Miguel Arciniega, Gregorio Arciniega, Maria Petra Arciniega, Mateo Arciniega along with hundreds more names can be visited at the Benjamin Milam Park, San Antonio, TX. His descendants from the Jose Miguel Arciniega Descendants Society, (JMADS) named his first home the Arciniega House on his birthday September 22, 2013; presently still standing on the corner of Arciniega Street and South Presa Street; in the courtyard of the Marriott Plaza Hotel. He and his father, Gregorio Arciniega, built the small house in 1811. JMADS has installed a Texas Historical Marker on May 15, 2015 in front of his home for his loyalty and dedication to Texas. Arciniega is commemorated as a Maker of Texas by the Texas Historical Commission. On November 6, 2015 JMADS unveiled a portrait of Arciniega in the Texas State Capital. He can also be seen inside his home on Arciniega Street, in the South Campus of San Jacinto College in Houston, TX, and Meador Elementary School in Houston, TX where he validated land grants for Stephan F. Austin‚Äôs coastal colony as the land commissioner. His portrait is also displayed in the Town of Bastrop Museum. Arciniega‚Äôs portraits were painted by a lifelong artist, David Baisden, from Houston, TX.

From 2011‚Äì2017 he designed, led and implemented a 6-year, 3-country language and peace building initiative for UNICEF in Malaysia, Myanmar and Thailand. He has previously worked on peace building activities in Sri Lanka in the late 1990s, and in several other settings. He is a language planning specialist, recognised for his work on combining practical problem solving language policy with academic study of language problems. He has published extensively on bilingual education, English as a second/additional language, peace building and communication, multiculturalism and intercultural education, Asian studies, Italian language teaching and the revitalisation of indigenous and immigrant community languages.  Biography  Professor Lo Bianco wrote Australia's National Policy on Languages in 1987, the first multilingual national language policy in an English speaking country and was Chief executive of the National Languages and Literacy Institute of Australia until 2002. He has advised on language, culture and literacy education, and on the integration of indigenous and immigrant children into mainstream schools, reconciliation and peace through education, in many countries, including Canada, Ireland, Italy, Papua New Guinea, Singapore, Slovenia, South Africa, Sri Lanka, Thailand, Timor Leste, the United Kingdom, and Vietnam, among others. From 2011‚Äì2017 he served as research advisor for LUCIDE, a European Commission project on Languages in Urban Communities ‚Äì Integration and Diversity for Europe, conducting large scale 4-year research on multilingualism at the municipal level in 12 European cities. In January 2014 he commenced in an academic advisory role with the National Research Centre for Foreign Language Education at Beijing Foreign Studies University which has included providing advice to the State Language Commission of China and supporting academic research initiatives. Professor Lo Bianco supervises PhD research projects and teaches courses in language planning, and supports international research projects in several countries on language and culture studies, language planning and multiculturalism/intercultural education. His language policy advising activity includes: language services for the Sydney Olympic Games, a report which was subsequently used to support planning of language services at the Athens and London Games; assistance to the government of Ireland to produce a 20-year strategy to support the vitality of Irish; support on basic education, literacy and language policy in South Africa, Hawaii, Italy, Alberta (Canada), Western Samoa and other Pacific Island countries; preparation of a National Language Education plan for the Government of Sri Lanka, 1999, under World Bank financing; and commissioned support for language policy in Scotland and Northern Ireland, among other international collaboration activities.  National Policy on Languages  The National Policy on Languages (NPL) was issued by the Australian Government Publishing Service (AGPS) in March 1987. It was the first comprehensive national language policy in Australia. On 26 April 1987 the Prime Minister announced the government's endorsement of the Policy. The National Policy on Languages was adopted as a national plan to cover all of Australia's language needs and interests (English and English literacy, English as a second and foreign language and languages other than English, including Indigenous language rights, immigrant and foreign languages) as well as language services (research, translating and interpreting, public media). One of its initiatives was for the co-ordination of research activity nationally, including the creation of the National Languages and Literacy Institute of Australia and its 32 constituent research centres across Australia. The aim of the NLLIA was to embed applied linguistics research into mainstream academic activity. In its 1990 report to the International Conference on Education the Australian Department of Employment, Education and Training described the NPL as \\".... one of the most influential documents in Australian education.\\" Today the NPL is often cited as an example of comprehensive and co-ordinated language planning.

Plot Opening quote: \\"I am glad 'tis night, you do not look on me, for I am much ashamed of my exchange.\\" Juliette‚Äôs (Bitsie Tulloch) college roommate, Alicia (Alicia Lagano), leaves her abusive boyfriend, Joe (Tom Walton), and stays with Nick (David Giuntoli) and Juliette; none of them realize Joe is stalking her. While she is there, Nick realizes that Alicia is a Fuchsbau and tells Juliette. Juliette communicates to Alicia that she knows about the world of Wesen and that Alicia does not need to hide it from her, but Alicia denies knowing what Juliette is talking about. Meanwhile, Nick and Hank (Russell Hornsby) investigate what seems to be a Wesen gang murder, with only one witness, Jared Ellis (Dalpre Grayer), who is the teenage brother of Hank‚Äôs physical therapist, Zuri, (Sharon Leal). The men who murdered the gang member discuss whether they should take care of the kid who saw them, but realize that Jared‚Äôs girlfriend was the waitress at the diner where the murder took place, so they decide to use her instead. When Hank and Nick talk with the murder victim‚Äôs girlfriend in the hospital, she refuses to talk with them, until she woges and realizes that Nick is a Grimm, and he tells her that he is there as a cop, but can come back as a Grimm, if she doesn‚Äôt help them. She tells them that it was another gang, and Nick and Hank go to ask Monroe (Silas Weir Mitchell) about the presence of Wesen street gangs. He knows nothing of them, but Rosalee (Bree Turner) does, as she used to buy drugs from them in her ‚Äúdark period.‚Äù Nick and Hank follow a lead from a red light camera that leads them to the car of Hank‚Äôs physical therapist, and they take her brother Jared into custody. When they talk to him, he is clearly terrified and refuses to talk to them, but the men stalk and grab Jared‚Äôs girlfriend, Joy (Meredith Adelaide). The gang members arrive at Jared‚Äôs apartment, but Zuri is on the phone with Hank and she cries for help. Zuri and Jared identify the men who came to the apartment, and are put into a safe house. Juliette goes to talk with Rosalee about her concern that Alicia is not acknowledging what she is. Rosalee confides that Juliette doesn‚Äôt realize how special she, Nick, and Hank are that they do not judge ‚Äúor want to cut our heads off.‚Äù Rosalee adds that she tried to hide what she was for a long time, as she was dealing with it. The next day as Alicia tells them that she has found a new apartment, Juliette tells her that Nick is a Grimm. She freaks out and as Nick is calming her down, Joe arrives and knocks Nick out and tries to drag Alicia away. Juliette beats Joe, and when Nick comes around and re-enters the fray, Joe says ‚ÄúYou are a Grimm; don‚Äôt kill me.‚Äù To which he responds ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt think it is me you have to worry about.‚Äù Both Nick and Juliette tell Joe that he better never try to see Alicia again. Later, the murderers lure Jared to Joy‚Äôs house, where we find out that Jared and Zuri are both Wesen, and Zuri kills the head of the Seattle gang of murderers. Hank tells Zuri he does not have a problem with her being Wesen, but she says that she does, and he leaves. Reception =Viewers= The episode was viewed by 5.33 million people, earning a 1.3/4 in the 18-49 rating demographics on the Nielson ratings scale, ranking third on its timeslot and seventh for the night in the 18-49 demographics, behind Bones, Last Man Standing, Blue Bloods, Hawaii Five-0, 20/20, and Shark Tank. This was a 7% decrease in viewership from the previous episode, which was watched by 5.68 million viewers with a 1.5/4. This means that 1.3 percent of all households with televisions watched the episode, while 4 percent of all households watching television at that time watched it. With DVR factoring in, the episode was watched by 7.95 million viewers with a 2.4 ratings share in the 18-49 demographics.Live+7 DVR Ratings: 'The Big Bang Theory' Has Biggest 18-49 Ratings & Total Viewer Increase, 'Enlisted' Tops Percentage Gains in Week 16 =Critical reviews= \\"Eyes of the Beholder\\" received positive reviews. The A.V. Club's Kevin McFarland gave the episode a \\"C+\\" grade and wrote, \\"Nick and Hank seem to encounter a different Wesen every week, whether it's working with Renard and the outside world, or chasing down a culprit for a case introduced that week. Perhaps the show doesn't give that much indication of how time passes for these characters, and maybe, as I've posited before, Grimm simply doesn't show the more 'routine' cases the two detectives handle. But it sure seems like they're getting an awful lot of crimes involving Wesen concentrated in one area of investigation.\\" Nick McHatton from TV Fanatic, gave a 4.0 star rating out of 5, stating: \\"If there's one thing that I learned at the end of Grimm Season 3 Episode 10, it's this: Don't give Juliette a frying pan. Not since Rapunzel in Tangled have I witnessed someone mercilessly beat the bad guys to a pulp with one.\\" MaryAnn Sleasman from TV.com, wrote, \\"While 'Eyes of the Beholder' was certainly an improvement over last week's mid-season premiere, my Spidey-sense is starting to tingle in a rather uncomfortable way because we have yet to hit the sweet spot that the first half of Grimms third season nailed consistently, week after week. It's like the writers decided to save all the mediocre episodes with the weird racial undertones for January, interrupting all the good stuff to get them out of the way now in hopes that maybe we'll forget about them when the plot heats up again later on.\\" References External links Grimm (season 3) episodes 2014 American television episodes ","title":"Eyes of the Beholder"},{"id":"51406251","text":"Hamilton Creek is a tributary stream of Cahuilla Creek, (itself a tributary of Wilson Creek, Temecula Creek, and the Santa Margarita River), in Riverside County, California.

The presence or lack of macroinvertebrates such as insects, worms and snails in a river or stream can give a biological indicator on the health of that waterway. The MCI assigns a number to each species of macroinvertebrate based on the sensitivity of that species to pollution. The index then calculates an average score. A higher score on the MCI generally indicates a more healthy stream. The MCI (Macroinvertebrate Community Index) relies on an allocation of scores to freshwater macroinvertebrates based on their pollution tolerances. Freshwater macroinvertebrates found in pristine conditions would score higher than those found in polluted areas.Stark, J. D. (1993) Performance of the Macroinvertebrate Community Index: Effects of sampling method, sample replication, water depth, current velocity, and substratum on index values. New Zealand Journal of Marine and Freshwater Research 27:4, 463-478. MCI values can be calculated using macroinvertebrate presence-absence data using this equation: MCI = [(site score)/(# of scoring taxa)]*20 Previous water quality assessments have relied on both chemical and habitat analysis, however, these methods have been proven to be insufficient due to pollution from nonpoint sources.Bennett, H. H., M. W. Mullen, P. M. Stewart, J. A. Sawyer, and E. C. W. (2004) Development of an Invertebrate Community Index for an Alabama Coastal Plain Watershed. Journal of the American Water Resources Association, 40:1, 43-51 Species living in an aquatic environment may be the best natural indicator of environmental quality and reveal the effects of any habitat alteration or pollution, and have proved to respond to a wide range of stressors such as sedimentation, urbanization, agricultural practices and forest harvesting effects.Collier, KJ. (2014) Wood decay rates and macroinvertebrate community structure along contrasting human pressure gradients (Waikato, New Zealand), New Zealand Journal of Marine and Freshwater Research, 48:1, 97-111 Any changes that may occur in macroinvertebrate communities that lead to a reduction in diversity increase the dominance of pollution-tolerant invertebrates, such as oligochaetes and chironomids.Hall, M. J., G. P. Closs and R. H. Riley. (2001) Relationships between land use and stream invertebrate community structure in a South Island, New Zealand, coastal stream catchment. New Zealand Journal of Marine and Freshwater Research, 35:3, 591-603 Thus, a lack of species diversity and low biotic index scores of inhabitant macroinvertebrates may be an indicator of poor water quality.Collins, C. L., M. W. Mullen, P. M. Stewart, and E. C. Webber. (2008) Validation of an Invertebrate Community Index for Urban Streams for an Alabama Coastal Plains Watershed. Journal of The American Water Resources Association, 44(3), 663-669 The risk of water quality degradation is the greatest in low- elevation areas, where high intensity agriculture and urban development are the dominant land uses.Larned, S. T., T. Snelder, M. J. Unwin, and G.B. McBride. (2016) Water quality in New Zealand rivers: current state and trends. New Zealand Journal of Marine and Freshwater Research, 50:3, 389-417 Macroinvertebrate communities are the preferred indicators of aquatic ecosystem health because they are very easy to both collect and identify, and have short life spans, thus responding very quickly to changes in their environment. The MCI methods of utilizing macroinvertebrate communities to assess the overall health of an aquatic environment continues to be the most reliable, applicable, and widely acclaimed method around the world.Olomukoro, J. O. and A. Dirisu. (2014) Macroinvertebrate Community and Pollution Tolerance Index in Edion and Omodo Rivers in Derived Savannah Wetlands in Southern Nigeria. Jordan Journal of Biological Sciences, 7:1, 19-24. Variations on the MCI In addition to the MCI indexed defined above, there are also two other variations of the MCI. The QMCI (Quantitative Macroinvertebrate Community Index) and the SQMCI (Semi-Quantitative Macroinvertebrate Community Index). Both MCI and QMCI are widely used in countries like New Zealand. The combination of widespread use and good performance of the MCI and the QMCI in detecting water quality in aquatic ecosystems has sparked interest in further refinement of the methods in New Zealand.Stark, J. D. (1998) SQMCI: A biotic index for freshwater macroinvertebrate coded‚Äêabundance data. New Zealand Journal of Marine and Freshwater Research, 32:1, 55-66. The QMCI, just like the MCI, was initially designed to evaluate the organic enrichment in aquatic ecosystems. The third index, the SQMCI, was created to reduce sampling and processing efforts required for the QMCI.Wright‚ÄêStow, A. E. and Winterbourn, M. J. (2003) How well do New Zealand's stream‚Äêmonitoring indicators, the macroinvertebrate community index and its quantitative variant, correspond? New Zealand Journal of Marine and Freshwater Research, 37:2, 461-470. The SQMCI will respond in a similar matter to the QMCI in community dominance, however, will require fewer samples to achieve the same precision. The SQMCI gives a comparative appraisal to the QMCI with under 40% of the exertion, in circumstances that macroinvertebrate densities are not required. This diminishes expenses and also enhances the logical solidness of biomonitoring projects. Both the QMCI and SQMCI are similar to the MCI in the way that they are graded on a 1 (extremely tolerant) to 10 (highly intolerant) scale. However, they differ in the way that MCI is calculated using presence-absence data whereas QMCI uses quantitative or percentage data. Having a qualitative, quantitative, and semi-quantitative version of the same index has raised some questions as to if this is a good thing or not. All three indexes have the same purpose, which is to measure the quality of an aquatic ecosystem, however, there are no clear recommendations about when each one is most appropriate to be used. In a study conducted on 88 rivers, Scarsbrook et al. (2000) concluded MCI is more useful than the QMCI for recognizing changes in stream water quality over time. Having three forms of a similar index may prompt to various conclusions and also opens the route for specific utilization of either file to give bias to a specific position or position taken by a specialist. In August 2019, the Ministry for the Environment released a draft National Policy Statement for Freshwater Management, and a report from Scientific and Technical Advisory Group that recommended including three different measures, MCI, QMCI and Average Score Per Metric (ASPM). QMCI values can be calculated using: QMCI = ‚àë_(i=1)^(i=s)‚ñí(n_i*a_i)/N''' SQMCI values can be calculated similar to QMCI except that coded abundances are substituted for actual counts. Example: SQMCI = ‚àë_(i=1)^(i=s)‚ñí(n_i*a_i)/N Factors Influencing MCI There are several factors which can affect the data acquisition of MCI when assessing the water quality of an aquatic ecosystem. Hard-bottom and Soft-bottom channels can often yield different results and many researchers will use two different versions of the MCI. For example, in a study by Stark & Mallard (2007) they discuss that hard and soft bottom channels have separate versions of the MCI and the two versions can not be combined into one data set because of the differences in taxa and tolerance values. Spatial variability is also of interest in terms of affecting the data acquired through MCI. Sites which are progressively down stream often tend to yield a lower MCI value. There may also be confounding influences between riffles, runs, or pools with a single stream reach.Stark, J. D. and N. Phillips. (2009) Seasonal variability in the Macroinvertebrate Community Index: Are seasonal correction factors required? New Zealand Journal of Marine and Freshwater Research, 43:4, 867-882 Depth and velocity have also been raised as a concern with regards to effecting results, however Stark (1993) investigated the influences of the sampling method, water depth, current velocity and substratum on the results and found that both MCI and QMCI are independent of depth, velocity, and substratum from macroinvertebrate samples collected from stony riffles. This finding is an advantage for the assessment of water pollution. There have been several studies conducted on seasonal variability, which has been considered the main influential factor on the assessment of water quality. It has been concluded that all models should test data that has been collected in the season as the reference data, which is being used. There have been several other factors such as water temperature, invertebrate life histories and dissolved oxygen levels that have all been explained as causes of seasonal variability. Warmer seasons have biotic indices that are indicative of poorer stream health. Warmer seasons such as summer, would have increased temperatures therefore increasing water temperature and decreasing the amount of dissolved oxygen in the water making the environment less ideal to aquatic macroinvertebrates. In return, this effects the density of macroinvertebrate population and changes the results of the indices.

It may be described as the set of points for which the quadratic form for the space applied to the displacement vector from a centre point is a constant value, with the inclusion of hyperplanes as a limiting case.  Notation and terminology  This article uses the following notation and terminology: * A pseudo-Euclidean vector space, denoted , is a real vector space with a nondegenerate quadratic form with signature . The quadratic form is permitted to be definite (where or ), making this a generalization of a Euclidean vector space. * A pseudo-Euclidean space, denoted , is a real affine space in which displacement vectors are the elements of the space . It is distinguished from the vector space. * The quadratic form acting on a vector , denoted , is a generalization of the squared Euclidean distance in a Euclidean space. √âlie Cartan calls the scalar square}} of . * The symmetric bilinear form acting on two vectors is denoted or . This is associated with the quadratic form . * Two vectors are orthogonal if . * A normal vector at a point of a quasi-sphere is a nonzero vector that is orthogonal to each vector in the tangent space at that point.  Definition  A quasi-sphere is a submanifold of a pseudo- Euclidean space consisting of the points for which the displacement vector from a reference point satisfies the equation :, where and . Since in permitted, this definition includes hyperplanes; it is thus a generalization of generalized circles and their analogues in any number of dimensions. This inclusion provides a more regular structure under conformal transformations than if they are omitted. This definition has been generalized to affine spaces over complex numbers and quaternions by replacing the quadratic form with a Hermitian form. A quasi-sphere } in a quadratic space has a counter- sphere }. Furthermore, if and is an isotropic line in through , then , puncturing the union of quasi-sphere and counter-sphere. One example is the unit hyperbola that forms a quasi-sphere of the hyperbolic plane, and its conjugate hyperbola, which is its counter-sphere.  Geometric characterizations  = Centre and radial scalar square = The centre of a quasi-sphere is a point that has equal scalar square from every point of the quasi-sphere, the point at which the pencil of lines normal to the tangent hyperplanes meet. If the quasi-sphere is a hyperplane, the centre is the point at infinity defined by this pencil. When , the displacement vector of the centre from the reference point and the radial scalar square may be found as follows. We put , and comparing to the defining equation above for a quasi- sphere, we get : p = -\\\\frac b {2a}, : r = p\\\\cdot p - \\\\frac c a. The case of may be interpreted as the centre being a well-defined point at infinity with either infinite or zero radial scalar square (the latter for the case of a null hyperplane). Knowing (and ) in this case does not determine the hyperplane's position, though, only its orientation in space. The radial scalar square may take on a positive, zero or negative value. When the quadratic form is definite, even though and may be determined from the above expressions, the set of vectors satisfying the defining equation may be empty, as is the case in a Euclidean space for a negative radial scalar square. = Diameter and radius = Any pair of points, which need not be distinct, (including the option of up to one of these being a point at infinity) defines a diameter of a quasi-sphere. The quasi-sphere is the set of points for which the two displacement vectors from these two points are orthogonal. Any point may be selected as a centre (including a point at infinity), and any other point on the quasi-sphere (other than a point at infinity) define a radius of a quasi-sphere, and thus specifies the quasi-sphere.  Partitioning  Referring to the quadratic form applied to the displacement vector of a point on the quasi-sphere from the centre (i.e. ) as the radial scalar square, in any pseudo-Euclidean space the quasi-spheres may be separated into three disjoint sets: those with positive radial scalar square, those with negative radial scalar square, those with zero radial scalar square. In a space with a positive-definite quadratic form (i.e. a Euclidean space), a quasi-sphere with negative radial scalar square is the empty set, one with zero radial scalar square consists of a single point, one with positive radial scalar square is a standard -sphere, and one with zero curvature is a hyperplane that is partitioned with the -spheres.

The attack caused the death of two people and a dog and left one person injured. It was alleged that Ayad used the Arabic phrase \\"Allahu akbar\\" both during the attack and his arrest, and while police ruled out any links to extremism, they are still investigating whether he had a romantic interest in victim Mia Ayliffe-Chung. Police have indicated Ayad had used cannabis on the night of the attack. Ayad also sang the French national anthem during the attack. On 25 August 2016, Ayad was charged with the crimes of murder, attempted murder, serious animal cruelty and serious assault. On 27 October 2016, Ayad's trial was adjourned to Mental Health Court, as a result of determining a preliminary diagnosis of schizophrenia. This diagnosis was confirmed by the Mental Health Court on 5 April 2018 resulting in the criminal charges being dropped and an order was made to detain him in The Park Centre for Mental Health in Brisbane for treatment. Attack Ayad attacked Mia Ayliffe-Chung, his roommate as she lay in her bunk. Ayad then stabbed hostel caretaker Grant Schultz in the leg and chased the hostel's pet dog Atari around the yard stabbing the dog until it died. A second British backpacker, Tom Jackson, was also attacked when he tried to help the woman. He died several days later. Ayad continued to scream \\"Allahu akbar\\" as police officers worked to subdue him, injuring several officers. Jackson and another guest, Daniel Richards were subsequently awarded the Queen's Gallantry Medal for their efforts to aid Ayliffe-Chung. Victims Ayliffe-Chung died at the scene. Jackson suffered critical injuries in the attack and died five days later in hospital. Schultz suffered stab wounds to the leg. The dog Atari died at the scene. Attacker Smail Ayad, 29, is a French national. Ayad went out drinking once a week like many backpackers, where on Saturday nights he would travel to Ayr for rum or beer with other Frenchmen. Since his arrest, he has been transferred from Stuart prison to a secure mental health facility in Brisbane. Ayad was initially charged with Ayliffe-Chung's murder, the attempted murders of Jackson and Scultz, and a charge of animal cruelty. An additional 12 counts of assaulting police were laid a few days later arising from his attack on the police officers who subdued him. One of the attempted murder charge was upgraded to murder after Jackson died. On 5 April 2018, the Queensland Mental Health Court determined that Ayad was of unsound mind at the time of the killings. Four psychiatrists found he was suffering from paranoid schizophrenia and believed he was the target of an international conspiracy to kill him. The criminal charges were dropped against Ayad as it could not be proven he had an intent to kill. The court directed Ayad to be detained in The Park Centre for Mental Health for treatment. Responses The Islamic Council of Queensland criticised media reports for quickly linking use of this phrase with Islamic terrorism. On 25 August 2016, the authorities were confident the stabbings were not an act of terrorism. Several backpackers who have stayed at Home Hill before the double murder, spoke out against the violence that has broken out previously and the drinking culture among the backpackers. The town was called \\"Hell Hill\\" even before the murder incident and one former resident warned others to \\"avoid it at all costs\\". Ayliffe-Chung's mother, Rosie Ayliffe, came to Australia for her daughter's funeral and began to investigate working conditions on Australian farms.

Orozco was admitted into a hospital in Guadalajara with pneumonia and there experienced a radical call to help others in the same hospital who were ill - she recovered and soon returned to fulfil this promise while later becoming a religious and establishing her own order in order to advance this mission. Orozco was beatified made a Servant of God on 13 April 1978 under Pope Paul VI and later named as Venerable under Pope John Paul II on 21 December 1991 who also beatified her on 9 November 1997. Life Vicenta Ch√°vez Orozco was born in Cotija de la Paz in Mexico in 1867 as the last of four children (all males) to Luis Ch√°vez and Benigna Orozco. One brother was Eligio. Orozco was a pious child who fostered a great devotion to the Infant Jesus and she often made little altars and invited other children to reflect with her. In 1866 she accompanied her parents and brothers to Guadalajara to a new home where there were poor people and laborers. Orozco was hospitalized with pneumonia on 20 February 1892 at the hospital of Santisima Trinidad. She recovered from her pneumonia on 10 July 1892 and later returned to the hospital she spent time in to dedicate herself to other ill people as per her decision. She made her private vows on 25 December 1895 (Christmas) - alongside Catalina Velasco and Juana Mart√≠n del Campo - and then made her full canonical profession as a professed religious in 1911. In between that she founded her own religious order - the Servants of the Holy Spirit and the Poor - on 12 May 1905 with the aid of the priest Miguel Cano Guti√©rrez; the order received diocesan approval on 10 August 1911 and was later aggregated to the Order of Friars Minor on 2 October 1939. She was appointed as its superior in 1913 and held the position until 1943. In 1914 - during the Mexican Revolution - Venustiano Carranza's forces commandeered the Guadalajara Cathedral and took a number of priests and religious hostage which also included her. From 1942 she began to suffer from vision impairment and a number of other health issues but she still was the first person to arrive each morning in the chapel for Mass at 4:00am but on 29 July 1949 did not appear as she suffered a heart attack. The chaplain - Fr. Roberto Lopez - anointed her and Archbishop Jos√© Garibi y Rivera heard her confession and celebrated Mass for her; Orozco was pale and had a weak pulse. At the elevation of the Eucharist she took a final breath and died in the Santisima Trinidad hospital of Guadalajara. Her order later received the papal decree of praise from Pope John XXIII on 28 April 1962 and is present in eight Mexican dioceses; there was 151 religious in 24 houses as of 2005. Beatification The beatification process commenced under Pope Paul VI on 13 April 1978 after the Congregation for the Causes of Saints issued the official \\"nihil obstat\\" (nothing against) to the cause and titled her as a Servant of God while allowing for a cognitional process to take place; that process held in Guadalajara was validation in Rome on 5 May 1983. The postulation later sent the official Positio dossier to the C.C.S. in 1989 and allowed for a board of theologians to voice their assent to the dossier's contents on 26 April 1991; the C.C.S. did so as well in their meeting of 5 November 1991. Orozco was declared to be Venerable on 21 December 1991 after Pope John Paul II issued a decree confirming her life of heroic virtue. The miracle needed for her to be beatified was investigated and later validated on 2 October 1992 while a medical board approved the healing to be a legitimate miracle on 10 October 1996; theologians met and approved it on 10 January 1997 while the C.C.S. followed suit on 8 April 1997. John Paul II issued the final approval needed for the beatification on 7 July 1997 and beatified the late nun on 9 November 1997 in Saint Peter's Square.

It was written in the form of prose in standard Kawi script with some variations, and using the Old Javanese language. This inscription was carved on copperplate (tamra pra≈õasti) totaling 10 plates, however two plates are missing; the plate numbers 3 and 5. Today the 8 plates of Kaladi inscriptions are stored in the National Museum of Indonesia in Jakarta with inventory number E71. The Kaladi inscription was found in the area of Mount Penanggungan, East Java. The Kaladi inscription dated from early 10th century, during the reign of King ≈örƒ´ MaharƒÅja Rakai Watukura Dyah Balitung ≈örƒ´ Dharmmodaya MahƒÅsambhu of Medang Mataram Kingdom. King Balitung was the successor of Rakai Kayuwangi. This inscription is important and interesting, because it refers to banditry in ancient Java. The inscription also mentioned about foreign-origin residents that resided in Java. The inscription describes the royal patronage that encourage the development of settlements along the rivers and roads connecting interior settlements with the ports of coastal Java, in order to protect the merchants and coastal settlers by reducing the crime of piracy, robbery and banditry along the trade routes. Contents This inscription tells of the establishment of the villages of Kaladi, GayƒÅm, and Pyapya, all included within the samgat (region) of Bawa·∂á. The lands were appointed as Sƒ´ma lands by the request of Dapunta Suddhara and Dapunta Dampi to the King Rakai Watukura Balitung. The inscription tells the background of that led to the request; initially there were patches of forests that separates the villages which causes fear among villagers. The village dwellers are constantly under attack from residents (horde of bandits) of Mariwu·∂á, which makes the traders and fishermen feel uneasy and constantly in fear day and night. Then the villagers mutually agreed and decided that the forests should be cleared and transformed into rice paddy fields, so that people will no longer suffer fear, and the rice fields were to be included within the region (samgat) of Bawa·∂á. This inscription also mentioned the names of the officials in charge of this affairs, and also mention about pegs given to the officials to mark the boundaries of the new Sƒ´ma lands' rice fields. The inscription also mentioned sapata law or punishment for violating the Sƒ´ma. In addition, this inscription also explains about foreign-origin people that resided in ancient Java. The inscription mentioned about Kling (refer to Kalinga or simply Southeastern Indian people), Arya (Aryans of the Northern India), Singhala (Sinhalese of Sri Lanka), Drawila (Dravida?, Pondhiceri), Campa (Chams of Champa), Kmir (Khmers of Cambodia, but some translate it as Kashmiri people, although this is highly discounted) and Rman (Mon) as foreigners from mainland Asia that frequently came to Java to trade. The inscription suggests a maritime trade network has been established between kingdoms in mainland Southeast Asia and Java.

Operations were carried out in the region between the Euphrates river to the east and the Syrian rebel-held area around Azaz to the west. The Turkish military and Turkey-aligned Syrian rebel groups, some of which used the Free Syrian Army label, fought against both the Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF) and the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant (ISIL), from 24 August 2016. On 29 March 2017, the Turkish military officially announced that Operation Euphrates Shield was \\"successfully completed\\". The Turkish president Recep Tayyip Erdoƒüan said on the first day of the operation that it was aimed against both the Islamic State and the People's Protection Units.Erdogan says Syria operation aimed at IS jihadists, Kurdish PYD 24 August 2016. The long- threatened capture of Manbij, under the de facto control of the Rojava administration, remains unfulfilled. The Turkish occupation of northern Syria is ongoing. Background Northern Aleppo Governorate is a region of major strategic importance in the Syrian civil war, previously mostly held by the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant (ISIL). For ISIL it was their only gate to the Turkish border. For the Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF), the Shahba region between the Euphrates River to the east and the Kurd Mountains to the west is the missing link to connect the cantons of the Federation of Northern Syria ‚Äì Rojava. For Turkey, it is the path to its influence in Syria. The stage for the Jarabulus offensive was set by the previous Manbij offensive from June‚ÄìAugust, which saw the SDF capturing the city of Manbij and its surroundings from ISIL and in the aftermath moving north. At the same time, Turkey-backed Syrian rebels fought the Battle of al-Rai to approach Jarabulus from the west. According to an article published in The Independent, the Turkish objectives were to target ISIL, strike at the political and military power of the Democratic Union Party (PYD) and to consolidate its position in expectation of shifts towards more war or greater peace. Turkey's defence minister Fikri I≈üƒ±k said that \\"preventing the Kurdish PYD party from uniting Kurdish cantons\\" east of Jarabulus with those further west was a priority. In Ankara Turkish president Recep Tayyip Erdoƒüan said \\"at 4 am this morning, operations started in the north of Syria against terror groups which constantly threaten our country\\". Before the operation, SDF forces including People's Protection Units (YPG) units were advancing on Jarabulus following their military victory over the Islamic State in Manbij. Both Manbij and Jarabulus are west of the Euphrates River, but Turkey wanted YPG forces to move back to the east of the river after the conclusion of the SDF's Manbij operation. Turkey's action pitched its military against a force backed by its NATO ally, the United States. It was the first time Turkish warplanes struck in Syria since November 2015, when Turkey downed a Russian warplane, and the first significant incursion by Turkish special forces since a brief operation to relocate the tomb of Suleyman Shah, in February 2015. Pro-SDF sources stated that Turkey had \\"an agreement with ISIL\\" to rescue it in Jarabulus from the SDF offensive. According to H√ºrriyet Daily News this report is believed by \\"many\\" in Washington and Turkey and it could pose serious problems for Ankara. Preparations Reportedly, Turkey had prepared battle plans for the intervention more than a year prior. On 9 May 2016, a plan was reportedly proposed by the US, Turkey, Saudi Arabia, and Qatar to have the Nour al-Din al-Zenki Movement form a \\"Northern Army\\" to gather more than 3,000 fighters for the operation. The next phase was to transfer the fighters from Idlib to northern Aleppo through the Bab al-Hawa Border Crossing and the Azaz border crossing. This reportedly began on 13 May. However, the plan was delayed due to doubts from U.S. officials about the capabilities of the Syrian rebel forces that Turkey had recruited to fight with its military, opposition from the US-backed Syrian Democratic Forces, and the rift between Turkey and Russia that was not mended until early August 2016. On 20 August 2016, a large number of rebels and a military convoy containing more than 50 vehicles loaded with heavy and medium weapons from al-Rai were transferred to the Turkish border with Jarabulus. On 22 August, as a response to the Gaziantep bombing and two mortar shells launched by ISIL hitting the town of Karkamƒ±≈ü adjacent to Jarabulus, the Turkish Land Forces launched 60 artillery shells at Islamic State positions in Jarabulus while simultaneously bombarding Manbij Military Council positions farther south in order to prevent them from advancing further to the north. Karkamƒ±≈ü was soon evacuated and cleared of its residents. Turkey continued to shell ISIL positions in Jarabulus after two mortar rounds hit Karkamƒ±≈ü and three hit Kilis. On 23 August, Turkey shelled Islamic State territory in northern Syria again. ISIL responded by firing rockets into Turkey. The Turkey-backed rebels under the brand of the Free Syrian Army (FSA) that took part in the offensive comprised mainly Syrian Turkmen, mostly in the Syrian Turkmen Brigades. During the offensive, FSA militants of Turkmen origin used light blue armbands, a color which is often used as a symbol of Turkic heritage; meanwhile, the rebels of Arab origin mainly used red ones. The SDF have said that MIT assassinated Abdel Sattar al- Jader, the leader of the Jarabulus Military Council (a component of the SDF), just prior to the operation. The campaign =Capture of Jarabulus by Turkish-backed forces (24 August)= Early in the morning of 24 August, Turkish forces directed intense artillery fire against ISIL positions in Jarabulus while the Turkish Air Force bombed 11 targets from the air. Later that day, Turkish main battle tanks followed by pick-up trucks, believed to be carrying Turkish-backed Syrian rebels, and the Turkish Special Forces crossed the border and were joined by hundreds of Free Syrian Army (FSA) fighters as the ground forces attacked the town. U.S.-led coalition planes helped the Turkish forces. This was their first co-ordinated offensive into Syria. The FSA said progress was slow because of mines planted by ISIL fighters. A few hours after the offensive's beginning, Turkish Special Forces and the Sham Legion captured their first village, Tal Katlijah, after ISIL fighters retreated from it to reinforce Jarabulus. Some time later, the FSA captured four more villages including Tel Shair, Alwaniyah and two other villages. Hours later, Turkish- and US-backed rebels were reported to have captured the border town of Jarabulus, with ISIL offering little resistance. The Syrian Observatory for Human Rights (SOHR) also reported that the FSA had captured almost all of the city. A FSA spokesman stated that a large number of ISIL fighters had withdrawn to al-Bab in front of the offensive. The fact that not much combat took place between Turkey or Turkish-backed Syrian rebels against ISIL in Jarabulus and the closeness in Islamist political ideology between ISIL and some of the rebel groups involved, has led to accusations, both local and international, about collusion between Turkey and ISIL in the operation, including reports of ISIL fighters changing uniform. In an interview published in The Independent on 9 September, an ISIL fighter said that \\"when the Turkish army entered Jarabulus, I talked to my friends who were there. Actually, Isis didn't leave Jarabulus; they just shaved off their beards.\\" =Continued advance of Turkish-backed forces against ISIL and conflict with SDF (24‚Äì25 August)= Later on 24 August, speaking in Ankara, US vice president Joe Biden appeared to support Turkey's stance vis-a-vis the Syrian Kurds and said that \\"the elements that were part of the Syrian Democratic Forces, the YPG that participated, that they must go back across the river\\" (the Euphrates). The YPG, however, initially refused to withdraw from Manbij, while the pro-SDF Jarabulus Military Council groups declared that they would not give up their hometown to the Turkish-backed rebel groups which they considered \\"no different from ISIS\\". In consequence, when Turkish-backed FSA units, among them the Sham Legion and Nour al-Din al-Zenki Movement, forcibly attempted to enter the SDF-held village of Amarinah south of Jarabulus, they were met with resistance. Whereas the SDF stated to have repelled the assault, the rebels stated that they had captured the village. Before clashing with the SDF, the FSA had captured half a dozen villages. On early 25 August, more than 20 Turkish tanks crossed into the Syrian border. The U.S. foreign minister later informed his Turkish counterpart that the YPG had started withdrawing to the east of the Euphrates river. A spokesman for Operation Inherent Resolve later announced that the SDF had withdrawn across the Euphrates river in order to prepare for the Raqqa campaign. The YPG later separately announced it had withdrawn to the east of Euphrates and said all military command along with all YPG-held positions was handed over to the Manbij Military Council. Despite this, Turkey stated that some YPG units had not retreated, leading the Turkish military to shell the SDF with artillery and, according to H√ºrriyet Daily News, launch a drone strike against one YPG group. While the conflict between Turkey and SDF continued, members of the Jarabulus Military Council stated once again that they \\"will not allow some \\"mercenaries\\" to take over our city. We will liberate Jarabulus,\\" with some stating that some of the Turkish-backed rebels were former ISIL fighters. At approximately 11:00 pm local time that evening, internet censorship watchdog organization Turkey Blocks detected a nationwide social media blackout, restricting domestic and mobile services throughout Turkey. Analysts concluded that the blackout measure had almost certainly been implemented to restrict online sharing of sensitive war plans, as the offensive in Syria got under way, using newly amended wartime internet \\"killswitch\\" legislation. Meanwhile, the offensive against ISIL continued, as both the Turkish-backed forces as well as SDF units took control of additional villages south of Jarabulus from ISIL. Pro-PYD sources stated that clashes had broken out among FSA groups in Jarabulus. Turkish Defence Minister Fikri I≈üƒ±k stated later in the day that FSA was clearing Jarabulus of any remaining ISIL militants. After Jarabulus was largely secured, rebel commanders declared conflicting targets for the further offensive; whereas the Levant Front announced that the rebels would next attempt to take Al-Bab, the Al-Moutasem Brigade and the Sultan Murad Division stated that the Turkish-backed forces would proceed west to break the ISIL siege of Mare', while Turkish media reported that the offensive aimed at securing a strip of territory along the Turkish-Syrian border. However, Ankara's forces pushed south and mostly focused on targeting Kurdish-led SDF forces. =Disputed YPG withdrawal; Turkish military and rebels drive SDF south of the Sajur River (26‚Äì29 August)= On 26 August, Al-Masdar News stated that all YPG forces had withdrawn to the east of the Euphrates as result of the continued Turkish pressure, leaving all territory around Manbij under control of their allies in the SDF. Rebel forces later released photos of YPG ID cards and weapons reportedly taken in Amarna, suggesting that at least some YPG fighters remained around Manbij. On the next day Turkish planes bombed the SDF-aligned Jarabulus Military Council positions in the village of Amarna, 10 km south of Jarabulus. According to the SDF, civilian homes were also hit and the SDF avoided moving north to prevent escalation of the clashes. The Turks and the rebel forces then attacked and captured the SDF-held villages of Mazaalah and Yousif Bayk, while also attempting to advance against the stragetic significant hilltop of Amarna. In response to the attacks, mostly Arab SDF groups such as the Northern Sun Battalion announced that they would send reinforcements to help the Jarabulus Military Council. Later that day, one Turkish soldier was killed and three were wounded in an anti-tank missile attack on a Turkish tank south of Jarabulus. According to Turkish military sources the missile was fired from territory held by the SDF. The soldier's death was the first reported fatality on the Turkish side. Turkish forces retaliated with artillery fire. Meanwhile, the Turkish Free Syrian Army (TFSA) cleared Jarabulus of mines and explosives planted by ISIL militants before their withdrawal from the town. The Turkish Red Crescent started distributing food after landmines and other explosives had been cleared from the border between Karkamis in Turkey and Jarabulus in Syria. The humanitarian movement handed out various food supplies for around 5,000 people in the town. Taking advantage of the fighting between the SDF and the FSA, ISIL launched a massive counteroffensive and captured al-Rai, according to the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights (SOHR). On 28 August, according to the SOHR and Aleppo24, at least 20 civilians were killed and 50 wounded in Turkish artillery fire and air strikes on the village of Jeb el-Kussa, and another 28 were killed and 25 wounded in Turkish air strikes near the town of Al-Amarneh and the village of Saressat. At least four SDF fighters had also been killed and 15 injured in the Turkish bombardment of the two areas. Syrian monitoring groups reported that at least 70 people were killed over the weekend (27‚Äì28 August), most of whom were civilians, in the Turkish operations. Turkish officials didn't comment on the reported civilian death toll, except to say that commanders were taking all necessary measures to protect noncombatants. Turkey stated to have killed 25 PKK and YPG militants in the course of the airstrikes. Turkish- backed forces then began a major attack against the SDF positions, capturing Amarna and nearby Ain al-Bayda; rebel groups also stated to have taken the villages of Qusa, Balaban, Dabisa, Jeb el-Kussa, Suraysat, Umm Routha, Maghayer and Qiratah further south, though this could not be independently confirmed. The ANF News Agency published a video of two Turkish army tanks destroyed by SDF anti-tank missiles. Meanwhile, Turkish-backed Sham Legion fighters released footage showing them torturing SDF prisoners. Some of the Syrian refugees, mainly Syrian Turkmen and Arabs who were living in the area which TFSA forces captured, returned to the Jarabulus area. Erdoƒüan stated that the necessary help would be given to other refugees who wished to return to their homeland and Turkish Minister of Foreign Affairs Mevl√ºt √áavu≈üoƒülu said the YPG was committing ethnic cleansing in areas which were opposed to them. On 29 August, Ibrahim Ibrahim, head of the Rojava Media Cell, stated that local forces in Jarabulus and Manbij were being reinforced but said reports that the YPG was reinforcing Manbij was false. The United States' envoy to the anti-ISIL coalition called the clashes between the SDF and Turkish-backed rebels a \\"source of deep concern\\". The spokesman for the Pentagon called for the YPG to pull back to the east of the river, which he stated had largely occurred. He also warned that such clashes enabled ISIL to find sanctuary and continue planning attacks. In the course of the day, Turkish and Turkish-backed forces first captured all remaining SDF positions north of the Sajur River, and then proceeded to cross it to take three more villages, bringing the number of villages captured by the rebels to 21. =Rebel‚ÄìSDF ceasefire attempt; Rebel fighting against ISIL continued (30 August ‚Äì 2 September)= On 30 August, John Thomas, a spokesman for the US Central Command stated that Turkey and SDF had agreed to stop fighting each other and had opened communications with the United States as well as with each other. Jarabulus Military Council stated that it had reached a temporary ceasefire agreement with Turkey after mediation by the US-led anti-ISIL coalition. It also stated that the ceasefire had started around midnight of 29‚Äì30 August. On the same day, Turkey's foreign ministry said the U.S.' comments regarding the objectives of the Turkish military operation in Syria were unacceptable and that the country would continue its operations until it achieved the goal of eliminating \\"terrorist threats in the region\\". Turkish military sources and commander of a Syrian opposition group said a ceasefire had not taken effect. The commander stated however while there was a pause in the operation, it would resume shortly. The U.S. welcomed the putative pause in fighting. Later in the day, Turkish Armed Forces stated that a Turkish tank near Sajur river had been hit by a rocket. However, it was not clear who had carried out the attack. The Turkish military carried out a strike 45 minutes after the tank was hit and stated it had destroyed a group of \\"terrorists\\" west of Jarabulus. It also stated that it had carried out airstrikes against ISIL targets in Kulliyah in northern Syria. SOHR confirmed that there was a pause in fighting between the two groups around Jarabulus and Sajor river. General Joseph Votel meanwhile stated that Kurdish fighters had moved to east of Euphrates as per their commitment. Also on 30 August, SDF forces with coalition support started the Western al-Bab offensive against ISIL in the southwest of the region. On 31 August, Turkey's officials rejected the announcement of ceasefire made by the U.S. shortly prior, saying Turkey would not accept any compromise or ceasefire between Turkey and what Turkey saw as terrorist elements. Turkish Prime Minister Binali Yƒ±ldƒ±rƒ±m said that \\"operations will continue until all terrorist elements have been neutralised, until all threats to our borders, our lands and our citizens are completely over\\". Meanwhile, ISIL launched a massive counterattack in the southwestern countryside of Jarabulus preceded by a suicide attack. The militants captured four villages (Kiliyeh, Arab Hasan Saghir, Al-Muhsinli, and Al-Bulduq) from both the SDF and Turkish-backed rebels. Two Turkish tanks were reportedly destroyed in the clashes. On 1 September 2016, explosive experts of the Turkish Armed Forces cleared mines from the area around Jarabulus using controlled explosions. The de-mining operation on the Syrian side of the border was visible from the Turkish border town of Karkamƒ±≈ü. An AFP photographer nearby heard at least a dozen explosions. Turkish prime minister's spokesman said the Turkish government would treat foreign volunteers as terrorists, and Yasin Aktay, a spokesman for Turkey's ruling Justice and Development Party (AKP), speaking to Middle East Eye opined that when it comes to Europeans or Americans joining the YPG, they could only be considered \\"crusaders\\" or intelligence agents. Macer Gifford, a prominent British volunteer with the YPG and leader of its medical unit was quoted as saying \\"only in the minds of right wing and nationalist politicians in Turkey could the volunteers ever be called terrorists\\"; he said that while he had no intention to fight against Turkey, he would do so if and when Turkey attacked the YPG. Later on 2 September 2016, a statement released by the Turkish military said that a total of 271 targets were hit 1195 times by the Turkish Armed Forces and the Free Syrian Army while anti-ISIL coalition jets struck two ISIL targets. Also, the Turkish-backed FSA captured the Syrian village of Qundarah from ISIL. The Turkish military also said that the Turkish Air Force destroyed three buildings used by ISIL in Arab Ezza and Qundarah with airstrikes. Also on 2 September, the leader of a SDF component group Liberation Brigade, Abdul Karim Obeid, defected to the camp of Turkish-backed rebels with 20 to 50 of his men, citing opposition to reported YPG domination of the SDF, while SDF sources suggested: \\"he was displeased with the civil administration of the Federation of Northern Syria ‚Äì Rojava replacing \\"warlordist\\" political rule\\". =Turkey enters the rebel's al-Rai front against ISIL (3‚Äì19 September)= On 3 September, Turkey additionally deployed tanks to the Syrian town of al-Rai to help the Turkish-backed rebels to push east from the town towards villages captured by the rebels west of Jarabulus. The incursion was launched from Kilis Province which had been frequently targeted with rocket attacks from ISIL. The Sham Legion and the Hamza Division also announced they had captured four villages (Fursan, Lilawa, Kino and Najma) south of Arab Ezza.

Earlier, US troops on gun trucks, followed by a Turkish tank and trucks carrying US-allied FSA fighters, withdrew from al- Rai back into Turkey after some fighters of Ahrar al-Sharqya, a Free Syrian Army labeled rebel group, denounced them as \\"infidels\\" and \\"Crusaders\\".

After Turkish Free Syrian Army(TFSA) units had captured a few villages from ISIL, By 23 September ISIL had recaptured more than 20 villages from the rebels. Due to the rebel losses, the offensive was halted and the third phase of the Turkish operation was put on hold. A late September piece in Al-Monitor assessed the campaign as follows: \\"IS has recaptured scores of Turkmen villages south of Jarablus from FSA militias. (...) From the outset, there were doubts about whether Euphrates Shield could be sustained without the involvement of Turkish ground troops. It was not difficult to foresee that the biggest weakness was the inadequacy of the motley crew of jihadists assembled under the FSA banner. To make up for this deficiency, the Turkish army will have to deploy increasing numbers of troops to advance southward in Syria and thus into the quagmire.\\" In the immediate aftermath of the aborted offensive towards al-Bab, the TFSA and Turkey launched a new offensive towards the ISIL-held town of Dabiq. On 1 October, the Turkish Parliament extended the military operation's mandate for another year. The next day, Turkish-backed opposition forces started advancing; Turkmen villages Boztepe (Tallat al- Baydah), T√ºrkmenbarƒ± and Hurdanah were taken over by Turkish-backed rebel forces. On 5 October, TFSA primarily driven by the Sultan Murad Division, took control of four more villages from ISIL and, with the Turkish Special Forces, entered the small and strategic town of Akhtarin, easing the way for the planned attack on Dabiq. The town was captured by them on 6 October.Turkish- backed rebels capture important town from ISIS in northern Aleppo Al-Masdar News (6 October 2016) After taking control of the supply route between Al-Bab and Dabiq by taking Akhtarin and its vicinity, on 9 October, Turkey and the affiliated rebels announced that the area between Mare, Akhtarin and Kafrghan, an area which contains two important IS-held locations, Sawran and Dabiq, a military zone.

One week later, following heavy clashes around the area, on 16 October, the FSA, headed by Sultan Murad Division, first took control of Sawran, Syria and continued towards Dabiq. One day earlier, IS leader Baghdadi published a voice record stating that the \\"Dabiq War\\", which IS was using as ritual propaganda, \\"isn't this ongoing one\\". Soon after Sawran, full control in Dabiq was also taken and rebel forces went as south as Asunbul to secure the newly acquired area before proceeding to the next stage of the offensive targeting Qabasin and Bab. =Clashes between SDF, ISIS and rebels: western al-Bab offensive (18 October ‚Äì 3 November)= Turkish-backed FSA fighter loads an M2 Browning during the fighting in northern Aleppo Governorate On 18 October, the Northern Thunder Brigade issued an ultimatum to the \\"PKK\\" and the Army of Revolutionaries, warning them to leave Tell Rifaat within 48 hours after which they will attack the town. On 19 October, following capturing the last remaining IS-held villages between the control line of the SDF, Turkey-backed rebels started an offensive towards the SDF positions in Shahba region and Tell Rifaat with Turkish support. Following the first days of clashes and strikes, the Turkish army said that its air strikes have killed 160 to 200 YPG members with maximum care for civilians. Syrian government sources however reported around such a number of civilians killed. SDF sources reported 11 fighters from their ranks killed. SOHR stated that death toll was around 20, possible 4 civilians included. On 22 October, first reports gains were announced by the rebel factions, namely 2 to 3 villages, which later turned out to be untrue. Turkish-backed rebels surrounded Shaykh Issa, just east of Tell Rifaat. Turkish artillery shelling and air strikes mainly focused on Tell Rifaat, Shaykh Issa and villages under SDF control in western al-Bab. Turkish tanks entered Syria also from the west, from Hatay region into Idlib region, to the southernmost point of the PYD-held Afrin canton and positioned on hills overlooking Tel Rifat and Afrin. By 25 October, it became evident that the SDF had repelled all assaults by Turkish-backed rebels on villages and positions under its control. ANHA stated that the \\"failures and casualties\\" despite \\"major\\" Turkish support had \\"demoralized\\" rebel groups and caused their retreat from further attacks against the SDF. Of the commanders from the Northern Thunder Brigade who issued the ultimatum, one was reportedly killed in action and one was seriously injured. In a counterattack, the SDF stated to have captured two villages from the rebels. =Al-Bab (6 November 2016 ‚Äì 23 February 2017)= Al-Bab military council fighters during the Battle of al- Bab. On 6 November, the rebels supported by Turkish planes and artillery advanced south towards al-Bab, entering the northern outskirts of the city on 14 November. The US-led coalition did not support the offensive due to it being an independent Turkish operation. On 24 November, according to the Turkish military, the Syrian Arab Air Force conducted an airstrike against Turkish Special Operations Forces and aligned Turkish-backed rebels north of al-Bab, killing four Turkish soldiers and injuring 11 otherm one seriously. While the Turkish Prime Minister's office has issued a temporary gag order on reporting about the airstrike, main opposition Republican People's Party (CHP) leader Kemal Kƒ±lƒ±√ßdaroƒülu called on the Turkish government to \\"act with common sense.\\" Prime Minister Binali Yildirim issued a statement whereby he assured the aggression \\"will not be left unanswered\\" promising the Turkish military's determination to \\"clear the area of terrorists is unaffected by the move.\\" Turkish officials initially stated the casualties were due to an ISIL attack, before blaming the Syrian Air Force. However, the pro-opposition activist group the SOHR disputed it was an air-strike and stated it was in fact an ISIL suicide attack. Additionally, ISIL confirmed it conducted a suicide attack in the area. On 25 November, the Syrian airforce said that their jets have not bombed Turkish soldiers. TFSA technical in the outskirts of al-Bab On 8 January 2017, the New York Times reported that momentum gained with the ouster of Daesh from Jarablus was stalled at al-Bab due to heavy resistance and an inexplicable lack of U.S. air support. In response, the Turkish government sought aid from Russian airstrikes against ISIS positions. On 2 February 2017, Sky News reported that Turkish aircraft killed 51 IS fighters in the space of 24 hours in the areas of al Bab, Tadif, Kabbasin and Bzagah, the airstrikes targeted buildings and vehicles resulting in 85 IS positions destroyed.

On 28 February, Turkish president Erdogan announced that the Turkish-backed forces would assault Manbij after completing their operations in al-Bab as originally planned. He called for the YPG to be moved to the east of the river and ruled out any cooperation with the SDF. Clashes erupted between both sides, with the Turkish-supported rebels quickly advancing through five villages west of the city. On 2 March, the Manbij Military Council announced that it had reached an agreement with Russia to hand over villages to the west of Manbij to the Syrian government in the coming days in order to protect them from being assaulted by Turkish-backed forces. Turkey's foreign minister Mevl√ºt √áavu≈üoƒülu requested from the United States to force Kurdish troops to withdraw from Manbij. The SDF later launched a counter-attack, retaking several villages that had been captured by the rebels a day earlier. The Russian General Staff's Sergey Rudosky as well as the United States Department of Defense confirmed on 3 March that the SDF had agreed to hand over villages to the west of Manbij to the Syrian government.

After marrying him, her family disowned her and she lost contact with them. Kitagawa earned her Ph.D. from the University of Chicago in 1951. She worked for a local urban research center, and then became an assistant professor at Chicago in 1954. She stayed there for the rest of her career, with a promotion to full professor in 1970, until her 1989 retirement. Her husband also worked at Chicago, as professor of history of religions and dean of the divinity school. Her honors included election as a fellow of the American Sociological Association (1959) and American Statistical Association (1968). Her daughter, Anne Rose Kitagawa, is notable as a curator of Asian art.

Due to the repeated stress concentration, a crack starts in the overlay that has a similar shape to the crack in the old pavement. This crack is called a \\"reflective crack\\". Reflective cracking can be categorized as one of the distresses in asphalt pavement. It can affect the general performance and durability of the pavement.

In 1924 he sat, briefly, as a member of the national parliament (Reichstag). Sources may refer to him using the name \\"Max Richter\\", the cover-name under which he sometimes operated between 1933 and 1935. In 1933, some months after the Nazi power seizure, he fled from Nazi Germany, ending up as a political refugee in Moscow. Here he was arrested in 1937 and then sentenced and shot in 1938. Life =Early years= Schubert was born in Lengefeld, a small mining town in the hills south of Chemnitz, not far from the German border with what was, at the time, the Austrian province of Bohemia. He attended school in the town. One source states that his early work was as a miner and another adds that he trained locally as a metal worker with \\"Wittig & Schwabe\\". He joined the German Metal Workers' Union when he was only sixteen. He also joined the Social Democratic Party (SPD), although sources differ as to whether he did this in 1907 or 1912. By 1912 he had moved to Leipzig where he was employed full-time as the secretary of the Workers' Gymnastics Association (\\"Arbeiter-Turnerbund\\"). At the outbreak of war in 1914, the decision of the party to implement an effective political truce over funding for the war was immediately contentious within the party, and internal divisions grew as economic destitution at home and industrial-scale slaughter on the frontline mounted. In 1917 the party split: Schubert was one of those who went with the breakaway faction, forming the short-lived Independent Social Democratic Party (\\"Unabh√§ngige Sozialdemokratische Partei Deutschlands\\" / USPD). Three years later the USPD itself broke up, and Hermann Schubert was a member of the majority group that now joined the recently launched Communist Party. =Communist politician= Early in the 1920s Hermann Schubert was in one of the first batches of German communists to attend a course at what became the International Lenin School in Moscow. He became a trades union secretary in Suhl in 1922, and in 1923 was among the delegates at the 8th Communist party conference, held that year in Leipzig. He also played a leading part in the armed insurrection that broke out in Thuringia later in 1923, as a result of which he was arrested early in 1924. However, on 27 April 1924 party comrades stormed the jail in Suhl and succeeded in releasing him. In the general election of May 1924 Schubert's name appeared on the Communist Party candidate list for Election district 12 (Thuringia). The party secured sufficient votes in Thuringia to give it four seats in the national Reichstag, and Schubert's name was high enough up on the party list for one of them to be his. Reichstag membership would normally have secured him some level of parliamentary immunity. However, in the wake of street disturbances across several parts of Germany during 1923, in November of that year a court had declared the Communist Party illegal: the ban was still in force through the summer of 1924 and election to the Reichstag in May 1924 provided no effective immunity against re-arrest. In July 1924, after just two months, Schubert resigned his Reichstag seat and relocated to the Ruhr area in the west of the country, which at this point was still under French military occupation in connection with an ongoing dispute about war reparations. Schubert pursued his (now illegal) party work in the Ruhr region, where he was appointed regional party secretary at Bochum. However, on 21 October 1924, despite holding a false passport, Schubert was re-arrested. In December 1924 he was elected a member of the Prussian regional parliament (\\"Landtag\\"), and was released from jail in January 1925. He continued at this stage to be based for much of the time in the Ruhr area, serving as a member of the Communist Party district leadership team (\\"Bezirksleitung\\") in Essen with particular responsibility for trades union matters till 1928, which was also the year in which he was re- elected to the Prussian Landtag, in which he served till 1933. During this time Schubert came into contact with Wilhelm Florin. At the end of 1928 serious differences arose between the two men, and Schubert was transferred, briefly, to party duties in Berlin where he worked till March 1929 in the \\"Comradeship Department\\" (\\"Genossenschaftsabteilung\\") of the Party Central Committee, before being sent to East Prussia as a regional \\"Polleiter\\" (\\"Leiter der Abteilung Politik\\" / Policy Head). Between May 1930 and early 1933 he was undertaking secretarial duties as part of the regional leadership team (Bezirksleitung) in Hamburg-Wasserkante, the large region surrounding Hamburg on the right bank of the Elbe estuary. In 1931 he was appointed \\"Polleiter\\" for Hamburg-Wasserkante. At the 1929 party conference, held that year in Berlin-Wedding, Schubert's name was placed on the candidate list for membership of the Communist Party Central Committee, which was the party's ruling body nationally. After just two years, in 1931, he was co-opted into the Central Committee, and in 1932 the party leader Ernst Th√§lmann, appointed him to membership of the Politburo, which was the executive committee within the Central Committee.Bund Sozialistischer Arbeiter, Das Ende der DDR. Eine politische Autopsie, 1992, p. 32. =Nazi Germany: Soviet exile= In January 1933 the political backdrop was transformed when the Nazi Party took power and converted Germany into a one-party dictatorship. Political activity - except in support of the Nazi Party - became illegal. At the end of February 1933 the Reichstag fire was instantly blamed on the Communists, and in March 1933 the party leader, Schubert's friend Ernst Th√§lmann, was arrested: Schubert immediately went to Berlin, as recently agreed with Th√§lmann, in order to take over the chairmanship of the illegal Communist Party. This unleashed a political struggle with Schubert and John Schehr on one side and Walter Ulbricht on the other. Ulbricht was already a shrewd and ruthless political operator who coveted the party leadership for himself. Schehr was discovered and arrested in November 1933, but Schubert remained active in the party leadership. Schubert and Schehr, backed by a politburo majority that included Wilhelm Florin, and Franz Dahlem, were keen to continue with Th√§lmann's uncompromisingly left-wing Communist agenda, while Ulbricht, backed by another future heavy hitter, Wilhelm Pieck, appeared to advocate a more pragmatic future for the party. The division reflected a series of bitter disputes and splits that had affected the German and Soviet Communist Parties during the 1920s, and would provide a defining context for Schubert's political career in the run-up to his execution in 1938. In Autumn 1933 Hermann Schubert fled from Nazi Germany, crossing the frontier from his home region into Czechoslovakia where leading exiled German communists were attempting to regroup in Prague. He moved on to the Saarland, a part of Germany still at this point under French military occupation, and from there to Paris, where a more permanent headquarters for the German Communist Party in exile was forming. However, in December 1934 he was one of the communist leaders who relocated again, this time to Moscow, still representing the party's left-wing within the Party Central Committee. Between 1933 and 1935 (sometimes applying the cover-name \\"Max Richter\\") Schubert played a decisive role in the party leadership. A meeting took place in January 1935 between the German Communist Party leadership and the Comintern at which Schubert's appointment to the Comintern executive committee in succession to Fritz Heckert was agreed. However, just as the political tide in Moscow was clearly turning against the Comintern, so Schubert himself was becoming increasingly marginalised inside the party. It was the Ulbricht / Pieck faction that was becoming mainstream, and both Florin and Dahlem switched sides, joining Ulbricht's group. The first party conference since the Hitler power zeizure was held in Brussels in October 1935. It was here that Schubert and his friend Fritz Schulte were excluded from the party central committee, scapegoated for the party's misfortunes and distanced from the apparatus of the party and of the Comintern. He was given a relatively low-profile position in International Red Aid, the international Communist workers' welfare organisation. However, on 15 May 1937, in the context of the purges (\\" –ß–∏—Å—Ç–∫–∏\\") that were a feature of political life in Moscow during the later 1930s, Hermann Schubert was arrested by the NKVD. He was identified as a participant in the \\"Anti-Comintern block\\", and on 22 March 1938 he was condemned to death and, later the same day, shot. Two months later, in May 1938, the government back home in Germany posthumously stripped Hermann Schubert of his German citizenship.

Jenkins won the gold medal in the women's vault at the 1990 Commonwealth Games in Auckland, New Zealand. She had been considered an outsider at the event who was not expected to have a high placing. Consequently she became the youngest New Zealander to win a gold medal at either the Commonwealth or Olympic Games. Following the Games, Jenkins had increased demands from the media and expectations from the public. She was invited to a prestigious event in Russia and after that she prepared for the 1991 World Championships, where she intended to gain an individual qualification for the 1992 Summer Olympics in Barcelona, Spain. Unfortunately she contracted measles before the 1991 event and this meant that she could not compete. Moreover all the competitors were required to be inoculated and this caused some suspicion amongst a few nations. This brought unwanted attention on New Zealand and Jenkins. Jenkins was unable to qualify for the Barcelona Olympics and continued with gymnastics, but her dream had come to an end and she eventually quit. She opted to study physical education at the University of Otago. Sources differ whether she has been teaching physical education at schools in Auckland, or whether she lives in Australia and is involved in performing arts.

Controversy On January 20, 2017, CNN reported Meitu apps are collecting information about users for advertising purposes, and sends that data back to servers in China. But Meitu denied CNN's report that the app is leaking users' privacy. The company said collecting users' data is to \\"optimize app performance, its effects and features, and to better understand our consumer engagement with in-app advertisements\\" in an official statement. The permissions include certain geolocation and app-checking code to comply with advertising network requirements in China, where jailbroken devices can be used to defraud advertisers, and advertisers may demand that their messages be geofenced to appear only in certain regions. Apple confirmed that the app was and remains in compliance. Meitu's makers are quoted as saying: ‚ÄúOur mission is to make the world a more beautiful place.‚Äù They have made achieving beauty a matter of a couple clicks. In the modern competitive world in China beauty has become a source of capital. Meitu has made it easy to edit one's photos to give a competitive edge in job applications. Due to the widespread nature of Meitu, Chinese beauty culture has been irrevocably changed. Beauty standards in China have become linked to the Meitu definitions of beauty. It has become common practice in China for people, largely women, to take their Meitu edited pictures to plastic surgeons as examples for what they want to look like. In June 2020, the Government of India banned Meitu app with 58 other Chinese origin apps citing data and privacy issues. The border tensions in 2020 between India and China might have also played a role in the ban.

They are the localised adaptation of the Five Forms of the Highest Deity (‰∫îÊñπ‰∏äÂ∏ù W«îfƒÅng Sh√†ngd√¨) of common Chinese theology. Names and meanings In some places of Hebei, the cult comprises four instead of five zoomorphic gods, including the Fox, the Weasel, the Hedgehog and the Snake Gods (ÂõõÂ§ß‰ªô S√¨d√†xiƒÅn, ÂõõÂ§ßÈó® S√¨d√†m√©n). While the Fox God and the Weasel God always remain the two prominent members of the cult, the other positions vary in some regions including the Tiger, the Wolf, the Hare and the Turtle Gods. Li Qingchen (?-1897), a scholar of Tianjin, explained the images of the Five Great Immortals as follows: ::[...] the Five Immortals [...] are: Áãê H√∫ is fox, ÈªÑ Hu√°ng is weasel, ÁôΩ B√°i is hedgehog, Êü≥ Li«î is snake and ÁÅ∞ Huƒ´ is rat. I said these five can be distinguished by five colors. [...] White and yellow are hedgehog's and weasel's original colors, Huƒ´ is black and Li«î is green. [...] The Ode of Songs reads: \\"Nothing is redder than fox\\". As gods of wealth, the Five Immortals are also known by the epithet of \\"Little Wealth Gods\\" (Â∞èË¥¢Á•û Xi«éoc√°ish√©n). The Five Immortals have both male and female form, usually represented twosomes. =Huxian‚ÄîFox Immortal= H√∫xiƒÅn (Áãê‰ªô=ËÉ°‰ªô \\"Fox Immortal\\"), also called H√∫sh√©n (ÁãêÁ•û=ËÉ°Á•û \\"Fox God\\") or H√∫w√°ng (ÁãêÁéã=ËÉ°Áéã \\"Fox Ruler\\") is possibly the most important of the Five Immortals in northeast China. Nagao Ryuz≈ç, a Japanese sinologist, observed that the Fox Gods \\"enjoy such popularity to be worshipped by almost every household in north China and Manchuria\\". Henry Dor√© documented the worship of the Fox God in the northern parts of Jiangsu and Anhui. In parts of Hebei, to every newborn is assigned his own bƒõnsh√©n (Êú¨Á•û patron god) manifestation of Huxian, usually a female for a boy and a male for a girl. After these boys and girls get married, their patrons will be represented sitting together. In his survey of popular shrines and temples in Manchuria, Takizawa Shunry≈ç found the number dedicated to Fox Gods overwhelming. The deity can be represented as either male or female, but is most frequently identified as the female H√∫xiƒÅn Ni√°ngni√°ng (Áãê‰ªôÂ®òÂ®ò \\"Fox Immortal Lady\\") whose animal form is a nine-tailed fox. She is the Chinese equivalent of the Japanese Shint≈ç cult of Inari ≈åkami, both god(desses) of the foxes or collective representations of the fox sprites. The fox deity is also represented as a couple of gods, male and female, called the Great Lord of the Three Foxes (ËÉ°‰∏âÂ§™Áà∑ H√∫sƒÅn T√†iy√©) and the Great Lady of the Three Foxes (ËÉ°‰∏âÂ§™Â•∂ H√∫sƒÅn T√†in«éi). As a goddess, the Fox Immortal is related to Xƒ´w√°ngm«î (Ë•øÁéãÊØç \\"Queen Mother of the West\\"), the great goddess guardian of Mount Kunlun (axis mundi). pp. 88-89 & 184 =Huangxian‚ÄîWeasel Immortal= Hu√°ngxiƒÅn (ÈªÉ‰ªô literally \\"Yellow Immortal\\") is the Weasel God, and is identified as an incarnation of the pan-Chinese Yellow Deity (ÈªÑÂ∏ù Hu√°ngd√¨) and Hu√°ng D√†xiƒÅn (ÈªÑÂ§ß‰ªô \\"Great Yellow Immortal\\").Wang Xue. ‰∏úÂåóÂÜúÊùëÂú∞Âå∫ÈªÑ‰ªô‰ø°‰ª∞ÁöÑ‰∫∫Á±ªÂ≠¶Á†îÁ©∂ D≈çngbƒõi n√≥ngc≈´n d√¨q≈´ hu√°ng xiƒÅn x√¨ny«éng de r√©nl√®i xu√© y√°nji≈´.

Another name which indicates the collective personification of weasels is \\"Great Lord of the Two Yellows\\" (ÈªÑ‰∫åÂ§™Áà∑ Hu√°ng√®r T√†iy√©). =Shexian‚ÄîSnake Immortal= The Snake God is either called Sh√©xiƒÅn (Ëõá‰ªô literally \\"Snake Immortal\\"), Li«îxiƒÅn (Êü≥‰ªô \\"Immortal Liu\\"), or Ch√°ngxiƒÅn (Â∏∏‰ªô \\"Viper Immortal\\"). Alternatively he is M«éngxiƒÅn (Ëüí‰ªô \\"Python (or Boa) Immortal\\"). Considered an incarnation of the Dragon God, the snake traditionally represents generation and activity (yang). As such, it is also associated to Fuxi and N√ºwa, respectively the snake-bodied patron of heaven (Â§©Áöá TiƒÅnhu√°ng) and patroness of earth (Âú∞Áöá Dehu√°ng), who represent the two forces who concur in the birth of things. =Baixian‚ÄîHedgehog Immortal= The B√°ixiƒÅn (ÁôΩ‰ªô \\"White Immortal\\") is the Hedgehog God.

Biography Stanko Horvat graduated from the Music Academy in Zagreb in 1956 where he studied composition in the class of Stjepan ≈†ulek. He further studied on the Paris Conservatoire (1958‚Äì59) with T. Aubin and privately with Ren√© Leibowitz. At the Electronic Studio of the Technical University of Berlin he has done studio research (1977‚Äì78). Between 1961 and 1999, when he retired, he taught at the Music Academy in Zagreb and many of the important Croatian composers were his students. He has had a number of important public functions (Artistic Director of the Music Biennale Zagreb 1985-89; President of the Croatian Composers' Society, 1974‚Äì79, etc.). He is a member of the Croatian Academy of Sciences and Arts and has received numerous awards and much recognition for his work. Oeuvre Horvat‚Äôs first works are deeply rooted in the classical tradition (Concertino for Strings, 1952). After studying in Paris ‚Äì and under Leibowitz‚Äôs influence ‚Äì he turned to dodecaphony, serialism and other contemporary composition techniques. However, he soon abandoned them as they are incompatible with his sensibility. The Polish School had a much stronger influence on his work (Contrasts for the String Quartet, 1963). In all musical forms that he has employed, Horvat has focused primarily on musical expression. He is inclined towards pure sound, simple form and traditional treatment of the instrument. His works reveal a desire for reconciliation of the contemporary and romantic, the exact and free form, the structured and improvised. His fondness towards simplicity of texture is always apparent, occasionally reminding us of minimalistic music (Accords, 1979; Ostinati, 1983; Concertino for the Piano and Strings, 1996; In modo rustico for the bass-clarinet and piano, 1997).

Context In 1940, confronted with the successful Blitzkrieg of Nazi Germany against Poland and France, and the German Panzer divisions lined up along their border, the Swiss government found itself in an awkward position. The Germans even demanded apologies for the destruction of German planes which had been shot down by the Swiss after violating the Swiss airspace and the Armistice of 22 June 1940 between France and Germany made it likely that German invasion plans of Switzerland would be implemented. There were strong trends within Switzerland which advocated submission to the Germans. Sustained Nazi propaganda emanated from the 30,000-strong German community in Switzerland, the German embassy and consulates and from the extreme right (\\"Fronts Movement\\" or \\"Frontismus\\") which became amalgamated into the Swiss National Movement in June 1940.Georges Andr√© Chevallaz, The Challenge of Neutrality: Diplomacy and the Defense of Switzerland, Lexington Books, 2001, , 278 pages, p. 95 The then President of the Swiss Confederation and Foreign Minister, Marcel Pilet-Golaz delivered on 25 June 1940 an ambiguous speech where he made allusions to an \\"adaptation to the new conditions\\", a \\"partial demobilization of the Army\\", a \\"national turnaround\\", a more authoritarian regime for Switzerland and to a \\"new order\\" in Europe, in short a lot of Petainist vocabulary mixed with consensual, religious-ringing rhetoric (which earned the speech the nickname of ‚Äúsermon‚Äù). The German version of this originally French text was slightly adapted and contained quite a few words reminiscent of National Socialist speech.Georges Andr√© Chevallaz, The Challenge of Neutrality: Diplomacy and the Defense of Switzerland, Lexington Books, 2001, , 278 pages, p. 38 His calculated but ambiguous attitude was confirmed and raise even more doubts within Switzerland when he received on the federal premises a delegation of the Swiss extreme right \\"frontists\\", on 10 and 14 September 1940. History =The launching of the Gotthard League= Fearing that defeatism and the effects of the Nazi propaganda would lead the federal government to submit to the Germans and give up the traditional democratic values of Switzerland, a group of young people led by Denis de Rougemont and Professor Theophil Spoerri founded the Gotthard League on 30 June 1940 in order to defend both these values and the independence of Switzerland. On 22 July an ‚ÄúAppeal to the Swiss People‚Äù written by de Rougemont was published in the Swiss press to rally support for the movement.Christian Ackermann, Denis de Rougemont : une biographie intellectuelle, Labor et Fides, 1996, 1284 pages, , p. 652 Signatories were, besides de Rougemont and Spoerri, , who was at the time a military instructor and later became a politician within the Radical- Democratic Party (PRD);Biography of Walther Allg√∂wer, , from the conservative- liberal movement Redressement national;Biography of Robert Eibel, Christian Gasser, from the liberal ‚ÄúLigue des Non-Subventionn√©s‚Äù;Biography of Christian Gasser, , a social-democrat Christian trade-unionist;Biography of Ren√© Leyvraz, Philippe Mottu, from Moral Rearmament; Paul Sch√§fer, also from Moral Rearmament;Philippe Muller, Tout ce que ta main--, Publisher: L'√¢ge d'homme, Lausanne, 1991, , 164 pages, p. 36 Heinrich Schnyder, a manager from the Migros groceries firm.

Among the most notable supporters of the Gotthard League are Gottlieb Duttweiler, founder of the Migros chain of grocery stores, Protestant theologian Emil Brunner, conservative historian Gonzague de Reynold and socialist philosopher and psychologist Philippe M√ºller.Biography of Philippe Muller, It must be added that the opinion differences between Denis de Rougemont and Gonzague de Reynold did create serious difficulties which prevented the Gotthard League to communicate consistentlyChristian Ackermann, Denis de Rougemont : une biographie intellectuelle, Labor et Fides, 1996, 1284 pages, , pp. 644-647 and that the hurried departure of de Rougemont for a 5-year exile in the USA under pressure of the Germans probably helped tilt the balance towards the more conservative side of the Gotthard League.Kristina Schulz, Neutralit√© et engagement : Denis de Rougemont et le concept de ¬´ neutralit√© active ¬ª, ‚Äò‚ÄôA contrario‚Äô‚Äô magazine, 2006/2 (Vol. 4), Publisher: BSN Press, , 172 pages, pp.57-70 However the launching of the Gotthard League, facilitated by a personal gift of 50‚Äô000 Swiss francs, was a major event. The League‚Äôs manifesto was carried by no less than 74 Swiss newspapersJacques Meurant, La presse et l‚Äôopinion de la Suisse romande face √† l‚ÄôEurope en guerre, 1929-1941, Neuch√¢tel : La Baconni√®re, 1976, p. 388. and was followed by more publications in the following ten days, including one appeal signed by the respected Zurich professor Theo Spoerri, regarded as the leader of Moral Rearmament in Switzerland, who had been elected to lead the governing body of the Gotthard League. =Ideology= Denis de Rougemont wrote a 10-page manifesto entitled What Is the Gotthard League? (\\"Qu'est-ce que la Ligue du Gothard ?\\") explaining its principles: on one hand active neutrality and on the other hand faithfulness to the fundamental values of Switzerland such as federalism, in order to resist \\"at all costs\\" to totalitarianisms. It went on to add that the immediate means of action of the League rested entirely on its members' public expression. It appealed strongly in favour of the military defense of the r√©duit national around the Saint-Gotthard Massif ‚Äì as advocated by General Guisan, of intelligence gathering, of a series of economic and political reforms and of a \\"struggle against defeatism and deceitful propaganda\\". The plea in favour of the country‚Äôs military defense was totally in line with General Guisan‚Äôs strategy. (On 25 July 1940, General Guisan had delivered a historic address to the entire Swiss Officer Corps assembled on the R√ºtli, a location identified as the site of the founding act of the Swiss confederation in 1291. He had taken every disposition so that Switzerland could resist Nazi invasion and had made it very clear there would never be any surrender; Swiss citizens had been instructed to disregard any surrender broadcast, as it would either be done under threat or be enemy propaganda.Willi Gautschi, General Henri Guisan: Commander-In-Chief of the Swiss Army in World War, Front Street Press, 2003, 912 pages) This is hardly surprising since both Denis de Rougemont and Philippe Mottu worked for the \\"Army and Home\\" section at the Swiss Army's headquarters, an internal propaganda department which General Guisan strongly developed during the war years.Christian Ackermann, Denis de Rougemont : une biographie intellectuelle, Labor et Fides, 1996, 1284 pages, , pp. 637 However, the Gotthard League slowly shifted towards structures inspired by past regimes. The federal assembly representing the cantons was for instance named \\"Di√®te\\" (Diet) as in the Ancien R√©gime of Switzerland (prior to the 1798 French invasion).Daniel Bourgeois, Le changement politique apr√®s la d√©faite fran√ßaise de 1940, in \\"Mat√©riaux pour l‚Äôhistoire de notre temps\\" review, 2009/1 (Nr 93), Publisher : BDIC, Nanterre, France, 100 pages, p. 32-42 In the same spirit the Gotthard League decided in November 1940 to base its principles exclusively on Christianity; therefore, somewhat surprisingly albeit with chosen words, it kept Jews and Freemasons at bay: \\"The Gotthard League holds that emotional campaigns against Jews or Freemasons are not desirable. It believes that this country‚Äôs Christian traditions will remain the basis of our political life and that, in the future, the greatest clarity and candour will need to be applied. Given these principles, people to whom Christian traditions are foreign or belonging to organisations subject to secret or foreign influence are not eligible as Gotthard League members.\\"Christian Gasser, Der Gotthard-Bund; Eine schweizerische Widerstandsbewegung aus den Archiven 1940-1948, Bern und Stuttgart, 1984, p. 67, quoted by Roland Butikofer, Le refus de la modernit√© (La Ligue vaudoise: une extr√™me droite et la Suisse - 1919-1945, Lausanne, 1997, p. 362. =Early development= Working through press conferences, ¬´ patriotic evenings ¬ª, meetings, courses, advertisements, posters and pamphlets, the circa 8000 members of the League campaigned for collective social responsibility on matters such as agricultural development (to achieve food self-sufficiency, see :fr:Plan Wahlen), family protection, elderly care, and job creations. Their programme also included a revision of the political system introducing more authority in democracy and a corporatist organisation of the economy. The League adopted a federal structure, local teams being part of a federation, which itself was headed by a governing body (directoire) in charge of coordination the initiatives of the local groups. =Post-War Life= In 1951, activities were focalised on the national level. The main post-war issues were dealt with through over 300 ¬´ open letters ¬ª advocating solutions to the Swiss society‚Äôs new challenges. The Gotthard League was dissolved in 1969. Professor Spoerri remained its president until the end. Evaluation =Influence= The Gotthard League‚Äôs influence in Switzerland during the war years was sizeable.Michel Perdrisat, Le directoire de la Ligue du Gothard, 1940-1945, Entre r√©sistance et r√©novation, Editions Alphil, 166 pages, Denis de Rougemont wrote that the Gotthard League‚Äôs influence on the Swiss morale was distinctly felt after only one month of campaigning: it created ‚Äúa salutary shock on Swiss public opinion, restoring confidence in many a citizen and it gave birth to a great hope, dissipating some of the defeatist mists.‚Äù.Christian Ackermann, Denis de Rougemont : une biographie intellectuelle, Labor et Fides, 1996, 1284 pages, , p. 657 The Gotthard League also helped military officers who had been deeply unsettled by the Swiss President Pilet-Golaz‚Äô public address on 25 June and who were considering a coup, to stay within the limits of the law; one of them, captain Alfred Ernst, even donated 50‚Äô000 Swiss Francs (an inheritance) to the Gotthard League, so that the resistance message could be brought to the country by the Gotthard League rather than by the young revolted army officers, provided quick action was undertaken.Philippe Muller, Tout ce que ta main--, Publisher: L'√¢ge d'homme, Lausanne, 1991, , 164 pages, p. 35 =Criticism= The Gotthard League‚Äôs attempt to unite people from highly diverse backgrounds into a kind of union of opposites (Catholics and Protestants, French-speaking and German-speaking, political right and left, ‚Ä¶) raised questions in many quarters of Swiss society and criticism was both sharp and immediate ; in a letter dated 6 August 1940, Denis de Rougemont mentions ¬´ the 200 articles written against us ¬ª and he goes on to add ¬´ we are being accused with utmost assurance to be Nazis, Marxists, Catholics, Oxfordians, a daughter company of Duttweiler, utopians, fixers, etc. etc. ¬ª In 2001, Swiss historian Michel Perdrizat declared that the Gotthard League had led an ambiguous policy by trying to combine resistance spirit with a political renovation of Switzerland, going into the direction of a conservative, antidemocratic state; he regards the leaders of the Gotthard League as na√Øve. In 2009 however, historian Daniel Bourgeois warned that it is difficult to judge with hindsight. Whereas sympathy for French Mar√©chal Philippe P√©tain was widespread in the French-speaking part of Switzerland and could explain the resurgence of the French R√©volution nationale ideas or words in statements issued by movements such as the Gotthard League, there were other confusing words elsewhere in these tense and troubled times, like de Gaulle substituting \\"Honneur et Patrie\\" to \\"Libert√©, √âgalit√©, Fraternit√©\\" as the French national motto, or the \\"tragic Petainist illusion\\" harboured by Resistance hero Henri Frenay in the early moments of the French Resistance movement.

The measurement and control of both types during manufacture is essential to ensure optimum quality, acceptability and suitability for purpose of the product. For instance, in automotive manufacturing, a high quality reflective appearance is desirable with low reflection haze and high contrast whilst in packaging clear, low haze, highly transmissive films are required so that the contents, foods etc., can be clearly observed.  Reflection Haze  Reflection Haze is an optical phenomenon usually associated with high gloss surfaces, it is a common surface problem that can affect appearance quality. The reflection from an ideal high gloss surface should be clear and radiant, however, due to scattering at imperfections in the surface caused by microscopic structures or textures (‚âà 0.01 mm wavelength) the reflection can appear milky or hazy reducing the quality of its overall visual appearance. Causes of this could be due to a number of factors ‚Äì * Poor dispersion * Method of applying the coating * Variations in drying, curing or baking * Types of materials used in the formulation * Polishing or abrasion A high gloss surface with haze exhibits a milky finish with low reflective contrast- reflected highlights and lowlights are less pronounced. On surfaces with haze, halos are visible around the reflections of strong light sources. =Measurement= Measurement of reflection haze is primarily defined under three International test standards:  ASTM E430 ASTM E430-2011 Standard Test Methods for Measurement of Gloss of High-Gloss Surfaces by Abridged Goniophotometry  ASTM E430 comprises three test methods: Test method A specifies a 30¬∞ angle for specular gloss measurement, 28¬∞ or 32¬∞ for narrow-angle reflection haze measurement and 25¬∞ or 35¬∞ for wide-angle reflection haze measurement. Test method B specifies a 20¬∞ angle for specular gloss measurement and 18.1¬∞ and 21.9¬∞ for narrow-angle reflection haze measurement. Test method C specifies a 30¬∞ angle for specular gloss measurement, 28¬∞ or 32¬∞ for narrow-angle reflection haze measurement and 15¬∞ wide-angle reflection haze measurement.  ASTM D4039 ASTM D4039‚Äì09(2015) Standard Test Method for Reflection Haze of High-Gloss Surfaces  Test method specifies gloss measurements to be made at 20¬∞ and 60¬∞, the haze index is then calculated as the difference between the 60¬∞ and 20¬∞ measurements.  ISO 13803 ISO 13803:2014 (Paints and varnishes ‚Äì Determination of haze on paint films at 20 degrees)  Test method specifies a 20¬∞ angle for specular gloss measurement and 18.1¬∞ and 21.9¬∞ for narrow- angle reflection haze measurement. All test methods specify that measurements should be made with visible light according to CIE spectral luminous efficiency function V(Œª) in the CIE 1931 standard observer and CIE standard illuminant C. As most commercially available glossmeters have gloss measurement angles of 20¬∞, 60¬∞ and 85¬∞ haze measurement is incorporated at either 20¬∞ (ISO 13803 / ASTM E430 method B) or at 20¬∞ and 60¬∞ ( ASTM D4039). There are however some manufacturers that offer glossmeters with measurement angles of 30¬∞ and haze measurement in accordance with ASTM E430 Method A and C but are fewer in number, therefore for the purposes of detailing haze measurement theory only the first three methods will be included.  ISO 13803 / ASTM E430 method B  Both test methods measure specular gloss and haze together at 20¬∞ that means light is transmitted and received at an equal but opposite angle of 20¬∞. Specular gloss is measured over an angular range that is limited by aperture dimensions as defined in ASTM Test Method D523. The angular measurement range for this at 20¬∞ is ¬±0.9¬∞ (19.1¬∞ - 20.9¬∞). For haze measurement additional sensors are used either side of this range at 18.1¬∞ and 21.9¬∞ to measure the intensity of the scattered light. Both solid colours and those containing metallics can be measured using this method provided haze compensation is used (as detailed later).  ASTM D4039  This method can only be used on nonmetallic materials having a 60¬∞ specular gloss value greater than 70 in accordance with ASTM Test Method D523 / ISO 2813. Haze Index is calculated from gloss measurements made at 20 and 60 degrees as the difference between the two measurements (HI = G60-G20). As measurements of specular gloss depend largely on the refractive index of the material being measured 20¬∞ gloss will change more noticeably than 60¬∞ gloss, therefore as haze index is calculated using these two measurements it too will be affected by the refractive index of the material. Evaluations of reflection haze using this test method are therefore confined to samples of roughly the same refractive index.  Haze compensation  It is important to note that the colour (luminous reflectance) of a material can greatly influence the measurement of reflection haze. As colour and haze are both components of scattered light (diffuse reflectance) they must be separated so that only the haze value is quantified; this is also true for metallics or coatings containing metallic pigments where a higher scattering exists. As test method ASTM D4039 is only suitable for nonmetallic materials of more or less the same refractive index separation of the colour and haze components is not detailed. Haze index calculations and measurements using this test method will therefore produce higher haze results on brighter coloured materials than darker with the same level of haze present. The chart below shows these differences for various colours:- Graph showing the effects of haze compensation Both ISO 13803 and ASTM E430 method B require a separate measurement of luminous reflectance, Y, to calculate compensated haze. The tri-stimulus value Y gives a measure of the lightness of the material as defined in ISO 7724-2 requiring a 45¬∞/0¬∞ geometry to be used with standard illuminant C and 2¬∞ observer (although it is mentioned that slightly different conditions will not result in significant errors). Luminous reflectance measurements, Y, are required on both the sample material and a reference white; ISO 13803 details the use of a BaSO4 standard - Barium sulphate, a white crystalline solid having a white opaque appearance and high density as this material is a good substitute for a perfectly reflecting diffusor as defined under ISO 7724-2. Compensated haze can then be calculated as - H Comp = H Linear ‚Äì Y Sample / Y BaSO4 Using the ISO / ASTM method therefore to measure luminous reflectance produces a reliable measurement of Y for non-metallic surfaces as the diffuse component is lambertian, i.e. it is equal in amplitude at all angles in relation to the sample surface. Light reflections within a coating However, for metallic coatings and those containing speciality pigments, as the particles within the coating reflect the light directionally around the specular angle, little or no metallic reflection is present at the angle at which the luminosity is measured, therefore these types of coatings have an unexpectedly high haze reading. Using a measurement angle which is closer to the region adjacent to the haze angle has proven successful in providing compatible readings on solid colours and also compensating for directional reflection from metallic coatings and speciality pigments = Applications = Generally measurement of reflection haze is confined to high gloss paints and coatings and highly polished metals. Although there has been some degree of success using this measurement method for films it has proven unreliable due to variability caused by changes in the film thickness (internal refraction variations) and the background colour on which the film sample is placed. Generally haze measurement of films is performed using a transmission type hazemeter as described hereafter.  Transmission Haze  = Light and transparent materials = light and transparent materials When light strikes the surface of a transparent material the following interactions occur ‚Äì ‚Ä¢ Light is reflected from the front surface of the material ‚Ä¢ Some light is refracted within the material (depending on thickness) and reflected from the second surface ‚Ä¢ Light passes through the material at an angle which is determined by the refractive index of the material and the angle of illumination. The light that passes through the transparent material can be affected by irregularities within it; these can include poorly dispersed particles, contaminants (i.e. dust particles) and/or air spaces. This causes the light to scatter in different directions from the normal the degree of which being related to the size and number of irregularities present. Small irregularities cause the light to scatter, or diffuse, in all directions whilst large ones cause the light to be scattered forward in a narrow cone shape. These two types of scattering behaviour are known as Wide Angle Scattering, which causes haze due to the loss of transmissive contrast, and Narrow Angle Scattering a measure of clarity or the \\"see through quality\\" of the material based on a reduction of sharpness. These factors are therefore important for defining the transmitting properties of a transparent material- Transmission ‚Äì The amount of light that passes through the material without being scattered Haze ‚Äì The amount of light that is subject to Wide Angle Scattering (At an angle greater than 2.5¬∞ from normal (ASTM D1003)) Clarity ‚Äì The amount of light that is subject to Narrow Area Scattering (At an angle less than 2.5¬∞ from normal) = Measurement = Measurement of these factors is defined in two International test standards-  ASTM D1003 ASTM ASTM D1003 Standard Test Method for Haze and Luminous Transmittance of Transparent Plastics  ASTM D1003 comprises two test methods: Procedure A ‚Äì using a Hazemeter Procedure B ‚Äì using a Spectrophotometer  BS EN ISO 13468 Parts 1 and 2 BS EN ISO 13468 Plastics -- Determination of the total luminous transmittance of transparent materials  Part 1 ‚Äì Using a single beam Hazemeter Part 2 ‚Äì Using a dual beam Hazemeter The test methods specify the use of a Hazemeter as shown below - Transmission Haze Diagram A collimated beam of light from a light source (ASTM D1003 - Illuminant C, BS EN ISO 13468 Parts 1 and 2 - Illuminant D65 ) passes through a sample mounted on the entrance port of an integrating sphere. The light, which is uniformly distributed by a matte white highly reflective coating on the sphere walls, is measured by a photodetector positioned at 90¬∞ from the entrance port. A baffle mounted between the photodetector and the entrance port prevents direct exposure from the port. The exit port immediately opposite the entrance port contains a light trap to absorb all light from the light source when no sample is present. A shutter in this exit port coated with the same coating as the sphere walls allows the port to be opened and closed as required. Total transmittance is measured with the exit port closed. Transmittance haze is measured with the exit port open. Commercially available Hazemeters of this type perform both measurements automatically, the only operator interaction being the placement of the sample material on the measurement (entrance) port of the device.

The story begins with Sati and how Shiva finally gets back Sati in form of Parvati. After getting Parvati together , Shiva narrates the story of Rama to Parvati. The Plot of Ramayana begins with Dasarath's efforts of getting a son by holding a . The central plot of the Sanskrit Ramayana is followed in the text. However there are some significant departures in the sub plots and minor character. Hence it isn't a translation of original Sanskrit Ramayana. It is said that the poet hadn't read original Sanskrit Ramayana in his lifetime.And he wrote about it by getting information from local priests and folklore. Structure The work is written in a meter called Dandi Vritta.. It is a 14 letter meter suitable for narrative style.It is a lengthy work . The epic keeps seven cantos of the original Sanskrit Ramayan. They are : # Adi Kanda - # Ayodhya Kanda - # Bana Kanda - # Kishkindya Kanda - # Sundara Kanda - # Yudhaa Kanda - # Uttara kanda - Cultural aspects This work brought the tale of ramayana to the Odia speaking region and it became quite popular. It faced significant opposition from the Sanskrit proponents and opponents of Odia literature. It is heavily influenced by the Jagannath culture. In multiple places the writer says that the writing is carried out by Jagannath himself The book also enlightens some significant aspect of contemporary lifestyle. There are descriptions of pregnancy , customs and rituals followed during pregnancy etc. There descriptions of cultural practices that follows the birth of a child.

George Townsend Andrews, best known as a railway architect, designed the 1838 premises, which were demolished after 1896. Includes photograph of the building The West Yorkshire Archive Service holds the records of both of these institutions in addition to those of the infirmary. =From 1896= The infirmary's building in Free School Lane, Halifax, was opened on 28 April 1896 by the Duke and Duchess of York (the future George V and Queen Mary), who also opened the town's Borough Market that day. It is said that Queen Victoria had given permission for it to be named the \\"Halifax Royal Infirmary\\" but that the duke announced the wrong name, which was then retained. It became part of the National Health Service in 1948, and was part of the Calderdale Healthcare NHS Trust, which in 2001 merged into the Calderdale and Huddersfield NHS Foundation Trust.

It was released in Japan by Toho on August 20, 2016. Plot The film tells the story of Tsubasa Ono and Daisuke Yamada, who enter Shirato High School of Sapporo due to similar circumstances: the two idolize Shirato thanks to a good impression from one of its past baseball victories. Tsubasa, a girl who lacks self-confidence, wants to voice her opinion through her instrument of choice, trumpet, while Daisuke wants to join the school's baseball club and win the regional championship. The two make a promise that they will join the brass band and baseball clubs, respectively, and support each other for the championship. During their first year, Tsubasa and Daisuke befriend Yasushi Kido, who also joins the baseball club, and Himari Wakita, who warns Tsubasa of the brass band's strict commitments. Indeed, Tsubasa is overwhelmed by the club's unrelenting exercises, especially as she has no experience of playing a trumpet before, while her shyness is belittled by fellow freshman Aki Mizushima, a moody but prodigious trumpeter. Nevertheless, with Daisuke's encouragement, Tsubasa holds on and slowly learns the art of a trumpeter, aided by her upperclassman, Yuka Mori. When Yuka becomes depressed after being dismissed from the national championship team due to an injury, Tsubasa stubbornly visits her apartment to ask for her return. Though the brass band ultimately fails in claiming the gold medal, Yuka does return and thanks Tsubasa for her support. Meanwhile, the baseball team also loses the regional champion title that year, but Daisuke is touched when Tsubasa plays the winning march solo despite being forbidden to do so, which earns her a lash out from her teacher. Tsubasa eventually realizes that she is in love with Daisuke and confesses to him during one night, but he rejects her as he wants to concentrate on baseball first. Two years later, Tsubasa and Daisuke, now seniors, respectively become trainers for their respective clubs. Despite this, Tsubasa is initially not chosen to play for the national championship, though she requests for additional training and is ultimately selected. She and Mizushima have become friends and are facing a group of ambitious juniors unhappy with the team's current leadership. Meanwhile, a love rival for Tsubasa appears in the form of Akane Sawa, a junior member of the baseball club insisting that Tsubasa is merely hindering Daisuke, especially when Daisuke is handicapped after a training and has little chance to apply for the regional championship. To cheer him up, Tsubasa arranges for the entire brass band club to play an orchestra in front of Daisuke's ward. Daisuke eventually recovers enough for him to participate as a replacement member. At the regional championship, Shirato's baseball team initially loses track until Daisuke emerges as the team's replacement catcher. In the next half-inning, Daisuke is able to score a walkoff home run, thus winning the champion title. That afternoon, Tsubasa visits the school's hall of fame and is approached by Daisuke, who confesses his love for her. She accepts and the two kiss. During the credits, Shirato's brass band team is shown participating in the national championship and winning the gold medal.

Background Goode was a son of the physician John Goode Sr. (1886‚Äì1959) and the former Claudia Alice Nolte (1895‚Äì1969). In 1939, shortly after his sixteenth birthday, he graduated from Thomas Jefferson High School. He attended Washington and Lee University in Lexington, Virginia, for three years from 1939 to 1942, ultimately receiving his bachelor's degree in 1943 from the University of Texas at Austin. Military During World War II, Goode served in the United States Marine Corps as a combat infantry platoon leader and executive officer in the South Pacific battles of Cape Gloucester, New Britain, Peleliu, and Okinawa. In the two latter battles, he was wounded. He was honorably discharged in 1945 at the rank of captain. At Peleliu, as a second lieutenant, he received the Silver Star for courageous actions on September 27, 1944. When his platoon encountered the Japanese on a hill, Goode brought forward a machine-gun section. He pushed through hostile machine-gun and rifle fire which had already caused the death of one of his men and the wounding of two others. Twenty enemy soldiers were killed. Later in the day, Goode again braved hostile fire but managed to return to his support squad. His calm under hostile action and leadership in battle were determined to have saved the lives of many of his men. His superiors concluded that Goode's \\"gallant devotion to duty reflects great credit on [him] and the United States Naval Service.\\" Goode received the Bronze Star and a Presidential Unit Citation.\\"John W. Goode Jr.: Goode involved in law, politics: Active in legal and political ventures more than 40 years, but he was best known for his campaign against U.S. Rep. Henry B. Gonzalez in a special election in 1961\\", San Antonio Express-News, February 6, 1994 Family In 1949, Goode married the former Janet Irwin, who died prior to 2003. The couple's two sons were John III and George Irwin Goode, who predeceased his father. Goode III, known as \\"Grizzly\\" or \\"Johnny\\", was an artist and graphic designer who worked in the restaurant and nightclub business in San Antonio and was a state judo champion. Goode's sister, Eleanor Goode Brune (1927‚Äì2005), served as the national committeewoman of the Young Republican Federation of Texas from 1950 to 1956. Like her brother, she was a UT graduate. She also attended the Worden School of Social Work at Our Lady of the Lake University in San Antonio and was active in social work programs, having organized the Volunteer Service Bureau and worked with blind children. She retired to the rural but historic Crowell community in Foard County in West Texas. Eleanor's husband and Goode's brother-in-law, David H. Brune (1930‚Äì2007), a native of California, was in legal partnership with Goode from 1958 to 1962. Law and politics After the war, Goode completed his studies in 1948 at the University of Texas School of Law. For two-and-a-half years, he was acting first assistant district attorney in the office of the Bexar County District Attorney. He entered private practice thereafter and was involved during the course of his legal career in several firms, beginning with Hardy & Goode and ending with Goode, Casseb & Jones, now Goode, Casseb, Jones, Riklin, Choate & Watson. \\"He was so devoted to his law practice that, it was his hobby. ... He enjoyed corporate law and not the glamorous criminal law as much, although he did do some criminal cases,\\" recalled his son, John W. Goode III. Goode worked on the successful Dwight D. Eisenhower presidential campaign in 1952. He was a chairman of the San Antonio Municipal Civil Service Commission, and he was a Republican county chairman. He was a delegate to the 1960 Republican National Convention held in Chicago to nominate the unsuccessful Nixon-Lodge ticket. In November 1961, he was the Republican candidate in a special election for the United States House of Representatives for Texas' 20th congressional district but was defeated by the Democrat, Henry B. Gonzalez, the first Hispanic to serve in both the Texas State Senate and as a member of Congress from Texas. Goode had been hopeful of a political upset after former president Dwight Eisenhower flew to San Antonio to campaign with Goode. The candidate also received support from a Conservative Democratic group.\\"Conservative Demos go for Goode\\", San Antonio Express and News, October 29, 1961, p. 5.

Earlier that same year in the spring of 1961, Gonzalez had lost out in another special election for the United States Senate seat formerly held by Vice President Johnson. Victory in that race went in a major upset to John Tower, the first Republican to represent Texas in the upper legislative chamber in the 20th century. In November 1993, three months before his death, Goode was inducted into the Bexar County Republican Party's newly established Hall of Fame. Goode was active in several civic organizations and fraternities, including the Texas Cavaliers, Texas Law Foundation, the San Antonio Bar Association, and the Order of the Alamo.

He declared he was an angel of God, which led to the name \\"Angel Obinim\\" given to him by his church. He also seemed to have conjured a passport for a church member who lost his. In 2016, he told his church he could transform himself and others into objects and animals. Jon Benjamin, the British High Commissioner to Ghana, ridiculed him for these claims over Twitter. = 2016 flogging case = Obinim in August 2016 publicly flogged two teenagers, one of whom was pregnant, on live television, accusing them of fornicating and conspiring to abort a pregnancy, leading to public outcry, after the video also went viral on social media. Ghana's Minister of Gender, Children, and Social Protection Nana Oye Lithur herself led a campaign for his arrest, by lodging a complaint to the Ghana Police Service Domestic Violence and Victims‚Äô Support Unit (DOVVSU). He was subsequently arrested. Following the arrest, hundreds of his church members besieged the police station where he was held to demand his release, a move that was seen to be the first of its kind involving a religious leader. They also threatened not to vote for the current government in Ghana's upcoming election in December 2016 if Obinim is not released. The protesters were dispersed with a water cannon.
