The series is written by Y≈çsuke Kuroda, produced by Sunrise, and directed by Gor≈ç Taniguchi, with music composed by K≈çtar≈ç Nakagawa. It is set in an alternative time in Kanagawa Prefecture where a phenomenon gave 1% of its people supernatural powers; they are known as Alters. The plot follows a young Alter mercenary known as Kazuma, as well as Ryuho, a man working for the Alter special forces known as HOLY, who become rivals as their areas clash. The series' concept originated in 1999 when Taniguchi was working on Infinite Ryvius. He wanted to create another series that would contain themes similar to it, as well as new ones centered mostly on how people adapted to the 21st century. A manga adaptation of s-CRY- ed, drawn by Yasunari Toda, was serialized in Akita Shoten's Weekly Sh≈çnen Champion. A novelization by Kazuho Hyodo has been published. Additionally, a two-part recollection film was released by Sunrise. Both the anime and the manga have also seen English release. s-CRY-ed has been popular in Japan, often appearing on polls taken by Japanese magazines, and once took third place in the Anime Grand Prix awards. Critical reception to the series has been generally positive, with reviewers noting while initial episodes might be simple, the plot becomes more interesting as the series unfolds. Plot =Setting= The series is set several years after \\"The Great Uprising\\", a future geological phenomenon in Kanagawa Prefecture near Tokyo. These people have developed a power known as Alter where they create weapons. The number of Alters rises steadily as the series progresses. There are two opposing forces of Alters: the Native Alters, a group of Alter users who live outside the central city and avoid any relationships with the government; and HOLY, a subgroup of Alter users in an organization called HOLD. HOLD functions as the Mainland government's super police force of the Lost Ground, while HOLY, composed exclusively of Alter users, serves as the special operations group, aiding it in performing dangerous missions that might require the help of an Alter user. =Synopsis= Kazuma is a native Alter user who makes his living as a mercenary so that he and his close friend, Kanami Yuta, can live together. Kazuma's friend Kunihiko Kimishima gives him a mission to defeat another native Alter user. However, a man known as Ryuho from HOLY captures Kazuma in the aftermath. Ryuho tries to interrogate Kazuma over an unknown Alter user (later dubbed Crystal) who killed his mother and dog. Using a woman from HOLY named Mimori Kiryu as a hostage, Kazuma manages to return to his house. When native Alter users are captured by HOLY, Kazuma enters a forest where he finds Crystal. After fighting Crystal, Kazuma's Alter receives a power up. Shortly afterwards, it is revealed the Great Uprising was caused by a similar event in a parallel universe where all creatures are independent thinking Alters. Kazuma goes on a rampage against HOLY after Kinishima dies while helping him during one of his fights. Shortly afterwards, Kazuma and Ryuho fight, but during the battle, they open a gateway to the parallel universe, causing another uprising and attracting the attention of the Mainland government. Both Kazuma and Ryuho are thought to be dead after the fight. While Kazuma hides in underground fights, Ryuho suffers amnesia. With help from an old friend, HOLY member Straight Cougar, Kazuma recovers his will to protect Kanami who is searching for him. Ryuho also recovers his memories while fighting HOLY users attacking natives and ends up becoming one of Kazuma's allies. The Mainland sends its agent, Kyouji Mujo, to the Lost Ground in an attempt to exploit the power of the parallel universe for economic gain. Mujo develops delusions of grandeur after becoming the de facto head of the Lost Ground government and absorbing the crystal entity from \\"the other side\\" to add to his already formidable Alter power. Both he and the Crystal entity are defeated by the separate efforts of Kazuma and Ryuho respectively, as both increase their Alter powers by taking energy from the parallel world. The Mainland once again attempts to exert control over the Lost Ground by sending in a fleet of refined Alter users under their control. However, they are defeated by Kazuma and Ryuho. After defeating the Mainland forces, Kazuma and Ryuho engage in one final battle to settle their rivalry. As one of them is about to declare victory, the screen fades to white. In an epilogue, taking place years later, they remain the protectors of the Lost Ground, defending it from Mainland invaders, while an older Kanami awaits their return. Creation and release According to the series' director Gor≈ç Taniguchi, the idea for s-CRY-ed originated in 1999 when he was working on the series Infinite Ryvius. One of Infinite Ryviuss themes was people communicating with each other. The series' staff wanted to show people already on their own paths, focusing more on individualism. With the storyline beginning in the early 21st century, Taniguchi said the cast would already have adapted to the new times allowing s-CRY-ed to take more themes from Infinite Ryvius. The title s-CRY-ed is basically a combination of one English word and Japanese. The first lower-case \\"s\\" is a representation of the Japanese word su which means something in its natural form and not artificial. \\"Cry\\" comes from the English, and the last \\"ed\\" represents a person. Combined as \\"s-CRY-ed\\" the Sunrise studio staff wanted it to express the idea of how people react or interact when they are in their most natural state. They had devised the word when the project was in its early phases of production, and while it was meant to be a temporary name, the staff ended up using it as the title. When asked by the staff of the magazine Animerica if the anime was influenced by Western superheros like Spider-Man or Batman, Taniguchi denied that influence. Instead, he said his inspirations for s-CRY-ed were other works he had produced for Sunrise. The society shown in the series was not meant to be another take on classic superheroes but instead investigate how everyone can adapt to their own situation. While the series is known for the extensive action in its episodes, the director believes everything he wanted viewers to see was presented. To distinguish the HOLY members, the Sunrise staff researched the costumes they could design. Taniguchi said their outfits are meant to resemble prison uniforms. In Japan, the series was released between July 4 and December 26, 2001, with a total of twenty-six episodes. These were collected on nine DVD volumes between November 25, 2001, and July 25, 2002. A DVD box set containing all the episodes was released on January 25, 2008; a Blu-ray box set was made available on October 26, 2011. The Blu-ray box of the series sold a total of 6,172 units during its release week in Japan. The anime was licensed by Bandai Entertainment in early 2003. Starting in 2003, they released the show in North America as six individual Region 1 volumes, followed by a complete six-disc box set in November 2004. A Universal Media Disc version of the first volume was released on October 11, 2005. Bandai's European branch, Beez Entertainment, published the series in the United Kingdom. The release was a six-disc box set released between June 6, 2005 and February 27, 2006. Later, the series premiered on Adult Swim in the United States on May 28, 2005, after select episodes had been aired on Adult Swim's Video On Demand service for nearly a year. On September 27, 2005, Bandai re-released s-CRY-ed under the Anime Legends banner, in three two-disc volumes, followed by the Anime Legends Complete Collection on October 24, 2006. Following the 2012 closure of Bandai Entertainment, Sunrise announced at Otakon 2013, that Sentai Filmworks had rescued s-CRY-ed, along with a handful of other former BEI titles. However, Sentai never re-released the anime and the license eventually expired. On May 3, 2020, it was announced that Discotek Media had picked up the license for S-CRY-ed.https://www.animenewsnetwork.com/news/2020-05-03/discotek-licenses- detective-conan-episode-one-love-hina-again-s-cry-ed-anime/.159099 It will be released on Spring 2021 on Blu- ray.https://www.animenewsnetwork.com/news/2020-09-15/discotek-schedules-gin- rei-ova-in-late-2020-early-2021/.164022 In Australia, the series is licensed by Madman Entertainment. s-CRY-ed music was composed by K≈çtar≈ç Nakagawa. Its original soundtrack was released on November 21, 2001, and two drama CDs were released on December 19 of the same year. For the first twenty-five episodes the opening and ending theme songs are \\"Reckless Fire\\" by Yasuaki Ide and \\"Drastic My Soul\\" by Mikio Sakai, respectively. However, for episode twenty- six, \\"Reckless Fire\\" is replaced by \\"Drastic My Soul\\", and the episode's ending theme is \\"Tabidachi no Kane ga Naru\\" (\\"The Bell of Setting out for a Journey Will Ring\\") by Sakai. There are also three insert songs starting with \\"All I Need Is Love\\" by Sakai for episodes fourteen and seventeen, \\"Magma\\" by Ide for episode nineteen, and \\"Discovery\\" by Sakai. Both the singles of \\"Reckless Fire\\" and \\"Drastic My Soul\\" were released on August 22, 2001. Films On April 8, 2011, Sunrise announced on the official s-CRY-ed Japanese website the series would be re-released and re-mastered in a two- movie release comprising the entire series and including new footage, titled s-CRY-ed Alteration, as part of the s-CRY-ed 10th Anniversary Project. During its release, TAO, the first part, took fifteenth place at the Japanese box office earning US$141,055 on nine screens for a per-screen average of US$15,673. In the following week the film dropped off the charts. The Blu-ray of the first part was released on February 24, 2012. It sold 6,624 units in its release week; it had sold 7,726 units by the end of the second week. The second part, QUAN, was released on March 10, 2011. Its Blu-ray volume was released on July 27 of the following year. The Blu-ray format of the second part sold a total of 6,543 units in Japan. The films also had a single CD including the new version of \\"Reckless Fire\\" alongside \\"SPIRITS\\" which was released on March 7, 2012. Additionally, another CD drama was released for the films on the same date as the single CD. Related media A manga of the series written by Y≈çsuke Kuroda and illustrated by Yasunari Toda was published in the magazine Weekly Sh≈çnen Champion between October 4, 2001 and June 20, 2002. The manga was collected in a total of five tank≈çbon (book) volumes. Tokyopop licensed this series in October 2002. They released the manga between March 11 and November 4, 2003. Additionally, a light novel series was written by Kazuho Hyodo and illustrated by Hisashi Hirai and published by Dengeki Bunko. The series was released between May 10, 2002 and May 10, 2003. Additionally, Kazuma has appeared in the crossover role-playing game Heroes Fantasia. Reception The series has been popular in Japan. Anihabara! listed s-CRY-ed in its top three anime series twice during 2001. In 2002, it took the same place in a poll by Animage. In the Animage Anime Grand Prix awards, s-CRY-ed took the third place in the series category. The Kazuma character also took second place, being defeated by Inuyashas title character. In a TV Asahi survey of the top hundred shows Japanese fans enjoyed, s-CRY-ed took 51st place. In March 2010, Kazuma was ranked nineteenth best male anime character of the 2000s by the Japanese magazine Newtype. The anime series has received mostly positive reviews by manga and anime publications. DVD Verdict's Mac McEntire said that while the first volume lacked depth, its action scenes made the series as well as its characters appealing despite their tendency to shout their attacks. In a review of the same volume, John Sinnott of DVD Talk also said the fight scenes were good, remarking it has more \\"plot\\" in contrast to other fighting series. He also found the two protagonists, Kazuma and Ryuho, appealing noting they have multiple similarities that had yet to be explored. Regarding the series' dialog, he expressed a preference for the Japanese cast over the English one. Seb Reid of UK Anime Network enjoyed the anime series but unlike Sinnot he felt the English dub was more \\"enjoyable\\". He also found the series' beginning enjoyable noting that while the series might be simplistic, he like the theme of \\"freedom\\", mostly seen through Kazuma's personality. While agreeing with Reid about the plot (to the point of comparing Kazuma to Han Solo from the Star Wars franchise due to their anti-heroic traits), Anime News Network's Zac Bertschy disliked the English dub. He also found the main plot confusing. Reviewers also compared the series positively with the famous Clamp series X. Bryan Morton of Mania Beyond Entertainment found the morality of some characters, such as Ryuho, who has several reasons for his cold personality such as his quest for revenge, interesting. Despite some issues with the animation, and not being a fan of fights himself, he recommended the series for fans of Dragon Ball Z, a series famous for its fight scenes. In a later review, Morton noted that Kazuma's character had developed as he not only fights Ryuho, but protect people from the Lost Ground. Despite saying he disliked the series for its focus on fighting, Morton noted s-CRY-ed \\"has grown on me a bit\\". Danielle D'Ornellas of Animefringe noted how many characters the anime covered, including both the protagonists and the antagonists, forcing viewers to pick which side they should root for. While she was not amazed by the animation, saying \\"strictly from an animation perspective, s-CRY-ed is average\\". She also found the English cast enjoyable while the music reminded her of a popular anime, Cowboy Bebop. The series' plot development surprised some reviewers. Reid was amazed by how the plot changed until its ending to the point of calling it an \\"excellent end to a superior series\\" despite having been able to predict most of the plot twists in the series. Justin Rich of Mania noted how similar both Kazuma and Ryuho became across the series with the exception of their upbringings and commented they still keep clashing every time they meet. Both Rich and Norton of Mania shared mixed feelings regarding the finale finding Kyouji Mujo's fight to be anti-climatic. As well, while the former liked the conclusion, the latter found it disappointing. Nevertheless, both of them found the final fight between Kazuma and Ryuho highly appealing. Don Houston of DVD Talk enjoyed how the relationship between Kazuma and Ryuho developed similar to \\"buddy films\\". While still clashing, they came to develop a mutual respect. He also recommended fans buy the DVD box rather than single volumes because of their high prices. In his review of the final volume, Houston stated that while the series started as \\"generic\\" its development allowed him to enjoy more of the show. He felt the storyline could have been finished in less than twenty-six episodes. s-CRY-ed was featured in an IGN article by Ryan Clements titled \\"The Anime We'd Love to Play\\". Clements commented that while the anime suffered from pacing and animation issues, both the cast and the powers were entertaining, remarking on the rivalry between Kazuma and Ryuho. In the 2007 book Manga: The Complete Guide author Jason Thompson found the manga \\"over- the-top\\" as an adaptation of the anime series. Thompson found it similar to Jojo's Bizarre Adventure based on the \\"enjoyably weird, exaggerated\\" art which is also one of the series' main appeal.

The single version of \\"Radar Love\\" reached #10 on the Cash Box Top 100 and #13 in Billboard in the United States. It also hit the Top 10 in many countries, including the United Kingdom, Canada, Australia, Germany, and Spain. Lyrics The song is written from the point of view of a car or truck driver who says he has some sort of psychic relationship with his girlfriend - \\"radar love\\". He has sensed that she urgently wants him to be with her, which makes him reckless. Composition Like other famous songs of the era (\\"Highway Star\\", \\"Stairway to Heaven\\", \\"Bohemian Rhapsody\\"), \\"Radar Love\\" is composed as a suite with several distinctive and quite different sections (although the tonality remains pretty much the same). The intro starts with a guitar riff in four movements. The first movement is up from C# minor with three power chords slightly reminiscent of Deep Purple's \\"Smoke on the Water\\". The second movement heads down, the third is up again, higher than the previous, and the fourth leads all down to E major. According to bass player Rinus Gerritsen the intro was inspired by Carlos Santana. Golden Earring ‚Äì Radar Love: The story behind the song. After the intro a driving snare drum sets the pace in 4/4 time, at around 100 BPM. The snare drum is soon joined by a signature bassline in F# minor. This is repeated eight times in two alternating lines. Starting at 0:47, the first verse is sung to the ongoing bassline in F# minor: \\"I've been driving all night, my hands wet on the wheel...\\" The verse consists of four lines and each of them is answered by a simple guitar hook. After the fourth line the song moves to a sort of bridge leading up to the chorus. \\"When she is lonely and the longing gets too much, she sends a cable coming in from above...\\" In this section, accompanied by vocal harmonies, the chords shift from E major via several changes to B major and finally C# minor at the start of the refrain: \\"We've got a thing that's called radar love...\\" During the chorus, starting in C# minor at 1:20, the band is joined by a brass section and the drum beat is doubled to give the impression that the tempo has speeded up.Songfacts: Radar Love by Golden Earring After the chorus the song returns to the previous bassline in F# minor. In verse two the singing gets funkier and so does the responding guitar which is now played with double notes. \\"The radio is playing some forgotten song, Brenda Lee's \\"Coming on Strong\\"...\\" At the end of the second chorus at 2:30 the album version continues with a different bassline and guitar improvisations until 3:49. In the single version this part has been left out and the song turns immediately to a trademark drum solo at 2:30 (or 3:49 respectively). Ten seconds into the solo the drummer is joined by guitar, bass and trumpets playing a riff derived from the intro which builds up repeating over several variations, until collapsing in an E major chord at 3:06 (4:25). At this point the song shortly slows down, but soon the haunting bassline restarts and the drummer returns to his driving beat. Yet, verse three at 3:36 (4:55) is a slightly different affair, as illustrated also by the lyrics: \\"No more speed, I'm almost there, gotta keep cool now, gotta take care...\\" This time the voice, more hesitant than driving, is answered by bluesy guitar licks played by two guitars opposing on the stereo channels. Energy returns with Brenda Lee coming on strong once more, and finally at 4:13 (5:32) the bridge and the chorus build up for a last ride with sounding horns. At 4:44 (6:03) starts the outro with a variation of the haunting bassline in F# minor and all instruments gradually joining in the same chord.  Impact  Golden Earring's \\"Radar Love\\" is one of rock music's enduring anthems. According to Rustyn Rose at Metaholic, the song \\"is a rock masterpiece, from its hooky chugging bassline, to its simple but unmistakable riffs, to its catchy anthemesque chorus. Even the jam which rides the song out is note for note classic\\".Rustyn Rose: Golden Earring 'Radar Love', Anatomy of a Song, Metalholic, June 19, 2011. The song has been chosen by many magazines and websites as a Top 10 driving song. Often it ranked in the top three. In polls it was chosen as the best radio song by readers of the newspaper Washington Post in November 2001. It resulted the #1 driving song in Australia (Australian Musician Magazine, November 2005), beating two AC/DC-songs, and in Canada (BBC Canada, March 2006).Radar-love.net, Did you know that? In 2011 it received a vast number of votes as the \\"Ultimate Driving Song\\" in a poll at PlanetRock and \\"finished well ahead of its nearest rival, Deep Purple's Highway Star\\"Ultimate Driving Song: The Top 50. The bassline, guitar improv and drum solo riff was used in the late 1970s and early 1980s as part of the opening credits and theme to the long running Australian current affairs programme Four Corners produced by ABC before it segues into the official theme, Robert Maxwell's \\"Lost Patrol\\". Cover versions According to the dedicated website radar-love.net, the song has been covered more than 500 times, among others by Tribe 8, Ministry, Omen, U2, R.E.M., Ian Stuart Donaldson, Sun City Girls, White Lion, Blue Man Group, Def Leppard, James Last, NWOBHM band Aragorn, Nine Pound Hammer, Oh Well, Joe Santana, the Space Lady and the Pressure Boys. The White Lion version charted at #59 on the Billboard Hot 100. Goth-pop band Ghost Dance recorded a cover of the song on the B-side of their \\"Heart Full of Soul\\" single, itself a cover of the Yardbirds track. A pre-Mercyful Fate band featuring King Diamond on vocals recorded a cover of the song. It is featured on King Diamond & Black Rose 20 Years Ago. WaveGroup Sound covered the White Lion version of the song on Guitar Hero Encore: Rocks the 80s.

It can be considered synonymous with \\"rightness\\" or being \\"upright\\". It can be found in Indian religions and Abrahamic traditions as a theological concept. For example, from various perspectives in Hinduism, Christianity, and Judaism it is considered an attribute that implies that a person's actions are justified, and can have the connotation that the person has been \\"judged\\" or \\"reckoned\\" as leading a life that is pleasing to God. It is also found in Tamil literature in the name of ‡ÆÖ‡Æ±‡ÆÆ‡Øç (aram). In Tamil literature there is separate section called ‡ÆÖ‡Æ± ‡Æ®‡ØÇ‡Æ≤‡Øç‡Æï‡Æ≥‡Øç (\\"righteous books\\"), for example Thirukkural, NƒÅla·π≠iyƒÅr and many more books. Tirukkural dedicates chapters 1‚Äì38 of the Book of Aram for righteousness. A poem in Purananuru written by Kaniyan Pungundranar, it showcases the practice of righteousness leads to world peace and harmony in society. William Tyndale (Bible translator into English in 1526) remodelled the word after an earlier word rihtwis, which would have yielded modern English *rightwise or *rightways. He used it to translate the Hebrew root ◊¶◊ì◊ß◊ô◊ù (TzDYQ), tzedek, which appears over five hundred times in the Hebrew Bible, and the Greek word (dikaios), which appears more than two hundred times in the New Testament. Etymology Old English rihtwƒ´s, from riht ‚Äòright‚Äô + wƒ´s ‚Äòmanner, state, condition‚Äô (as opposed to wrangwise, \\"wrongful\\"). The change in the ending in the 16th century was due to association with words such as bounteous. Ethics or moral philosophy Ethics is a major branch of philosophy, encompasses right conduct and good living. Rushworth Kidder states that \\"standard definitions of ethics have typically included such phrases as 'the science of the ideal human character' or 'the science of moral duty'\\".[3] Richard William Paul and Linda Elder define ethics as \\"a set of concepts and principles that guide us in determining what behavior helps or harms sentient creatures\\".[4] The Cambridge Dictionary of Philosophy states that the word ethics is \\"commonly used interchangeably with 'morality' ... and sometimes it is used more narrowly to mean the moral principles of a particular tradition, group or individual.\\" Abrahamic religions =Christianity= In the New Testament, the word righteousness, a translation word for the Greek dikaiosunƒì, is used as 'being righteous before others' (e.g. Matthew 5:20) or 'being righteous before God' (e.g. Romans 1:17). William Lane Craig argues that we should think of God as the \\"paradigm, the locus, the source of all moral value and standards\\". In Matthew's account of the baptism Jesus tells the prophet \\"it is fitting for us to fulfill all righteousness\\" as Jesus requests that John perform the rite for him. The Sermon of the Mount contains the memorable commandment \\"Seek ye first the kingdom of God and His righteousness\\". A secondary meaning of the Greek word is 'justice' Young, Robert. (May 2011) Young's Analytical Concordance to the Bible. p. 819. , which is used to render it in a few places by a few Bible translations, e.g. in Matthew 6:33 in the New English Bible. Jesus asserts the importance of righteousness by saying in Matthew 5:20, \\"For I tell you that unless your righteousness surpasses that of the Pharisees and the teachers of the law, you will certainly not enter the kingdom of heaven.\\" However, Paul the Apostle speaks of two ways, at least in theory, to achieve righteousness: through the Law of Moses (or Torah); and through faith in the atonement made possible through the death and resurrection of Jesus Christ (). Some interpret that he repeatedly emphasizes that faith is the only effective way., For example, just a few verses earlier, he states the Jews did not attain the law of righteousness because they sought it not by faith, but by works. The New Testament speaks of a salvation founded on God's righteousness, as exemplified throughout the history of salvation narrated in the Old Testament (). Paul writes to the Romans that righteousness comes by faith: \\"...a righteousness that is by faith from first to last, just as it is written: 'The righteous will live by faith.'\\" () In the New Revised Standard Version has a footnote that the original word has the meaning of 'benevolence' and the Messianic Jewish commentary of David Stern affirms the Jewish practice of 'doing tzedakah' as charity in referring to the Matt. 6 and II Cor. 9 passages.Stern, David H. (1992) Jewish New Testament Commentary: A companion volume to the 'Jewish New Testament'. p. 30 and p. 512. speaks of the relationship between works of righteousness and faith, saying that \\"faith without works is dead.\\" Righteous acts according to James include works of charity () as well as avoiding sins against the Law of Moses (). describes Lot as a righteous man. Type of saint In the Eastern Orthodox Church, \\"Righteous\\" is a type of saint who is regarded as a holy person under the Old Covenant (Old Testament Israel) but also sometimes used for married saints of the New Covenant (the Church). According to Orthodox theology, the Righteous saints of the Old Covenant were not able to enter into heaven until after the death of Jesus on the cross (), but had to await salvation in the Bosom of Abraham (see: Harrowing of Hell). =Islam= Righteousness is mentioned several times in the Quran.http://www.wefound.org/texts/Islam_files/IslamRighteousness.htm The Quran says that a life of righteousness is the only way to go to Heaven. =Judaism= Righteousness is one of the chief attributes of God as portrayed in the Hebrew Bible. Its chief meaning concerns ethical conduct (for example, Leviticus 19:36; Deuteronomy 25:1; Psalm 1:6; Proverbs 8:20). In the Book of Job the title character is introduced to us as a person who is perfect in righteousness. East Asian religions =Yi (Confucianism)= Yi, (), literally \\"justice, righteousness; meaning,\\" is an important concept in Confucianism. It involves a moral disposition to do good, and also the intuition and sensibility to do so competently.(Cheng) Yi resonates with Confucian philosophy's orientation towards the cultivation of benevolence (ren) and skillful practice (li). Yi represents moral acumen which goes beyond simple rule following, and involves a balanced understanding of a situation, and the \\"creative insights\\" necessary to apply virtues \\"with no loss of sight of the total good. Yi represents this ideal of totality as well as a decision- generating ability to apply a virtue properly and appropriately in a situation.\\" (Cheng p. 271) In application, yi is a \\"complex principle\\" which includes: # skill in crafting actions which have moral fitness according to a given concrete situation # the wise recognition of such fitness # the intrinsic satisfaction that comes from that recognition.(Cheng) Indian religions Dharma is a key concept with multiple meanings. There might not be a single-word translation for dharma in Western languages. Dharma ‡§ß‡§∞‡•ç‡§Æ can be translated as righteousness, religion, faith, duty, law, and virtue. Connotations of dharma include rightness, good, natural, morality, righteousness, and virtue. It means moral, right, just, balanced, or natural etc. In common parlance, dharma means \\"right way of living\\" and \\"path of rightness\\". Dharma encompasses ideas such as duty, rights, character, vocation, religion, customs and all behaviour considered appropriate, correct or \\"morally upright\\". It is explained as law of righteousness and equated to satya (truth, Sanskrit: satya ‡§∏‡§§‡•ç‡§Ø‡§Ç). \\"...when a man speaks the Truth, they say, \\"He speaks the Dharma\\"; and if he speaks Dharma, they say, \\"He speaks the Truth!\\" For both are one.\\" ‚Äî Brihadaranyaka Upanishad, 1.4.xiv. The importance of dharma to Indian sentiments is illustrated by India's decision in 1947 to include the Ashoka Chakra, a depiction of the dharmachakra ( the \\"wheel of dharma\\"), as the central motif on its flag. The wheel in the centre of India's flag symbolises Dharma. =Hinduism= Bhagavad Gita Chapter 4: Text 7 In Hindu philosophy and religion, major emphasis is placed on individual practical morality. In the Sanskrit epics, this concern is omnipresent. Including duties, rights, laws, conduct, virtues and \\"right way of living\\". The Sanskrit epics contain themes and examples where right prevails over wrong, the good over evil. In the mid-20th century, an inscription of the Indian Emperor Ashoka from the year 258 BC was discovered. This rock inscription contained Sanskrit, Aramaic and Greek text. According to Paul Hacker, on the rock appears a Greek rendering for the Sanskrit word dharma, the word eusebeia. In his 250 BCE Edicts used the word eusebeia as a Greek translation for the central Buddhist and Hindu concept of dharma. This rock inscription, concludes Paul Hacker,[34] suggests dharma in India, about 2300 years ago, was a central concept and meant not only religious ideas, but ideas of right, of good, of one's duty. The Ramayana is one of the two great Indian epics. The Ramayana tells about life in India around 1000 BCE and offers models in dharma. The hero, Rama, lived his whole life by the rules of dharma; in fact, that was why Indian consider him heroic. When Rama was a young boy, he was the perfect son. Later he was an ideal husband to his faithful wife, Sita, and a responsible ruler of Aydohya. Each episode of Ramayana presents life situations and ethical questions in symbolic terms. The issue is debated by the characters, finally the right prevails over wrong, the good over evil. For this reason, in Hindu Epics, the good, morally upright, law-abiding king is referred to as \\"dharmaraja\\". In Mahabharata, the other major Indian epic, similarly, dharma is central, and it is presented with symbolism and metaphors. Near the end of the epic, the god Yama, referred to as dharma in the text, is portrayed as taking the form of a dog to test the compassion of Yudhishthira, who is told he may not enter paradise with such an animal, but refuses to abandon his companion, for which decision he is then praised by dharma. The value and appeal of the Mahabharata is not as much in its complex and rushed presentation of metaphysics in the 12th book, claims Ingalls, because Indian metaphysics is more eloquently presented in other Sanskrit scriptures; the appeal of Mahabharata, like Ramayana, is in its presentation of a series of moral problems and life situations, to which there are usually three answers given, according to Ingalls: one answer is of Bhima, which is the answer of brute force, an individual angle representing materialism, egoism, and self; the second answer is of Yudhishthira, which is always an appeal to piety and gods, of social virtue and of tradition; the third answer is of introspective Arjuna, which falls between the two extremes, and who, claims Ingalls, symbolically reveals the finest moral qualities of man. The Epics of Hinduism are a symbolic treatise about life, virtues, customs, morals, ethics, law, and other aspects of dharma. There is extensive discussion of dharma at the individual level in the Epics of Hinduism, observes Ingalls; for example, on free will versus destiny, when and why human beings believe in either, ultimately concluding that the strong and prosperous naturally uphold free will, while those facing grief or frustration naturally lean towards destiny. The Epics of Hinduism illustrate various aspects of dharma, they are a means of communicating dharma with metaphors. In Hinduism, dharma signifies behaviors that are considered to be in accord with ·πöta, the order that makes life and universe possible, and includes duties, rights, laws, conduct, virtues and \\"right way of living\\".The concept of dharma was already in use in the historical Vedic religion, and its meaning and conceptual scope has evolved over several millennia. The ancient Tamil moral text of Tirukkural is solely based on a·πüam, the Tamil term for dharma. The antonym of dharma is adharma. = Buddhism = In Buddhism dharma means cosmic law and order, but is also applied to the teachings of the Buddha. In Buddhist philosophy, dhamma/dharma is also the term for \\"phenomena\\".Dharma refers not only to the sayings of the Buddha, but also to the later traditions of interpretation and addition that the various schools of Buddhism have developed to help explain and to expand upon the Buddha's teachings. For others still, they see the Dharma as referring to the \\"truth\\", or the ultimate reality of \\"the way that things really are\\" (Tibetan: Cho). =Jainism= The major Jain text, Tattvartha Sutra mentions Das-dharma with the meaning of \\"ten righteous virtues\\". These are forbearance, modesty, straightforwardness, purity, truthfulness, self-restraint, austerity, renunciation, non-attachment, and celibacy. A right believer should constantly meditate on virtues of dharma, like supreme modesty, in order to protect the soul from all contrary dispositions. He should also cover up the shortcomings of others. ‚Äî Puru·π£ƒÅrthasiddhyupƒÅya (27) =Sikhism= For Sikhs, the word Dharm means the path of righteousness and proper religious practice. For Sikhs, the word dharam (Punjabi: ‡®ß‡®∞‡®Æ, romanized: dharam) means the path of righteousness and proper religious practice. Guru Granth Sahib in hymn 1353 connotes dharma as duty. The 3HO movement in Western culture, which has incorporated certain Sikh beliefs, defines Sikh Dharma broadly as all that constitutes religion, moral duty and way of life. =Zoroastrianism= In Zoroastrianism, Asha is a very important tenant of the Zoroastrian religion with a complex and highly nuanced range of meaning. It is commonly summarized in accord with its contextual implications of 'truth' and 'right(eousness)', 'order' and 'right working'. From an early age, Zoroastrians are taught to pursue Righteousness in their everyday lives by following the Threefold Path of Asha: Humata, Huxta, Huvarshta (Good Thoughts, Good Words, Good Deeds). One of the most sacred and powerful mantras in the religion is the Ashem Vohu, after the Ahunavar or Ahuna Vairya, which has been translated as an Ode to Righteousness. There are many translations that all differ due to the complexity of Avestan and the concepts involved (For other translations, see: Ashem Vohu). \\"Righteousness is the best good and it is happiness.

It states that :p_{n+1}-p_n=O((\\\\log p_n)^2),\\\\ where pn denotes the nth prime number, O is big O notation, and \\"log\\" is the natural logarithm. While this is the statement explicitly conjectured by Cram√©r, his heuristic actually supports the stronger statement :\\\\limsup_{n\\\\rightarrow\\\\infty} \\\\frac{p_{n+1}-p_n}{(\\\\log p_n)^2} = 1, and sometimes this formulation is called Cram√©r's conjecture. However, this stronger version is not supported by more accurate heuristic models, which nevertheless support the first version of Cram√©r's conjecture. Neither form has yet been proven or disproven. Conditional proven results on prime gaps Cram√©r gave a conditional proof of the much weaker statement that :p_{n+1}-p_n = O(\\\\sqrt{p_n}\\\\,\\\\log p_n) on the assumption of the Riemann hypothesis. The best known unconditional bound is :p_{n+1}-p_n = O(p_n^{0.525}) due to Baker, Harman, and Pintz.R. C. Baker, G. Harman, and J. Pintz, The difference between consecutive primes. II. Proc. London Math. Soc. (3), 83 (2001), no. 3, 532-562 In the other direction, E. Westzynthius proved in 1931 that prime gaps grow more than logarithmically. That is,. :\\\\limsup_{n\\\\to\\\\infty}\\\\frac{p_{n+1}-p_n}{\\\\log p_n}=\\\\infty. His result was improved by R. A. Rankin,R. A. Rankin, The difference between consecutive prime numbers, J. London Math. Soc. 13 (1938), 242-247 who proved that :\\\\limsup_{n\\\\to\\\\infty}\\\\frac{p_{n+1}-p_n}{\\\\log p_n}\\\\cdot\\\\frac{\\\\left(\\\\log\\\\log\\\\log p_n\\\\right)^{2}}{ \\\\log\\\\log p_n \\\\log\\\\log\\\\log\\\\log p_n} > 0. Paul Erd≈ës conjectured that the left-hand side of the above formula is infinite, and this was proven in 2014 by Kevin Ford, Ben Green, Sergei Konyagin, and Terence Tao.K. Ford, B. Green, S. Konyagin, and T. Tao, Large gaps between consecutive prime numbers. Ann. of Math. (2) 183 (2016), no. 3, 935‚Äì974  Heuristic justification Cram√©r's conjecture is based on a probabilistic model‚Äîessentially a heuristic‚Äîin which the probability that a number of size x is prime is 1/log x. This is known as the Cram√©r random model or Cram√©r model of the primes.Terry Tao, 254A, Supplement 4: Probabilistic models and heuristics for the primes (optional), section on The Cram√©r random model, January 2015. In the Cram√©r random model, :\\\\limsup_{n\\\\rightarrow\\\\infty} \\\\frac{p_{n+1}-p_n}{\\\\log^2 p_n} = 1 with probability one. However, as pointed out by Andrew Granville,. Maier's theorem shows that the Cram√©r random model does not adequately describe the distribution of primes on short intervals, and a refinement of Cram√©r's model taking into account divisibility by small primes suggests that c \\\\ge 2e^{-\\\\gamma}\\\\approx1.1229\\\\ldots (), where \\\\gamma is the Euler‚ÄìMascheroni constant. J√°nos Pintz has suggested that the limit sup may be infinite,J√°nos Pintz, Very large gaps between consecutive primes, Journal of Number Theory 63:2 (April 1997), pp. 286‚Äì301. and similarly Leonard Adleman and Kevin McCurley write :As a result of the work of H. Maier on gaps between consecutive primes, the exact formulation of Cram√©r's conjecture has been called into question [...] It is still probably true that for every constant c>2, there is a constant d>0 such that there is a prime between x and x+d(\\\\log x)^c. Leonard Adleman and Kevin McCurley, Open Problems in Number Theoretic Complexity, II. Algorithmic number theory (Ithaca, NY, 1994), 291‚Äì322, Lecture Notes in Comput. Sci., 877, Springer, Berlin, 1994. Related conjectures and heuristics Prime gap function Daniel Shanks conjectured the following asymptotic equality, stronger than Cram√©r's conjecture,. for record gaps: G(x)\\\\sim \\\\log^2 x. J.H. Cadwell has proposed the formula for the maximal gaps: G(x)\\\\sim \\\\log x(\\\\log x-\\\\log\\\\log x), which is formally identical to the Shanks conjecture but suggests a lower-order term. Marek Wolf has proposed the formula for the maximal gaps G(x) expressed in terms of the prime counting function \\\\pi(x): :G(x)\\\\sim \\\\frac{x}{\\\\pi(x)}(2\\\\log\\\\pi(x)-\\\\log x+c_0), where c_0=\\\\log(C_2)=0.2778769... and C_2=1.3203236... is twice the twin primes constant; see , . Using Gauss's approximation \\\\pi(x)\\\\sim x/\\\\log(x) this gives :G(x)\\\\sim \\\\log(x)(\\\\log x-2\\\\log\\\\log x), which for large x is also asymptotically equivalent to the Cram√©r and Shanks conjectures: G(x)\\\\sim \\\\log^2(x). Thomas Nicely has calculated many large prime gaps.. He measures the quality of fit to Cram√©r's conjecture by measuring the ratio :R = \\\\frac{\\\\log p_n}{\\\\sqrt{p_{n+1}-p_n}}. He writes, ‚ÄúFor the largest known maximal gaps, R has remained near 1.13.‚Äù However, 1/R^2 is still less than 1.

The term was coined in 1904 by Schmorl. Bilirubin is a naturally occurring substance in the body of humans and many other animals, but it is neurotoxic when its concentration in the blood is too high, a condition known as hyperbilirubinemia. Hyperbilirubinemia may cause bilirubin to accumulate in the grey matter of the central nervous system, potentially causing irreversible neurological damage. Depending on the level of exposure, the effects range from clinically unnoticeable to severe brain damage and even death. When hyperbilirubinemia increases past a mild level, it leads to jaundice, raising the risk of progressing to kernicterus. When this happens in adults, it is usually because of liver problems. Newborns are especially vulnerable to hyperbilirubinemia- induced neurological damage, because in the earliest days of life, the still- developing liver is heavily exercised by the breakdown of fetal hemoglobin as it is replaced with adult hemoglobin and the blood brain barrier is not as developed. Mildly elevated serum bilirubin levels are common in newborns, and neonatal jaundice is not unusual, but bilirubin levels must be carefully monitored in case they start to climb, in which case more aggressive therapy is needed, usually via light therapy but sometimes even via exchange transfusion. Classification =Acute bilirubin encephalopathy (ABE)= ABE is an acute state of elevated bilirubin in the central nervous system. Clinically, it encompasses a wide range of symptoms. These include lethargy, decreased feeding, hypotonia or hypertonia, a high-pitched cry, spasmodic torticollis, opisthotonus, setting sun sign, fever, seizures, and even death. If the bilirubin is not rapidly reduced, ABE quickly progresses to chronic bilirubin encephalopathy. =Chronic bilirubin encephalopathy (CBE)= CBE is a chronic state of severe bilirubin-induced neurological lesions. Reduction of bilirubin in this state will not reverse the sequelae. Clinically, manifestations of CBE include: # movement disorders ‚Äì dyskinetic CP with often spasticity. 60% have severe motor disability (unable to walk). # auditory dysfunction ‚Äì auditory neuropathy (ANSD) # visual/oculomotor impairments (nystagmus, strabismus, impaired upward or downward gaze, and/or cortical visual impairment). In rare cases, blindness can occur. # dental enamel hypoplasia/dysplasia of the deciduous teeth, # gastroesophageal reflux, # impaired digestive function. # slightly decreased intellectual function: Although most of (approximately 85%) individual with kernicterus fall in normal or dull-normal range. # epilepsy is uncommon. These impairments are associated with lesions in the basal ganglia, auditory nuclei of the brain stem, and oculomotor nuclei of the brain stem. Cortex and white matter are subtly involved. Cerebellum may be involved. Severe cortical involvement is uncommon. =Subtle bilirubin encephalopathy (SBE)= SBE is a chronic state of mild bilirubin-induced neurological dysfunction (BIND). Clinically, this may result in neurological, learning and movement disorders, isolated hearing loss and auditory dysfunction. *In the past it was thought that kernicterus (KI) often cause an intellectual disability. This was assumed due to difficulty with hearing, that is typically not detected in a normal audiogram accompanied by impairments of speech, with choreoathetosis. With advances in technology, this has proven to not be the case as those living with KI have repeatedly demonstrated their intelligence using Augmentative Communication devices . Although most individuals with kernicteric cerebral palsy have normal intelligence, some children with mild choreoathetosis develop dull normal intelligence or mild intellectual disability even without auditory dysfunction. Causes Unconjugated hyperbilirubinemia during the neonatal period describes the history of nearly all individuals who suffer from kernicterus. It is thought that the blood‚Äìbrain barrier is not fully functional in neonates and therefore bilirubin is able to cross the barrier. Moreover, neonates have much higher levels of bilirubin in their blood due to: # Although the severe hemolytic disease of the newborn is usually the cause of death, many children who barely survive the anemia exhibit permanent mental impairment or damage to motor areas of the brain because of precipitation of bilirubin in the neuronal cells, causing destruction of many, a condition called kernicterus. The rapid breakdown of fetal red blood cells immediately prior to birth (and subsequent replacement by normal adult human red blood cells). This breakdown of fetal red blood cells releases large amounts of bilirubin. # Neonates cannot metabolize and eliminate bilirubin. The sole path for bilirubin elimination is through the uridine diphosphate glucuronosyltransferase isoform 1A1 (UGT1A1) proteins that perform a (SN2 conjugation) reaction called \\"glucuronidation\\". This reaction adds a large sugar to the bilirubin and makes it more water-soluble, so more readily excreted via the urine and/or the feces. The UGT1A1 enzymes are present, but not active until several months after birth in the newborn liver. Apparently, this is a developmental compromise since the maternal liver and placenta perform glucuronidation for the fetus. In the early 1980s a late-fetal change (30 ‚Äì 40 weeks of gestation) in hepatic UGT1A1 (from 0.1% to 1.0% of adult activity levels) and post-natal changes that are related to birth age not gestational age were reported. Similar development of activities to pan- specific substrates were observed except for serotonin (1A4), where adult activities were observed in fetal (16 ‚Äì 25 weeks) and neonatal liver up to 10 days old. More recently, individual UGT isoform development in infants and young children, including two fetal liver samples, were analyzed and showed that pediatric levels of mRNA and protein for UGT1A1 did not differ from adults, but activities were lower. Hence, the effects of UGT1A1 developmental delay in activation have been illuminated over the last 20‚Äì30 years. The molecular mechanism(s) for activating UGT1A1 remain unknown. # Administration of aspirin to neonates and infants. Aspirin displaces the bilirubin that was non-covalently attached to albumin in the blood stream, thus generating an increased level of free bilirubin which can cross the developing blood brain barrier. This can be life-threatening. Bilirubin is known to accumulate in the gray matter of neurological tissue where it exerts direct neurotoxic effects. It appears that its neurotoxicity is due to mass-destruction of neurons by apoptosis and necrosis. Risk factors *Premature birth *Rh incompatibility *Polycythemia ‚Äì often present in neonates *Sulfonamides (e.g. co-trimoxazole) ‚Äì displaces bilirubin from serum albumin *Crigler‚ÄìNajjar syndrome, type I *G6PD deficiency *Bruising Gilbert's syndrome and G6PD deficiency occurring together especially increases the risk for kernicterus. Diagnosis The diagnosis is based upon physical examination of moro reflex. Asymmetrical moro reflex indicate kernicterus . An xray also help to diagnose this condition. Asymmetrical moro reflex will indicate one sided brachial plexus injury. Neurological causes (including kernicterus) will have symmetric abnormal moro reflex ( or absent moro reflex). Prevention The only effective way at preventing kernicterus is to lower the serum bilirubin levels either by phototherapy or exchange transfusion. Visual inspection is never sufficient; therefore, it is best to use a bilimeter or blood test to determine a baby's risk for developing kernicterus. These numbers can then be plotted on the Bhutani nomogram. Treatment Currently no effective treatment exists for kernicterus. Future therapies may include neuroregeneration. A handful of patients have undergone deep brain stimulation, and experienced some benefit. Drugs such as baclofen, clonazepam, gabapentin, and artane are often used to manage movement disorders associated with kernicterus. Proton pump inhibitors are also used to help with reflux. Cochlear implants and hearing aids have also been known to improve the hearing loss that can come with kernicterus (auditory neuropathy ‚Äì ANSD).

The Oxford English Dictionary gives the earliest entry as being from Bristol in 1500, but there were bager(s)gates at York in 1243 and in Lincoln by 1252. It continued in use until the 19th century in Great Britain.Peter Clark, Paul Slack -Crisis and Order in English Towns 1500-1700 2013 - Page 13 \\"The sixteenth century was the great age of the fair and market, of the enhanced complexity of commercial exchange, of broggers, badgers, drovers and pedlars.\\" The term badger was specifically applied to those dealing in grain for food, but was also applied generically to food commodity dealers. These included those dealing in grain for brewing (maltsters) or meal for bread-making (mealmen), while others specialised in butter and cheese. Other grains, beans, peas or even vetch were traded in years when wheat and barley prices were high. The legislation also referred to kidders, drovers of livestock, laders, and carriers. The primary statutes were 4 & 5 Edward VI, c.14, 'An Act against Regrators, Forestallers and Ingrossers' 1552 and 5 Elizabeth I, c 12, 'An Act touching Badgers of Corn, and Drovers of Cattle to be licensed' 1563. These prescribed penalties against the offences of engrossing (speculative accumulation), forestalling (buying produce before it was offered in market), and regrating (buying and re-selling within the same market or within 4 miles). They required badgers to be licensed by three justices of the peace at quarter sessions and required them to be married householders, of 30 years of age or more, resident in the county for at least 3 years. Household servants or retainers could not be badgers. In some counties justices seem to have regularly imposed limits on licences, specifying the markets where badgers could buy or sell, the quantities they could buy or the number of packhorses they could use for carrying goods between markets. The preamble to the statute of 1562 declared that many people took up the trade of badgering seeking only to live easily and to leave their honest labour. As with much of the Tudor regulatory legislation enforcement this may better reflect the fears of central government than the reality of the trade. Although there were complaints about abuses by badgers enforcement action was variable. There are few surviving records of licensing before the Civil War, and it may not have been comprehensive. In that period most prosecutions for breaching the statutes were brought by common informers, whose reputation was poor. The licensing system is best seen as one of the powers which were available to the county justices of the peace, which they used when local conditions required or when ordered to so by the Privy Council. The legislation was repealed in 1772, but forestalling remained a common law offence until 1844. The contribution made by badgers to the provisioning of provincial cities and industrial towns is hard to calculate. However, they must have been significant, as local justices complained when neighbouring justices or over- zealous informers restricted their activities. There are also records of local communities petitioning the justices for a nominated person to be licensed specifically to buy grain to supply their market. The term is now obsolete.

Badgers are a polyphyletic grouping, and are not a natural taxonomic grouping: badgers are united by their squat bodies, adapted for fossorial activity. All belong to the caniform suborder of carnivoran mammals. The 11 species of mustelid badgers are grouped in four subfamilies: Melinae (4 species, including the European badger), Helictidinae (5 species of ferret-badger), Mellivorinae (the honey badger or ratel), and Taxideinae (the American badger); the respective genera are Arctonyx, Meles, Melogale, Mellivora and Taxidea. Badgers include the most basal mustelids; the American badger is the most basal of all, followed successively by the ratel and Melinae; the estimated split dates are about 17.8, 15.5 and 14.8 million years ago, respectively. The two species of Asiatic stink badgers of the genus Mydaus were formerly included within Melinae (and thus Mustelidae), but more recent genetic evidence indicates these are actually members of the skunk family (Mephitidae). Badger mandibular condyles connect to long cavities in their skulls, which gives resistance to jaw dislocation and increases their bite grip strength. This in turn limits jaw movement to hinging open and shut, or sliding from side to side, but it does not hamper the twisting movement possible for the jaws of most mammals. Badgers have rather short, wide bodies, with short legs for digging. They have elongated, weasel-like heads with small ears. Their tails vary in length depending on species; the stink badger has a very short tail, while the ferret badger's tail can be long, depending on age. They have black faces with distinctive white markings, grey bodies with a light-coloured stripe from head to tail, and dark legs with light-coloured underbellies. They grow to around in length including tail. The European badger is one of the largest; the American badger, the hog badger, and the honey badger are generally a little smaller and lighter. Stink badgers are smaller still, and ferret badgers smallest of all. They weigh around , while some Eurasian badgers weigh around .  Etymology  An adult female (sow) American badger The word \\"badger\\", originally applied to the European badger (Meles meles), comes from earlier bageard (16th century),C. T. Onions, ed., The Oxford Dictionary of English Etymology (Oxford: Oxford UP, 1966), 68. presumably referring to the white mark borne like a badge on its forehead. Similarly, a now archaic synonym was bauson 'badger' (1375), a variant of bausond 'striped, piebald', from Old French bausant, baucent 'id.'.The American Heritage Dictionary, 4th edn., s.v. \\"badger\\" (Houghton Mifflin, 2001). The less common name brock (Old English: brocc), (Scots: brock) is a Celtic loanword (cf. Gaelic broc and Welsh broch, from Proto-Celtic *brokkos) meaning \\"grey\\". The Proto-Germanic term was *√æahsuz (cf. German Dachs, Dutch das, Norwegian svintoks; Early Modern English dasse), probably from the PIE root *tek'- \\"to construct,\\" so the badger would have been named after its digging of setts (tunnels); the Germanic term *√æahsuz became taxus or tax≈ç, -≈çnis in Latin glosses, replacing mƒìlƒìs (\\"marten\\" or \\"badger\\"), and from these words the common Romance terms for the animal evolved (Italian tasso, French taisson‚Äîblaireau is now more common‚ÄîCatalan toix√≥, Spanish tej√≥n, Portuguese texugo). A male European badger is a boar, a female is a sow, and a young badger is a cub. In North America the young are usually called kits, while the terms male and female are generally used for adults. A collective name suggested for a group of colonial badgers is a cete,Hints and Things: collective nouns Retrieved 28 June 2010. but badger colonies are more often called clans. A badger's home is called a sett.  Classification  The following list shows where the various species with the common name of badger are placed in the Mustelidae and Mephitidae classifications. The list is polyphyletic and the species commonly called badgers do not form a valid clade. * Family Mustelidae ** Subfamily Melinae *** Genus Arctonyx **** Hog badger, Arctonyx collaris *** Genus Meles **** Japanese badger, Meles anakuma **** Asian badger, Meles leucurus **** European badger, Meles meles ** Subfamily Helictidinae *** Genus Melogale **** Burmese ferret-badger, Melogale personata **** Javan ferret-badger, Melogale orientalis **** Chinese ferret- badger, Melogale moschata **** Bornean ferret-badger, Melogale everetti **** Vietnam ferret-badger, Melogale cucphuongensis ** Subfamily Mellivorinae *** Honey badger, Mellivora capensis ** Subfamily Taxidiinae: *** ‚Ä†Chamitataxus avitus *** ‚Ä†Pliotaxidea nevadensis *** ‚Ä†Pliotaxidea garberi *** American badger, Taxidea taxus * Family Mephitidae ** Genus Mydaus *** Indonesian or Sunda stink badger (teledu), Mydaus javanensis *** Palawan stink badger, Mydaus marchei  Distribution  Badgers are found in much of North America, Ireland, Great Britain and most of the rest of Europe as far north as southern Scandinavia.Brink van den, F.H.

Database entry includes a brief justification of why this species is of data deficient. The honey badger is found in most of sub- Saharan Africa, the Arabian Desert, southern Levant, Turkmenistan, Pakistan and India. A Japanese badger walking around, 2016 Behaviour The behaviour of badgers differs by family, but all shelter underground, living in burrows called setts, which may be very extensive. Some are solitary, moving from home to home, while others are known to form clans called cetes. Cete size is variable from two to 15. Badgers can run or gallop at for short periods of time. Badgers are nocturnal. In North America, coyotes sometimes eat badgers and vice versa, but the majority of their interactions seem to be mutual or neutral. American badgers and coyotes have been seen hunting together in a cooperative fashion.  Diet  The diet of the Eurasian badger consists largely of earthworms (especially Lumbricus terrestris), insects, grubs, and the eggs and young of ground-nesting birds. They also eat small mammals, amphibians, reptiles and birds, as well as roots and fruit. In Britain, they are the main predator of hedgehogs, which have demonstrably lower populations in areas where badgers are numerous, so much so that hedgehog rescue societies do not release hedgehogs into known badger territories. They are occasional predators of domestic chickens, and are able to break into enclosures that a fox cannot. In southern Spain, badgers feed to a significant degree on rabbits. American badgers are fossorial carnivores ‚Äì i.e. they catch a significant proportion of their food underground, by digging. They can tunnel after ground-dwelling rodents at speed. The honey badger of Africa consumes honey, porcupines, and even venomous snakes (such as the puff adder); they climb trees to gain access to honey from bees' nests. Badgers have been known to become intoxicated with alcohol after eating rotting fruit.AFP: Drunk badger blocks German road. Google.com (8 July 2009). Retrieved on 7 November 2011.

Retrieved 22 May 2019.  Relation with humans  = Hunting = Hunting badgers for sport has been common in many countries. The Dachshund (German for \\"badger hound\\") dog breed was bred for this purpose. Badger-baiting was formerly a popular blood sport. Although badgers are normally quite docile, they fight fiercely when cornered. This led people to capture and box badgers and then wager on whether a dog could succeed in removing the badger from its refuge. In England, opposition from naturalists led to its ban under the Cruelty to Animals Act of 1835 and the Protection of Badgers Act of 1992 made it an offence to kill, injure, or take a badger or to interfere with a sett unless under license from a statutory authority. The Hunting Act of 2004 further banned fox hunters from blocking setts during their chases. Badger pelts Badgers have been trapped commercially for their pelts, which have been used for centuries to make shaving brushes, a purpose to which it is particularly suited owing to its high water retention. Virtually all commercially available badger hair now comes from mainland China, though, which has farms for the purpose. The Chinese supply three grades of hair to domestic and foreign brush makers. Village cooperatives are also licensed by the national government to hunt and process badgers to avoid their becoming a crop nuisance in rural northern China. The European badger is also used as trim for some traditional Scottish clothing. The American badger is also used for paintbrushes and as trim for some Native American garments. = Culling = Controlling the badger population is prohibited in many European countries since badgers are listed in the Berne Convention but they are not otherwise the subject of any international treaty or legislation. Many badgers in Europe were gassed during the 1960s and 1970s to control rabies.The European badger (Meles meles) . badger.org.uk Until the 1980s badger culling in the United Kingdom was undertaken in the form of gassing, allegedly to control the spread of bovine tuberculosis (bTB). Limited culling resumed in 1998 as part of a 10-year randomised trial cull, which was considered by John Krebs and others to show that culling was ineffective. Some groups called for a selective cull,Badger cull is necessary to stop them suffering, say vets. The Times (27 April 2013). Retrieved on 2 September 2013. whilst others favoured a programme of vaccination. Wales and Northern Ireland are currently (2013) conducting field trials of a badger vaccination programme. In 2012 the government authorised a limited cull led by the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs. However it was later deferred and a wide range of reasons given. In August 2013 a full culling programme began whereby it was expected that about 5,000 badgers would be killed over six weeks in West Somerset and Gloucestershire using a mixture of controlled shooting and free shooting. (Some badgers were to be trapped in cages first.) The cull caused many protests, with emotional, economic and scientific reasons being cited. The badger is considered an iconic species of the British countryside and it has been claimed by shadow ministers that \\"The government's own figures show it will cost more than it saves...\\", and Lord Krebs, who led the Randomised Badger Culling Trial in the 1990s, said the two pilots \\"will not yield any useful information\\". = Food = Although rarely eaten today in the United States or the United Kingdom, badgers were once a primary meat source for the diets of Native Americans and European colonists. Badgers were also eaten in Britain during World War II and the 1950s. In some areas of Russia, the consumption of badger meat is still widespread. Shish kebabs made from badger, along with dog meat and pork, are a major source of trichinosis outbreaks in the Altai Region of Russia. In Croatia badger meat is rarely eaten, but when it is, it is usually smoked, dried, or served in goulash. In France, badger meat was used in the preparation of several dishes, such as Blaireau au sang, and it was a relatively common ingredient in countryside cuisine. Badger meat was eaten in some parts of Spain until recently. = Pets = Badgers are sometimes kept as pets. Keeping a badger as a pet or offering one for sale is an offence in the United Kingdom under the 1992 Protection of Badgers Act.  In popular culture  Ratty, Mole, and Mr. Toad from The Wind in the Willows In medieval times, badgers were thought to work together to dig holes under mountains. They were said to lie down at the entrance of the hole holding a stick in their mouths, while other badgers piled dirt on their bellies. Two badgers would then take hold of the stick in the badger's mouth, and drag the animal loaded with dirt away, almost in the fashion of a wagon.\\"Medieval Bestiary : Badger\\". bestiary.ca. The 19th-century poem \\"The Badger\\" by John Clare describes a badger hunt and badger-baiting. The character Frances in Russell Hoban's children's books, beginning with Bedtime for Frances (1948‚Äì1970), is depicted as a badger. Trufflehunter is a heroic badger in the Chronicles of Narnia book Prince Caspian (1951) by C. S. Lewis. Badger characters are featured in author Brian Jacques' Redwall series (1986‚Äì2011), most often falling under the title of Badger Lord or Badger Mother. A badger god is featured in The Immortals (1992‚Äì1996) by Tamora Pierce and \\"The Badger\\" is a comic book hero created by Mike Baron. The badger is the emblem of the Hufflepuff house of the Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry in the J. K. Rowling's Harry Potter book series (1997‚Äì2007), it is chosen as such because the badger is an animal that is often underestimated, because it lives quietly until attacked, but which, when provoked, can fight off animals much larger than itself, which resembles the Hufflepuff house in several ways. Many other stories featuring badgers as characters include Kenneth Grahame's children's novel The Wind in the Willows (1908), Beatrix Potter's The Tale of Mr. Tod (1912; featuring badger Tommy Brock), the Rupert Bear adventures by Mary Tourtel (appearing since 1920), T. H. White's Arthurian fantasy novels The Once and Future King (1958, written 1938‚Äì41) and The Book of Merlyn (1977), Fantastic Mr. Fox (1970) by Roald Dahl, Richard Adams's Watership Down (1972), Colin Dann's The Animals of Farthing Wood (1979), and Erin Hunter's Warriors (appearing since 2003). In the historic novel Incident at Hawk's Hill (1971) by Allan W. Eckert a badger is one of the main characters. Badgers are also featured in films and animations: a flash video called Badgers shows a cete doing calisthenics. The 1973 Disney animated film Robin Hood, depicts the character of Friar Tuck as a badger. In the Doctor Snuggles series, Dennis the handyman, was a badger. In Europe, badgers were traditionally used to predict the length of winter.Yoder, Don (2003) Groundhog Day. Mechanicsburg, Pennsylvania: Stackpole Books.

The badger is also the official mascot of Brock University in St. Catharines, Ontario, Canada; The University of Sussex, England; and St Aidan's College at the University of Durham. In 2007, the appearance of honey badgers around the British base at Basra, Iraq, fuelled rumours among the locals that British forces deliberately released \\"man- eating\\" and \\"bear-like\\" badgers to spread panic. These allegations were denied by the British army and the director of Basra's veterinary hospital. On 28 August 2013 the PC video game Shelter was released by developers Might and Delight in which players control a mother badger protecting her cubs.

In each episode, Ross taught techniques for landscape oil painting, completing a painting in each session. The program followed the same format as its predecessor, The Magic of Oil Painting, hosted by Ross's mentor Bill Alexander. During its run, it won three Emmy Awards. Production The show was aired and produced by non-commercial, public television stations. The first season aired in early 1983, and initially it was produced by WNVC in Falls Church, Virginia. Starting in the second season in late 1983, the show was produced by WIPB in Muncie, Indiana until its end in 1994, and later by Blue Ridge Public Television in Roanoke, Virginia. Most of the series was distributed by what is now American Public Television. Reruns continue to air in syndication in the United States today under the title The Best of The Joy of Painting, featuring a collection of Bob Ross' favorite paintings from the show's run. Format Each 30-minute show usually begins with Ross (or a guest) standing in front of a blank canvas against a white or black background. Guests included Ross's long-time friend Dana Jester, along with Ross's son Steve, his old instructor John Thamm, and many others. Within the 30-minute program, Ross graphically ran the colors across the screen (this was not done in the first season, with Ross instead going it over on his palette on-screen), as he turned the blank canvas into an imaginary landscape, using the wet-on-wet oil painting technique, in which the painter continues adding paint on top of still-wet paint rather than waiting for each layer of paint to dry. Combining this method with the use of two-inch and other types of brushes, as well as painting knives, allowed him to paint trees, water, clouds, and mountains in a matter of seconds. Each painting would start with simple strokes that appeared to be nothing more than the smudges of color. As he added more and more strokes, the blotches transformed into intricate landscapes. As he painted, he instructed viewers regarding the techniques he was using, he added comments describing the \\"happy little clouds\\" and \\"happy little trees\\" he was creating. He would also have home video footage of himself with a baby deer, or a raccoon, or another small animal. Each program was shot in real time with two video cameras: a medium shot of Ross and his canvas, and a close-up shot of the canvas or palette. At the end of each episode, Ross was known for saying something akin to, \\"...so from all of us here I'd like to wish you happy painting, and God bless, my friend...\\"then the show's theme song as credits roll over the finished painting. Ross created three versions of each painting. The first, done prior to taping, sat on an easel off-camera and was used as a template to create a second, which the viewers actually watched him paint; after taping he painted a more detailed third one for inclusion in his instructional books.The Real Bob Ross: Meet The Meticulous Artist Behind Those Happy Trees.

Munro's work has been described as having revolutionized the architecture of short stories, especially in its tendency to move forward and backward in time.Alice Munro Wins Nobel Prize in Literature, by Julie Bosmans, The New York Times, 10 October 2013 Her stories have been said to \\"embed more than announce, reveal more than parade.\\" Munro's fiction is most often set in her native Huron County in southwestern Ontario. Her stories explore human complexities in an uncomplicated prose style. Munro's writing has established her as \\"one of our greatest contemporary writers of fiction\\", or, as Cynthia Ozick put it, \\"our Chekhov.\\" Munro is the recipient of many literary accolades, including the 2013 Nobel Prize in Literature for her work as \\"master of the contemporary short story\\", and the 2009 Man Booker International Prize for her lifetime body of work. She is also a three-time winner of Canada's Governor General's Award for fiction and was the recipient of the Writers' Trust of Canada's 1996 Marian Engel Award, as well as the 2004 Rogers Writers' Trust Fiction Prize for Runaway.

Buffalo, NY: Broadview Press, 2012. Her mother, Anne Clarke Laidlaw (n√©e Chamney), was a schoolteacher. She is of Irish and Scottish descent, her father being a direct descendant of James Hogg, the Ettrick Shepherd. Munro began writing as a teenager, publishing her first story, \\"The Dimensions of a Shadow\\", in 1950 while studying English and journalism at the University of Western Ontario under a two-year scholarship. During this period she worked as a waitress, a tobacco picker, and a library clerk. In 1951, she left the university, where she had been majoring in English since 1949, to marry fellow student James Munro. They moved to Dundarave, West Vancouver, for James's job in a department store. In 1963, the couple moved to Victoria, where they opened Munro's Books, which still operates. Career Munro's highly acclaimed first collection of stories, Dance of the Happy Shades (1968), won the Governor General's Award, then Canada's highest literary prize. That success was followed by Lives of Girls and Women (1971), a collection of interlinked stories. In 1978, Munro's collection of interlinked stories Who Do You Think You Are? was published (titled The Beggar Maid: Stories of Flo and Rose in the United States). This book earned Munro a second Governor General's Literary Award. From 1979 to 1982, she toured Australia, China and Scandinavia for public appearances and readings. In 1980 Munro held the position of writer in residence at both the University of British Columbia and the University of Queensland. Since the 1980s, Munro has published a short-story collection at least once every four years, most recently in 2001, 2004, 2006, 2009, and 2012. First versions of Munro's stories have appeared in journals such as The Atlantic Monthly, Grand Street, Harper's Magazine, Mademoiselle, The New Yorker, Narrative Magazine, and The Paris Review. Her collections have been translated into thirteen languages. On 10 October 2013, Munro was awarded the Nobel Prize in Literature, cited as a \\"master of the contemporary short story\\". She is the first Canadian and the 13th woman to receive the Nobel Prize in Literature.Saul Bellow, the 1976 laureate, was born in Canada, but he moved to the United States at age nine and became a US citizen at twenty-six. Munro is noted for her longtime association with editor and publisher Douglas Gibson. When Gibson left Macmillan of Canada in 1986 to launch his own Douglas Gibson Books imprint at McClelland and Stewart, Munro returned the advance that Macmillan had already paid her for The Progress of Love so that she could follow Gibson to the new company.\\"Munro follows publisher Gibson from Macmillan\\". Toronto Star, 30 April 1986. Munro and Gibson have retained their professional association ever since; when Gibson published his own memoirs in 2011, Munro wrote the introduction, and to this day Gibson often makes public appearances on Munro's behalf when her health prevents her from appearing personally.\\"Alice Munro unlikely to come out of retirement following Nobel win\\". CTV News, 11 October 2013. Almost twenty of Munro's works have been made available for free on the web. However, in most cases these are the first versions only.Which of the stories have free Web versions. From the period before 2003, 16 stories have been included in Munro's own compilations more than twice, with two of her works scoring even four republications: \\"Carried Away\\" and \\"Hateship, Friendship, Courtship, Loveship, Marriage\\".For further details, see List of short stories by Alice Munro. Film adaptations of Munro's short stories have included Martha, Ruth and Edie (1988), Edge of Madness (2002), Away from Her (2006), Hateship, Loveship (2013) and Julieta (2016). Writing Many of Munro's stories are set in Huron County, Ontario. Her strong regional focus is one of the features of her fiction. Another is the omniscient narrator who serves to make sense of the world. Many compare Munro's small-town settings to writers from the rural South of the United States. As in the works of William Faulkner and Flannery O'Connor, her characters often confront deep-rooted customs and traditions, but the reaction of Munro's characters is generally less intense than their Southern counterparts'. Her male characters tend to capture the essence of the everyman, while her female characters are more complex. Much of Munro's work exemplifies the literary genre known as Southern Ontario Gothic.Susanne Becker, Gothic Forms of Feminine Fictions. Manchester University Press, 1999. Munro's work is often compared with the great short-story writers. In her stories, as in Chekhov's, plot is secondary and \\"little happens.\\" As with Chekhov, Garan Holcombe notes: \\"All is based on the epiphanic moment, the sudden enlightenment, the concise, subtle, revelatory detail.\\" Munro's work deals with \\"love and work, and the failings of both. She shares Chekhov's obsession with time and our much-lamented inability to delay or prevent its relentless movement forward.\\" A frequent theme of her work, particularly evident in her early stories, has been the dilemmas of a girl coming of age and coming to terms with her family and the small town she grew up in. In recent work such as Hateship, Friendship, Courtship, Loveship, Marriage (2001) and Runaway (2004) she has shifted her focus to the travails of middle age, of women alone, and of the elderly. It is a mark of her style for characters to experience a revelation that sheds light on, and gives meaning to, an event. Munro's prose reveals the ambiguities of life: \\"ironic and serious at the same time,\\" \\"mottoes of godliness and honor and flaming bigotry,\\" \\"special, useless knowledge,\\" \\"tones of shrill and happy outrage,\\" \\"the bad taste, the heartlessness, the joy of it.\\" Her style places the fantastic next to the ordinary, with each undercutting the other in ways that simply and effortlessly evoke life. As Robert Thacker wrote: Many critics have asserted that Munro's stories often have the emotional and literary depth of novels. Some have asked whether Munro actually writes short stories or novels. Alex Keegan, writing in Eclectica, gave a simple answer: \\"Who cares? In most Munro stories there is as much as in many novels.\\" Research on Munro's work has been undertaken since the early 1970s, with the first PhD thesis published in 1972.J.R. (Tim) Struthers, Some Highly Subversive Activities: A Brief Polemic and a Checklist of Works on Alice Munro, in: Studies in Canadian Literature / √âtudes en litt√©rature canadienne (SCL/√âLC), Volume 06, Number 1 (1981). The first book-length volume collecting the papers presented at the University of Waterloo first conference on her oeuvre was published in 1984, The Art of Alice Munro: Saying the Unsayable.The Art of Alice Munro: Saying the Unsayable (1984) was edited by Judith Miller.

In 2003/2004, the journal Open Letter. Canadian quarterly review of writing and sources published 14 contributions on Munro's work, in Autumn 2010 the Journal of the Short Story in English (JSSE)/Les cahiers de la nouvelle dedicated a special issue to Munro, and in May 2012 an issue of the journal Narrative focussed on a single story by Munro, \\"Passion\\" (2004), with an introduction, a summary of the story, and five essays of analysis.Journal of the Short Story in English (JSSE)/Les cahiers de la nouvelle special issue = Creating new versions = Munro publishes variant versions of her stories, sometimes within a short span of time. Her works \\"Save the Reaper\\" and \\"Passion\\" came out in two different versions in the same year, in 1998 and 2004 respectively. At the other end of the scale, two stories were republished in a variant version about 30 years later, \\"Home\\" (1974/2006/2014) and \\"Wood\\" (1980/2009).For details please see List of short stories by Alice Munro Ann Close and Lisa Dickler Awano reported in 2006 that Munro had not wanted to reread the galleys of Runaway (2004): \\"No, because I'll rewrite the stories.\\" In their symposium contribution An Appreciation of Alice Munro they say that of her story \\"Powers\\", for example, Munro did eight versions in all.An Appreciation of Alice Munro, by Ann Close and Lisa Dickler Awano, Compiler and Editor. In: The Virginia Quarterly Review. VQR Symposium on Alice Munro. Summer 2006, pp. 102‚Äì105. Section variants of \\"Wood\\". Awano writes that \\"Wood\\" is a good example of how Munro, being \\"a tireless self-editor\\",Lisa Dickler Awano, Kindling The Creative Fire: Alice Munro‚Äôs Two Versions of \\"Wood\\", New Haven Review, 30 May 2012. rewrites and revises a story, in this case returning to it for a second publication nearly thirty years later. In this case, Awano says, Munro revised characterizations, themes and perspectives, as well as rhythmic syllables, a conjunction or a punctuation mark. The characters change, too. Inferring from the perspective they take on things, they are middle-age in 1980, and in 2009 they are older. Awano perceives a heightened lyricism brought about not least by the poetic precision of the revision undertaken by the author. The 2009 version is made up of eight sections instead of three in 1980, and it has a new ending. Awano writes that Munro literally \\"refinishes\\" the first take on the story, with an ambiguity that is characteristic of Munro's endings, and that the author re-imagines her stories throughout her work a variety of ways. Several stories were re-published with considerable variation as to which content goes into which section. This can be seen, for example, in \\"Home\\", \\"The Progress of Love\\", \\"What Do You Want to Know For?\\", \\"The Children Stay\\", \\"Save the Reaper\\", \\"The Bear Came Over the Mountain\\", \\"Passion\\", \\"The View From Castle Rock\\", \\"Wenlock Edge\\", and \\"Deep-Holes\\". Personal life Munro married James Munro in 1951. Their daughters Sheila, Catherine, and Jenny were born in 1953, 1955, and 1957 respectively; Catherine died the day of her birth due to the lack of functioning kidneys. In 1963, the Munros moved to Victoria where they opened Munro's Books, a popular bookstore still in business. In 1966, their daughter Andrea was born. Alice and James Munro divorced in 1972. Munro returned to Ontario to become writer in residence at the University of Western Ontario, and in 1976 received an honorary LLD from the institution. In 1976, she married Gerald Fremlin, a cartographer and geographer she met in her university days. The couple moved to a farm outside Clinton, Ontario, and later to a house in Clinton, where Fremlin died on 17 April 2013, aged 88. Munro and Fremlin also owned a home in Comox, British Columbia. At a Toronto appearance in October 2009, Munro indicated that she had received treatment for cancer and for a heart condition requiring coronary-artery bypass surgery. In 2002, her daughter Sheila Munro published a childhood memoir, Lives of Mothers and Daughters: Growing Up With Alice Munro.

The gens Atilia, sometimes written Atillia, was a plebeian family at ancient Rome, which rose to prominence at the beginning of the fourth century BC. The first member of this gens to attain the consulship was Marcus Atilius Regulus, in 335 BC. The Atilii continued to hold the highest offices of the state throughout the history of the Republic, and well into imperial times.Dictionary of Greek and Roman Biography and Mythology, vol. I, p. 405 (\\"Atilia Gens\\"). Origin Chase classifies the nomen Atilius with a small group of gentilicia probably formed from praenomina ending in ' using the suffix ', a morphology common in names of Latin origin.Chase, p. 125. The root might then be a praenomen Atius, otherwise unknown, although there was a Sabine praenomen Attius. Praenomina The Atilii favored the praenomina Lucius, Marcus, and Gaius, the three most common names throughout Roman history, to which they sometimes added Aulus and Sextus. Under the Empire, some of the Atilii bore the praenomen Titus. Branches and cognomina Under the Republic, the cognomina of the Atilii included Bulbus, Calatinus, Luscus, Priscus, Regulus, Nomentanus, and Serranus. Of these, only Regulus and Serranus appear to constitute a distinct family, with the Serrani being descended from the Reguli. The only cognomina found on coins are Saranus, which appears to be the same as Serranus, and Nomentanus.Eckhel, vol. v, p. 146.Crawford, Roman Republican Coinage, pp. 254, 255. Luscus, the first surname associated with the Atilii appearing in history, was a common name originally describing someone with poor eyesight, belonging to a large class of cognomina derived from the physical characteristics of individuals.Chase, pp. 109, 110. This is the surname as given in Dionysius, although some sources amend it to Longus, originally referring to someone particularly tall. It has been argued that Lucius Atilius Luscus, one of the first consular tribunes elected in 444 BC, was a patrician, since the first plebeians were elected to that office in 400; and most if not all of the ancient patrician gentes possessed plebeian branches, which frequently came to eclipse the fame of their patrician forebears. However, the lists of consular tribunes from both 444 and 422 contain names that are otherwise regarded as plebeian, and according to tradition the office was created with the intention that its members should be elected from either order, so in all probability Luscus, like all of the other Atilii, was plebeian.Cornell, The Beginnings of Rome, pp. 334‚Äì337. Priscus, a personal cognomen belonging to one of the early Atilii, usually translates as \\"elder\\", and probably served to distinguish its bearer from younger Atilii of his era.Chase, p. 111.New College Latin & English Dictionary, s.v. priscus. Bulbus, an onion, belongs to a class of surname derived from everyday objects, although the circumstances by which such cognomina were acquired by individuals is seldom known. The name is comparable to Caepio, a cognomen with much the same meaning.New College Latin & English Dictionary, s.v. bulbus. The Atilii Reguli were the most illustrious of their gens. The surname Regulus is a diminutive of Rex, a king.Chase, p. 112. This family rose to prominence in the time of the Samnite Wars, and continued down to the interval between the First and Second Punic Wars, at which time it was supplanted by that of Serranus or Saranus. The Atilii Serrani continued down to the time of Cicero, before fading into obscurity. Calatinus, also found as Caiatinus, the surname of Aulus Atilius Calatinus, a hero of the First Punic War, probably refers either to the town of Cales in Campania, or to the neighboring town of Caia. One of the Atilii Reguli had previously obtained the surname Calenus, in consequence of a battle fought at Cales in 335 BC.Broughton, pp. 139, 140 (and note 1). Likewise, Nomentanus, the name of one of the Atilii during the late Republic, is clearly derived from the Nomentum, an ancient city of Latium, although his particular connection with that town is unknown.

It is located at the eastern end of Seven Sisters Road, which runs from Tottenham High Road to join the A1 in Holloway. It is within the South Tottenham postal district. Etymology John Greenwood (1790) The Dorset map of 1619See Tottenham article shows the area known today as Seven Sisters named as Page Greene. However, by 1805 the first series Ordnance Survey map was showing the area as Seven Sisters.1805 Ordnance Survey map on Vision Of Britain website showing Seven Sisters. The name is derived from seven elms which were planted in a circle with a walnut tree at their centre on an area of common land known as Page Green.Just by the green was a tavern called the Seven Sisters. The clump was known as the Seven Sisters by 1732.Tottenham: Growth before 1850', A History of the County of Middlesex: Volume 5: Hendon, Kingsbury, Great Stanmore, Little Stanmore, Edmonton Enfield, Monken Hadley, South Mimms, Tottenham (1976) High Road, Seven Sisters In his early-seventeenth-century work, The Briefe Description of the Towne of Tottenham Highcrosse, local vicar and historian William Bedwell singled out the walnut tree for particular mention. He wrote of it as a local 'arboreal wonder' which 'flourished without growing bigger'. He described it as popularly associated with the burning of an unknown Protestant.W. Bedwell, Brief Description of Tottenham (1631), reprinted in W. J. Roe, Ancient Tottenham, 119, referenced in Tottenham: Growth before 1850', A History of the County of Middlesex: Volume 5: Hendon, Kingsbury, Great Stanmore, Little Stanmore, Edmonton Enfield, Monken Hadley, South Mimms, Tottenham (1976), pp. 313-317 There is also speculation that the tree was ancient, possibly going back as far as Roman times, perhaps standing in a sacred grove or pagan place of worship. The location of the seven trees can be tracked through a series of maps from 1619 on.Seven Sisters / Page Green and South Tottenham Conservation Area on the Haringey Council website. From 1619 they are shown in a position which today corresponds with the western tip of Page Green at the junction of Broad Lane and the High Road.a.Google Maps Satellite view. b.Google Maps Street view. With urbanisation radically changing the area, the 'Seven Sisters' had been replanted by 1876, still on Page Green, but further to the east. Contemporary maps show them remaining in this new location until 1955. The current ring of hornbeam trees was planted in 1997 in a ceremony led by five families of seven sisters. History Seven Sisters is on the route of Ermine Street, the Roman road connecting London to York. At the time of Domesday, the area was within the Manor of Tottenham held by Waltheof II, Earl of Northumbria, the last of the great Anglo-Saxon Earls. In the medieval period a settlement grew up at Page Green and the woodland was increasingly cleared for agriculture. In the early decades of the nineteenth century, the Seven Sisters Road was constructed and the area saw the construction of a number of large houses, including Suffield Lodge, Seven Sisters House and Grove Place.The development of the area is well visualised through a series of maps provided in the appendix of the archaeology report of the proposed Wards Corner redevelopment These fine buildings soon fell victim to the spread of Victorian London and by the third quarter of the century the area had been almost completely built over. Seven Sisters today Seven Sisters Market Today Seven Sisters is a multi-cultural area strongly influenced by its location on key road and underground rail routes. Immediately above the tube station is an early- Edwardian department store building, formerly occupied by Wards Furnishing Stores, which traded until 1972. Part of the building, known locally as Wards Corner, is thriving as an indoor market with a strong Latin American flavour.Pueblito Paisa The Clyde Circus Conservation Area stretches between the busy local shops of West Green Road and Philip Lane. Most of the residential streets between are in the Conservation Area, but not the more modern Lawrence Road and Elizabeth Place.Clyde Circus Residents of the Clyde Circus Conservation Area are brought together by the Clyde Area Residents Association (CARA), which holds an annual street party. Its sister group, the Fountain Area Residents Association (FARA), covers residents to the south of West Green Road, namely those in Kirkton Road, Roslyn Road, Seaford Road, Elmar Road, Turner Avenue, Brunel Walk, Avenue Road and Braemar Road.Fountain Area Residents Association Recent successful projects organised by FARA members include the creation of a community garden at the site of a dated pedestrian ramp. Another recent community project is the Avenue Orchard.Avenue Road Orchard The local community utilised wasteland behind a concrete wall on Avenue Road for planting apple trees, and held a workshop with local artists to source ideas for how to improve the look and feel of the wall and area around the Avenue Orchard.Avenue Art Project Plans for development The old Wards Corner building above the tube station has been earmarked for development since 2004, when Haringey Council published a development brief.Development Brief In August 2007 Haringey Council entered into a Development Agreement with developer Grainger. Grainger's plan to demolish the existing buildings on the site and replace them with a new mixed-use development of retail and residential units was met with local opposition. The Wards Corner Coalition (WCC) campaigned for the existing buildings and Latin American market to be retained and improved. The WCC mounted a legal challenge against the plans and, in June 2010, the Court of Appeal quashed the planning permission. In 2012, Grainger submitted revised plans for the site. Haringey Council granted planning permission for the revised plans on 12 July 2012. In addition to the Wards Corner plans, further projects for regeneration in Seven Sisters are planned. Haringey Council's 'Plan for Tottenham' sets out the Council's long-term vision for the area.

The game was made available as freeware for PC platforms in 2003. Set in a dystopian future, the player assumes the role of Robert Foster, who was stranded in a wasteland known as \\"the Gap\\" as a child and adopted by a group of local Aboriginals, gradually adjusting to his life in the wilderness. After many years, armed security officers arrive, killing the locals and taking Robert back to Union City. He escapes and soon uncovers the corruption which lies at the heart of society. Originally titled Underworld, the game was a collaboration between game director Charles Cecil and comic book artist Dave Gibbons, and cost ¬£40,000 to make. Cecil was a fan of Gibbons's work and approached with the idea of a video game. The game has a serious tone, but features humour-filled dialogue, which came as a result of Cecil's and writer Dave Cummins's goal to find a middle ground between the earnestness of Sierra's and the slapstick comedy of LucasArts' adventure games. It was built using Revolution's Virtual Theatre engine, first used in Revolution's previous and debut release, 1992's Lure of the Temptress. It received positive reviews at the time of its release and is retrospectively viewed as a cult classic and Revolution's greatest game besides Broken Sword: The Shadow of the Templars. A remastered edition was released for iOS in 2009 as Beneath a Steel Sky Remastered, which also received a positive reception from the gaming press. A sequel was greenlit during the Broken Sword: The Serpent's Curse 2012 Kickstarter campaign, and was announced in March 2019. Entitled Beyond a Steel Sky, it was released on Apple Arcade in June 2020, with a Steam release in July 2020. Gameplay Beneath a Steel Sky is a 2D adventure game played from a third-person perspective. The player uses a point-and-click interface to interact with the environment and to guide protagonist Robert Foster through the game's world. To solve puzzles and progress in the game, the player collects items that may be combined with one another, used on the environment, or given to non-player characters (NPCs). The protagonist converses with NPCs via dialogue trees to learn about the game's puzzles and plot. Clues and other information are obtained by clicking on items in the inventory and on objects in the environment. Unlike in most adventure games at the time, the protagonist's death is possible, after which the player starts from the last save point. In the remastered iOS version, the point-and-click interface is replaced with a touch user interface, a hint system is added, and hotspots are highlighted. Synopsis =Background= Beneath a Steel Sky is set at an unknown point in a dystopian future, when the Earth has been significantly damaged by pollution and/or nuclear fallout. In Australia, the six states and two territories who have been consumed by their respective capital cities are described as \\"city states\\". Union City is the second largest of the six remaining city states after the acquisition of Asio-City. Within this socio- political milieu, the national intelligence agency ASIO wield a great deal of power. After the \\"Euro-American War\\", all participants agreed upon a set of ideals described as the \\"neo democratic principles\\" which remove all labour representation and social benefits. Ironically, those that subscribe to these principles are called \\"Unions\\", contrasting the real world definition of what a trade union pushes for. Those that oppose the Unions' ideals are called \\"Corporations\\". All of the City States in Australia are either Corporations or Unions. The larger political context of the game involves a conflict between Union City and the Hobart Corporation, whereby they are each trying to achieve market dominance by the use of sabotage. During the game, characters in Union City remark that Hobart Corporation is winning the \\"economic war\\" by flooding the market with \\"cheap, gimmicky garbage,\\" although it is never clarified whether this is mere propaganda. =Plot= The immediate backstory is introduced via a comic book that tells the story of a young boy called Robert who is the sole survivor of a helicopter crash in \\"the Gap\\" (the name applied to the Outback at the time of the game). Too young to fend for himself, Robert is adopted by a group of locals, who teach him the skills he needs to survive in this harsh new environment; they name him Robert Foster, partly due to him being fostered by them, but also because of the discovery of an empty can of Foster's Lager found near the crash site. Over the years, Foster learns engineering and technology and builds a talking, sentient robot called Joey. Joey's personality is stored on a small circuit board, which can easily be inserted and removed from many types of robot. This allows him to change bodies as the situation requires, provided his circuit board is not damaged. His commentaries on the current \\"shell\\" he is in are a running gag throughout the game. As the game starts, Foster is kidnapped and his tribe annihilated by security soldiers sent from Union City by its all-powerful computer, LINC (Logical Inter-Neural Connection). The abductors refuse to give Foster any explanation as to what is happening. Shortly upon arriving in the city, the helicopter malfunctions and crashes in the city's upper level. Foster survives and flees, making his way into a recycling plant, carrying Joey's circuit board with him. Foster places Joey's circuit board into a robotic vacuum cleaner (something about which Joey is none too happy). He then attempts to escape the plant, but is cornered by a security officer who had also survived the accident. The officer, Reich, addresses Foster as \\"Overmann\\". Just as Reich is about to kill Foster, a nearby security camera shoots a laser, disarming him. Reich tells the camera, which he reveals is controlled by LINC, that Foster must be stopped. In answer the camera shoots him again, killing him. Foster takes the officer's access card and sunglasses before he continues his escape. As he makes his way further down the city, Foster eventually arrives in the abandoned subway tunnels. There he discovers that LINC has grown exponentially, to the point where he is now half-machine, half-organic entity. However, in order to function, LINC needs a human host to share its brain. The current host is Foster's biological father, who is old and has become severely worn out from his symbiosis with LINC. It is revealed that LINC sent for Foster because, with the death of its current host inevitable, it needed a replacement, and only a blood relative would do. Foster ultimately defeats LINC by plugging Joey (who, at this point, could be optionally given the new name \\"Ken\\" by Foster) into the mainframe. Joey/Ken is able to take control of the system, and set about turning Union City into a utopia. Development While working at Activision, Revolution co-founder and CEO Charles Cecil got the idea of working with Dave Gibbons, artist and co-creator of comic book Watchmen, as Cecil was a fan of the comic book himself. He approached Gibbons, but shortly thereafter, the old Activision broke down. However, they maintained a friendship, and Cecil later contacted Gibbons to ask him to work on Revolution's second game. Seeing his son play video games, Gibbons became interested and realized that his skills in drawing, writing and conceptualizing could be useful in a gaming environment. Joining the team just before the release Lure of the Temptress, Gibbons was sent a rudimentary outline of what could happen in the hypothesised game, and wrote a longer story with new characters and scenarios, to which Revolution then further added. Originally the game was named Underworld, a title proposed by Gibbons, but it was renamed due to the release of Ultima Underworld: The Stygian Abyss. The production values became much higher for Beneath a Steel Sky than for Lure of the Temptress, resulting in a game six times larger, and by the end of 1993, the team working on the game had grown to eleven. The game was created in sections, which allowed the team to ensure that each part was \\"perfected\\" before moving on. Its 2-year development cost ¬£40,000, a large amount of money for the company at the time. =Creative and technical design= The designers' goal was to create a visual bridge between comic and video game graphics. Gibbons drew the backgrounds in pencil, starting with roughs, which were sent to Revolution to see if they were technically feasible. Once agreed upon, Gibbons would then make the final sketch. The pencil sketches were then colored, mainly by Les Pace. The backgrounds were scanned on a Macintosh as 24-bit, 1000x1000 pixel images with 16 million colors, and then transformed to 8-bit, 320x200 pixel images with 256 colors for the PC version. The backgrounds were designed so that the sprites would appear clear on the screen and wouldn't mix with the backgrounds. Gibbons created the sprites using Deluxe Paint on an Amiga. Steve Ince, who joined the team in February 1993, created a number of sprite animations, also painting some backgrounds based on Gibbons's sketches. Gibbons also designed the characters, although he found it challenging to get a character's personality and expression in a face that was only around seven pixels wide and nine pixels high with a limited palette. He would have liked to design a character in a similar manner to Prince of Persia or Flashback, but Revolution wanted something more detailed, so the result became a compromise. All character sprites are smoothly animated with around 20 positions each. According to Gibbons, about 75% of the backgrounds and characters he designed were used in the game. Dave Cummins wrote the dialogue for the game. The tone of Revolution's early games was born from a tension between Cummins and Cecil. Cummins wanted to be more flippant with dialogue, while Cecil wanted to be more serious. Their goal was to find the middle ground between Sierra's \\"ridiculously earnest\\" stories and the slapstick comedy of LucasArts games. For the voice acting, which is only included in the CD-ROM version, Revolution used actors from the Royal Shakespeare Company. Only two days were spent recording over five thousands lines of dialogue. Not pleased with the results, however, Revolution decided on a lengthy re- recording, and realized that voice actors should be used, rather than stage actors. As a result of this, the speech doesn't always match the on-screen text, with English terms being Americanized. Cummins was also responsible for the score of the game, writing a specific tune for each of the main locations. Beneath a Steel Sky became the second game to use Revolution's Virtual Theatre engine, after Lure of the Temptress. According to Cecil, the original version of the engine seemed less applicable in Beneath a Steel Sky, as the ability to issue commands conflicted with the gameplay they intended to create. Lure of the Temptress had one story that was moved forward by a key event, whereas Beneath a Steel Sky had multiple threads. In one way this presented them with \\"exciting gameplay opportunities, but in others it cordoned off more ambitious ideas in terms of multilinearity.\\" As a consequence, some of the engine's features were scaled back. Tony Warriner and David Sykes, both Revolution co- founders and programmers, had to update the engine, which was part of the new deal with Virgin Interactive. As an example of change in the updated engine, Virtual Theatre 2.0, Warriner explained that in Lure of the Temptress, the system controlled everything, for instance specific routines to a door. So if there was a door on-screen, the door-routine was called up to handle it. The consequence was that every door looked the same and acted the same, so if a door was somewhat different from the last one, it caused a problem. This was changed in the new system, as it was object oriented and no distinction was made between a proper object like a door or key. =Release= Beneath a Steel Sky was presented at the European Computer Trade Show in the London Business Design Centre in April 1993 and at the Consumer Electronics Show in Chicago in June 1993.; ; According to French magazine G√©n√©ration 4, the game was supposed to be released by the end of October 1993. Various playable demos of the game were made; one was added to the first issue of PC Gamer, and Amiga demos were added as cover disks to several Amiga magazines.e.g. ; ; Beneath a Steel Sky was published in March 1994 by Virgin Interactive on floppy disks and CD-ROM. It came on 15 floppy disks, as opposed to Lure of The Temptress, which came on four. Because of the Amiga restrictions, a few animations had to be left out, as not all Amiga owners had a hard drive. Each conversion of the images to the Amiga resulted in a loss of detail. According to Revolution in- house artist Adam Tween, it took a couple of days to \\"touch up\\" the screens. A comic book created by Gibbons, which was translated into the introduction sequence of the game, came as part of the game package. Beneath a Steel Sky was translated from English into French and Portuguese. This was the first game not developed in Portugal to be released with a Portuguese translation. =Freeware release and Remastered edition= In August 2003, the game was released as freeware with its assembly language source code by Revolution Software.Source code \\"Source code for Beneath a Steel Sky in Assembly language (415,225 bytes) xxxx\\" (2005) The source code availability made it possible for the ScummVM project to support the game, which allows the game to be played on Windows, OS X, Linux, Windows CE and other compatible operating systems and platforms. In November 2011, James Woodcock released an enhanced soundtrack of the game for ScummVM. The game is also available for free download on digital distribution services, including Desura and GOG.com. In July 2009, Revolution announced that a remastered edition of Beneath a Steel Sky would be released on iOS later that year. The remastered edition features new animated movies by Gibbons, a context-sensitive help system and improved audio quality. The game was released on the App Store on October 7, 2009. The animated movies in the iOS remastered version make use of the original stills and use a sliding paper-like style to animate them. Critical reception and commercial performance Beneath a Steel Sky was critically acclaimed. In 1995, PC Gamer awarded it the \\"Best Dialogue\\" award, and it won the \\"Best Adventure\\" award at the Golden Joystick Awards. It was also a commercial success, reaching the number one place on the British Gallup charts. Eurogamer's Simon Parkin later summarized that it \\"sold extremely well\\", with lifetime sales between 300,000 and 400,000 units by July 2009. Parkin noted that the majority of its sales derived from European countries. CU Amigas Tony Dillon proclaimed Beneath a Steel Sky as \\"one of the greatest adventures ever.\\" Amiga Formats Rob Mead said that the game is an \\"Utterly brilliant\\", \\"massive, intense and atmospheric adventure which will keep you on tenterhooks right until its final startling conclusion.\\" PC Gamer USs Steve Poole called it \\"slick, funny,\\" \\"absorbing\\" and \\"one of the most playable adventures of all time\\" \\"that will appeal to a wide variety of gamers\\". Amiga Powers Cam Winstanley said that it is \\"an example of what an adventure game should be like ‚Äì funny, enthralling and convincing.\\" Adventure Gamers' Claire Wood called it an \\"enjoyable\\", \\"engaging adventure classic, thoroughly enjoyable playing experience\\" and \\"a 1984 for the computer game generation.\\" Winstanley thought that the main highpoint of the game was the story, with an ending \\"that's actually quite a surprise.\\" Wood praised the \\"intelligent, thought provoking storyline\\" that \\"becomes more and more compelling, punctuated by unexpected plot twists and macabre discoveries.\\" Dillon praised the game's \\"stunning\\" graphics. Mead said the comic book-like artwork projected a great \\"atmosphere\\". Winstanley felt that the game looked \\"superb\\". Wood said the graphics \\"have aged reasonably well\\". Many of the critics praised the game's \\"adult humour\\", showcased through numerous one-liners and double entendres. Dillon praised the charm of the various characters and their personalities built through conversations. Wood also praised the Revolution's \\"trademark\\" \\"light-hearted humour\\". Both Dillon and Wood, as well as Winstanley, highlighted Joey's witty remarks. Poole called the writing \\"some of the funniest dialog ever\\" and the characters \\"warped\\" and \\"interesting\\". Reviewers praised the game's puzzles for being logical but still challenging. Poole found the puzzles to be \\"tricky\\" and \\"engaging\\", but stated \\"the difficulty of the puzzles in the final third of the game is disproportionately high\\" and that he disliked some of the \\"race the clock\\" puzzles. On the other hand, Winstanley felt that the \\"real time\\" puzzles \\"add pace\\". Wood's only gripe with the puzzles were the \\"odd and disorienting\\" LINC-space sequences. Dillon wrote that the controls were so \\"simple that Revolution can finally lay claim to having created the ultimate in intuitive control methods.\\" Poole labeled them \\"a masterwork of simplicity\\". Winstanley also praised the \\"simple\\" interface, while Wood said that the \\"unobtrusive interface\\" is one of the factors that make the game a \\"highly immersive experience\\". =Remastered version= The remastered 2009 iOS version was also very well received. It holds an aggregate score of 85% on GameRankings based on 7 reviews, and 82 out of 100 on Metacritic based on 5 reviews. It was nominated for Best Port/Enhanced Re-release at the Adventure Gamers' 2009 Aggie Awards in 2010. The game sold around 20,000 units in its first month of release, while Cecil anticipated sales of around 70,000 copies during its first year on sale, and roughly 100,000 in its lifetime. The remastered release is available with Spanish, French, Swedish, Portuguese, German, Italian, and English subtitles. Slide To Play Keith Andrew said that \\"Beneath a Steel Sky somehow feels bigger and bolder than its rivals, raising the bar and highlighting what others have so far failed to achieve. Perfectly suited to its new home, this remastering of a classic game serves up point- and-click play nearly unmatched on the App Store.\\" Andrew noted that the point-and-click interface \\"merg[es] seamlessly with touchscreen controls\\" and that the hint system is \\"a feature that might antagonize some of Steel Sky's hardened fan-base, but one perfectly pitched at the iPhone generation.\\" IGN Eduardo Vasconcellos stated that the game \\"is a reminder of how good the old point-and-clickers really were. The updated elements only add to the experience -- especially the cutscenes. If you're looking for an intriguing story, solid gameplay and some nostalgic charm, Beneath a Steel Sky is for you.\\" Vasconcellos applauded the \\"intuitive and responsive\\" touch controls and said that the \\"visuals are an attractive update of the original release.\\",so he gave the game an \\"Editor's Choice\\" award. Pocket Gamers Tracy Erickson said that the game \\"remains as entertaining as it did 15 years ago, galvanising the adventure gaming resurgence on iPhone.\\" Erickson felt that the touch controls are \\"only functional and not fantastic,\\" but that \\"measures have been taken to address [problems of the original point-and click interface] to a respectable degree,\\" and that the \\"minimally enhanced presentation raises alarm.\\" However, he concluded that even though \\"More could have been done to brush the dust off this ageing title,\\" \\"it's still a standout game.\\" He gave it a \\"Silver Award\\". Legacy Although retrospectively Broken Sword: The Shadow of the Templars is generally looked upon as Revolution's magnum opus, Beneath a Steel Sky still holds the status of a cult classic and has been featured on numerous \\"all-time top\\" lists: Amiga Power ranked Beneath a Steel Sky 42nd on their Amiga Power All-Time Top One Hundred in 1994. Adventure Gamers ranked the game 17th on their list of Top 20 Adventure Games of All-Time in 2004, and 19th on the Top 100 All-Time Adventures in 2011. In 2006, Adventure Classic Gaming put the game in 9th place on their list of the Top 10 retro graphic adventure games of all time from PC to consoles. Retro Gamer placed it in third on its list of Top 20 Adventure Games of All-Time ... not by LucasArts in 2010. It was included in Edge editor Tony Mott's 1001 Video Games You Must Play Before You Die, a book published in 2010. In 2011, PC Gamer ranked it ninth on its list of 20 free PC games you must play.

Revolution Software. =Sequel= In 2004, Cecil commented \\"Beneath a Steel Sky 2 is a project Revolution has been considering for a while, and has started to move forward on, but we are unable to comment beyond this.\\" In an interview with Eurogamer in 2006, Cecil spoke of his admiration for the work done by ScummVM and the resulting interest in a sequel. He also stated that if he were to make the game he \\"would dearly love to work with Dave Gibbons again.\\" In a February 20, 2009 interview with IGN UK about the Wii and DS versions of Broken Sword: The Director's Cut, Cecil and Gibbons re- iterated their interest in a sequel to Beneath a Steel Sky. On September 25, 2012, Revolution announced that Beneath a Steel Sky 2 would be greenlit if their Broken Sword 5: The Serpent's Curse Kickstarter reached $1 million. Despite Broken Sword: The Serpent's Curse failing to meet the $1 million 'stretch goal', Revolution announced that the success of its crowdfunding campaign had inspired them to greenlight Beneath a Steel Sky 2. However, Revolution later clarified that Beneath a Steel Sky 2 will not necessarily be the studio's first project following Broken Sword 5 and that they would \\"think\\" about what their next game will be after finishing the Broken Sword game. In February 2014 it was reported that Beneath a Steel Sky 2 had never entered production, despite previous reports to the contrary. The reason cited was that the Broken Sword franchise took up the sole focus of the company. However, in 2016 interview, Cecil claimed that a sequel was still a possibility as it was \\"still very much at an early stage\\". On March 25, 2019, Revolution announced that Beyond a Steel Sky would be released on Apple Arcade (iOS, macOS, tvOS) later in 2019. The game was released on Apple Arcade on June 26, 2020, and on Steam on July 16, 2020.

It lies north-east of Neath. Seven Sisters falls within the Seven Sisters ward of Neath Port Talbot county borough. History The village of Seven Sisters had always been recognised historically for its coal mining pit that was located in the middle of what was once one of the richest sources of coal in Britain, if not the world, in the heart of the South Wales Coalfield. Development of many mines, and hence small settlements into villages and towns in the area, was brought about by a combination of a rich deposits of anthracite in the western South Wales coalfield, as well as the construction of the Neath and Brecon Railway from 1862. =Colliery= David Evans of the Evans-Bevan coal mining partnership, had wanted to call the colliery after his daughter, Isabella Bevan who cut the first sod on the land at Bryn Dulais farm with a silver spade on Monday 11 March 1872.http://www.neath-porttalbot.gov.uk/default.aspx?page=1514 However, in light of superstition, and the fact that his own six sisters attended the ceremony, Evans agreed to call the mine Seven Sisters.http://www.welshcoalmines.co.uk/Photo.htm Anthracite coal fields always suffer from blow out, and on 10 November 1907, one occurred which killed 5 men. In 1923, there were 607 men working at Seven Sisters, producing from the Furnace Four Feet, Brass and Nine Feet Big Vein seams. During World War II the colliery was featured in an anti-Nazi film The Silent Village, made with the cooperation of the South Wales Miners Federation. During the 1950s geological problems and changing economic conditions took their toll, and in May 1963 the colliery closed and the pit filled in. The men who had been employed at the Seven Sisters were transferred to the nearby Blaenant Colliery, which closed in 1990. Village With the opening of the mine in 1875, a community grew up around it. The present day name of the village came from the fact that Evan Evans had one son and seven daughters, hence the \\"seven sisters\\". At its peak in 1945 the colliery employed over 759 men from the surrounding area. The first dwellings erected in the village were single storey buildings for the coal miners, named Brick Row, which are still in place today. More collieries were opened in the surrounding area, such as the demand for coal increased. Nant-y-Cafn or Dillwyn colliery was opened in 1884, Henllan Colliery 1911 and Brynteg Colliery and brickworks in 1885. All housing in the village prior to the 1930s was for coal miners, brick workers and railway employees. A junior school was opened in 1884 at a cost of ¬£530 for the school building and ¬£280 for the school house. 33 children appeared on the register for this year. Its first headmaster was Mr W.J. Thomas employed on an annual salary of ¬£52.One of the objects from the Seven Sisters Hoard In 1905, a mixed collection of bronze objects found much earlier in the Brynt√™g area, was recognized as being an important find. Held in the National Museum of Wales, they are known as \\"The Seven Sisters Hoard.\\" =The palace= In 1912, Evan Evans Bevan agreed to build a village hall, which on completion in 1914 became known as the \\"Palace.\\" Used for gathering and travelling drama shows, from 1916 it showed films. Purchased in 1925 by the Reading Room Committee, it became the Seven Sisters' Miners' Welfare Society, which later established a children's playing field, a football field and in 1935 the construction of an outdoor swimming pool, completed in 1932. In 1941 the Society purchased the 1926 institute and bowling green, constructed by Evan Evans Bevan. The Society was taken over by the National Coal Board on nationalisation in 1947.http://www.archivesnetworkwales.info/cgi- bin/anw/fulldesc_nofr?inst_id=35&coll;_id=11496&expand;= =Present day= The former colliery site now has the Canolfan sheltered housing complex, and the Ysticlau Park playing field. Some history of the village still remains, with the pit head winding gear sunk in the ground next to the site of the old colliery, and five pairs of preserved sections of railway line indicating the size of the enterprise. Although the railway still runs through the village, the station was removed and the line is at present freight only. Access to Neath is via the First Cymru 907 services to/from Coelbren; while the 158/X58 services run to Swansea's Quadrant Bus Station to/from Banwen. The former pit head baths were converted to an indoor swimming pool which was later converted into a multi-purpose Community Hall. Originally the colliery team, Seven Sisters RFC founded in 1897, are a WRU affiliated rugby union club. The village has as of 2019 a post office, small convenience shop, hairdressers, a cafe/fish and chip shop, a takeaway selling pizzas, kebabs and burgers and a small shop selling gifts.

The wider urban area, which includes neighbouring settlements, had a population of 50,658 in 2011. Historically in Glamorgan, the town is located on the River Neath, east northeast of Swansea. Etymology The town's English name ultimately derives from \\"Nedd\\" the original Welsh name for the River Neath and is known to be Celtic or Pre-Celtic. A meaning of shining or brilliant has been suggested, as has a link to the older Indo-European root *-nedi (simply meaning river). As such, the town may share its etymology with the town of Stratton, Cornwall and the River Nidd in Northern England.Weatherhill, Craig (2009) A Concise Dictionary of Cornish Place-names. Westport, Co. Mayo: Evertype; p. 65 History =Roman fort= The town is located at a ford of the River Neath and its strategic situation is evident by a number of Celtic hill forts, surrounding the town. The Romans also recognised the area's strategic importance and built an Auxiliary Fort on the river's Western bank around AD 74. Much of the site is on the grounds of Dwr-y-Felin Comprehensive School but archaeological digs have also found gate-towers that extended out beyond the fort's walls (a feature unique in Roman Britain) and a large Roman marching camp which would have accommodated thousands of troops.Nidum Roman dig in playing fields BBC Wales, 21 February 2011 These finds indicate some of the unusual measures taken by the Romans during the resistance of the native Silures and the fort at Neath was abandoned in around 125AD for fifteen years and again in around 170AD for a century before the final Roman withdrawal around 320AD. The Antonine Itinerary () names ' (or ) as one of nine places in Roman Wales. =Medieval period= St Illtyd visited the Neath area and established a settlement in what is now known as Llantwit on the northern edge of the town.

Neath Castle =Industrial and modern Neath= Neath was a market town that expanded with the arrival of the Industrial Revolution in the 18th century with new manufacturing industries of iron, steel and tinplate. The Mackworth family, who owned the Gnoll EstateBritton Manor were prominent in the town's industrial development. Coal was mined extensively in the surrounding valleys and the construction of canals and railways made Neath a major transportation centre and the Evans & Bevan families were major players in the local coal mining community as well as owning the Vale of Neath Brewery.Neath Brewery Silica was mined in the area of Pontneddfechan, after Quaker entrepreneur William Weston Young invented the blast furnace silica firebrick, later moving brick production from the works at to the Green in Neath. The town continued as a market trading centre with a municipal cattle market run by W.B.Trick. Industrial development continued throughout the 20th century with the construction by BP of a new petroleum refinery at . Admiral Lord Nelson stayed at the Castle Hotel en route to Milford Haven when the fleet was at anchor there. Lt. Lewis Roatley, the son of the landlord of the Castle Hotel, served as a Royal Marines officer with Nelson aboard in the Battle of Trafalgar.

The most significant gamma globulins are immunoglobulins (antibodies), although some immunoglobulins are not gamma globulins, and some gamma globulins are not immunoglobulins. Use as medical treatment Gamma globulin injections are usually given in an attempt to temporarily boost a patient's immunity against disease. Being a product derived from bone marrow and lymph gland cells, gamma globulin injections, along with blood transfusions and intravenous drug use, can pass hepatitis C to their recipients. Once hepatitis C was identified in 1989, blood banks began screening all blood donors for the presence of the virus in their bloodstream. However, since hepatitis C is known to have been present since at least the 1940s, a gamma globulin shot received prior to the early 1990s put the recipient at risk of being infected. Injections are most commonly used on patients having been exposed to hepatitis A or measles, or to make a kidney donor and a recipient compatible regardless of blood type or tissue match. Injections are also used to boost immunity in patients unable to produce gamma globulins naturally because of an immune deficiency, such as X-linked agammaglobulinemia and hyper IgM syndrome. Such injections are less common in modern medical practice than they were previously, and injections of gamma globulin previously recommended for travelers have largely been replaced by the use of hepatitis A vaccine. Gamma globulin infusions are also used to treat some immunological diseases, such as idiopathic thrombocytopenia purpura (ITP), a disease in which the platelets are being attacked by antibodies, leading to seriously low platelet counts. It appears that gamma globulin causes the spleen to ignore the antibody-tagged platelets, thus allowing them to survive and function. A recent clinical trial of gamma globulin in chronic fatigue syndrome patients had no recognizable benefit, while an older trial showed improvement. The success of this treatment remains uncertain. Another theory on how gamma globulin administration works in autoimmune disease is by overloading the mechanisms that degrade gamma globulins. Overloading the degradation mechanism causes the harmful gamma globulins to have a much shorter half of the life in sera. Intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) may be used in Kawasaki disease. Intravenous gamma globulin was FDA-approved in 2004 to reduce antibodies in a patient with kidney failure to allow that person to accept a kidney from a donor with a different blood type (ABO-incompatible), or who is an unacceptable tissue match. Stanley Jordan at Cedars-Sinai Medical Center in Los Angeles pioneered this treatment. Pathology An excess is known as hypergammaglobulinemia. A deficiency is known as hypogammaglobulinemia. A disease of gamma globulins is called a \\"gammopathy\\" (for example, in monoclonal gammopathy of undetermined significance).

As of the 2010 census it had a population of 1,466. It is named for the striking rock formation on the adjacent Catoctin Mountain, which was formed by the Potomac River cutting through the ridge in a water gap, a typical formation in the Appalachian Mountains. The formation is not visible from the town and can only be seen from boats on the river, or from the southern bank of the river in Virginia. History Oblique air photo of Point of Rocks, facing southwest Historic St. Paul's Episcopal Church, built in 1841 by enslaved men and women of the Duval Plantation and consecrated in 1843. Listed on the National Register of Historic Places. =Settlement and early history= For centuries before European settlers arrived in the Point of Rocks area, indigenous populations inhabited the region. The Piscataway Nation was one of the Native American cultures to live in Point of Rocks, inhabiting an island in the Potomac River today known as Heater's Island. Forced from their homelands in modern-day Prince George's County by English settlement in the mid-18th century, the Piscataway migrated to Heater's Island around 1699, though their population was severely decreased by an outbreak of smallpox in 1704. The Piscataways remained on the island for a few more years before migrating north into Pennsylvania and New York. About a decade after the Piscataway abandoned their settlement on Heater's Island, the first European settler in Point of Rocks, Arthur Nelson, received a patent for a tract of land called \\"Nelson's Island.\\" The Nelson Family retained their status as prominent landholders in Point of Rocks in the early-18th century, developing several plantations on which tobacco was grown. Commercial interests in the region led the Nelsons to petition for a road to be built connecting Frederick and \\"Nelson's Ferry,\\" the first English name assigned to the village that became Point of Rocks. This road was eventually constructed and became known as Ballenger Creek Pike. In the early-19th century, the arrival of the Chesapeake and Ohio (C&O;) Canal and the Baltimore and Ohio (B&O;) Railroad led to an increase in settlement and industry in the Point of Rocks area. The village became a temporary terminus for both the C&O; Canal and the B&O; Railroad in 1828 when the companies went to court to determine which would control the right of way through the narrow passage between the Potomac River and Catoctin Mountain immediately west of Point of Rocks. After six years of court battles, the companies agreed to compromise and share the right of way, the B&O; Railroad eventually constructing a tunnel through the mountain to broaden its lines through the narrow water gap. With the construction of the C&O; Canal and the B&O; Railroad and its strategic location on the Potomac River, Point of Rocks was poised to become a regional transportation hub and center of industrial activity. In 1835, Charles Johnson, the owner of the land on which Point of Rocks was built, had lots surveyed and streets laid out for a new town. =Slavery, Civil War, and Reconstruction= Captain Samuel C. Means From the earliest days of European settlement in Point of Rocks, forced labor through indentured servitude and enslavement of African Americans drove the local economy. Tobacco plantations in the fertile lands of the lower Monocacy Valley were operated based on the labor of enslaved men and women. The plantation owners also used their slaves to build houses, places of business, and public buildings, such as St. Paul's Episcopal Church, completed in 1841 using the labor of enslaved men and women from the Duval Plantation. Nearby Licksville, a small community located near Noland's Ferry crossing the Potomac River was the site of an active slave market. Situated on the border between Maryland and the seceded state of Virginia, Point of Rocks was the site of several small skirmishes and military actions during the Civil War. The B&O; Railroad and C&O; Canal were important targets for Confederate raiders across the Potomac River. In 1861, then Colonel Thomas J. \\"Stonewall\\" Jackson led a raid at Point of Rocks, shutting off the rail lines east of the town and capturing 56 locomotives and 300 rail cars. Neighboring Loudon County was home to several small pockets of Union supporters, including Quakers who lived in villages like Waterford and Lincoln who did not support secession or the Confederate cause for defending the institution of slavery. Point of Rocks became a haven for those families who were forced to flee Virginia. In 1862, Captain Samuel C. Means, a native of Waterford, Virginia, but then living in Point of Rocks where he was a merchant and the B&O; Railroad station manager, raised a cavalry unit called the Loudoun Rangers, the only organized unit from Virginia to fight for the Union. The Loudoun Rangers spent most of 1862 and 1863 fighting alongside Cole's Maryland Cavalry (the First Potomac Home Brigade) to protect the C&O; Canal and the B&O; Railroad from frequent Confederate raids. Cole's Maryland Cavalry encamped at Point of Rocks, occupying St. Paul's Episcopal Church where they burned the interior furnishings. Lt. Col. John S. Mosby and his 43rd Battalion of Virginia Cavalry, known as \\"Mosby's Raiders\\", crossed the Potomac and attached Union garrison forces at Point of Rocks in 1864 in a brief campaign called the \\"Calico Raid.\\" The area was also the scene of military maneuvers and brief skirmishes during Valley Campaigns of 1864 and the Battle of Monocacy on July 9, 1864. In the years after the Civil War, Point of Rocks remained a place of conflict. In 1879, James Carroll was lynched in Point of Rocks after being accused of breaking into the home of Richard Thomas and raping his wife. Having fled down the C&O; Canal towpath to Georgetown, Carroll was apprehended on April 16, 1879. While being transported to Frederick for trial, a mob swarmed the train as it approached the station in Point of Rocks, removed Carroll from police custody, and hanged him in an adjacent field. The death of Carroll, whose alleged crimes have never been proven or disproven, was one of three recorded lynchings to take place in Frederick County. =The Victorian Era= B&O; Railroad in 1873 In 1873, the B&O; Railroad opened its Metropolitan Branch, connecting Washington D.C. to its Old Main Line in a junction at Point of Rocks. A new station, which has become a noted town landmark, was erected the same year. The Gothic Revival styled brick building was designed by E. Francis Baldwin and is situated in the center of the junction of the two lines. Several other prominent structures were built in the town during the Victorian era, including the town's Methodist Church (1894), Holy Trinity Episcopal Church (1887, replaced in 1912), St. Luke's Lutheran Church (1889), and Masonic Temple (1898). =Recent history= In 2001 Duke Energy filed an application with the Maryland Public Service Commission to construct a power plant on the north edge of town. In November 2002, however, Duke officially canceled its proposal, though it retains property in the area.Maryland Public Service Commission. Baltimore, MD. \\"In the Matter of the Application of Duke Energy Frederick, LLC for a Certificate of Public Convenience and Necessity to Construct a 640-MW Generating Facility in Frederick County, Maryland.\\" Case No. 8891. June 18, 2001ff. The Point of Rocks railroad station was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1973, and St. Paul's Episcopal Church was listed in 1978. Flooding Older portions of the town are on the Potomac River floodplain and have been repeatedly inundated. An ongoing Federal Emergency Management Agency program to reduce flood insurance payouts has resulted in the purchase and demolition of a large portion of structures on the lowest-lying properties. Geography Point of Rocks is located in southern Frederick County, on the north bank of the Potomac River, and is bordered to the west by U.S. Route 15, which here runs along the eastern base of Catoctin Mountain. Via US 15 it is north to Frederick, the county seat, and south across the Potomac River to Leesburg, Virginia. Maryland Route 28 leads east from Point of Rocks through rural Frederick County and Montgomery County to Rockville. According to the U.S. Census Bureau, the Point of Rocks CDP has a total area of , all land. Infrastructure =Transportation= The community contains the Point of Rocks Bridge of U.S. Route 15 over the Potomac River into Virginia. The bridge is the first such crossing of the river upstream of the American Legion Memorial Bridge on I-495 in Montgomery County. The only other crossing between them is White's Ferry. Rail service through Point of Rocks began with the 1834 opening of the Baltimore and Ohio Railroad's main line, which ended at the next stop in Sandy Hook, Maryland, before the Harpers Ferry Crossing across the Potomac and into Virginia opened in 1839. Point of Rocks is a passenger station stop on the MARC Brunswick Line. The station, designed by Ephraim Francis Baldwin, was built by the Baltimore and Ohio (B&O;) Railroad and completed in 1876. Marking the junction between CSX's Metropolitan Subdivision (the current main line) and the Old Main Line Subdivision, it remains one of the former B&O;'s signature landmarks, and is a popular subject of railroad photography.

Saudi Aramco has both the world's second-largest proven crude oil reserves, at more than ,OPEC, Annual Statistical Bulletin 2016 and largest daily oil production of all oil producing companies. On 11 December 2019, the company's shares commenced trading on the Tadawul stock exchange.

Saudi Aramco operates the Ghawar Field, the world's largest onshore oil field, and the Safaniya Field, the world's largest offshore oil field.Aramco Overseas Company - About Saudi Aramco , aramcooverseas.com. Retrieved 11 November 2014. On 9 April 2019, Aramco issued bonds collectively valued at US$12 billion. Its first international bond issue received more than $100 billion in orders from foreign investors, which breaks all records for a bond issue by an emerging market entity. On Wednesday, 12 June 2019, Aramco reported its net income at $111.1 billion in 2018 compared to $75.9 billion in 2017, with total revenues at $355.9 billion in 2018. History Saudi Aramco's origins trace to the oil shortages of World War I and the exclusion of American companies from Mesopotamia by the United Kingdom and France under the San Remo Petroleum Agreement of 1920. The US administration at the time had popular support for an \\"Open Door policy\\", which Herbert Hoover, secretary of commerce, initiated in 1921. Standard Oil of California (SoCal) was among those US companies seeking new sources of oil from abroad. Through its subsidiary company, the Bahrain Petroleum Co. (BAPCO), SoCal struck oil in Bahrain in May 1932. This event heightened interest in the oil prospects of the Arabian mainland. On 29 May 1933, the Saudi Arabian government granted a concession to SoCal in preference to a rival bid from the Iraq Petroleum Co. The concession allowed SoCal to explore for oil in Saudi Arabia. SoCal assigned this concession to a wholly owned subsidiary, California-Arabian Standard Oil (CASOC). In 1936, with the company having had no success at locating oil, the Texas Oil Co. (Texaco) purchased a 50% stake of the concession. After four years of fruitless exploration, the first success came with the seventh drill site in Dhahran in 1938, a well referred to as Dammam No. 7. This well immediately produced over , giving the company confidence to continue. On 31 January 1944, the company name was changed from California-Arabian Standard Oil Co. to Arabian American Oil Co. (or Aramco). In 1948, Standard Oil of New Jersey (later known as Exxon) purchased 30% and Socony Vacuum (later Mobil) purchased 10% of the company, with SoCal and Texaco retaining 30% each. The newcomers were also shareholders in the Iraq Petroleum Co. and had to get the restrictions of the Red Line Agreement lifted in order to be free to enter into this arrangement. Aramco compound in Saudi Arabia, 1954 In 1949, ARAMCO had made incursions into the Emirate of Abu Dhabi (now part of the UAE), leading to a border dispute between Abu Dhabi and Saudi Arabia. In 1950, King Abdulaziz threatened to nationalize his country's oil facilities, thus pressuring Aramco to agree to share profits 50/50. A similar process had taken place with American oil companies in Venezuela a few years earlier. The American government granted US Aramco member companies a tax break known as the golden gimmick equivalent to the profits given to King Abdulaziz. In the wake of the new arrangement, the company's headquarters were moved from New York to Dhahran. In 1951, the company discovered the Safaniya Oil Field, the world's largest offshore field. In 1957, the discovery of smaller connected oil fields confirmed the Ghawar Field as the world's largest onshore field. In 1975, the Saudi Arabia second five-year economic plan included a Master Gas Plan. Natural gas would be used to generate power, rather than flaring the gas. The plan counted on using the associated gas, but by 1985, Aramco was able to include a billion standard cubic foot per day (Bscfd) of non-associated gas. This non-associated gas was produced from the Kuff Formation, which is a limestone 650 m below the oil producing Arab Zone. In 1994, Aramco discovered more non-associated gas in the deeper Jawf sandstone formation, and built plants in Hawiyah and Haradh to process it. This increased the capacity of the Master Gas System to 9.4 billion scfd. In 1973, following US support for Israel during the Yom Kippur War, the Saudi Arabian government acquired a 25% \\"participation interest\\" in Aramco's assets. It increased its participation interest to 60% in 1974 and acquired the remaining 40% interest in 1976. Aramco continued to operate and manage the former Aramco assets, including its concessionary interest in certain Saudi Arab oil fields, on behalf of the Saudi Arab Government until 1988. In November 1988, a royal decree created a new Saudi Arab company, the Saudi Arabian Oil Company, to take control of the former Aramco assets (or Saudi Aramco) and took the management and operations control of Saudi Arabia's oil and gas fields from Aramco and its partners. In 1989‚Äì90, high-quality oil and gas were discovered in three areas south of Riyadh: the Raghib area about 77 miles southeast of the capital. In Sept. 1990, after the start of the Gulf War, Aramco was expected to replace much of the oil production removed from the global market due to the embargo of Iraq and occupied Kuwait. This amounted to producing an extra 4.8 million barrels per day (Mbpd) to keep the global oil market stable. In addition, Aramco was expected to provide all of the coalition aviation and diesel needs. Aramco recommissioned 146 Harmaliyah, Khurais, and Ghawar oil wells with associated gas oil separation plants, and saltwater treatment pipeline, that had been mothballed during the 1980s oil price collapse. Daily production increased from 5.4 Mbpd in July to 8.5 Mbpd in Dec. 1990 after a three-month de-mothball effort. Starting in 1990, Aramco embarked on an expansion of crude oil sales in the Asian market. Agreements with Korea, the Philippines, and China resulted. By 2016, about 70% of Aramco's crude oil sales were to Asia. In May 2001, Saudi Arabia announced the Gas Initiative, which proposed forming 3 joint ventures with 8 IOCs for gas exploration on pure upstream acreage. Core Venture 1 included south Ghawar and north Rub' Al-Khali, Core Venture 2 included the Red Sea, while Core Venture 3 involved Shaybah and Kidan. In 2003, Royal Dutch Shell and Total S.A. formed a partnership with Saudi Aramco in Core Venture 3. In 2004, Core Venture 1 became three separate joint ventures with Saudi Aramco holding 20%, one with Lukoil, a second with Sinopec, and a third with Repsol. By 2004, Aramco was producing 8.6 million barrels per day (mbpd) out of a potential 10 mbpd. In 2005, Aramco launched a five-year plan to spend $50 billion to increase their daily capacity to 12.5 mbpd by increasing production and refining capacity and doubling the number of drilling rigs. In 2005, Saudi Aramco was the world's largest company with an estimated market value of $781 billion. In June 2008, in response to crude oil prices exceeding $130 a barrel, Aramco announced it would increase production to 9.7 million barrels per day (mbpd). Then as prices plummeted, Aramco stated in Jan. 2009, that it would reduce production to 7.7 mbpd. In 2011, Saudi Aramco started production from the Karan Gas Field, with an output of more than 400 million scf per day. In January 2016, the Deputy Crown Prince of Saudi Arabia, Mohammad bin Salman Al Saud, announced he was considering listing shares of the state-owned company, and selling around 5% of them in order to build a large sovereign fund. Wall Street Journal reported in September 2018, Aramco was considering a $1 billion venture-capital fund to invest in international technology firms. In June 2019, a report by Financial Times claimed that Aramco had been bearing the ministry-related expenses; boosting the finance ministry budget allocation. It also included Energy Minister Khalid Al Falih‚Äôs company-related and diplomatic trips, as well as his stays in luxurious hotels. However, an ally mentioned that Falih‚Äôs policies have delivered additional oil revenues that far exceeded his expenses. In September 2019, Saudi Arabia appointed Yasir Al-Rumayyan as the Chairman of Aramco. Al-Rumayyan became head of the country‚Äôs sovereign wealth fund by replacing Khalid Al-Falih, who was holding the position since 2015. In 2020, Saudi Aramco acquired a 70% share in SABIC, a chemicals manufacturing company. In June 2020, Saudi Aramco laid off nearly 500 of its more than 70,000 employees, while the global energy firms were reducing their workforce due to the COVID-19 pandemic. However, majority of the workers who lost their job at Aramco were foreigners. On August 9, 2020, Saudi Aramco reported a 50 per cent fall in net income for the first half of its financial year, as demand for oil and prices continued to fall due to the coronavirus crisis. This came after Saudi Aramco lost its title as the world‚Äôs largest listed company by market capitalization to Apple, on July 31, 2020. =2012 cyber attack= Aramco computers were attacked by a virus on 15 August 2012. The following day Aramco announced that none of the infected computers were part of the network directly tied to oil production, and that the company would soon resume full operations. Hackers claimed responsibility for the spread of the computer virus. The virus hit companies within the oil and energy sectors. A group named \\"Cutting Sword of Justice\\" claimed responsibility for an attack on 30,000 Saudi Aramco workstations, causing the company to spend months restoring their services. The group later indicated that the Shamoon virus had been used in the attack. Due to this attack, the main site of Aramco went down and a message came to the home page apologizing to customers. Computer security specialists said that \\"The attack, known as Shamoon, is said to have hit 'at least one organization' in the sector. Shamoon is capable of wiping files and rendering several computers on a network unusable.\\" Richard Clarke suggests the attack was part of Iran's retaliation for the U.S. involvement in Stuxnet.in Zero Days, 1:43 Security researcher Chris Kubecka, who helped the company establish security after the attack, detailed the level of sophistication in her Black Hat USA 2015 presentation and episode 30 of Darknet Diaries. = 2019 drone attack = On 14 September 2019, there was a drone attack on two Saudi Aramco plants: the Abqaiq oil processing facility and Khurais oil field. Houthi rebels claimed responsibility for the attack. The attack cut 5.7 million barrels per day (bpd) of Saudi crude output, over 5 percent of the world's supply. There were discussions by Saudi Arabian officials on postponing Aramco's IPO, because the attacks \\"sidelined more than half of the kingdom's output\\" of oil. = 2019 Initial public offering (IPO) = Since around 2018, Saudi Arabia had been considering to put a portion of Saudi Aramco's ownership, up to 5%, onto public trading via a staged initial public offering (IPO), as to reduce the cost to the government of running the company. While the IPO had been vetted by major banks, the IPO was delayed over concerns of Aramco's corporate structure through 2018 into 2019. The September 2019 drone attacks on Aramco's facilities also delayed the onset of the IPO. Aramco announced on Sunday 3 November 2019 its plan to list 1.5% of its value as an IPO on the Tadawul stock exchange. On November 9, 2019, Saudi Aramco released a 600-page prospectus giving details of the IPO. According to the specifications provided, up to 0.5 per cent of the shares were locked for individual retail investors. On 4 December 2019, Saudi Aramco priced its offering at 32 Saudi riyal (approximately $8.53) per share. The company generated subscriptions of total amount equals $119 billion representing 456% of total offer shares. It raised $25.6 billion in its IPO, making it the world's largest IPO to date, succeeding that of the Alibaba Group in 2014. The company commenced trading on Tadawul on 11 December 2019, with shares rising 10% to 35.2 riyals, giving the company a market capitalisation of about $1.88 trillion, and making Saudi Aramco the world's largest listed company. Operation Exploration Headquarters of Aramco Services Co. in Houston Saudi Aramco is headquartered in Dhahran, but its operations span the globe and include exploration, production, refining, chemicals, distribution and marketing.

Saudi Aramco has been exploring for oil and gas reservoirs since 1982. Most of this process takes place at the EXPEC Advanced Research Center. Originally, Saudi Aramco used Cray Supercomputers (CRAY-1M) in its EXPEC Advanced Research Center (ECC)Cray FAQ Part 3: FAQ kind of items , spikynorman.dsl.pipex.com. Retrieved 11 November 2014. to assist in processing the colossal quantity of data obtained during exploration and in 2001, ECC decided to use Linux clusters as a replacement for the decommissioned Cray systems. ECC installed a new supercomputing system in late 2009 with a disk storage capacity of 1,050 terabytes (i.e, exceeding one petabyte), the largest storage installation in Saudi Aramco's history to support its exploration in the frontier areas and the Red Sea.\\"Saudi EXPEC Computer Center Deploys Supercomputer\\", 24 February 2010. Retrieved 11 November 2014. =Refining and chemicals= While the company did not originally plan on refining oil, the Saudi government wished to have only one company dealing with oil production. Therefore, on 1 July 1993, the government issued a royal decree merging Saudi Aramco with Samarec, the country's oil refining company. The following year, a Saudi Aramco subsidiary acquired a 40% equity interest in Petron Corporation, the largest crude oil refiner and marketer in the Philippines. Since then, Saudi Aramco has taken on the responsibility of refining oil and distributing it in the country. In 2008, Saudi Aramco sold its entire stake to the Ashmore Group, a London-listed investment group. Ashmore acquired an additional 11% when it made a required tender offer to other shareholders. By July 2008, Ashmore, through its SEA Refinery Holdings B.V., had a 50.57 percent of Petron's stock. Ashmore's payment was made in December 2008. In December 2008, Ashmore acquired PNOC's 40% stake. In the same month, San Miguel Corporation (SMC) said it was in the final stages of negotiations with the Ashmore Group to buy up to 50.1 percent of Petron. In 2010, SMC acquired majority control of Petron Corporation. Currently, Saudi Aramco's refining capacity is (International joint and equity ventures: , domestic joint ventures: 1,900 mpbd, and wholly owned domestic operations: .) Saudi Aramco's downstream operations are shifting emphasis to integrate refineries with petrochemical facilities. Their first venture into it is with Petro Rabigh, which is a joint venture with Sumitomo Chemical Co. that began in 2005 on the coast of the Red Sea. In order to become a global leader in chemicals, Aramco will acquire 50% of Royal Dutch Shell's stake in their refiner in Saudi Arabia for $631 million.

It used to have its own created subsidiary company, Vela International Marine, which was merged with Bahri company, to handle shipping to North America, Europe, and Asia. It is a stakeholder in the King Salman Global Maritime Industries Complex, a shipyard that will be the largest in the world when complete. = Global investment = Saudi Aramco expanded its presence worldwide to include the three major global energy markets of Asia, Europe, and North America. In April 2019, Aramco has signed a deal to acquire a 13% stake in South Korean oil refiner Hyundai Oilbank for $1.24 billion. Moreover, on 11 April 2019, Aramco signed an agreement with Poland‚Äôs leading oil refiner PKN Orlen to supply it with Arabian Crude Oil. = Liquefied natural gas = Aramco is planning to be a major producer of liquefied natural gas (LNG) in the world. It sold its first cargo of LNG from Singapore to an Indian buyer. The company is looking globally for potential joint ventures and partnerships to achieve its goal regarding LNG market. Saudization The original concession agreement included Article 23; as Ali Al-Naimi pointed out, this was a \\"key building block in the shaping of Saudi society for decades to come.\\" It reads, \\"The enterprise under this contract shall be directed and supervised by Americans who shall employ Saudi nationals as far as practicable, and in so far as the company can find suitable Saudi employees it will not employ other nationals.\\" The first company school was started in May 1940 in the Al-Khobar home of Hijji bin Jassim, company interpreter, translator and first instructor. Al-Naimi pointed out, \\"From the beginning, the development of Aramco was directly tied to the betterment of Saudi Arabia.\\" Another school was located in Dhahran in 1941, and was called the Jebel School. Boys hired into entry-level positions attended at 7 AM for four hours, followed by four hours of work in the afternoon. In 1950, Aramco built schools for 2,400 students. In 1959, Aramco sent the first group of Saudi students to college in the States. In 1970, Aramco started hiring its first high school graduates, and in 1979 started offering college scholarships. In 1965, Zafer H. Husseini was named the first Saudi manager and in 1974, Faisal Al-Bassam was named the first Saudi vice president. One of the early students was Al-Naimi, who was named the first Saudi president of Aramco in Nov. 1983. As Al-Naimi states, \\"The oil company committed itself to developing qualified Saudis to become fully educated and trained industry professionals.\\" Al-Naimi acknowledged Thomas Barger's championing of Saudization, \\"You, of all of Aramco's leaders, had the greatest vision when you supported the training effort of Saudi Arab employees during its early days. That visionary support and effort is bearing fruit now and many executive positions are filled by Saudis because of that effort.\\" In 1943, 1,600 Saudis were employed at Aramco, but by 1987, nearly two-thirds of Aramco's 43,500 strong workforce were Saudis. In 1988, Al-Naimi became CEO and Hisham Nazer became chairman, the first Saudis to hold those positions. The \\"pinnacle of Saudization\\" occurred when the Shaybah oil field came on line in July 1998, after a three-year effort by a team consisting of 90% Saudis. The Aramco of 2016 still maintained an expatriate workforce of about 15%, so Aramco can, in the words of Al-Naimi, \\"be sure it is getting access to the latest innovations and technical expertise.\\" Saudi Aramco has emitted 59.26 billion tonnes of carbon dioxide equivalent since it began operations, accounting for 4.38% of worldwide anthropogenic emissions since 1965. In a letter sent to nine international banks reportedly hired by Aramco to assist it in arranging its $2tn market debut, 10 green groups warned about the listing causing a highly possible hindrance in the fight against greenhouse gas emissions and human rights abuses committed by the Saudi regime. On 6 November 2019, Saudi Aramco joined the World Bank's initiative to reduce gas flaring to zero by 2030. The firm reported flaring of less than 1 per cent of its total raw gas production in the first half of 2019.

The most common indications for a serum protein electrophoresis test are to diagnose or monitor multiple myeloma, a monoclonal gammopathy of uncertain significance (MGUS), or further investigate a discrepancy between a low albumin and a relatively high total protein. Unexplained bone pain, anemia, proteinuria, chronic kidney disease, and hypercalcemia are also signs of multiple myeloma, and indications for SPE. Blood must first be collected, usually into an airtight vial or syringe. Electrophoresis is a laboratory technique in which the blood serum (the fluid portion of the blood after the blood has clotted) is applied to an acetate membrane soaked in a liquid buffer., to a buffered agarose gel matrix, or into liquid in a capillary tube, and exposed to an electric current to separate the serum protein components into five major fractions by size and electrical charge: serum albumin, alpha-1 globulins, alpha-2 globulins, beta 1 and 2 globulins, and gamma globulins. Acetate or gel electrophoresis Proteins are separated by both electrical forces and electroendoosmostic forces. The net charge on a protein is based on the sum charge of its amino acids, and the pH of the buffer. Proteins are applied to a solid matrix such as an agarose gel, or a cellulose acetate membrane in a liquid buffer, and electric current is applied. Proteins with a negative charge will migrate towards the positively charged anode. Albumin has the most negative charge, and will migrate furthest towards the anode. Endoosmotic flow is the movement of liquid towards the cathode, which causes proteins with a weaker charge to move backwards from the application site. Gamma proteins are primarily separated by endoosmotic forces. Capillary electrophoresis In capillary electrophoresis, there is no solid matrix. Proteins are separated primarily by strong electroendoosmotic forces. The sample is injected into a capillary with a negative surface charge. A high current is applied, and negatively charged proteins such as albumin try to move towards the anode. Liquid buffer flows towards the cathode, and drags proteins with a weaker charge. Serum protein fractions Normal serum protein electrophoresis diagram with legend of different zones. Serum protein electrophoresis normal results =Albumin= Albumin is the major fraction in a normal SPEP. A fall of 30% is necessary before the decrease shows on electrophoresis. Usually a single band is seen. Heterozygous individuals may produce bisalbuminemia ‚Äì two equally staining bands, the product of two genes. Some variants give rise to a wide band or two bands of unequal intensity but none of these variants is associated with disease. Increased anodic mobility results from the binding of bilirubin, nonesterified fatty acids, penicillin and acetylsalicylic acid, and occasionally from tryptic digestion in acute pancreatitis. Absence of albumin, known as analbuminaemia, is rare. A decreased level of albumin, however, is common in many diseases, including liver disease, malnutrition, malabsorption, protein-losing nephropathy and enteropathy. =Albumin ‚Äì alpha-1 interzone= Even staining in this zone is due to alpha-1 lipoprotein (high density lipoprotein ‚Äì HDL). Decrease occurs in severe inflammation, acute hepatitis, and cirrhosis. Also, nephrotic syndrome can lead to decrease in albumin level; due to its loss in the urine through a damaged leaky glomerulus. An increase appears in severe alcoholics and in women during pregnancy and in puberty. The high levels of AFP that may occur in hepatocellular carcinoma may result in a sharp band between the albumin and the alpha-1 zone. =Alpha-1 zone= Orosomucoid and antitrypsin migrate together but orosomucoid stains poorly so alpha 1 antitrypsin (AAT) constitutes most of the alpha-1 band. Alpha-1 antitrypsin has an SG group and thiol compounds may be bound to the protein altering their mobility. A decreased band is seen in the deficiency state. It is decreased in the nephrotic syndrome and absence could indicate possible alpha 1-antitrypsin deficiency. This eventually leads to emphysema from unregulated neutrophil elastase activity in the lung tissue. The alpha-1 fraction does not disappear in alpha 1-antitrypsin deficiency, however, because other proteins, including alpha-lipoprotein and orosomucoid, also migrate there. As a positive acute phase reactant, AAT is increased in acute inflammation. Bence Jones protein may bind to and retard the alpha-1 band. =Alpha-1 ‚Äì alpha-2 interzone= Two faint bands may be seen representing alpha 1-antichymotrypsin and vitamin D binding protein. These bands fuse and intensify in early inflammation due to an increase in alpha 1-antichymotrypsin, an acute phase protein. =Alpha-2 zone= This zone consists principally of alpha-2 macroglobulin (AMG or A2M) and haptoglobin. There are typically low levels in haemolytic anaemia (haptoglobin is a suicide molecule which binds with free haemoglobin released from red blood cells and these complexes are rapidly removed by phagocytes). Haptoglobin is raised as part of the acute phase response, resulting in a typical elevation in the alpha-2 zone during inflammation. A normal alpha-2 and an elevated alpha-1 zone is a typical pattern in hepatic metastasis and cirrhosis. Haptoglobin/haemaglobin complexes migrate more cathodally than haptoglobin as seen in the alpha-2 ‚Äì beta interzone. This is typically seen as a broadening of the alpha-2 zone. Alpha-2 macroglobulin may be elevated in children and the elderly. This is seen as a sharp front to the alpha-2 band. AMG is markedly raised (10-fold increase or greater) in association with glomerular protein loss, as in nephrotic syndrome. Due to its large size, AMG cannot pass through glomeruli, while other lower-molecular weight proteins are lost. Enhanced synthesis of AMG accounts for its absolute increase in nephrotic syndrome. Increased AMG is also noted in rats with no albumin indicating that this is a response to low albumin rather than nephrotic syndrome itself AMG is mildly elevated early in the course of diabetic nephropathy. =Alpha-2 - beta interzone= Cold insoluble globulin forms a band here which is not seen in plasma because it is precipitated by heparin. There are low levels in inflammation and high levels in pregnancy. Beta lipoprotein forms an irregular crenated band in this zone. High levels are seen in type II hypercholesterolaemia, hypertriglyceridemia, and in the nephrotic syndrome. =Beta zone= Transferrin and beta-lipoprotein (LDL) comprises the beta-1. Increased beta-1 protein due to the increased level of free transferrin is typical of iron deficiency anemia, pregnancy, and oestrogen therapy. Increased beta-1 protein due to LDL elevation occurs in hypercholesterolemia. Decreased beta-1 protein occurs in acute or chronic inflammation. Beta-2 comprises C3 (complement protein 3). It is raised in the acute phase response. Depression of C3 occurs in autoimmune disorders as the complement system is activated and the C3 becomes bound to immune complexes and removed from serum. Fibrinogen, a beta-2 protein, is found in normal plasma but absent in normal serum. Occasionally, blood drawn from heparinized patients does not fully clot, resulting in a visible fibrinogen band between the beta and gamma globulins. =Beta-gamma interzone= C-reactive protein is found in between the beta and gamma zones producing beta/gamma fusion. IgA has the most anodal mobility and typically migrates in the region between the beta and gamma zones also causing a beta/gamma fusion in patients with cirrhosis, respiratory infection, skin disease, or rheumatoid arthritis (increased IgA). Fibrinogen from plasma samples will be seen in the beta gamma region. Fibrinogen, a beta-2 protein, is found in normal plasma but absent in normal serum. Occasionally, blood drawn from heparinized patients does not fully clot, resulting in a visible fibrinogen band between the beta and gamma globulins. =Gamma zone= The immunoglobulins or antibodies are generally the only proteins present in the normal gamma region. Of note, any protein migrating in the gamma region will be stained and appear on the gel, which may include protein contaminants, artifacts, or certain medications. Depending on whether an agarose or capillary method is used, interferences vary. Immunoglobulins consist of heavy chains (IgA, IgM, IgG, IgE and IgD) and light chains (kappa and lambda). A normal gamma zone should appear as a smooth 'blush', or smear, with no asymmetry or sharp peaks. The gamma globulins may be elevated (hypergammaglobulinemia), decreased (hypogammaglobulinaemia), or have an abnormal peak or peaks. Note that immunoglobulins may also be found in other zones; IgA typically migrates in the beta-gamma zone, and in particular, pathogenic immunoglobulins may migrate anywhere, including the alpha regions. Hypogammaglobulinaemia is easily identifiable as a \\"slump\\" or decrease in the gamma zone. It is normal in infants. It is found in patients with X-linked agammaglobulinemia. IgA deficiency occurs in 1:500 of the population, as is suggested by a pallor in the gamma zone. Of note, hypogammaglobulinema may be seen in the context of MGUS or multiple myeloma. If the gamma zone shows an increase the first step in interpretation is to establish if the region is narrow or wide. A broad \\"swell-like\\" manner (wide) indicates polyclonal immunoglobulin production. If it is elevated in an asymmetric manner or with one or more peaks or narrow \\"spikes\\" it could indicate clonal production of one or more immunoglobulins, Polyclonal gammopathy is indicated by a \\"swell- like\\" elevation in the gamma zone, which typically indicates a non-neoplastic condition (although is not exclusive to non-neoplastic conditions). The most common causes of polyclonal hypergammaglobulinaemia detected by electrophoresis are severe infection, chronic liver disease, rheumatoid arthritis, systemic lupus erythematosus and other connective tissue diseases. A narrow spike is suggestive of a monoclonal gammopathy, also known as a restricted band, or \\"M-spike\\". To confirm that the restricted band is an immunoglobulin, follow up testing with immunofixation, or immunodisplacement/immunosubtraction (capillary methods) is performed. Therapeutic monoclonal antibodies monoclonal antibodies (mAb), also migrate in this region and may be misinterpreted as a monoclonal gammopathy, and may also be identified by immunofixation or immunodisplacement/immunosubtraction as they are structurally comparable to human immunoglobulins. The most common cause of a restricted band is an MGUS (monoclonal gammopathy of uncertain significance), which, although a necessary precursor, only rarely progresses to multiple myeloma. (On average, 1%/year.) Typically, a monoclonal gammopathy is malignant or clonal in origin, Myeloma being the most common cause of IgA and IgG spikes. chronic lymphatic leukaemia and lymphosarcoma are not uncommon and usually give rise to IgM paraproteins. Note that up to 8% of healthy geriatric patients may have a monoclonal spike. Waldenstr√∂m's macroglobulinaemia (IgM), monoclonal gammopathy of undetermined significance (MGUS), amyloidosis, plasma cell leukemia and solitary plasmacytomas also produce an M-spike. Oligoclonal gammopathy is indicated by one or more discrete clones. Lysozyme may be seen as a band cathodal to gamma in myelomonocytic leukaemia in which it is released from tumour cells.

Although he did not invent the guillotine and opposed the death penalty, his name became an eponym for it. The actual inventor of the prototype was a man named Tobias Schmidt, working with the king's physician, Antoine Louis. Early life and education Guillotin was born on 28 May 1738 in Saintes, France, the second son of Joseph-Alexandre Guillotin and Catherine Agatha Martin. Legend has it that he was born prematurely because his mother was in distress after hearing the screams of a man being tortured to death on the breaking wheel. Guillotin's early education was by the Jesuits in Bordeaux and he earned a Master of Arts degree at the College of Aquitaine of the University of Bordeaux in December 1761. The essay that he wrote to earn the degree impressed the Jesuits so much that they invited him to become a professor of literature at the Irish College in Bordeaux. However, he left after a few years and travelled to Paris to study medicine, becoming a pupil of Antoine Petit. He gained a diploma from the faculty at Reims in 1768 and his doctorate at the School of Medicine in Paris in 1770, which also gave him the title of Doctor-Regent. This allowed him to teach medicine in Paris. Career In Paris, Guillotin became a well-known physician. By 1775, he was concerned with issues of torture and death. That year, he wrote a memo proposing that criminals be used as subjects in medical experiments. Although he recognised that as cruel, he considered it preferable to being put to death. In 1784, when Franz Mesmer began to publicize his theory of \\"animal magnetism\\", which was considered offensive by many, Louis XVI appointed a commission to investigate it and Guillotin was appointed a member, along with Jean Sylvain Bailly, Antoine Laurent de Jussieu, Antoine Lavoisier, and Benjamin Franklin. The commission declared Mesmer to be a fraud, and this put Guillotin in the public eye. =Political career and guillotine= In December 1788, Guillotin drafted a pamphlet entitled Petition of the Citizens Living in Paris, concerning the proper constitution of the States-General. The French parliament attempted to suppress his pamphlet and summoned him to give an account of his opinions, but the crowd during his testimony was very much in support of him, and he was released, which served to increase his popularity. On 2 May 1789, he became one of 10 Paris deputies in the Estates-General of 1789 and was secretary to the body from June 1789 to October 1791. On 20 June 1789, the National Assembly, as the members were now calling themselves, found itself locked out of its chamber. Guillotin suggested they reconvene in a nearby jeu de paume court, where the members swore the Tennis Court Oath, vowing \\"not to separate and to reassemble wherever circumstances require, until the Constitution of the kingdom is established\\". As a member of the assembly, Guillotin initially directed his attention towards medical reform. As a member of the Poverty Committee, he toured the H√¥tel-Dieu and contributed to the report that exposed the unsanitary conditions there. He also became first chair of the Health Committee and submitted a bill for medical reform in 1791. At the same time, he was also concerned with criminal law reform. His experiences as a doctor had led him to oppose capital punishment: at first, he attempted to abolish it, but was unsuccessful. At that time, beheading in France was typically by axe or sword, which did not always cause immediate death. Additionally, beheading was reserved for the nobility, while commoners were typically hanged, which could take a long time, as the techniques whereby the victim's neck was broken by the noose had not yet been invented. Other methods included burning at the stake, the breaking wheel, death by boiling, and dismemberment. Guillotin realised that, if he could not eliminate executions, he could at least make them more humane. On 10 October 1789, he proposed that \\"the criminal shall be decapitated; this will be done solely by means of a simple mechanism.\\" The \\"mechanism\\" was defined as \\"a machine that beheads painlessly\\". His proposal appeared in the Royalist periodical, Les Actes des Ap√¥tres. In all, Guillotin proposed six articles: # All punishments for the same class of crime shall be the same, regardless of the criminal (i.e., there would be no privilege for the nobility) # When the death sentence is applied, it will be by decapitation, carried out by a machine # The family of the guilty party will not suffer any legal discrimination # It will be illegal to anyone to reproach the guilty party's family about his/her punishment # The property of the convicted shall not be confiscated # The bodies of those executed shall be returned to the family if so requested Guillotin assumed that, if a fair system was established where the only method of capital punishment was by mechanical decapitation, then the public would feel more appreciative of their rights. Despite this proposal, Guillotin was opposed to the death penalty, and hoped that a more humane and less painful method of execution would be the first step towards total abolition. He also hoped that, as the decapitation machine would kill quickly without prolonged suffering, this would reduce the size and enthusiasm of crowds that often witnessed executions. On 1 December 1789, Guillotin made a remark during a follow-up speech to the Assembly about capital punishment. He was quoted (or possibly misquoted) as saying, \\"Now, with my machine, I cut off your head in the twinkling of an eye, and you never feel it!\\" The statement quickly became a popular joke, and a few days after the debate a comic song about Guillotin and \\"his\\" machine circulated, forever tying his name to it, despite the fact that he was not at all involved in its design or construction. The Moniteur of 18 December 1789 deplored the joking but repeated Guillotin's \\"twinkling of an eye\\" statement for posterity. The articles were fairly controversial as the rights of the criminals and their families had not previously been considered, but they were accepted over the course of several years, with the \\"decaptation by simple machine\\" one finally being accepted on 3 June 1791, with the result that his proposals became law on 20 March 1792. Meanwhile, the Assembly had commissioned Antoine Louis to build such a device. His proposal was presented on 17 March, and the first executions using it took place on 25 April 1792. However, by October 1791, Guillotin had already retired from the Assembly, returning to practise medicine. During the Reign of Terror, he moved to Arras to become the director of the military hospital there, returning to Paris a year later. Towards the end of the Reign of Terror, a letter from the Comte de M√©r√© to Guillotin fell into the hands of the public prosecutor, Fouquier- Tinville in which the Count, who was to be executed, commended his wife and children to Guillotin's care. The authorities demanded Guillotin inform them of the whereabouts of the Count's wife and children. As Guillotin either would not or could not give the information, he was arrested and imprisoned. He was freed from prison in the general amnesty of 9 Thermidor (27 July) 1794 after Robespierre fell from power. In November 1795, a letter was published in the Moniteur claiming that the guillotine's victims were still alive. Guillotin was shocked, and for the remainder of his life, he deeply regretted that the machine was named after him. His continued efforts to abolish the death penalty were hampered by the widespread belief that the person who proposed using a decapitation machine to carry out executions must surely be in favour of it. =Resumption of medical career= Guillotin became one of the first French doctors to support Edward Jenner's discovery of vaccination, and in 1805 was the chairman of the Central Vaccination Committee in Paris. He also founded one of the precursors of the National Academy of Medicine. Personal life =Family= The association with the guillotine so embarrassed Guillotin's family that they petitioned the French government to rename it; when the government refused, they instead changed their own family name. By coincidence, a person named Guillotin was indeed executed by the guillotinehe was J.M.V. Guillotin, a doctor of Lyon. This coincidence may have contributed to erroneous statements that J-I. Guillotin was put to death on the machine that bears his name; however, in reality, Guillotin died at home in Paris in 1814 of natural causes, aged 75, specifically from a carbuncle,Richard Gordon, The Alarming History of Medicine: Amusing Anecdotes from Hippocrates to Heart Transplants, New York: St. Martin‚Äôs Press, 1993. p. 225. and is now buried in the P√®re-Lachaise Cemetery in Paris. He was married to Louise Saugrain, sister of the physician and chemist Antoine Saugrain. =Freemasonry= Joseph Guillotin was initiated into Freemasonry, in 1765 at \\"La Parfaite Union\\" lodge in Angoul√™me. Very active as a mason, he joined several other lodges. As a deputy of the Grand Lodge from 1772 he took part in the birth of the Grand Orient of France and attended all its conventions until 1790. In 1773, he became Worshipful Master of the lodge \\"La Concorde Fraternelle\\" in Paris. In 1776, he founded the \\"La V√©rit√©\\" lodge and often attended Les Neuf S≈ìurs.Dictionnaire universelle de la Franc-Ma√ßonnerie, page 352 (Marc de Jode, Monique Cara and Jean-Marc Cara, ed. Larousse, 2011) In modern fiction Guillotin features in Andrew Miller's Costa prize-winning novel Pure and in the Vampire Dawn series for teenage emerging readers by Anne Rooney. He is also a primary character in the 1992 novel Dr Guillotine, written by the actor Herbert Lom.

Cutting a hole in the ice to check the water conditions Checking water conditions through a small hole in the ice Cutting the ice hole with chainsaws Ice diving is a type of penetration diving where the dive takes place under ice. Because diving under ice places the diver in an overhead environment typically with only a single entry/exit point, it requires special procedures and equipment. Ice diving is done for purposes of recreation, scientific research, public safety (usually search and rescue/recovery) and other professional or commercial reasons. The most obvious hazards of ice diving are getting lost under the ice, hypothermia, and regulator failure due to freezing. Scuba divers are generally tethered for safety. This means that the diver wears a harness to which a line is secured, and the other end of the line is secured above the surface and monitored by an attendant. Surface supplied equipment inherently provides a tether, and reduces the risks of regulator first stage freezing as the first stage can be managed by the surface team, and the breathing gas supply is less limited. For the surface support team, the hazards include freezing temperatures and falling through thin ice.  Procedures  Whether ice diving inherently constitutes technical diving is debated within the recreational diving community. For the professional diver it is a high risk environment requiring additional safety measures. Ice diving is a team diving activity because each diver's lifeline requires a . This person is responsible for paying out and taking in line so that the diver does not get tangled, and for rope signal communications with the diver. Professional teams will also require a and diving supervisor. Under some circumstances a guide line can be used as a reference for the divers to find the hole after the dive or in an emergency in a similar way to cave diving or wreck penetration instead of a lifeline. In these cases the divers should be competent in procedures for diving with a guideline. Polar diving experience has shown that buoyancy control is a critical skill affecting safety. Typical procedure for a scuba dive under ice: * A snow shovel is used to clear the snow and ice from the area. * An ice saw or a chain saw is used to cut a hole in the ice. * A weatherproof area is used for the divers to suit up. * The diver and tender on the surface are connected by a rope lifeline and harness. The harness is typically put on over the dry suit but under the BC or other buoyancy device so that the diver remains tethered even if he or she must remove the air cylinder or buoyancy control device. The harness fits over the shoulders and around the back such that the tender on the surface can, in an emergency, haul an unconscious diver back to the hole. The harness should not be able to slide up or down the diver's torso when pulled in line with the body. * Rope signals or voice communications systems must be used. * A roped standby diver is ready on the surface. * One or two divers may dive at the same time from the same hole, each with his or her own rope. Using two ropes runs little risk of getting tangled together, but using three significantly increases this risk. * If the regulator free-flows and freezes, the diver should close it down and switch to the backup, and terminate the dive. * When diving in pack ice, the surface team must constantly monitor ice movement to ensure that the exit is not compromised. * The diver must ensure that there is always a positive indication of the route to the exit area. A tether to a surface tender is usually preferable as it can be used to communicate, but if this is not practicable a reel and distance line is an alternative. * The risk of attack by predators and aggressive wildlife should be considered. Polar bear, walrus, and leopard seal are potential hazards within their ranges. * Gas management for an overhead environment is appropriate. *Deployment of a single tethered scuba diver is a reasonably safe alternative to free-swimming buddy team diving. The tethered scuba diver is equipped with a full-face mask with voice communications, high capacity scuba air supply, and an independent emergency air supply. A lifeline with communications cable is secured to a body harness on the diver and is handled by a surface tender who is in constant voice communication with the diver. A similarly equipped standby diver is available on the surface.  Equipment  Since diving under the ice takes place in cold climates, there is typically a large amount of equipment required. Besides each person's clothing and exposure-protection requirements, including spare mitts and socks, there is basic scuba gear, back-up scuba gear, tools to cut a hole in the ice, snow removal tools, safety gear, some type of shelter, lines, and refreshments required. The diver can use a weight harness, integrated weight buoyancy control device, or a weight belt with two buckles on it so the weights can not be accidentally released which would cause a run-away ascent into the ice sheet. Dry suits with adequate thermal undergarments are standard environmental protection for ice diving, though in some cases thick wetsuits may suffice. Hoods, boots and gloves are also worn. Full-face masks can provide more protection for the divers' facial skin. =Exposure suits= Because of the water temperature (between 4 ¬∞C and 0 ¬∞C in fresh water, approximately -1.9 ¬∞C for normal salinity sea water), exposure suits are mandatory. * Pre- and post-dive thermal protection is critical for safety and diver function. * Hand thermal protection is important to retain functionality and prevent cold injury. * The diver should be kept warm throughout the dive, but active rewarming by external heating and heavy exercise should be avoided directly after the dive, as the effect of cold on risk of decompression sickness is not fully understood. Some consider a dry suit mandatory; however, a thick wetsuit may be sufficient for hardier divers. A wetsuit can be pre- heated by pouring warm water into the suit. A hood and gloves (recommended three-finger mitts or dry gloves with rings) are necessary, and dry suit divers have the option of using hoods and gloves that keep their head and hands dry. Some prefer to use a full face diving mask to essentially eliminate any contact with the cold water. The biggest drawback to using a wet suit is the chilling effect on the diver caused by the water evaporating from the suit after a dive. This can be reduced by using a heated shelter. =Scuba equipment= A diving regulator suitable for cold-water is used. All regulators have a risk of freezing and free flowing, but some models fare better than others. Environmentally sealed regulators avoid contact between the surrounding water and the moving parts of the first stage by isolating them in an antifreeze fluid (e.g. Poseidon) or by siting the moving parts behind a diaphragm and transmitting the pressure through a pushrod (e.g. Apeks). Although there is no universally accepted standard, at least one agency recommends the use of two non-freezing regulators arranged as follows: primary first stage with primary second stage, BCD inflation hose, and submersible pressure gauge (SPG); secondary first stage with secondary second stage (octopus), dry suit inflation hose, and SPG, although only one SPG is needed for a single cylinder or manifolded twins. The two first stages are mounted on independently closable valves, as a first stage freeze free-flow can only be stopped by shutting off the air supply from the cylinder until the valve has thawed out. The second regulator is there to supply the remaining gas when the first regulator is shut off. A second-stage isolation valve used in conjunction with a first-stage overpressure relief valve may be effective as a quick method to manage demand valve free-flow. * Regulators should be checked to ensure that they perform effectively at low temperatures before use far from a free surface. * A minimum of two independent regulators is recommended for diving under ice, as scuba apparatus has a tendency to free- flow under polar conditions Divers must be competent in change-over procedures, including shutdown of the free-flowing equipment. * Keeping regulators warm and dry before diving, and limiting breathing from the regulator before immersion will reduce the risk of regulator freezing. Purging or any other cause of high flow rate markedly increases the probability of freezing and should be kept to an absolute minimum. Redundant systems usually typically comprise double cylinders with a primary and alternate regulator. Each of the second stages is supplied its own first stage, which can be shut down at the cylinder valve in an emergency, such as a free flow. The diver's buoyancy compensator is on a different first stage to the dry suit so if there is an issue with one the diver can still control their buoyancy. Some divers use a primary regulator on a 7-foot hose and a secondary on a necklace, this is useful when it may be necessary for the divers to swim in single file. the reason for the primary being on a long hose is to ensure the donated regulator is known to be working. =Buoyancy and weighting= * A drysuit should be used with a buoyancy compensator for ice diving unless the diver is exposed to greater risk with a buoyancy compensator than without one. * A tethered diver, who is deployed to work independently, should preferably be equipped with full face mask, voice communications to the surface and redundant air supply. This is often obligatory for professional divers. * Most divers prefer to be more negative for ice diving than in open water like in most overhead environments, and ability to disconnect the low pressure inflator on a BCD or drysuit is a critical skill. =Tethers and guidelines= When diving under ice it can be easy to become disoriented, and a guideline back to the entry and exit hole is an important safety feature. The choice between using a tether (lifeline) controlled by a surface tender or a reel line deployed by the diver under ice depends on various factors. A tether connected to the diver and controlled by a surface tender is usually the safest option for most diving under ice, and the only reasonable choice when any significant current is present. The tether will prevent the diver from being swept away by current, and is generally strong enough for the surface party to pull the diver back to the hole unless it gets snagged. It may be the only option permitted by regulation or code of practice for professional divers on scuba. Recreational divers are not constrained by law or codes of practice, and there are a number of situations where experienced ice divers may choose to use a continuous guideline that is not attached to them, and which they control during the dive. This practice is more favoured for long penetration distances where entanglement and line fouling become greater risks. It is not recommended for divers new to the ice environment or for conditions which do not include very good visibility, no current, no moving ice and places to tie off the guideline along the route. A guideline may have advantages over a tether if: *All of the divers have both significant penetration and ice diving skills and experience, and **The environment is stable, the ice is fast and there are no significant currents or other water movement, or **The dive is to be deep (below ) or the dive is planned for more than total underwater distance from the entry point, where a long tether may be difficult to manage Or: *There is significant risk of entanglement if a tether is used Divers may also choose to use a guideline for the primary part of the dive and clip on to a tether for decompression as currents are usually strongest near the surface. =Surface team= *Adequate thermal protection must be provided to tenders and standby divers. :* Warm waterproof shoes. :* Warm anorak for cold weather. :* Warm cap covering the ears. :* Sunglasses with a UV filter to protect the eyes in sunny days. :* Lip-care stick and cream to protect hands and face against cold and wind. ;* A device like crampons to aid in traction on ice. especially when cutting the hole or carrying gear Hazards Hazards of ice diving include the specific diving environmental hazards of penetration diving, in particular the hazard of not finding the exit area, and some hazards that are more specific to the low temperatures. *Frostbite: *Hypothermia: *Non-freezing cold injury *Regulator freezing: *Entrapment by moving ice: *Slipping on ice: Diving gear is heavy outside of the water, and the water on the diver's exposure suit can quickly freeze, reducing mobility and traction. *Wild animals like sharks and polar bears: =Regulator freezing= Regulator freezing is a malfunction of a diving regulator where ice formation on or in one or both stages causes the regulator to function incorrectly. Several types of malfunction are possible, including jamming of the first or second stage valves in any position from closed to more frequently fully open, which can produce a free-flow capable of emptying the diving cylinder in minutes, ice formation in the exhaust valve opening causing leakage of water into the mouthpiece, and shedding of ice shards into the inhalation air, which may be inhaled by the diver, possibly causing laryngospasm. When air expands during pressure reduction in a regulator, the temperature drops and heat is absorbed from the surroundings. It is well known that in waters colder than use of a regulator to inflate a lift bag, or to purge a regulator underwater for just a few seconds, will start many regulators free-flowing and they will not stop until the air supply to the regulator is stopped. Some cold water scuba divers install shuttle type shut off valves at each second stage regulator so if the second stage freezes open, the low pressure air can be shut off to the frozen second stage allowing them to switch to the alternative second stage and abort the dive. The most familiar effect of regulator freezing is where the second stage demand valve starts free flowing due to ice formation around the inlet valve mechanism that prevents the valve from closing after inhalation. Besides the problem of free flow from second stage icing, a less known problem is free ice formation, where ice forms and builds up inside the second stage but does not cause the regulator to free flow, and the diver may not be aware that the ice is there. This free ice build-up inside the second stage can break loose in the form of a sliver or chunk and pose a significant choking hazard because the ice can be inhaled, which may trigger laryngospasm. This can be a particular problem with regulators having ice-shedding internal surfaces that are teflon coated, which allows the ice to break free of the internal surfaces and helps to prevent the regulator from free flowing by clearing the ice. This may be helpful in keeping the demand valve mechanism free to move, but the ice still forms in the regulator and has to go somewhere when it breaks loose. With most second stage scuba regulators, ice forms and builds up on internal components, and the gap between the valve lever and fulcrum point is reduced and eventually filled by the build-up of ice that forms, preventing the inlet from fully closing during exhalation Once the valve starts leaking, the second stage components get even colder due to the cooling effect of the continuous flow, creating more ice and an even greater free flow. With some regulators the refrigerating effect is so great, that water around the exhaust valve freezes, reducing exhaust flow, and increasing exhalation effort and producing positive pressure in the valve body, making it difficult to exhale through the regulator. This may cause the diver to loosen their grip on the mouthpiece and exhale around the mouthpiece. With some regulators, once the regulator starts free-flowing the flow escalates into a full free-flow, and delivers air to the diver at temperatures cold enough to freeze mouth tissue in a short time, causing frostbite. The effect increases with depth, and the deeper the diver is, the faster the breathing gas will be lost. In some cold water fatalities, by the time the diver‚Äôs body is recovered there is no gas left in the cylinder, and the regulator has warmed up and melted the ice, destroying the evidence, and leading to a finding of death by drowning due to running out of gas. Mechanism of icing When the high pressure gas passes through the regulator first stage, the pressure drop from cylinder pressure to inter-stage pressure causes a temperature drop as the gas expands. The higher the cylinder pressure the greater the drop in pressure and the colder the gas gets in the low pressure hose to the second stage. An increase in flow will increase the amount of heat lost and the gas will get colder, as heat transfer from the surrounding water is limited. If the breathing rate is low to moderate (15 to 30 lpm) the risk of ice formation is less. The factors that influence ice formation are: *Cylinder pressure: - The temperature drop is proportional to the pressure drop. See general gas equation. *Breathing or flow rate: - The heat loss is proportional to the mass flow of gas. *Depth: - Mass flow is proportional to downstream pressure for a given volumetric flow. *Water temperature: - Rewarming of the expanded gas and the regulator mechanism depends on water temperature, and the temperature difference between the gas and the water. *Duration of flow:- During high flow rates heat loss is faster than rewarming, and gas temperature will drop. *Regulator design and materials: - The materials, arrangement of parts, and gas flow in the regulator affect reheating and deposition of ice. The thermal conductivity of the regulator components will affect the rate of heat transfer. *Breathing gas composition: - The amount of heat needed to raise the temperature depends on the specific heat capacity of the gas. Once the water temperature drops below there is not enough heat in the water to rewarm the components of the second stage being chilled by the cold gas from the first stage, and most second stages start forming ice. The cold inter-stage air enters the second stage and is reduced to ambient pressure, which cools it further, so it chills the second stage inlet valve components to well below freezing and as the diver exhales, the moisture in the exhaled breath condenses on the cold components and freezes. Heat from the surrounding water may keep the second stage regulator components warm enough to prevent the build-up of ice. The diver‚Äôs exhaled breath at , does not have enough heat to compensate for the cooling effect of the expanding incoming air once the water temperature is much below , and once the water temperature drops below there is not enough heat in the water to rewarm the regulator components fast enough to keep moisture in the divers exhaled breath from freezing if the diver is breathing hard. This is why the CE cold water limit is at which is the point at which many scuba regulators start retaining free ice. The longer the gas expands at a high rate, the more cold gas is produced, and for a given rate of reheating, the colder the regulator components will get. Keeping high flow rates to as short a time as possible will minimise ice formation. The air temperature above the ice may be considerably colder than the water under the ice, and the specific heat of air is much less than that of water. As a consequence, there is less warming of the regulator body and inter-stage gas when out of the water, and it is possible for further cooling to occur. This increases the risk of second stage icing, and the gas in the cylinder may be cooled sufficiently for condensation of residual moisture to occur during first stage expansion, as the expanding gas may cool below the dew point specified for high pressure breathing gas, which could cause internal icing of the first stage. This can be avoided by restricting breathing from the set in the cold air to a minimum. A similar effect occurs with the second stage. Air which has already expanded and cooled through the first stage expands again and cools further at the demand valve of the second stage. This cools the components of the second stage and water in contact with them may freeze. Metal components around the moving parts of the valve mechanism allow heat transfer from the surrounding slightly warmer water, and from exhaled air from the diver, which is considerably warmer than the surroundings. Second stage freezing can develop quickly from the moisture in the exhaled breath, so regulators that prevent or reduce contact of the diver‚Äôs exhaled breath with the colder components and the area where the cold gas enters will usually build up less ice on critical components. The heat transfer qualities of the materials can also significantly influence ice formation and freezing risk. Regulators with exhaust valves that do not seal well will form ice quickly as ambient water leaks into the casing. All second stages can develop ice when the inlet gas temperature averages below and this can happen in water temperatures up to . The ice that forms may or may not cause a free flow, but any ice inside the regulator casing may present an inhalation hazard. A second stage freeze is also likely to happen with the valve open, causing a free flow, which may precipitate a first stage freeze if not immediately stopped. If the flow through the frozen second stage can be stopped before the first stage freezes, the process can be halted. This may be possible if the second stage is fitted with a shutoff valve, but if this is done, the first stage must be fitted with an over-pressure valve, as closing the supply to the second stage disables its secondary function as an over-pressure valve. Cold water function testing is used to compare a regulator's performance in cold water against various standards, mainly the U.S. Navy Experimental Diving Unit's unmanned cold water test procedures (1994), and European CE open circuit standard EN 250 of 1993. Testing may include failure modes and effects analysis, and other issues relating to manufacturing, quality assurance and documentation. The introduction of a complete computerised breathing simulator system by ANSTI Test Systems Ltd in the UK made possible the accurate breathing simulator testing at all realistic water temperatures that is the current practice. Surface supplied breathing equipment In most cases surface supplied helmets and full face mask demand valves do not get cold enough to develop ice because the umbilical works as a heat exchanger and warms the air up to the water temperature. If the surface supplied diver bails out to scuba emergency gas supply, then the problems are identical to those for scuba, though the metal gas block and bent tube gas passages before the second stage will provide some warming of inter-stage gas beyond what a scuba set would normally provide. If the surface air temperatures are well below freezing, (below ) excessive moisture from the volume tank can freeze into ice granules which can then travel down the umbilical and end up in the helmet intake, blocking off air to the demand valve, either as a reduction in flow or a complete blockage if the granules accumulate and form a plug. Ice formation in a surface supplied system can be prevented by use of an effective moisture separation system and regular draining of condensate. Desiccating filters can also be used. Use of HP gas for surface supply is not generally a problem as the HP compressors use a filter system that dries the air sufficiently to keep the dew point below . Keeping the surface section of the umbilical exposed to the cold air as short as possible will also help. The portion in the water is not normally cold enough to be a problem. Factors increasing the risk of regulator freeze *Unsuitable regulator design and construction *High flow rates through the regulator **Purging **Buddy breathing **Octo breathing **Filling a lift bag or DSMB from the breathing regulator **long bursts of dry suit inflation or BC inflation while breathing from the same regulator. **High breathing rate due to exertion *Low water temperature **Water directly under the ice is likely to be colder than deeper water in fresh water. *Breathing through the regulator above the ice in sub-freezing temperatures Precautions to reduce risk of regulator freezing *Keeping the interior of the second-stage completely dry before entering the water **Not breathing from the regulator until underwater. When testing the regulator before the dive, inhale only, avoid exhaling through the regulator as the moisture in the breath will freeze in the demand valve. *Preventing water from entering the second-stage chamber during or between dives *Depressing the purge button for no more than 5 seconds prior to or during the dive, and avoiding even this if possible *Avoiding heavy work loads that would significantly increase the breathing rate and volume of air moved through the valve with each breathing cycle *Ensuring that the scuba air is moisture-free *Keeping the regulator in warm surroundings prior to the dive, if possible. Mitigation Kirby Morgan have developed a stainless steel tube heat exchanger (\\"Thermo Exchanger\\") to warm the gas from the first stage regulator to reduce the risk of second stage scuba regulator freeze when diving in extremely cold water at temperatures down to . The length and relatively good thermal conductivity of the tubing, and the thermal mass of the block allows sufficient heat from the water to warm the air to within one to two degrees of the surrounding water. Procedures for managing a regulator freeze *The diver will close the cylinder valve supplying the frozen regulator and change over to breathing from the standby regulator. This conserves the gas and allows the frozen regulator time to defrost. *If tethered, the diver can signal to the line tender with the previously agreed emergency signal (usually five or more tugs on the rope) while breathing from free-flowing regulator (less desirable option used if no alternative gas supply is available). Five pulls will usually indicate that the surface tender should pull the diver to the surface, or in this case, the hole in the ice. *If diving without a tether the diver should follow the guideline back to the hole and avoid leaving the line unless able to use a jump line or can see the ice hole. *Emergency ascent if directly under the hole in the ice and in visible range. (least desirable option short of drowning) Protocol for a regulator freeze often includes aborting the dive. Low pressure inflator freeze It is possible for the dry suit or buoyancy compensator inflation valve to freeze while inflating, for similar reasons to regulator freeze. If this happens it can cause a runaway ascent if it is not dealt with immediately. If possible the low pressure inflator hose should be disconnected before it freezes onto the valve, while dumping air to control buoyancy. Excessive dumping of air may leave the diver too negative so it is preferable to have at least two controllable buoyancy systems, such as a dry suit and BCD, preferably supplied from different first stages. If the dry suit inflation valve freezes open it may allow water to leak into the suit once disconnected, so this usually results in aborting the dive. Most inflator problems can be avoided by keeping gear maintained and dry before the dive, using a low flow rate for inflation and avoiding long bursts, and having warm water at the dive site to thaw gear since ambient air temperature is usually well below freezing and this usually causes BCD issues before the dive.  Training and certification Training includes learning about how ice forms, how to recognize unsafe ice conditions, dive site preparation, equipment requirements, and safety drills. * Ice divers should be skilled in the use of drysuits, choice of thermal insulation, buoyancy control and weighting, and should be competent and experienced with the specific equipment they will use. * If lifelines are used, both divers and tenders must be competent to use them. Other skills required by the ice diver include: * How to impact the underside of the surface ice if the diver's weight belt falls off for any reason and the diver ascends uncontrollably and rapidly. * How to deal with a frozen air-supply system using a redundant back-up system. * What to do in the event the diver loses contact with the line or the line tender does not get feedback from the diver in response to signals given to the diver. Several agencies offer certification in recreational ice diving.

Born in Barcelona, he made his debut on the operatic stage at 11 as Trujam√°n in Manuel de Falla's El retablo de Maese Pedro and went on to a career that encompassed over 60 roles, performed in the world's leading opera houses and in numerous recordings. He gained fame with a wider audience as one of the Three Tenors along with Pl√°cido Domingo and Luciano Pavarotti in a series of mass concerts that began in 1990 and continued until 2003. Carreras is also known for his humanitarian work as the president of the Jos√© Carreras International Leukaemia Foundation (La Fundaci√≥ Internacional Josep Carreras per a la Lluita contra la Leuc√®mia), which he established following his own recovery from the disease in 1988. Life and career =Early years= Carreras was born in Sants, a working-class district in Barcelona. He was the youngest of Ant√≤nia Coll i Saigi and Josep Carreras i Soler's three children. In 1951, his family emigrated to Argentina in search of a better life. However, this move abroad proved unsuccessful, and within a year; they had returned to Sants where Carreras was to spend the rest of his childhood and teenage years.Carreras, J.: 1991, Singing From The Soul ‚Äì An Autobiography, London: Souvenir Press, pp. 82‚Äì83 304x304px He showed an early talent for music and particularly singing, which intensified at the age of six when he saw Mario Lanza in The Great Caruso.Carreras, J.: 1991, Singing From The Soul ‚Äì An Autobiography, London: Souvenir Press, pp. 84‚Äì85 The story recounted in his autobiography and numerous interviews is that after seeing the film, Carreras sang the arias incessantly to his family, especially \\" La donna √® mobile,\\" often locking himself in the family's bathroom when they became exasperated with his impromptu concerts.Carreras, J. Op. Cit. p. 85 At that point, his parents, with the encouragement of his grandfather Salvador Coll, an amateur baritone, found the money for music lessons for him. At first he studied piano and voice with Magda Prunera, the mother of one of his childhood friends, and at the age of eight, he also started taking music lessons at Barcelona's Municipal Conservatory. At just eight years old, he also gave his first public performance, singing \\"La donna √® mobile,\\" accompanied by Magda Prunera on the piano, on Spanish National Radio. A recording of this still exists and can be heard on the video biography, Jos√© Carreras ‚Äì A Life Story.Jos√© Carreras ‚Äì A Life Story, 1993, Decca, EAN: 0044007115435. (Originally produced by Iambic Productions for broadcast on The South Bank Show, it won an International Emmy Award in 1992 for outstanding documentary programme.) On 3 January 1958, at the age of eleven, he made his debut in Barcelona's great opera house, the Gran Teatre del Liceu, singing the boy soprano role of Trujam√°n in Manuel de Falla's El retablo de Maese Pedro. A few months later, he sang for the last time as a boy soprano at the Liceu in the second act of La Boh√®me. Throughout his teenage years, he continued to study music, moving on to the Conservatori Superior de M√∫sica del Liceu and taking private voice lessons, first with Francisco Puig and later with Juan Ruax, whom Carreras has described as his \\"artistic father.\\" Following the advice of his father and brother, who felt that he needed a 'backup' career, he also entered the University of Barcelona to study chemistry, but after two years he left the university to concentrate on singing. =1970s and 1980s= Juan Ruax encouraged Carreras to audition for what was to become his first tenor role at the Liceu, Flavio in Norma, which opened on 8 January 1970. Although only a minor role, the few phrases he sang caught the attention of the production's leading lady, the eminent soprano and fellow Catalan, Montserrat Caball√©. She asked him to sing Gennaro with her in Donizetti's Lucrezia Borgia, which opened on 19 December 1970. It was his first principal adult role, and the one which he considers to be his true debut as a tenor. In 1971, he made his international debut in a concert performance of Maria Stuarda in London's Royal Festival Hall, again with Caball√© singing the title role. Caball√© was instrumental in promoting and encouraging his career for many years, appearing in over fifteen different operas with him, while her brother and manager, Carlos Caball√©, was also Carreras's manager until the mid-1990s. During the 1970s Carreras's career progressed rapidly. In late-1971, he won first prize in Parma's prestigious Voci Verdiane competition which led to his Italian debut as Rodolfo in La boh√®me at the Teatro Regio di Parma on 12 January 1972. Later that year he made his American debut as Pinkerton in Madama Butterfly with the New York City Opera. Other major house debuts followed ‚Äì the San Francisco Opera in 1973, as Rodolfo; the Philadelphia Lyric Opera Company in 1973, as Alfredo in La traviata; the Vienna Staatsoper in 1974, as the Duke of Mantua in Rigoletto; London's Royal Opera House in 1974, as Alfredo; the New York Metropolitan Opera in 1974, as Cavaradossi in Tosca; and La Scala, Milan in 1975, as Riccardo in Un ballo in maschera. By the age of 28, he had already sung the tenor lead in 24 different operas in both Europe and North America, and had an exclusive recording contract with Philips, which resulted in valuable recordings of several less often performed Verdi operas, notably Il Corsaro, I due Foscari, La battaglia di Legnano, Un giorno di regno and Stiffelio. Carreras portraying Juli√°n Gayarre in the film Romanza Final (1986) Carreras's leading ladies during the 1970s and 1980s included some of the most famous sopranos and mezzo-sopranos of the day: Montserrat Caball√©, Birgit Nilsson, Viorica Cortez, Renata Scotto, Ileana Cotruba≈ü, Sylvia Sass, Teresa Stratas, Dame Kiri Te Kanawa, Frederica von Stade, Agnes Baltsa, Teresa Berganza, and Katia Ricciarelli. His artistic partnership with Ricciarelli began when they both sang in the 1972 La boh√®me at Parma and lasted for thirteen years, both in the recording studio and on stage. They later made a studio recording of La boh√®me for Philips Classics and can be heard together on over 12 other commercial recordings of both operas and recitals, predominantly on the Philips and Deutsche Grammophon labels. Of the many conductors he worked with during this period, the one with whom Carreras had the closest artistic relationship and who had the most profound influence on his career was Herbert von Karajan.Matheopoulos, H.: 1989, Bravo ‚Äì The World's Great Male Singers Discuss Their Roles, Victor Gollancz Ltd. pp. 49‚Äì50 He first sang under Karajan in the Verdi Requiem at Salzburg on 10 April 1976, with their final collaboration in a 1986 production of Carmen, again at Salzburg. With Karajan's encouragement, he increasingly moved towards singing heavier lirico-spinto roles, including Aida, Don Carlos, and Carmen, which some critics have said were too heavy for his natural voice and may have shortened his vocal prime. (See the section on Carreras's voice.) The 1980s saw Carreras occasionally moving outside the strictly operatic repertoire, at least in the recording studio, with recitals of songs from zarzuela, musicals and operettas. He also made full-length recordings of two musicals ‚Äì West Side Story (1985) and South Pacific (1986) ‚Äì both with Kiri Te Kanawa as his co-star. The recording of West Side Story was unusual in two respects: Carreras was chosen and conducted by Leonard Bernstein. Bernstein was conducting for the first time nearly 30 years after he composed the music, and a full-length documentary was made about the recording sessions. His 1987 Philips recording of the Argentine folk mass, Misa Criolla, conducted by its composer, Ariel Ram√≠rez, brought the work to a worldwide audience. Although many of Carreras's stage performances are available on video, he also ventured into film. In 1986, he portrayed the 19th century Spanish tenor Juli√°n Gayarre in Romanza Final (The Final Romance) and in 1987, he started working on a film version of La boh√®me directed by Luigi Comencini. It was during the filming of La boh√®me in Paris that he was found to be suffering from acute lymphoblastic leukemia and given a 1 in 10 chance of survival. However, he recovered from the disease after undergoing a gruelling treatment involving chemotherapy, radiation therapy and an autologous bone marrow transplant at the Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center in Seattle. Following his recovery, he gradually returned to both the operatic and the concert stage, embarking on a tour of come-back recitals in 1988 and 1989 and singing with Montserrat Caball√© in Medea (M√©rida, Spain 1989) and in the world premiere of Balada's Crist√≥bal Col√≥n (Barcelona, 1989) =1990‚Äìpresent= Carreras backstage at the Royal Albert Hall, December 2001 The 1990s continued to see Carreras performing on the operatic stage in Carmen and Fedora and making role debuts in Samson et Dalila (Peralada, 1990), Verdi's Stiffelio (London, 1993), and Wolf-Ferrari's Sly (Zurich, 1998). However, his opera performances became less frequent as he increasingly devoted himself to concerts and recitals. His final operatic performances at the Gran Teatre del Liceu, the opera house where his career began, were in Samson et Dalila (March 2001). He reprised the title role in Sly in Tokyo in 2002 and in 2004 performed at the Vienna State Opera in fully staged versions of the final act of Carmen and Act 3 of Sly. In April 2014, Carreras returned to the opera stage after a ten-year absence singing the title role of Christian Kolonovits's opera, El Juez (The Judge) in its premiere at the Arriaga Theatre in Bilbao. He reprised the role in August 2014 at the Festival Erl in Austria and in January 2015 at the Mariinsky Theatre in St. Petersburg.El Pa√≠s (12 January 2015). \\"Josep Carreras cantar√° ‚ÄòEl Juez (Los ni√±os perdidos)‚Äô en el Teatro Mariinsky\\". Retrieved 25 March 2015 . In 1990 the first Three Tenors concert took place in the Baths of Caracalla in Rome on the eve of the 1990 FIFA World Cup finals. It was originally conceived to raise money for Carreras's leukemia foundation and as a way for his colleagues, Pl√°cido Domingo and Luciano Pavarotti, to welcome their \\"little brother\\" back to the world of opera. However, it and the subsequent Three Tenors concerts brought Carreras a fame that went far beyond the opera house. It is estimated that over a billion people around the world watched the television broadcast of the 1994 Three Tenors concert in Los Angeles.\\"The Three Tenors in Paris\\" , WNET, 1998 By 1999, the CD from the first Three Tenors concert in Rome had sold an estimated 13 million copies, making it the best-selling classical recording of all time.Guinness World Records 2000 Millennium Edition Carreras is the center of a subplot in the 1996 episode \\"The Doll\\" in the Seinfeld television series, in which he is never referred to by name but instead as \\"the other guy\\" in the Three Tenors; he is erroneously referred to as being Italian (perhaps intentionally). The early 1990s also saw Carreras serving as the Musical Director for the opening and closing ceremonies of 1992 Barcelona Olympic Games, and performing in a worldwide concert tour in tribute to his first singing hero, Mario Lanza. By the 2000s Carreras's recording and live concert repertoire had moved largely to art song, Neapolitan songs, the light classical genre, and 'easy- listening'.E.g.

Beginning in 2002, Carreras scaled back his live performances to recitals and orchestral concerts. In an interview published in The Times on 8 May 2009, Carreras announced that he would no longer perform principal opera roles but was still open to recitals. =Humanitarian work= Carreras visiting a leukaemia patient on the cover of Amigos de la Fundaci√≥n, July 2005Following his own recovery from leukaemia, Carreras sought both to repay the debt he owed to medical science and to improve the lives and care of other leukaemia sufferers. On 14 July 1988, he established the Fundaci√≥ Internacional Josep Carreras per a la Lluita contra la Leuc√®mia (known in English as the Jos√© Carreras International Leukaemia Foundation)Jos√© Carreras International Leukemia Foundation (English version) in Barcelona. The foundation, which publishes a tri-monthly magazine on its activities, Amigos de la Fundaci√≥n, concentrates its efforts in four main areas: *Development of clinical research into the cure and treatment of leukaemia through scholarships and research grants. *Campaigns to increase bone marrow and cord blood donation for leukaemia patients requiring transplants, along with the operation of REDMO, the Spanish national registry of bone marrow donors. *Strengthening of the research and clinical infrastructures in both leading international institutions and hospitals and laboratories in the developing world. *Provision of social services to leukemia patients and their families, including free accommodation near transplant centres. The Jos√© Carreras International Leukaemia Foundation also has affiliates in the U.S., Switzerland, and Germany, with the German affiliate the most active of the three. Since 1995, Carreras has presented an annual live television benefit gala in Leipzig to raise funds for the foundation's work in Germany. Since its inception, the gala alone has raised well over ‚Ç¨71 million. Carreras also performs at least 20 charity concerts a year in aid of his foundation and other medical related charities. He is an Honorary Member of the European Society for Medicine and the European Haematology Association, an Honorary Patron of the European Society for Medical Oncology, and a Goodwill Ambassador for UNESCO. =Awards and distinctions= Carreras has received numerous awards and distinctions for both his artistic and humanitarian work. These include: Knight Grand Cross (First Class) of the Most Exalted Order of the White Elephant of Thailand (2019); Commander of the Ordre des Arts et des Lettres and Chevalier of the L√©gion d'honneur (France); Knight Grand Cross and Grand Officer of the Order of Merit of the Italian Republic (20 May 1996 and 3 April 1991, respectively); Grand Decoration of Honour for Services to the Republic of Austria (1999); the Cruz de Oro del Orden Civil de la Solidaridad Social from Queen Sofia of Spain, the Prince of Asturias Prize for Art (joint winner, 1991), the Grand Cross of Merit from the Federal Republic of Germany and the Gold Medal of the Generalitat of Catalonia (June 1984) Carreras has received the Bavarian Order of Merit, the Steiger Award (2006) and the St. George Order of the Semperoper (Dresden, 2010) Honorary Medal of the city of Leipzig on the occasion of his Leukemia Fundraiser for 2009 on 17 December 2009; awarded by the Mayor of Leipzig (unanimous decision of the town council of Leipzig). On 23 February 2004, the Austrian Post Office issued a 1‚Ç¨ stamp to commemorate the 30th anniversary of his debut at the Vienna Staatsoper. In 2009, he received the Brit Award for Outstanding Contribution to Music. He has Honorary Doctorates from the University of Barcelona and Miguel Hern√°ndez University (Spain); Napier, Loughborough and Sheffield universities (United Kingdom); the Mendeleev Russian University of Chemistry and Technology (Russia); the University of Camerino (Italy); Rutgers University (United States); the University of Coimbra (Portugal); the National University of Music Bucharest (Romania); Philipps-Universit√§t Marburg (Germany, 3 May 2006); University of Saarland (2012); the University of P√©cs (Hungary) and most recently, Kyunghee University (Korea) and the University of Porto (Portugal).

He had originally been a French teacher. However, he had fought on the Republican side during the Spanish Civil War, and when the Franco government came into power in 1939, he was no longer allowed to teach. His mother, Antonia Coll i Saigi, ran a small hair-dressing salon, where, as a child, Carreras often sang to the customers in return for pocket money. He was very close to his mother, who was convinced that he would one day be a great singer, and her death from cancer when he was 18 affected him greatly.Carreras, J. Op. Cit. p. 98 In Jos√© Carreras: A Life Story, he said that \\"even now, every time I go on stage, I always, always, have a quick thought for her.\\"Jos√© Carreras ‚Äì A Life Story, 1993, Decca Records/Iambic Productions In 1971 Carreras married Mercedes P√©rez. They had two children: a son, Albert (born in 1972), and a daughter, Julia (born in 1978). The marriage ended in divorce in 1992. In 2006, Carreras married Jutta J√§ger, but separated from her in 2011.El Pa√≠s (28 November 2011). \\"Josep Carreras se separa\\". Retrieved 29 November 2011 Carreras's nephew, David Gim√©nez Carreras, is a conductor and Director of the Orquestra Simf√≤nica del Vall√®s. He has conducted many of Carreras's concerts since the late 1990s as well as his opera performances in Sly at the Gran Teatre del Liceu in June 2000. Voice 341x341pxIn its prime, Carreras's voice was considered one of the most beautiful tenor voices of the day.Rosenthal, H. and Warrack, J. (1979) The Concise Oxford Dictionary of Opera, 2nd Edition, Oxford University Press. p. 83 The Spanish critic, Fernando Fraga has described it as a lyric tenor with the generosity of a spinto, having \\"a noble timbre, richly coloured and sumptuously resonant\\". This is particularly true of the middle range of his voice. Fraga also noted, as has Carreras himself, that even in his youth the high notes of the tenor range were always somewhat problematic for him, and became more so as his career progressed.Fraga, F.: 'El dorado sonido del coraz√≥n', √ìpera Actual n¬∫ 77, January 2005 Like his idol, Giuseppe di Stefano, Carreras was also known for the beauty and expressiveness of his phrasing and for his passionate delivery.Pasi, M.:'Trionfale ritorno del tenore: i loggionisti gli hanno anche consegnato una medaglia', Corriere della Sera, 11 November 1989 These qualities are perhaps best exemplified in his 1976 recording of Tosca with Montserrat Caball√© in the title role and conducted by Sir Colin Davis.Michael Oliver, Gramophone Magazine, August 1993 According to several critics e.g. John Freeman in his review of the 1976 Tosca recording in Opera News, 9 April 1977, p. 37; 'Jos√© Carreras and Miguel Fleta' by John Steane, Opera Now, March/April 2001; 'El dorado sonido del coraz√≥n', by Fernando Fraga, √ìpera Actual n¬∫ 77, January 2005 his assumption of the heavier spinto roles such as Andrea Ch√©nier, Don Jos√© in Carmen, Don Carlo, and Alvaro in La forza del destino put a strain on his naturally lyric instrument which may have caused the voice to prematurely darken and lose some of its bloom. Nevertheless, he produced some of his finest performances in those roles. The Daily Telegraph wrote of his 1984 Andrea Ch√©nier at London's Royal Opera House: \\"Switching effortlessly from the lyric poet Rodolfo in La Boh√®me a few weeks ago to the heroic poet Chenier, the Spanish tenor's vocal artistry held us spellbound throughout.\\" quoted in Matheopoulos, H.: 1989, Bravo ‚Äì The World's Great Male Singers Discuss Their Roles, Victor Gollancz Ltd. Of his 1985 performance in Andrea Ch√©nier at La Scala (preserved on DVD), Carl Battaglia wrote in Opera News that Carreras dominated the opera \\"with formidable concentration and a cleverly refined vocal accent that imparts to this spinto role an overlay of intensity lacking in his essentially lyric tenor.\\" Battaglia, C: Opera News, December 1985, p. 50 However, Carl H. Hiller's review of the La Scala performance in Opera also noted that while in the quiet phrases of the score \\"he could display all the tonal mellowness of which this perhaps most beautiful tenor voice of our time is capable\\", he had difficulty with the high loud notes, which sounded strained and uneasily produced.Hiller, C. H., Opera Magazine (UK), August 1985, p. 923. Recordings =Complete operas= This list is a representative selection of notable commercial recordings from the peak years of Jos√© Carreras's career.

Theses were mostly aimed at fellow Bolsheviks in Russia and returning to Russia from exile. He called for soviets (workers' councils) (as seen in the slogan \\"all power to the soviets\\"), denounce liberals and social revolutionaries in the Provisional Government, called for Bolsheviks not to cooperate with the government, and called for new communist policies. The April Theses influenced the July Days and October Revolution in the next months and are identified with Leninism.  Background  The February Revolution had resulted in the abdication of Tsar Nicholas II, the collapse of Imperial Russia, and the establishment of the liberal Provisional Government under Georgy Lvov and later Alexander Kerensky. The Provisional Government was dominated mainly by liberals and moderate socialists who wanted to instigate political reform, creating a democracy with elections for an executive and a constituent assembly. After the February Revolution, Lenin sought to return to Russia as soon as possible. This was problematic because he was isolated in neutral Switzerland as World War I continued to be fought in neighbouring states. The Swiss communist Fritz Platten managed to negotiate with the German government for the safe passage of Lenin and his company through Germany by rail on the so-called \\"sealed train\\". The German government clearly hoped Lenin's return would create political unrest in Russia, which would lead to the capitulation of Russia and the end of Russian participation of the war on the Entente side, ending the war on the Eastern Front and allowing German forces to concentrate their fight against France, Britain, and allied forces on the Western Front. (Indeed, after the October Revolution resulted in the Bolshevik rise to power, this did occur with the Decree on Peace and Treaty of Brest-Litovsk.) Once through Germany, Lenin continued by ferry to Sweden, and the remainder of the journey through Scandinavia was subsequently arranged by Swedish communists Otto Grimlund and Ture Nerman. On 16 April (3 April according to the old Russian Calendar) 1917, Lenin arrived by train to a tumultuous reception at Finland Station in Petrograd.  The Theses  The April Theses were first announced in a speech in two meetings on 17 April 1917 (4 April according to the old Russian Calendar). Some believe he based this on Leon Trotsky's Theory of Permanent Revolution. They were subsequently published in the Bolshevik newspaper Pravda. In the Theses, Lenin:Seventeen Moments in Soviet History ‚Äì Vladimir Lenin, April Thesis, Pravda, 20 April 1917. # Condemns the Provisional Government as bourgeois and urges \\"no support\\" for it, as \\"the utter falsity of all its promises should be made clear\\". He condemns World War I as a \\"predatory imperialist war\\" and the \\"revolutionary defensism\\" of foreign social democrat parties, calling for revolutionary defeatism. # Asserts that Russia is \\"passing from the first stage of the revolution‚Äîwhich, owing to the insufficient class consciousness and organization of the proletariat, placed power in the hands of the bourgeoisie‚Äîto its second stage, which must place power in the hands of the proletariat and the poorest sections of the peasants\\". # Recognises that the Bolsheviks are a minority in most of the soviets against a \\"block of all the petty-bourgeois opportunist elements, from the Social-Cadets and the Socialist Revolutionaries down to the Organising Committee (Chkheidze, Tsereteli, etc.), Steklov, etc., etc., who have yielded to the influence of the bourgeoisie and spread that influence among the proletariat\\". # Calls for a parliamentary republic not to be established and calls this a \\"retrograde step\\". He calls for \\"a republic of Soviets of Workers', Agricultural Labourers' and Peasants' Deputies throughout the country, from top to bottom\\". # Calls for \\"abolition of the police, the army, and the bureaucracy\\" and for \\"the salaries of all officials, all of whom are elective and displaceable at any time, not to exceed the average wage of a competent worker\\". # Calls for \\"The weight of emphasis in the agrarian programme to be shifted to the Soviets of Agricultural Labourers' Deputies\\", \\"confiscation of all landed estates\\", and \\"nationalisation of all lands in the country, the land to be disposed of by the local Soviets of Agricultural Labourers' and Peasants' Deputies. The organisation of separate Soviets of Deputies of Poor Peasants. The setting up of a model farm on each of the large estates (ranging in size from 100 to 300 dessiatines, according to local and other conditions, and to the decisions of the local bodies) under the control of the Soviets of Agricultural Labourers' Deputies and for the public account.\\" # Calls for \\"the immediate union of all banks in the country into a single national bank, and the institution of control over it by the Soviet of Workers' Deputies\\". # States that \\"it is not our immediate task to 'introduce' socialism, but only to bring social production and the distribution of products at once under the control of the Soviets of Workers' Deputies\\". # Lists \\"party tasks\\" as \\"Immediate convocation of a party congress\\", \\"alteration of the party programme, mainly: (1) On the question of imperialism and the imperialist war, (2) On our attitude towards the state and our demand for a 'commune state', amendment of our out-of-date minimum programme, and change of the Party's name\\". Lenin notes that \\"instead of 'Social Democracy', whose official leaders throughout the world have betrayed socialism and deserted to the bourgeoisie (the 'defencists' and the vacillating 'Kautskyites'), we must call ourselves the Communist Party\\". The name change would dissociate the Bolsheviks from the social democratic parties of Europe supporting participation of their nation in World War I. Lenin first developed this point in his 1915 pamphlet \\"Socialism and War\\", when he first called the pro-war social-democrats \\"social chauvinists\\". # Calls for a new \\"revolutionary International, an International against the social-chauvinists and against the 'Center'\\". This later became the Comintern (Third International) which was formed in 1919.  Effects  After the February Revolution, Bolshevik leaders returning from exile (such as Lev Kamenev) were arguing a much more moderate line, that Russian involvement in the war could be justified and that there should be cooperation with the liberals in the Provisional Government. However, Lenin's arguments reflected those made by the leading Bolsheviks in Petrograd at the time of the February Revolution, such as Alexander Shlyapnikov. Lenin succeeded in persuading the Bolsheviks of his arguments as laid out in the April Theses and they provided much of the ideological groundwork that later led to the October Revolution.

ASF is part of the Media Foundation framework. Overview and features ASF is based on serialized objects which are essentially byte sequences identified by a GUID marker. The format does not specify how (i.e. with which codec) the video or audio should be encoded; it just specifies the structure of the video/audio stream. This is similar to the function performed by the QuickTime, AVI, or Ogg container formats. One of the objectives of ASF was to support playback from digital media servers, HTTP servers, and local storage devices such as hard disk drives. The most common media contained within an ASF file are Windows Media Audio (WMA) and Windows Media Video (WMV). The most common file extensions for ASF files are extension (audio-only files using Windows Media Audio, with MIME-type \`audio/x-ms-wma\`) and (files containing video, using the Windows Media Audio and Video codecs, with MIME-type \`video/x-ms-asf\`). These files are identical to the old files but for their extension and MIME-type. The different extensions are used to make it easier to identify the content of a media file.The Difference Between ASF and WMV/WMA Files ASF files can also contain objects representing metadata, such as the artist, title, album and genre for an audio track, or the director of a video track, much like the ID3 tags of MP3 files. It supports scalable media types and stream prioritization; as such, it is a format optimized for streaming. The ASF container provides the framework for digital rights management in Windows Media Audio and Windows Media Video. An analysis of an older scheme used in WMA reveals that it is using a combination of elliptic curve cryptography key exchange, DES block cipher, a custom block cipher, RC4 stream cipher and the SHA-1 hashing function. ASF container-based media are sometimes still streamed on the internet either through the MMS protocol or the RTSP protocol. Mostly, however, they contain material encoded for 'progressive download', which can be distributed by any webserver and then offers the same advantages as streaming: the file starts playing as soon as a minimum number of bytes is received and the rest of the download continues in the background while one is watching or listening. The Library of Congress Digital Preservation project considers ASF to be the de facto successor of RIFF. In 2010 Google picked RIFF as the container format for WebP.

The municipality comprises the major Lauterbrunnen Valley (), the Soustal, the Sefinental, the upper Lauterbrunnen Valley with Untersteinberg including several glaciers, such as the Tschingelfirn and the Rottalgletscher, many Alpine meadows and peaks, such as Schilthorn, Bietenhorn, Schwarzm√∂nch, and Silberhorn, and finally the villages Lauterbrunnen, Wengen, M√ºrren, Gimmelwald, Stechelberg, and Isenfluh, and several hamlets. The population of the village Lauterbrunnen is less than that of Wengen, but larger than that of the others. Toponymy Lauterbrunnen was first mentioned in 1240 as \\"in claro fonte\\", a Romance language place name meaning \\"clear spring\\". By 1253, it was known to German speakers as Liuterbrunnon; the town had an alternate spelling of Luterbrunnen by 1268. While the meaning of brunnen is undoubtedly spring or fountain, there is some dispute about the meaning of lauter. Some translate it as clear, clean or bright (which compares to the earlier Romance language meaning of the place mentioned above), while others translate it as \\"many\\" or \\"louder\\". A local explanation is that the name Lauterbrunnen means \\"many springs\\", using a modern meaning of the word lauter in German; however, this could be an example of a folk etymology. History Lauterbrunnen Valley in the late 19th or early 20th century. Miners working on the Jungfraubahn Lauterbrunnen, view from the Murrenbahn, by Leo Wehrli (1935) Lauterbrunnen is first mentioned in 1240 as in claro fonte. In 1304 it was mentioned as Luterbrunnen. The oldest trace of a settlement in the area is a single Roman coin which was discovered in the Blumental. When the Lauterbrunnen Valley first appears in the historic record, during the 13th century, it was owned by the Freiherr of W√§denswil. In 1240 the Freiherr of W√§denswil sold the Sefinen Valley to Interlaken Monastery. Over the following century, the Monastery and other local lords began to expand their power in the Lauterbrunnen and neighboring valleys. However, around 1300, the Lord of Turn began to settle his Walser speaking people in the nearby L√∂tschen Valley and into the highlands of the Lauterbrunnen Valley. By 1346, the Walser villages of Lauterbrunnen, Gimmelwald, M√ºrren, Sichellauenen and Trachsellauenen all had village governments and a certain amount of independence from the Monastery. Three years later, much of the Bernese Oberland unsuccessfully rose up against Monastery. When the Monastery suppressed the rebellion, the Walser villages bore the brunt of the Monastery's wrath. By the 15th century, the villages of the valley were part of the large parish of Gsteig bei Interlaken (now part of Gsteigwiler). In 1487-88 the villagers in Lauterbrunnen built a filial church of the parish. In 1506, the parish appointed a full-time priest for Lauterbrunnen. In 1528, the city of Bern adopted the new faith of the Protestant Reformation and began imposing it on the Bernese Oberland. Lauterbrunnen joined many other villages and the Monastery in an unsuccessful rebellion against the new faith. After Bern imposed its will on the Oberland, they secularized the Monastery and annexed all the Monastery lands. Lauterbrunnen became the center of a new Reformed parish. Mines were built in the Trachsellauenen area in the upper valley beginning in the late 16th century. An iron smelter was built in Zweil√ºtschinen (now part of G√ºndlischwand) in 1715 to process the iron ore from Trachsellauenen. However most of the money from the mines went to the noble landowners. The villagers remained very poor. In the 17th and 18th centuries the poverty was so widespread that many of the villagers joined mercenary regiments or emigrated. A majority of the emigrants moved to the Carolinas in the United States. Beginning in the late 18th century, foreign mountain climbers began to use Lauterbrunnen as a starting point for their expeditions into the nearby Alps. Initially the climbers stayed in the village rectory. However, as Lauterbrunnen's fame grew and with the completion of a road from Interlaken in 1834 and the 1890 Bernese Oberland Railway, more hotels were needed for tourists. As new hotels were built, other tourist infrastructure was also built in the village. They built cable cars to M√ºrren in 1891 and to Wengen in 1893. But the most significant piece of infrastructure was the Jungfrau railway which was built in 1912. The Jungfrau rack railway runs from Kleine Scheidegg to the highest railway station in Europe at Jungfraujoch. The railway runs almost entirely within a tunnel built into the Eiger and M√∂nch mountains and contains two stations in the middle of the tunnel, where passengers can disembark to observe the neighboring mountains through windows built into the mountainside. In 1909 the English brothers Walter and Arnold Lunn popularized skiing, curling and bobsledding at Lauterbrunnen. These winter sports provided a whole new group of winter tourists and converted the summer tourist industry into a year-round business. The tourist economy of Lauterbrunnen was devastated due to World War I and II and the Great Depression. However, following the end of World War II, tourism rebounded. Many new vacation homes and chalets were built along with ski lifts, chair lifts and a heliport. On 1 January 1973 the former municipality of Isenfluh merged into the municipality of Lauterbrunnen. On 31 December 2009 Amtsbezirk Interlaken, the municipality's former district, was dissolved. On the following day, 1 January 2010, it joined the newly created Verwaltungskreis Interlaken-Oberhasli.Nomenklaturen ‚Äì Amtliches Gemeindeverzeichnis der Schweiz accessed 9 February 2013 Geography View of the valley from the M√§nnlichen Lauterbrunnen lies at the bottom of a U-shaped valley that extends south and then south-westwards from the village to meet the Lauterbrunnen Wall. The Lauterbrunnen Valley (Lauterbrunnental) is one of the deepest in the Alpine chain when compared with the height of the mountains that rise directly on either side. It is a true cleft, rarely more than one kilometer in width, between limestone precipices, sometimes quite perpendicular, everywhere of extreme steepness. In places the cliff walls are up to high. It is to this form of the valley that it owes the numerous waterfalls from which it derives its name. The streams descending from the adjoining mountains, on reaching the verge of the rocky walls of the valley, form cascades so high that they are almost lost in spray before they reach the level of the valley. The most famous of these is Staubbach Falls, less than one kilometer from the village of Lauterbrunnen. The high Staubbach is the highest free falling waterfall in Switzerland. Also near Lauterbrunnen is the highest waterfall in Switzerland, the M√ºrrenbach Fall. Weisse L√ºtschine river flows through Lauterbrunnen and overflows its banks about once a year. The source of the river comes from melting snow high in the mountains, thus making it a very pure and clean source of water. It is common practice in camp sites to chill drinks in the water. Trummelbach Falls is from Lauterbrunnen, connected by bus from the station.Trummelbach Falls tourist literature The municipality of Lauterbrunnen extends a considerable distance beyond the village and valley, with an area of . It reaches as far as the peaks of the Eiger, M√∂nch and Jungfrau to the east, the Gletscherhorn, Mittaghorn, Grosshorn, Breithorn and Tschingelhorn to the south, and the Gspaltenhorn and Schilthorn to the west. The Kleine Scheidegg Pass crosses over to Grindelwald to the east, whilst the Sefinenfurgge Pass crosses to Griesalp and Reichenbach im Kandertal to the west. Both passes carry hiking trails that form part of the Alpine Pass Route, a long-distance hiking trail across Switzerland between Sargans and Montreux.

J. R. R. Tolkien hiked from Interlaken to the Lauterbrunnen Valley while on a school trip to the Continent in 1911. The landscape of the valley later provided the concept and pictorial model for his sketches and watercolours of the fictitious valley of Rivendell, the dwelling place of Elrond Half-elven and his people. Lauterbrunnen featured in several scenes from the 1969 James Bond film On Her Majesty's Secret Service, including a car chase in which Bond (played for the only time by George Lazenby) was driven away from henchmen of Ernst Stavro Blofeld by his girlfriend Tracy di Vicenzo in a dramatic pursuit which culminated in them shaking off the pursuers in a stock car race. The 360 degree revolving restaurant Piz Gloria which crowns the Schilthorn peak was used to film Blofeld's hideout. In the movie Bond escapes from it by skiing down the mountain to reach the village of M√ºrren at its base. The location features in the Forza Motorsport series of games, with a fictional track by the name of 'Bernese Alps' incorporated into the mountainside.

It was originally formed in Munich in 1979http://www.discogs.com/ja/artist/407103-Dschinghis-Khan to compete in the Eurovision Song ContestGenghis Khan Discography at Discogs with their song \\"Dschinghis Khan\\". In 2018, there have been two groups with the name: the one led by original members Henriette Strobel and Edina Pop, and a more current group led by original member Wolfgang Heichel and Stefan Track, who replaced the late Louis Potgieter in the 2005 reunion concert.  Beginning: 1970s‚Äì80s The band was formed and managed by German producer Ralph Siegel. Their original eponymous song was written and produced by Ralph Siegel with lyrics by Bernd Meinunger and came in fourth place at the 1979 Eurovision Song Contest in Jerusalem. Their name is the German spelling of the name of the historical figure Genghis Khan of the Mongol Empire. The only native Germans in the group were the bald-headed Karl-Heinz \\"Steve\\" Bender, and Wolfgang Heichel, who brought his Dutch-born wife Henriette (n√©e Strobel) with him. Louis Hendrik Potgieter (Genghis Khan) was South African. Edina Pop (Marika K√©sm√°rky) was a Hungarian who had started her singing career in West Germany in 1969. Leslie M√°ndoki, also Hungarian, had left Hungary in 1975. In 1979, the band released the singles \\"Dschinghis-Khan\\". and \\"Moskau\\". In 1980, its English-language version topped the charts in Australia for six weeks, largely thanks to Seven Network using the song as the theme music for coverage of the 1980 Summer Olympics. In an interview with Russian television presenter Alexandra Glotova, the producer of the group Dschinghis Khan, Heinz Gross, said that in the 1980s, the band was banned in the Soviet Union and was accused of anti-communism and nationalism. Henriette Strobel, Wolfgang Heichel and Edina Pop performing in 2009 The group broke up in 1984 but 1986 saw a brief reunion as Dschinghis Khan Family. Only Henriette Heichel (vocals), Leslie M√°ndoki (drums) and Louis Potgieter (keyboards) returned from the original lineup. The song \\"Wir geh√∂r'n zusammen\\" led them to a national qualifying round of the Eurovision Song Contest, where they finished in second place. In 1988, Leslie M√°ndoki and √âva Csepregi, the vocalist of Hungarian pop group Neoton Fam√≠lia, sang the song \\"Korea\\" on the opening of the 1988 Summer Olympics in Seoul.  Continued career: 1990s‚Äìpresent  Dancer and front man Louis Potgieter died of AIDS in 1993, while singer Karl-Heinz \\"Steve\\" Bender died of cancer in 2006. The success of the band eventually led to Wolfgang and Henriette's divorce, with Henriette reverting to her maiden name of Strobel. In 2005, the band members Wolfgang Heichel, Steve Bender, Henriette Strobel and Edina Pop started a \\"comeback\\" with a show at the Retro FM festival in the Olympic stadium in Moscow. Stefan Track came as new member to the band to replace Louis Hendrik Potgieter. In 2018, they re-recorded their song \\"Moskau\\" with producer Ralph Siegel and singers Jay Khan, Alexander Malinin and Ustinya Malinin, Jorge Jim√©nez & Marifer Medrano for the 2018 FIFA World Cup.Welt.de In April 2018, original member Wolfgang Heichel and Stefan Track, fresh off his spin-off Rocking Son of Dschinghis Khan formed a new Dschinghis Khan after Heichel gained the rights to the name in Germany and Spain. Henriette Strobel, Edina Pop, Claus Kupreit, and producer Heinz Gross also own the rights to the name Dschinghis Khan, with both group patents revealing the use of a certain logo.

They advocated the transfer of national economic management to trade unions. The group was led by Alexander Shlyapnikov, Sergei Medvedev, Alexandra Kollontai and Yuri Lutovinov. It existed until 1922, when it was defeated at the 11th Congress of the Russian Communist Party (Bolsheviks). In some aspects, it was close with the German council communist movement, although there is no information about direct contacts between these groups. History = Emergence = The emergence of the Workers' Opposition‚Äôs ‚Äúideological sources‚Äù was linked with a statement by Alexander Shlyapnikov, which appeared on November 4, 1917: in his statement, Shlyapnikov proposed expanding the Council of People's Commissars by including representatives ‚Äúfrom all Soviet parties‚Äù. Their first public appearance as an organized group was at the 9th Congress of the Russian Communist Party (Bolsheviks), in September 1920, when the faction not only declared its existence, but also summed up the ‚Äúwork to be done‚Äù. = First appearances = One of the first speeches of representatives of the \\"workers' opposition\\" - the name was coined by Lenin \\\\- took place in February 1920, during the 2nd Tula Conference of the RCP (B.), after which the group managed to get a majority of seats in the provincial committee of the party, and its leader - I. V. Kopylov - became the chairman of the new composition of the provincial committee. In response to this, the former members of the provincial committee formed the opposition, directing their activities to prove the inability the \\"workers' opposition\\" to manage the affairs of the province; in addition, they began to plan the failure of their political opponents at the next provincial party conference. This confrontation led to an intensification of the struggle within the organization itself: the party‚Äôs Novosilsky District committee opposed the election of Kopylov and called for an extraordinary conference. The demand of the old guard was supported in Moscow by members of the party's central committee, who recalled Kopylov at their disposal. The conflict did not end there, because in response, the Zarechensky district committee issued a resolution requesting \\"to leave Kopylov to work in Tula.\\" The Central Committee nevertheless decided to convene an extraordinary party conference in the province: a resolution evaluating the work as unsatisfactory was adopted by a majority of 185 votes against 49. In response, representatives of the ‚Äúworkers' opposition‚Äù Severny and Nikitin left the district committee because of their disagreement with the party line. Having been defeated in Tula, Kopylov‚Äôs supporters nevertheless retained their positions in the Zarechensky district organization and the power struggle continued. At that time, support for the workers' opposition in the lower ranks of the party was quite strong: in particular, the number of Tula party organizations was halved between May and November 1920 , mainly due to the exit of the local workers. From the end of 1919 to the beginning of 1920, the workers' opposition matured along the periphery of Moscow Oblast and, by March 1920, took shape in the capital with many trade union leaders joining the group. In the same month, at a meeting of the communist faction of the All-Union Central Council of Trade Unions, Shlyapnikov proposed a formula for the separation of powers in the USSR: his simple scheme consisted in the separation of functions of trade unions, Soviets, and the Bolshevik party. According to the leader of the opposition, the party could be the responsible political state leader of the revolutionary struggle and construction, the Soviets - the form of political power, and the trade unions - the only responsible organizations of the national economy and, at the same time, the school of industrial management for workers. Shlyapnikov's theses caused great concern within the Central Committee of the RCP (b), which saw in them the manifestation of tendencies toward syndicalism in the Soviet trade unions - that is, an attempt on the leading role of the party in the economic sphere. On March 8 and 10, 1920, at meetings of the VTsSPS and MGPSS factions, representatives of the Central Committee Nikolai Bukharin and Nikolay Krestinsky sharply criticized Shlyapnikov‚Äôs ideas, accusing him of ‚Äúsyndicalism, guild narrowness, distrust of the Soviets and the party.‚Äù In response to such accusations, Lozovsky, who attended the meetings, noted that syndicalists denied the state itself, and Shlyapnikov had a different point of view: the opposition leader did not deny the state and did not encroach on state property; he talked only about the responsibility of trade unions for the economy and the main role of unions in Soviet industry. In September 1920, at the 9th Congress of the Russian Communist Party (Bolsheviks), there was a new flash of activity of supporters of the workers' opposition, which was associated with a discussion about the upper and lower classes of the party. Yuri Lutovinov formulated a number of provisions that later became part of the group‚Äôs opposition program: in his speech he ‚Äúfervently insisted on the immediate implementation of the broadest possible labor democracy, on the complete abolition of appointment, and on the strictest cleansing of the party.‚Äù The Bolshevik conference did not support this proposal: moreover, at the meeting it was decided to create a control commission, whose task was to prevent the factional struggle in the party. Despite such measures, the speeches of the supporters of the workers' opposition became more frequent throughout the country, and its contradictions with the course of the Central Committee intensified both in the regions and in the center. In particular, in November 1920, the Organizing Bureau of the Central Committee of the RCP (B.) was forced to pay special attention to the conflict in the Tula Provincial Committee of the RCP (B.), which flared up with renewed vigor: to clarify the circumstances, the central committee sent a special commission to the province. At the same time, in Moscow itself, the internal party struggle took on a fierce character. In the fall of 1920, playing on the problem of the upper and lower classes, the workers' opposition were able to attract the sympathy of many Bolsheviks to their program and form tangible support for their ideas among the party workers. As a result, at the end of November, at the gubernational conference, the opposition bloc was able to collect almost half of the delegates' votes: 124 against 154 people. As indicated in the Central Committee‚Äôs report, \\"the opposition itself was extremely hostile to the common party line\\": subsequently, Lenin noted that it came to the point that \\"the conference ended in two rooms\\". =Trade-union debate= Start of the debate The \\"trade-union debate\\" marked the rise of the \\"workers' opposition.\\" Relying on the provisions contained in the party program adopted at the 8th Congress of the Russian Communist Party (Bolsheviks) in 1919 - primarily on the part that ‚Äútrade unions should come to the total concentration of control over the entire national economy\\" - Shlyapnikov criticized the central committee with his like-minded comrades for ‚Äúmilitaristic methods‚Äù of working with trade unions, specifically because during the Russian Civil War, unions were massively deprived of independence and absorbed by the government of the RSFSR. According to Aleksei Semyonovich Kiselyov, serious disagreements with the party leadership among the trade union leaders emerged at the beginning of 1920: he saw them as the main reason for the transition to a policy of militarization of labor. At that time, the majority of trade unions believed that the prospect of the end of active hostilities required, if not a change in policy guidelines, then at least a shift in emphasis in the organization of labor - a transition to economic incentives. In particular, they advocated the improvement of the food situation of the proletariat and the development of \\"amateur activity\\" of workers within the framework of trade union organizations. Moreover, the party leadership proceeded from the assumption that in the prevailing conditions at the time of the end of the long war, reliance on conventional methods of industrial management would not be able to prevent the final collapse of the Soviet economy: they believed that emergency measures, including military ones, were necessary. Positions of the parties Questions about trade unions became key at meetings of the All-Union Central Council of Trade Unions on March 8, 10 and 15, 1920. According to Kiselyov, by that time in the leading circles of trade union leaders, three political groups could be identified. The first could be attributed to David Riazanov and Mikhail Tomsky, who believed that trade unions should withdraw from economic affairs and deal primarily with the organization of labor. The second group included those workers who advocated the ‚Äúmerging‚Äù of trade unions with the state apparatus. And the third group consisted of Shlyapnikov's supporters, who believed that trade unions should become the sole responsible organizations in the field of the national economy of the RSFSR. Thus, already in the spring of 1920, a heated discussion about trade unions began in Soviet Russia: it became open only in late 1920 - early 1921. At that time, a five-member ‚Äútrade union commission‚Äù was created for the central committees, the tasks of which included both studying and verifying the practical experience of the trade unions, and developing abstracts that would express the Central Committee‚Äôs point of view on this issue. However, Alexander Shlyapnikov, Yury Lutovinov and Leon Trotsky, initially included in this commission, refused to participate in it - which only aggravated the differences. Under these conditions, on December 24, the Plenum of the Central Committee decided to open a broad discussion on the question of trade unions. On December 30, 1920, leaders of intra-party groups spoke at an expanded meeting of the communist faction of the 8th All-Russian Congress of Soviets and All-Union Central Council of Trade Unions, where they outlined their political platforms. The controversy unfolding at the meeting was accompanied by mutual accusations and almost immediately \\"acquired a bad character.\\" From the beginning of January of the following year, party organizations joined in the discussion of issues: in particular, on January 3, at a meeting of the party‚Äôs active in Petrograd, an ‚ÄúAppeal to the Party‚Äù was adopted, expressing full support for the Lenin- Zinoviev group, and Trotsky was accused of trying to split the party and professional movement, \\"in the desire to eliminate unions\\". At the same time, the resolution proposed to send representatives to the 10th Congress of the Russian Communist Party (Bolsheviks) in proportion to the number of votes cast in support of each group. In addition, a desire was expressed to send agitators to the province who were obliged to provide propaganda and organizational assistance to local supporters of the Leninist group.  Support for the ‚ÄúWorkers' Opposition‚Äù Platform Almost from the very beginning, the discussion on trade unions went beyond the usual discussion of the theses of various fractions - and \\"turned into a kind of formal revealing of party opinion.\\" The question of the future of trade unions was brought up for discussion in district committees and district meetings of the Bolsheviks: usually, after reports of representatives of various platforms, voting was held at meetings. On the whole, the majority of Soviet communists supported the Leninist position; in particular, on January 17, 1921, eight platforms were put to a vote at a meeting of the party‚Äôs Moscow committee: 76 people voted for Lenin‚Äôs wording, 27 for Trotsky‚Äôs ideas, 4 for the theses of the ‚Äúworkers' opposition‚Äù, 11 for the Group of Democratic Centralism (who wanted more Soviet autonomy), 25 for the group of Ignatians, and the remaining platforms received less than two votes. On January 25, in the Tula party organization - where Trotsky, Zinoviev and Shlyapnikov acted as rapporteurs - 582 people voted for Lenin-Zinoviev‚Äôs resolution, 272 for Trotsky's and 16 delegates for Shlyapnikov's. The Petrograd party organization also supported the Leninist \\"Platform 10\\" and it gradually became apparent that the struggle in the capital was waged between the groups of Lenin‚ÄîZinoviev and Trotsky. A more \\"motley\\" picture was observed at the county and district meetings: on January 27, in the second Zamoskvoretsky district, 59 votes were cast for \\"platform 10\\", 10 for the theses of the \\"workers' opposition\\", and seven people supported the Trotskyists; in another district of Moscow - Baumansky - in the central area, 43 people voted for Lenin's thesis, 7 for the \\"workers' opposition\\", and 4 people for Trotsky‚Äôs principles. The trade unions themselves did not go around the discussion: in particular, at the congress of miners in Moscow, the platform of the \\"workers' opposition\\" gathered 61 votes in support, the \\"platform 10\\" - 137, and only eight people supported Trotsky's theses. At the Moscow Provincial Party Conference, held on February 19, 1921 and attended by more than three hundred delegates, there was a scandal: E. N. Ignatov declared support for the platform of the ‚Äúworkers' opposition‚Äù, which ‚Äúcaused great concern‚Äù among the conference members , since until the last day Ignatov‚Äôs group supported ‚Äúplatform 10‚Äù. The subsequent vote ended with the following result: ‚Äúplatform 10‚Äù received 217 votes, Trotsky's theses - 52, the platform of ‚Äúworkers' opposition‚Äù - 45, and the principles of ‚Äúdemocratic centralism‚Äù - 13 votes. In the central committee of metalworkers, the ‚Äúworkers' opposition‚Äù generally took first place: they were given eleven out of twenty votes. 10th Congress At the final stage of the \\"trade-union debate\\" of the Soviet Communists, to a large extent, the fate of the trade unions was no longer a cause for concern - the question of which fraction would win the upcoming 10th Congress of the Russian Communist Party (Bolsheviks) became more important. As a result, the struggle of the factions escalated into a battle for leadership in the party - which significantly affected the course of the discussion. The result of this congress was a Ban on factions in the Communist Party of the Soviet Union, putting an end to the aspirations of the Workers' Opposition and the Democratic Centralists.On Party Unity 16 March 1921; Soviet History Archive (marxists.org) 2002 =End of the movement= Members of the former Workers' Opposition continued to advocate their views during the period of the New Economic Policy but increasingly became politically marginalized. Nonetheless, on 5 July 1921 Kollontai took the floor before the Third Congress of the Comintern, bitterly attacking the policies of the Soviet government and warning that NEP 'threatened to disillusion workers, to strengthen the peasantry and petty bourgeoisie, and to facilitate the rebirth of capitalism'.Allen (A Proletarian From a Novel), pp. 183‚Äì184. Shlyapnikov and his supporters also conducted discussions with Gavril Myasnikov's Workers Group, but unlike Myasnikov, were determined not to leave the ranks of the Communist Party. At the beginning of 1922, former exponents of the Workers' Opposition, such as Shlyapnikov and Medvedev, and other members of the party of working class origins signed the so-called \\"Letter of the Twenty-Two\\", appealing to the Comintern Executive against suppression of dissent within the Russian party and bourgeois infiltrations into the Soviet state and the party itself. Kollontai co-signed the letter, with her best friend Zoya Shadurskaia, as intellectuals of non-working-class extraction, but in February 1922 she was restrained by Trotsky and Zinoviev from speaking before the Comintern Executive on behalf of the views expressed in the appeal.Allen (Early dissent), p. 31. Shlyapnikov, Kollontai, and Sergei Medvedev narrowly escaped expulsion from the Russian Communist Party at the party's subsequent Eleventh Congress in 1922, while two other signatories of the appeal, F. Mitin (b. 1882) and N. Kuznetsov (1898-1935), were expelled.Allen (Early dissent), p. 52 Kollontai later became an important diplomat and Shlyapnikov turned to writing his memoirs. In the latter half of the 1930s, Shlyapnikov and his closest comrades (Kollontai was not among them) were charged with having being involved in a counterrevolutionary group called \\"Workers' Opposition\\" and with having linked up with the \\"counterrevolutionary Trotskyist‚ÄìZinovievist terrorist bloc\\". Despite their proclaiming themselves innocent, both Shlyapnikov and Medvedev, along with many others, were condemned to death and executed in September 1937.Allen (Alexander Shlyapnikov), pp. 362‚Äì363. Tolokontsev, Kutuzov and Kiselyov were also put to death at the same time. Chelyshev had \\"died of a heart attack while under NKVD interrogation rather than confess to outlandish charges\\" (ibidem, p. 333). Lutovinov had already committed suicide in 1924. In her biography of Shlyapnikov Barbara Allen concludes the last chapter before epilogue, with these words: After the end of Stalinism, Shlyapnikov was rehabilitated in 1963, Medvedev in 1977. The decision annulling the latter's case for lack of evidence emphasized that \\"None of those judged on the Workers' Opposition case confessed guilt\\".Allen (Alexander Shlyapnikov), p. 367. A few minor figures, however, may have confessed. Membership The Workers' Opposition was led by Alexander Shlyapnikov, who was also chairman of the Russian Metalworkers' Union, and it consisted of trade union leaders and industrial administrators who had formerly been industrial workers. Alexandra Kollontai, the famous socialist feminist, was the group's mentor and advocate. Other prominent members included Sergei Medvedev and Mikhail Vladimirov (leaders of the Metalworkers' Union), Alexander Tolokontsev and Genrikh Bruno (artilleries industry leaders), Mikhail Chelyshev (a member of the Party Control Commission), Ivan Kutuzov (chairman of the Textileworkers' Union), Kirill Orlov (member of the Council of Military Industry and a participant in the 1905 mutiny on the Russian battleship Potemkin), and Aleksei Kiselyov (chairman of the Miners' Union). Yuri Lutovinov, a leader of the Metalworkers' Union and of the All-Russian Council of Trade Unions, sometimes spoke for the group, but sometimes held his own opinion. Ideology The Workers' Opposition advocated the role of unionized workers in directing the economy at a time when Soviet government organs were running industry by diktat and trying to exclude trade unions from a participatory role. Specifically, the Workers' Opposition demanded that unionized workers (blue and white collar) should elect representatives to a vertical hierarchy of councils that would oversee the economy. At all levels, elected leaders would be responsible to those who had elected them and could be removed from below. The Workers' Opposition demanded that Russian Communist Party secretaries at all levels cease petty interference in the operations of trade unions and that trade unions should be reinforced with staff and supplies to allow them to carry out their work effectively. Leaders of the Workers' Opposition were not opposed to the employment of \\"bourgeois specialists\\" in the economy, but did oppose giving such individuals strong administrative powers, unchecked from below. The \\"Workers' Opposition\\" based their ideas on the experience of the first months of Soviet power - a short period when the organization of production was really carried out on the basis of the self-government of the proletarians. Critics The Tenth Congress of the Russian Communist Party, in 1921, condemned the Workers' Opposition for factionalism, but adopted some of its proposals, including conducting a purge of the Party and organizing better supply of workers, to improve workers' living conditions. Several leaders of the Workers' Opposition, including Shlyapnikov, were elected to the Party Central Committee. Nevertheless, Party leaders subsequently undertook a campaign to subordinate trade unions to the Party and to harass and intimidate those who opposed this campaign.

He emigrated from Italy to Scotland at the age of four with his family. He attended Alloa Academy and then St. Joseph's College, Dumfries as a boarder, followed by two years of studies in Rome. Early career After Rome, Forte rejoined his family, who had moved to Weston-super- Mare, where his father ran a caf√© with two cousins. Charles's main training at the age of 21 came in Brighton, where he managed the Venetian At 26, he set up his first \\"milk bar\\" in 1935, the Strand Milk Bar Ltd, in [ the location. Soon he began expanding into catering and hotel businesses. At the outbreak of World War II, Forte was interned in the Isle of Man due to his Italian nationality, but he was released after only three months. After the war, his company became Forte Holdings Ltd and bought the Caf√© Royal in 1954. In the 1950s, he also opened the first catering facility at Heathrow Airport and the first full British motorway service station for cars at Newport Pagnell, Buckinghamshire, on the M1 motorway in 1959. He purchased the Hungaria Restaurant in Lower Regent St. in 1955. Later career Grave of Lord and Lady Forte in West Hampstead Cemetery Trust Houses Group Ltd and Forte Holdings were merged in 1970 to become Trust House Forte or THF. Through mergers and expansion, Forte expanded the Forte Group into a multibillion- pound business. His empire included the Little Chef and Happy Eater roadside restaurants, Crest, Forte Grand, Travelodge and Posthouse hotels, as well as the wine merchant Grierson-Blumenthal and a non-controlling majority stake in the Savoy Hotel. The Grierson-Blumenthal stake became a legally \\"forced\\" acquisition by the group. It had been a personal holding of Charles Forte and fellow directors of the group, supplying liquor to Forte restaurants and hotels at substantial personal profit, until the prejudice to shareholders was realised in the late 1970s (including possible prosecution under the Companies Act) which obliged its acquisition as a subsidiary. Forte was the CEO from 1971 and chairman from 1982 (when his son Rocco took over as CEO) of the Group. Happy Eater and the five Welcome Break major road service outlets were bought from Hanson Trust PLC on 1 August 1986. In the 1990s, the company increased its nominal capital and agreed to the public listed companies compliance regime to become Forte Group plc. Forte passed full control to his son Rocco in 1993, but soon the plc was faced with a hostile takeover bid from Granada. Ultimately, Granada succeeded with a ¬£3.9 billion tender offer in January 1996, which left the family with about ¬£350 million in cash. On 28 February 2007, Forte died in his sleep at his home in London, aged 98. He is buried in West Hampstead Cemetery. Honours and awards Forte was knighted by The Queen Mother in 1970 and created a life peer on 2 February 1982 as Baron Forte, of Ripley in the County of Surrey. He was also a knight of the Sovereign Military Order of Malta. Family In January 1943, Forte married Irene Mary Chierico, an English woman with Italian origin too, whose family had an important British import/export business in beverages. From the 1950s, Forte lived with an extended family including his parents and children at Greenway Gardens in Frognal, Hampstead, London.

He is venerated as a saint in the Oriental Orthodox Church, and his feast day is 8 February. Biography =Early life and education= Severus was born in the city of Sozopolis in Pisidia in c. 459,Barsoum (2003), p. 92 or c. 465,Sources that state Severus' birth in c. 465: *Gregory (1991) *Menze (2012) *Witakowski (2004), p. 115 into an affluent Christian family, however, later monophysite sources would assert that his parents were pagan.Witakowski (2004), pp. 115-116 His father was a senator in the city,Chapman (1911) and his paternal grandfather, also named Severus,St. Severus of Antioch. Northeast American Diocese of the Malankara Orthodox Syrian Church was the Bishop of Sozopolis and had attended the Council of Ephesus in 431. According to Severus' hagiography, he was named after his paternal grandfather as he had received a vision in which he was told, \\"the child who is for your son will strengthen Orthodoxy, and his name will be after your name\\". After his father's death, in 485, Severus travelled to Alexandria in Egypt to study grammar, rhetoric,Menze (2012) and philosophy, in both Greek and Latin.Barsoum (2003), p. 93 At Alexandria, he met Zacharias of Mytilene, a fellow student and friend, who persuaded him to read the works of Gregory of Nazianzus, and Basil of Caesarea, in particular his correspondence with Libanius. According to Zacharias, whilst students at Alexandria, he and Severus discovered and destroyed a hoard of pagan idols at the neighbouring city of Menouthis. In the autumn of 486, Severus travelled to Berytus in Phoenicia and studied law and philosophy at the law school, where he was later joined by Zacharias in 487. At Berytus, Severus and Zacharias led the expulsion of necromancers and enchanters from the city, and Severus began to dedicate his free time to studying the works of the Fathers of the Church. At this time, he joined a group of students led by a certain Evagrius who prayed together at the Church of the Resurrection every evening. Severus was convinced to be baptised, as he had not yet undergone baptism due to Pisidian custom in which men could not be baptised until they had grown a beard. In 488, he was baptised at the Church of Saint Leontius at Tripolis with Evagrius as his sponsor. =Monkhood= Severus subsequently adopted an ascetic life whereby he rejected bathing and adopted fasting. He initially intended to return to Pisidia and practise law, however, after a pilgrimage to the Church of Saint Leontius in Tripolis, the head of John the Baptist at Emesa, and Jerusalem, he resolved to join Evagrius and become a monk. Severus entered the monastery of Peter the Iberian near Maiuma in Palestine, a prominent centre of non-Chalcedonianism, and remained there for several years.Youssef (2015), p. 228 He later joined a monastic brotherhood in the desert near Eleutheropolis under the archimandrite Mamas.Venables (1911a) Severus practised asceticism in the desert until c. 500, at which time he became ill and was convinced to recover at the Monastery of Saint Romanus in Maiuma,Torrance (1998), p. 3 where he was ordained a priest by Epiphanius, Bishop of Magydus. At Maiuma, Severus received his inheritance from his parents, with which he shared the property with his brothers, donated most of his share to the poor, and constructed a monastery. On a walk outside the city, Severus came upon a hermit who left his cave to call out, \\"welcome to you Severus, teacher of Orthodoxy, and Patriarch of Antioch\\", despite never meeting Severus, the hermit thus prophesied Severus' ascension to the patriarchal throne. He remained at his monastery until 507/508, at which time Nephalius, a Chalcedonian monk, arrived at Maiuma and preached against Severus and other non-Chalcedonians. In 508, Nephalius wrote an apologia of the Council of Chalcedon,Torrance (1998), p. 4 to which Severus replied in his two Orationes ad Nephalium. In the same year, Patriarch Elias of Jerusalem commissioned Nephalius to expel non-Chalcedonian monks from their monasteries in Palestine, and Severus was sent to Constantinople to complain to Emperor Anastasius.Horn (2006), pp. 108-109 Severus travelled to Constantinople alongside 200 non-Chalcedonian monks, and gained favour with the emperor soon after his arrival. Patriarch Macedonius II of Constantinople attempted to sway Anastasius to support the Council of Chalcedon and presented the emperor with a collection of edited excerpts from the works of Cyril of Alexandria, an important Father of the Church who had died prior to the council. Severus, however, wrote Philalethes, and refuted Macedonius as the work of Cyril presented to the emperor was shown to be taken out of context. At Constantinople, Severus became friends with Julian, Bishop of Halicarnassus. Under Severus' influence, in 510, Anastasius allowed non- Chalcedonians to retake their monasteries, and, in 510/511, the emperor issued a typos (edict) that adopted the non-Chalcedonian interpretation of the Henotikon as law.Horn (2006), p. 110 After Macedonius' deposition and his succession by Timothy I, a non-Chalcedonian, in August 511, Severus returned to his monastery in Palestine. =Patriarch of Antioch= In 512, Flavian II, Patriarch of Antioch, was deposed by Anastasius, and a synod was held at Laodicea in Syria to elect a successor. Severus was elected on 6 November and consecrated at the Great Church of Antioch on 16 November. The consecration ceremony was attended by the bishops Dionysius of Tarsus, Nicias of Laodicea, Philoxenus of Hierapolis, Peter of Beroea, Simeon of Chalcis, Marion of Sura, Eusebius of Gabbula, Silvanus of Urima, Sergius of Cyrrhus, John of Europus, Philoxenus of Doliche, and Iulianus of Salamias.Honigmann (1947), p. 157 During the consecration ceremony, he affirmed the councils of Nicaea, Constantinople, and Ephesus, and the Henotikon.Torrance (1998), p. 5 Despite orders from Anastasius to not act or speak against the Council of Chalcedon,Horn (2006), p. 21 Severus condemned the council, as well as Pope Leo's Tome, Nestorius, Eutyches, Diodorus of Tarsus, Theodore of Mopsuestia, Ibas of Edessa, Barsauma, and Cyrus and John of Aigai. However, Severus could not be heard due to shouting and commotion, and he signed a declaration of faith at the ceremony's conclusion.Allen & Hayward (2004), p. 12 Upon his consecration, Severus had the baths at the patriarchal palace destroyed and the cooks sent away, in keeping with his abstinence from bathing and eating. He was accepted as Patriarch of Antioch by Patriarch Timothy I of Constantinople and Pope John of Alexandria, but Patriarch Elias of Jerusalem and other bishops refused to acknowledge him. Couriers taking synodical letters from Severus to Jerusalem were expelled from the city by Sabbas and a crowd congregated at the Church of the Holy Sepulchre and chanted, \\"anathema to Severus and his fellow communicants\\".Evans (2000), p. 107 Within Syria, Severus was popular amongst the population of the province of Syria Prima, which had largely adopted non-Chalcedonianism, whereas the province of Syria Secunda, which was home to a large Greek population who favoured Chalcedonianism, was hostile towards Severus. A synod was held at Tyre in Phoenicia in c. 514, at which the Council of Chalcedon and Leo's Tome was denounced, and Severus declared that the Henotikon had annulled the acts of the Council of Chalcedon. Severus began to exchange letters with Sergius the Grammarian at this time as Sergius had written to Antoninus, Bishop of Aleppo, who had asked Severus to respond. Sergius argued that the Synod of Tyre had made serious concessions to Chalcedonians, to which Severus responded with a treatise against Sergius. As patriarch, Severus and Peter, Archbishop of Apamea, were alleged to have hired Jewish mercenaries to kill 250 Chalcedonian pilgrims and leave their bodies unburied by the roadside. Chalcedonians also claimed that the monasteries that the pilgrims had fled to were set alight and the monks that had protected them were also killed. Between 514 and 518,Kazhdan (1991) John of Caesarea wrote an apologia of the Council of Chalcedon in response to Severus' Philalethes.Youssef (2015), p. 229 Severus wrote a treatise in defence of Philalethes, and began work on a reply to John of Caesarea. =Exile and death= Following Anastasius' death and his succession by Emperor Justin I in July 518, the bishops of Syria Secunda travelled to Constantinople and clamoured for Severus' deposition.Venables (1911b) Justin demanded Severus affirmed the Council of Chalcedon, to which he refused, and the emperor subsequently ordered Irenaeus, Count of the East, to arrest Severus and cut out his tongue.Knezevich (1991) Theodora, wife of Justinian, Justin's nephew and heir, discovered Justin's orders and warned Severus. On 25 September 518, Severus fled Antioch by boat to Alexandria, where he was well received by Pope Timothy III of Alexandria and the city's inhabitants. Severus' arrival in Egypt is celebrated by the Coptic Orthodox Church on 12 October.The Coming of Saint Severus, Patriarch of Antioch, to Egypt. Coptic Orthodox Church Network Despite his deposition, Severus did not cease to be seen as the legitimate Patriarch of Antioch by non- Chalcedonians.Arthur (2008), p. 102 During his exile in Egypt, Severus resided at the monastery of the Ennaton with Pope Timothy,Zissis (1987) and is known to have performed a number of miracles. He completed his three volume book, liber contra impium grammaticum, against John of Caesarea in c. 519. In his exile, Julian of Halicarnassus also took up residence at the monastery of the Ennaton and exchanged letters with Severus on the topic of the body of Christ. Whereas Julian had adopted aphthartodocetism, which argued that the body of Christ was incorruptible, Severus argued that the body of Christ was corruptible until the resurrection. He wrote five treatises against Julian, who responded in peri aphtharsias and an apologia.Constantelos (1987) The non- Chalcedonian community was quickly divided between \\"Severians\\", followers of Severus, and aphthartodocetae, and divisions remained unresolved until 527. The Severians were also known as the Pthartolatrae.Bates (1852), p. 137 Emperor Justinian, who succeeded his uncle Justin in 527, held a three-day synod at the Palace of Hormisdas in the spring of 532 at Constantinople to restore unity to the church through dialogue between five Chalcedonians and five or more non-Chalcedonians.Evans (2000), p. 111 The emperor invited Severus and promised immunity, however, he chose not to attend on the grounds of age and as he was accused of corruption and bribery, which he vehemently denied.Arthur (2008), p. 108 In c. 534, the non-Chalcedonian community faced further division with the separation of the Themistians from the Severians after their leader, Themistius, a deacon at Alexandria, advocated a more extreme belief of Christ's corruptibility.Frend (1991) At the invitation of Justinian, in the winter of 534/535,Torrance (1998), pp. 5-6 Severus travelled to Constantinople alongside Peter of Apamea and the monk Zooras.Roche (2003) At this time, Anthimus, Archbishop of Trebizond, was consecrated Patriarch of Constantinople and refused to affirm the Council of Chalcedon.Torrance (1998), p. 6 Severus successfully convinced Anthimus to adopt a position in line with himself and Pope Theodosius I of Alexandria. Severus' fortunes were quickly overturned as Pope Agapetus I of Rome arrived at Constantinople in March 536. Agapetus swayed Justinian to adopt a firm Chalcedonian position and Anthimus was replaced by Menas. Menas held a synod from 2 May to 4 June, at the conclusion of which Severus, Anthimus, Peter of Apamea, and Zooras were excommunicated.Bacchus (1913) On 6 August 536, Justinian issued an edict that charged Severus, Anthimus, Peter, and Zooras with Nestorianism and Eutychianism, banned Severus' books, and banished them from the capital and all major cities. Severus fled Constantinople with the aid of Empress Theodora and returned to Egypt. He resided at the residence of Dorotheus in the city of Sakha until his death on 5 February 538.Evans (2000), p. 184The Relocation of the Body of St. Severus, Patriarch of Antioch. Coptic Orthodox Church Network Dorotheus had Severus' body moved to the Zogag Monastery, and the relocation of the his body is celebrated on 19 December.

One of the first painters in Canada to adopt a Modernist and Post- Impressionist painting style,Lamoureux (2006) Carr did not receive widespread recognition for her work until the subject matter of her painting shifted from Aboriginal themes to landscapes‚Äîforest scenes in particular. As a writer, Carr was one of the earliest chroniclers of life in British Columbia. The Canadian Encyclopedia describes her as a \\"Canadian icon\\".Canadian Encyclopedia  Early life  Emily Carr House, Government Street, Victoria - now a Cultural Heritage Site Born in Victoria, British Columbia, in 1871, the year British Columbia joined Canada, Emily Carr was the second-youngest of nine children born to English parents Richard and Emily (Saunders) Carr.BC HeritageVancouver Art Gallery The Carr home was on Birdcage Walk (now Government Street), in the James Bay district of Victoria, a short distance from the legislative buildings (nicknamed the 'Birdcages') and the town itself. The Carr children were raised on English tradition. Richard Carr, born in England, believed it was sensible to live on Vancouver Island, a colony of Great Britain, where he could practice English customs and continue his British citizenship. The family home was made up in lavish English fashion, with high ceilings, ornate moldings, and a parlor.Braid (2000), p. 13. Carr was taught in the Presbyterian tradition, with Sunday morning prayers and evening Bible readings. Richard Carr called on one child per week to recite the sermon, and Emily consistently had trouble reciting it.Braid (2000), pp. 15‚Äì16. Carr's mother died in 1886, and her father died in 1888. Her oldest sister Edith Carr became the guardian of the rest of the children. Carr's father encouraged her artistic inclinations, but it was only in 1890, after her parents' deaths, that Carr pursued her art seriously. She studied at the San Francisco Art Institute for two years (1890‚Äì1892) before returning to Victoria. In 1899 Carr traveled to London, where she studied at the Westminster School of Art. Carr also visited the Nootka Indian mission at Ucluelet on the west coast of Vancouver Island in 1898. She traveled also to a rural art colony in St Ives, Cornwall, returning to British Columbia in 1905. Carr took a teaching position in Vancouver at the 'Ladies Art Club' that she held for no longer than a month ‚Äì she was unpopular amongst her students due to her rude behavior of smoking and cursing at them in class, and the students began to boycott her courses.Braid (2000), pp. 55‚Äì56.  First works on Indigenous people  In 1898, at age 27, Carr made the first of several sketching and painting trips to Aboriginal villages. She stayed in a village near Ucluelet on the west coast of Vancouver Island, home to the Nuu-chah-nulth people, then commonly known to English-speaking people as 'Nootka'. Carr recalled that her time in Ucluelet made \\"a lasting impression on me\\". Her interest in Indigenous life was reinforced by a trip to Alaska nine years later with her sister Alice. In 1912, Carr took a sketching trip to First Nations' villages in Haida Gwaii, the Upper Skeena River, and Alert Bay. Even though Carr left the villages of the Pacific Northwest, the impact of the people stayed with her. Carr adopted the Indian name Klee Wyck and she also chose it as the title of one of her works of writings.  Work in France  Determined to further her knowledge of the age's evolving artistic trends, in 1910 Carr returned to Europe to study at the Acad√©mie Colarossi in Paris. In Montparnasse with her sister Alice, Emily Carr met modernist painter Harry Gibb with a letter of introduction.Carr (2005) Upon viewing his work, she and her sister were shocked and intriguedBraid (2000), pp. 61‚Äì63. by his use of distortion and vibrant color; she wrote: \\"Mr Gibb's landscapes and still life delighted me ‚Äî brilliant, luscious, clean. Against the distortion of his nudes I felt revolt.\\" Carr's study with Gibb and his techniques shaped and influenced her style of painting, and she adopted a vibrant color palette rather than continuing with the pastel colors of her earlier British training.Braid (2000), p. 66. Emily Carr, Breton church, oil on canvas, 1906 Carr was greatly influenced by the Post-Impressionists and the Fauvists she met and studied with in France. After returning home in 1912, she organized an exhibition in her studio of seventy watercolors and oils representative of her time there. She was the first artist to introduce Fauvism to Vancouver.Baldissera (2015), p. 9.  Return to Canada  In March 1912 Carr opened a studio at 1465 West Broadway in Vancouver. When locals failed to support her radical new style, bold colour palette and lack of detail, she closed the studio and returned to Victoria.Vancouver Art Gallery, Early totems In the summer of 1912, Carr again traveled north, to Haida Gwaii and the Skeena River, where she documented the art of the Haida, Gitxsan and Tsimshian. At Cumshewa, a Haida village on Moresby Island, she wrote: Carr painted a carved raven, which she later developed as her iconic painting Big Raven. Tanoo, another painting inspired by work gathered on this trip, depicts three totems before house fronts at the village of the same name. On her return to the south, Carr organized an exhibit of some of this work. She gave a detailed lecture about the Aboriginal villages that she had visited, which ended with her mission statement: While there was some positive reaction to her work, even in the new 'French' style,Shadbolt (1990), p. 40. Carr perceived that Vancouver's reaction to her work and new style was not positive enough to support her career. She recounted as much in her book Growing Pains. She was determined to give up teaching and working in Vancouver, and in 1913 she returned to Victoria, where several of her sisters still lived. During the next 15 years, Carr did little painting. She ran a boarding house known as the 'House of All Sorts'. It was the namesake and provided source material for her later book. With her financial circumstances straitened and her life in Victoria circumscribed, Carr painted a few works in this period drawn from local scenes: the cliffs at Dallas Road, the trees in Beacon Hill Park. Her own assessment of the period was that she had ceased to paint, which was not strictly true, although \\"[a]rt had ceased to be the primary drive of her life.\\"Shadbolt (1990), p. 42. Emily Carr, Kitwancool, 1928  Growing recognition  Over time Carr's work came to the attention of several influential and supportive people, including Marius Barbeau, a prominent ethnologist at the National Museum in Ottawa. Barbeau in turn persuaded Eric Brown, Director of Canada's National Gallery, to visit Carr in 1927.Shadbolt (1990), p. 52. Brown invited Carr to exhibit her work at the National Gallery as part of an exhibition on West Coast Aboriginal art. Carr sent 26 oil paintings east, along with samples of her pottery and rugs with Indigenous designs.Shadbolt (1990), p. 53. The exhibit, which also included works by Edwin Holgate and A.Y. Jackson, traveled to Toronto and Montreal. Carr continued to travel throughout the late 1920s and 1930s away from Victoria. Her last trip north was in the summer of 1928, when she visited the Nass and Skeena rivers, as well Haida Gwaii, formerly known as the Queen Charlotte Islands. She also travelled to Friendly Cove and the northeast coast of Vancouver Island, and then up to Lillooet in 1933. Recognition of her work grew steadily, and her work was exhibited in London, Paris, Washington, DC, and Amsterdam, as well as major Canadian cities.Breuer & Dodd (1984) Carr held her first solo show in eastern Canada in 1935 at the Women's Art Association of Canada gallery in Toronto.Holmlund & Youngberg (2003)  Association with the Group of Seven  The Indian Church, 1929. Lawren Harris bought the painting and showcased it in his home. He considered it Carr's best work. It was at the exhibition on West Coast Aboriginal art at the National Gallery in 1927 that Carr first met members of the Group of Seven, at that time Canada's most recognized modern painters. Lawren Harris of the Group became a particularly important support: \\"You are one of us,\\" he told Carr, welcoming her into the ranks of Canada's leading modernists. The encounter ended the artistic isolation of Carr's previous 15 years, leading to one of her most prolific periods, and the creation of many of her most notable works. Through her extensive correspondence with Harris, Carr also became aware of and studied Northern European symbolism.Vancouver Art Gallery, Artistic Context Carr's artistic direction was influenced by the Group, and by Lawren Harris in particular, not only by his work, but also by his belief in Theosophy. Carr struggled to reconcile this with her own conception of God.Shadbolt (1990), p. 58. Carr's ‚Äúdistrust for institutional religion‚Äù pervades much of her art.Walker (1996), p. 114. She became influenced by Theosophic thought, like many artists of the time, and began to form a new vision of God as nature. She led a spiritual way of life, rejecting the Church and the religious institution. She painted raw landscapes found in the Canadian wilderness, mystically animated by a greater spirit.  Influence of the Pacific Northwest school  In 1924 and 1925, Carr exhibited at the Artists of the Pacific Northwest shows in Seattle, Washington. Fellow exhibitor Mark Tobey came to visit her in Victoria in the autumn of 1928 to teach an advanced course in her studio. Working with Tobey, Carr furthered her understanding of contemporary art, experimenting with Tobey's methods of full-on abstraction and Cubism, but she was reluctant to go to Tobey's extremes.Vancouver Art Gallery, Modernism and Late Totems Appelhof (1988) Although Carr expressed reluctance about abstraction, the Vancouver Art Gallery, a major curator of Carr's work, records Carr in this period as abandoning the documentary impulse and starting to concentrate instead on capturing the emotional and mythological content embedded in the totemic carvings. She jettisoned her painterly and practiced Post-Impressionist style in favour of creating highly stylized and abstracted geometric forms.  Focus shift and late life  Emily Carr, Odds and Ends, 1939 Carr suffered a heart attack in 1937, and another in 1939, forcing her to move in with her sister Alice to recover. In 1940 Carr suffered a serious stroke, and in 1942 she had another heart attack.Vancouver Art Gallery, Chronology With her ability to travel curtailed, Carr's focus shifted from her painting to her writing. The editorial assistance of Carr's friend Ira Dilworth, a professor of English, enabled Carr to see her own first book, Klee Wyck, published in 1941. Carr was awarded the Governor-General's Award for non-fiction the same year for the work.National Historic PersonGovernor General's Award Paintings from Carr's last decade reveal her growing anxiety about the environmental impact of industry on British Columbia's landscape. Her work from this time reflected her growing concern over industrial logging, its ecological effects and its encroachment on the lives of Indigenous people. In her painting Odds and Ends, from 1939 \\"the cleared land and tree stumps shift the focus from the majestic forestscapes that lured European and American tourists to the West Coast to reveal instead the impact of deforestation.\\"Baldissera (2015), p. 36. Emily Carr suffered her last heart attack and died on March 2, 1945, at the James Bay Inn in her hometown of Victoria, British Columbia, shortly before she was to have been awarded an honorary doctorate by the University of British Columbia.Shadbolt (1990), p. 182. Carr is buried at Ross Bay Cemetery. she was great  Work  = Painting = Emily Carr, Autumn in France, 1911. National Gallery of Canada Carr is remembered primarily for her painting. She was one of the first artists to attempt to capture the spirit of Canada in a modern style. Previously, Canadian painting had been mostly portraits and representational landscapes. Carr's main themes in her mature work were natives and nature: \\"native totem poles set in deep forest locations or sites of abandoned native villages\\" and, later, \\"the large rhythms of Western forests, driftwood-tossed beaches and expansive skies\\". She blended these two themes in ways uniquely her own. Her \\"qualities of painterly skill and vision [...] enabled her to give form to a Pacific mythos that was so carefully distilled in her imagination\\". At the California School of Design in San Francisco, Carr participated in art classes which were focused on a variety of artistic styles. Many of Carr's art professors were trained in the Beaux Arts tradition in Paris, France. Though she took classes in drawing, portraiture, still life, landscape painting, flower painting, Carr preferred to paint landscapes. Carr is known for her paintings of First Nations villages and Pacific Northwest Indian totems, but Maria Tippett explains that Carr's rare depictions of the forests of British Columbian from within make her work unique. Carr constructed a new understanding of Cascadia. This understanding includes a new approach to the presentation of native people and Canadian landscapes. After visiting the Gitksan village of Kitwancool in the summer of 1928, Carr became captivated by the maternal imagery in Pacific Northwest Indian totem poles. After Carr was exposed to these types of images, her paintings reflected these images of mother and child in Native carvings. Her painting can be divided into several distinct phases: her early work, before her studies in Paris; her early paintings under the Fauvist influence of her time in Paris; a post- impressionist middle period before her encounter with the Group of Seven; and her later, formal period, under the post-cubist influences of Lawren Harris and American artist and friend, Mark Tobey.Shadbolt (1990), p. 70. Carr used charcoal and watercolor for her sketches, and later, house paint thinned with gasoline on manila paper.Vancouver Art Gallery, Technical Practices The greatest part of her mature work was oil on canvas or, when money was scarce, oil on paper. On November 28, 2013, one of Carr's paintings, The Crazy Stair (The Crooked Staircase), sold for $3.39 million at a Toronto art auction.Slaughter (November 28, 2013) As of the sale, it is a record price for a painting by a Canadian female artist. = Writing = Carr is also remembered for her writing, largely about her native friends. In addition to Klee Wyck, Carr wrote The Book of Small (1942), The House of All Sorts (1944), and, published posthumously, Growing Pains (1946), Pause (1953), The Heart of a Peacock (1953), and Hundreds and Thousands (1966). Some of these books are autobiographical and reveal Carr as an accomplished writer. Criticisms have been made of her dramatized short stories as many readers expect them to be historically accurate.  Recognition  Emily Carr, Blunden Harbour, 1930 Carr's life itself made her a \\"Canadian icon\\", according to the Canadian Encyclopedia. As well as being \\"an artist of stunning originality and strength\\", she was an exceptionally late bloomer, starting the work for which she is best known at the age of 57 (see Grandma Moses). Carr was also an artist who succeeded against the odds, living in an artistically unadventurous society, and working mostly in seclusion away from major art centers, thus making her \\"a darling of the women's movement\\" (see Georgia O'Keeffe, whom she met in 1930 in New York City). Emily Carr brought the north to the south; the west to the east; glimpses of the ancient culture of the Indigenous peoples of the Americas to the most newly arrived Europeans on the continent. In 1952, works by Emily Carr along with those of David Milne, Goodridge Roberts and Alfred Pellan represented Canada at the Venice Biennale. Venice Biennale In the 1960s her works were exhibited at Galerie L'Art fran√ßais.Galerie L'Art fran√ßais On February 12, 1971 Canada Post issued a 6¬¢ stamp 'Emily Carr, painter, 1871‚Äì1945' designed by William Rueter based on Carr's Big Raven (1931), held by the Vancouver Art Gallery.Canada Post Stamp (1971) On May 7, 1991, Canada Post issued a 50¬¢ stamp 'Forest, British Columbia, Emily Carr, 1931‚Äì1932' designed by Pierre-Yves Pelletier based on Forest, British Columbia (1931‚Äì1932), also from the Vancouver Art Gallery collection.Canada Post Stamp (1991) In 2014‚Äì2015, the Dulwich Picture Gallery in south London hosted a solo exhibition, the first time such show was held in Britain.

Tippett's biography won the Governor General's Award for English-language non-fiction in 1979. Several biographies have been published of Carr's life with unsubstantiated speculations. Novelist Susan Vreeland's 2004 The Forest Lover brings in characters that did not exist in Carr's life, as well as factually recounting incidents that may not have happened. The book is a novelisation, not biography, based on events from Carr's life, using Emily Carr as the main character/protagonist and altering some characters and chronology for the purpose of pacing. Each part of the novel is introduced by a reproduction of a Carr painting.Vreeland (2004)The 2011 unpublished thesis,\\"Canadian Artist Emily Carr: A Psychoanalytic Portrait,\\" by Phyllis Marie Jensen, PhD, was accepted by the International School of Analytic Psychology in Zurich.  Archives  The British Columbia Archives holds the largest collection of Emily Carr artworks, sketches, and archival materials, which includes the Emily Carr fonds, the Emily Carr Art Collection, and a wealth of archival documents in held in the fonds of Carr's friends. There is an Emily Carr fonds at Library and Archives Canada. The archival reference number is R1969, former archival reference number MG30-D215. The fond covers the date range 1891 to 1991. It consists of 1.764 meters of textual records, 10 photographs, 1 print, 7 drawings. A number of the records have been digitized and are available online.

Early life Born in Saccarappa, Maine in 1825, into a large and indigent family of rural Maine. When his father, Deacon Akers, moved the family from Saccarappa to Salmon Falls on the Saco River, he started a wood-turning mill. For six years as a young man he worked in his father's \\"wood turning\\" mill. There he invented beautiful patterns and \\"turned\\" toys. His brother, Charles \\"Carl\\" Akers was also a sculptor and crayon portrait artist. He wrote articles on art for the Atlantic Monthly and also The Crayon, a short-lived, New York art magazine in the mid-19th century. He spent the winter of 1849 in Boston learning the art of plaster casting with the sculptor, Joseph Carew. In 1850 he opened a studio in Portland, Maine. He received a \\"Commemorative Silver Medal\\" in the 1854 Exhibition and Fair of the Maine Charitable Mechanic Association. He moved to Boston in 1849 where he was an apprentice. The award was for his bas relief called Peace. In 1855, at age 30, he went to Rome, Italy where he worked for several years. Career Patron John Neal claimed Akers was \\"the first person, man or woman, that ever tried to model anything in the shape of a head\\" in Portland, Maine. Neal provided Akers a studio space and commissioned his first bust.Neal 1874, p23 Among his works are busts of Edward Everett and Henry Wadsworth Longfellow, a head of John Milton and The Dead Pearl Diver,Portland Museum of Art on display at the Portland Museum of Art. Nathaniel Hawthorne described Dead Pearl Diver as an important work of the protagonist, Kenyon, in his novel The Marble Faun, acknowledging his debt to Akers in the introduction. Neal lamented his passing, claiming that \\"had he lived a few years longer, he would have built up a reputation for himself and his beloved country, well worth coveting.Neal 1874, p24 Marriage and children In 1858 he met Elizabeth Akers Allen a young mother, journalist and poet. They married in August 1860. Their only child, Gertrude Rothermel, died in infancy. He died in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania on May 21, 1861 from tuberculosis. He is buried in Portland's Evergreen Cemetery.

They are characterized as a nomadic race who live on the planet Tatooine. Depiction George Lucas cited Bedouins as the inspiration for Tusken Raiders. The Tusken Raiders are depicted as xenophobic and are known to be highly aggressive in their interactions with other species. They dress in heavy cloth robes, and have covered their heads with strips of cloth to hold a breath mask and eye protection on. They have learned how to train the Banthas native to Tatooine as mounts, and a marauding group of Tuskens will ride them single file, to hide their numbers. Although the Sand People are aggressive and violent by nature, they have deep-seated traditions that they cling to tightly. Young raiders are required to prove their adulthood in various physical activities, the hardest of which is the manhood ritual of hunting down a krayt dragon. While the Sand People have no written language, the most revered member of a Tusken clan is the storyteller. He knows the life-story of every member of his clan, and also knows of the clan's history. The storyteller is required to memorize the histories word- for-word, eliminating any chance for misinterpretation or distortion. Apprentice storytellers often are more hard-pressed to prove themselves than warriors, for a single mistake in reciting the histories means instant death.Video Game Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic, 2003 As violent as their nature is, Sand People stay as far from the moisture farmers as the farmers do them. There are occasional skirmishes with the more outlying settlements. Specialists studying the past of the Tusken Raiders also used the term Ghorfa to denote an earlier sedentary phase of their culture, and lastly Kumumgah, for the earliest stratum of sentient civilization on the planet, believed by some to represent a common ancestry shared by the Ghorfas (the Tuskens) and the Jawas. Appearances in Star Wars media Tusken Raiders first appear in Star Wars when a pack of them attack Luke Skywalker in the Jundland Wastes and knock him unconscious. However, just as they are going through Luke's landspeeder, Obi-Wan Kenobi frightens them off by imitating a Krayt dragon's mating call and rescues Luke. Tusken Raiders briefly appear in Episode I: The Phantom Menace, taking shots at the Boonta Eve Classic Podracer pilots, and again in Episode II: Attack of the Clones, set 22 years before Star Wars; in this film, they kidnap Anakin Skywalker's mother, Shmi Skywalker, and torture her for a month. Anakin eventually finds her, but she is mortally injured and dies in his arms. Seized by a violent rage, Anakin slaughters the entire tribe including the women and children. Tusken Raiders appear briefly in The Mandalorian; In Season 1, Episode 5, the Mandalorian comes across a small group of Raiders while travelling through their land, in search of a Bounty. They are initially hostile until he communicates with them via sign language. He successfully barters a pair of binoculars in exchange for safe passage. Expanded Universe According to the noncanon Star Wars Expanded Universe sources, Tusken Raiders are named after Fort Tusken, an early Old Republic mining settlement in which all of the settlers were overwhelmed, captured, or killed by Tusken Raiders, then referred to as \\"Sand People\\". The attack probably occurred due to the fort's placement over one of the Raiders' holy wells. The comic book series Star Wars: Republic explains that exiled Jedi Sharad Hett and his son A'Sharad Hett lived among the Tusken Raiders for many years. Hett was one of the few non-Tuskens to be accepted into their ranks and was even given the title of \\"warlord\\". Although A'Sharad Hett believed he was half-Tusken for the better part of his life, during his training on Coruscant he learned that Humans and Tusken Raiders were genetically unable to interbreed. This leads him to believe that his mother must have been a human, captured by the Tusken Raiders at a young age and raised as a Tusken. The series Star Wars: Legacy, set some 200 years later, reveals that A'Sharad eventually turned to the dark side of the Force and, as the Sith Lord Darth Krayt, briefly conquered the galaxy. In the Junior Jedi Knights and New Jedi Order series, it is revealed that Jedi Knight Tahiri Veila was raised by the Tusken Raiders after they killed her parents. A Tusken Raider named \\"Hoar\\" appears as a playable character in the PlayStation fighting game Star Wars: Masters of Ter√§s K√§si. In the Xbox Original game Star Wars: Battlefront II players are allowed to play as Tusken Raiders in a special game mode called \\"hunt\\". Tusken Raiders appear in Knights of the Old Republic and The Old Republic when players visit Tatooine. If the player pursues peace between the Tusken Raiders and the local mining corporations in Knights of the Old Republic, the player will be given an opportunity to learn the entire history of the Tusken Raiders and Tatooine. During the recital of Tusken Raider history, the player learns that Tusken Raiders were once human exactly like the player, Tatooine though now a desert planet was once a lush and verdant world, and the original Humans in the Star Wars Galaxy were abducted from this world by the Rakata of the Infinite Empire and then seeded among the stars as slaves building the Infinite Empire's monuments. Eventually the humans of Tatooine rebelled against the Infinite Empire, and in retaliation their world was destroyed by an orbital bombardment of the entire surface. Remaining groups of survivors adapted to the world's new destroyed surface, and the lesson that they took from all of this was that it was a sin to advance technologically and reach for the stars like their ancestors did. The player's companion will note that because the history has been passed only through recitation that it may be inaccurate; however almost everything the Tusken Raider recites to the player is confirmed throughout the game, and the only thing left to be confirmed is whether or not the Tusken Raiders were in fact once human and the origin for all humans throughout the galaxy.

Produced by Tom Dowd, the album was released on February 12, 1972, in the United States by Capricorn Records. Following their artistic and commercial breakthrough with the release of the live album At Fillmore East (1971), the Allman Brothers Band got to work on their third studio album. Many in the band were struggling, however, with heroin addictions, and checked into rehab to confront these problems. On October 29, 1971, group leader and founder Duane Allman was killed in a motorcycle accident in the band's hometown of Macon, Georgia, making it the final album to feature the guitarist. Eat a Peach was a mix of studio recordings‚Äîboth with and without Duane Allman‚Äîand recordings from the band's famed 1971 Fillmore East performances. The album contains the extended half-hour-long \\"Mountain Jam\\", which was long enough to take up two full sides of the original double-LP. Other highlights include vocalist Gregg Allman's performance of his brother's favorite song, \\"Melissa\\", plus Dickey Betts' \\"Blue Sky\\", which went on to become a classic rock radio staple. The album artwork was created by W. David Powell and J. F. Holmes at Wonder Graphics, and depicts the band's name on a peach truck, in addition to a large gatefold mural of mushrooms and fairies. The album's title came from a quote by Duane Allman: \\"You can't help the revolution, because there's just evolution ... Every time I'm in Georgia, I eat a peach for peace\\". Issued as a double album in February 1972, Eat a Peach was an immediate commercial success and peaked at number four on Billboard Top 200 Pop Albums chart. The album was later certified platinum and remains a top seller in the band's discography. Background The Allman Brothers Band had struggled to achieve commercial success in their two and a half years on the touring circuit; their first two studio albums, The Allman Brothers Band (1969) and Idlewild South (1970), had debuted to only modest sales. Despite this, they had achieved significant acclaim due to their live performances, which included extended jam renditions of songs. The band's third release was a live album, titled At Fillmore East, and represented their artistic and commercial breakthrough: it immediately received solid sales upon its July 1971 release and went gold some months later. In about a \\"three-or-four-week period\\", the band quite literally went from \\"rags to riches\\", and were able to pay their debts to manager Phil Walden and record label Capricorn Records. Although suddenly very wealthy and successful, much of the band and its entourage now struggled with heroin addiction. Four individuals‚Äîgroup leader Duane Allman, bassist Berry Oakley, and roadies Robert Payne and Joseph \\"Red Dog\\" Campbell‚Äîchecked into the Linwood-Bryant Hospital for rehabilitation in October 1971. Their addictions had begun to affect their performances and matters seemed to only be getting worse, according to many involved. The clinic was deemed a \\"joke\\" and a \\"nuthouse\\" by Payne and Red Dog, and was later described as more of a psychiatric ward, as true rehabilitation clinics were several years away. All involved (including Duane) struggled to keep off the substance in the ensuing days. Despite this, Duane fueled the band's passion to get better and end their addictions: \\"Duane was so happy and full of positive energy. He was always like that unless he was just totally wasted. He was the leader, the great soul, and he kept saying, 'We are on a mission and it's time for this thing to happen,'\\" said Linda Oakley. \\"He was moving forward, and that energized everyone else. Everyone fed off of that.\\" On October 29, 1971, Duane Allman, aged 24, was killed in a motorcycle accident a day after returning to the band's home of Macon, Georgia. Allman was riding at a high speed on his motorcycle at the intersection of Hillcrest Avenue and Bartlett Street as a flatbed truck carrying a lumber crane approached. The flatbed truck stopped suddenly in the intersection, forcing Allman to swerve his Harley-Davidson Sportster motorcycle sharply to the left to avoid a collision. As he was doing so, he struck either the back of the truck or the ball on the lumber crane and was immediately thrown from the motorcycle. The motorcycle bounced into the air, landed on Allman and skidded another 90 feet with Allman pinned underneath, crushing several internal organs. Though he was alive when he arrived at the hospital, despite immediate emergency surgery, he died several hours later from massive internal injuries. The loss devastated all who knew Allman, just as At Fillmore East climbed into the top 15 of the national album charts. Recording and production The band completed Eat a Peach following Duane Allman's death in late 1971. Several weeks before the gold certification of At Fillmore East and their rehabilitation, the band headed to Miami's Criteria Studios with producer Tom Dowd to work on their third studio album. The band first began recording the album one month prior, when they laid down the initial tracks for \\"Blue Sky\\". The band saved money on studio time by writing and debuting songs on the road. The band worked on three songs: \\"Blue Sky\\", an instrumental titled \\"The Road to Calico\\" (which would eventually develop into \\"Stand Back\\", with added vocals) and \\"Little Martha\\", the only song solely credited to Duane Allman. The band laid down these three songs and went back on the road for a short run of shows, and at this point several checked into rehab. After Duane's death, the band held a meeting on their future; it was clear all wanted to continue, and after a short period, the band returned to the road. Drummer Butch Trucks later said, \\"We all had this thing in us and Duane put it there. He was the teacher and he gave something to us‚Äîhis disciples‚Äîthat we had to play out.\\" Following these tragic events, lead guitarist Dickey Betts gradually took over the role as group leader. The band returned to Miami in December to complete work on the album. Twiggs Lyndon, a friend of the band, joined them; he had just completed a stay in a psychiatric hospital stemming from his 1970 arrest for the murder of a concert promoter. Lyndon became the band's production manager. The band recorded four more tracks with Dowd, including \\"Melissa\\", \\"Les Brers in A Minor\\", and \\"Ain't Wastin' Time No More\\". Allman's death provided the band with motivation; \\"We were all putting more into it, trying so hard to make it as good as it would have been with Duane. We knew our driving force, our soul, the guy that set us all on fire, wasn't there and we had to do something for him,\\" said Trucks. The heroin addictions had taken their toll on the band members; Gregg Allman later said, \\"We were taking vitamins, we had doctors coming over and sticking us in the ass with B12 shots every day. Little by little by little, we crawled back up to the point where we were standing erect.\\" The other material on Eat a Peach comes from live recordings. Dowd later said, \\"When we recorded At Fillmore East, we ended up with almost a whole other album's worth of good material, and we used [two] tracks on Eat a Peach. Again, there was no overdubbing\\". Dowd started the mixing process for Eat a Peach but had run overtime and was called to commitments with Crosby, Stills and Nash; longtime Allman friend and colleague Johnny Sandlin took over for the remaining mixes. Sandlin later said of the mixing process, \\"As I mixed songs like \\"Blue Sky,\\" I knew, of course, that I was listening to the last things that Duane ever played and there was just such a mix of beauty and sadness, knowing there's not going to be any more from him\\". He was particularly proud of his mixing work on the album, but was angry because he did not receive credit, only a \\"special thanks\\". Completing the recording of Eat a Peach raised each members' spirits; Allman said, \\"The music brought life back to us all, and it was simultaneously realized by every one of us. We found strength, vitality, newness, reason, and belonging as we worked on finishing Eat a Peach\\". \\"Those last three songs ... just kinda floated right on out of us ... The music was still good, it was still rich, and it still had that energy‚Äîit was still the Allman Brothers Band.\\" Composition Much of the music on Eat a Peach that was recorded after Duane's death directly dealt with the tragedy. \\"Ain't Wastin' Time No More\\" was written by Gregg Allman for his brother, Duane, immediately following his death. The song was composed on a 110-year-old Steinway piano in Studio D of Criteria. \\"Ain't Wastin'\\" was composed when Duane was still alive, but the lyrics deal with his passing, as well as veterans coming home from the Vietnam War. The song relates to the theme that \\"death is an inescapable inevitability‚Äîthat every day is precious.\\" \\"Les Brers in A Minor\\" is an instrumental penned by Dickey Betts, and its title is \\"bad French\\" for \\"less brothers\\". When writing the song, all in the band felt something was familiar about the song; it turned out to be a solo of Betts's from live renditions of \\"Whipping Post\\". It resurfaced many years later on a bootleg recording. \\"Les Brers\\" began recording in the newly constructed Studio C of the recording complex at Criteria, but the band disliked the sound captured in the room and moved to Studio A. As a result, the recording contains a slight pitch variation due to the difficulty of matching the original speed of the instruments when the intro was spliced onto the master tape. Gregg Allman recorded \\"Melissa\\" primarily as a tribute to his brother, who adored the song; the song was written in 1967 while staying in a hotel in Pensacola, Florida and was one of the first he saved after dozens of writing attempts. Allman had previously not shown it to other members of the band (\\"I thought it was too soft for the Allman Brothers,\\" he said), and was saving it for a possible solo album he assumed he would one day record. \\"One Way Out\\" was recorded on June 27, 1971 at the band's final concert at the Fillmore East, which was shut down after that date, and \\"Trouble No More\\" and \\"Mountain Jam\\" were culled from the band's March performances. \\"Mountain Jam\\" was always intended for inclusion on the band's next album; the band teased its appearance by including the opening seconds on the fade-out of the final song on At Fillmore East. The band considered it a signature song of the group, but they deemed the performance that was recorded relatively mediocre. Artwork and title Eat a Peach gatefold art The album's artwork was created by W. David Powell at Wonder Graphics. He had seen old postcards at a drugstore in Athens, Georgia, one depicting a peach on a truck and a watermelon on a rail car. Believing them perfect for an Allman Brothers album, he purchased them and \\"bought cans of pink and baby-blue Krylon spray paint and created a matted area to make the cards on a twelve-by-twenty-four LP cover.\\" He envisioned the album having \\"an early-morning-sky feel\\". He hand- lettered the band name and photographed it with a small Kodak camera, developing the photos at the drugstore. He then cut and pasted the letters on the side of the truck, underneath the peach. The album includes an elaborate gatefold mural featuring a fantasy landscape of mushrooms (referencing the psychedelic drug) and fairies, drawn by Powell and J. F. Holmes. \\"It told a story of happy, mystical brotherhood that was receding ever further into fantasy as the band grappled with the tragedy of Duane's death,\\" according to biographer Alan Paul. There was very little planning involved in the piece, which was created when the duo were in Vero Beach, Florida. When one would be drawing or painting the image, another would be swimming in the ocean. \\"We swapped off this way with virtually no conversation about the drawing, just fluid trade-offs,\\" said Powell. The art was created on a large illustration board, \\"on a one-to-one scale‚Äîit was the size of the actual spread,\\" according to Powell. Holmes' work is featured largely on the left, with Powell's on the right. Both were \\"profoundly influenced\\" by Early Netherlandish painter Hieronymous Bosch on the piece. At the time the artwork was finalized, Duane Allman was still alive and the title had not been finalized. As a result, the album lacks a title on the cover, which was an unusual approach for bands at the time. Powell later said, \\"When we showed it to someone at the label, he said, 'They are so hot right now, we could sell it in a brown paper bag'\\". Atlantic initially intended to title the album The Kind We Grow in Dixie, but the band refused. The title was the label of the postcard series Powell had seen in Athens. Trucks suggested they name the album Eat a Peach for Peace, after a quote from Duane Allman. When the writer Ellen Mandel asked Allman what he was doing to help the revolution, he replied: According to some sources, the peach being \\"eaten\\" was \\"the two-legged Georgia variety\\", implying cunnilingus. Drummer Butch Trucks also considered Allman's comment a sly reference to the poem \\"The Love Song of J. Alfred Prufrock\\" by T. S. Eliot, one of Allman's favorite poets. An untrue story persisted for many years after the album's release that it was named after the truck Allman crashed into, purported to be a peach truck. The album art was later selected by Rolling Stone magazine in 1991 as one of the 100 greatest album covers of all time. Release Before the release of Eat a Peach, industry talk suggested the demise of the group after the death of Duane Allman. The record's promotional campaign was coordinated by Dick Wooley, the former head of promotion for Atlantic Records. He had recently quit his position there and was contacted by Walden to help Capricorn in its efforts. (Capricorn Records had recently separated from Atlantic Records as well; Eat a Peach would be among the first Capricorn albums released under a new distribution deal with Warner Bros. Records.) \\"They needed help because the buzz in the record business and on the street was that the ABB was finished as a band and would never survive without Duane,\\" said Wooley. After being played some songs from Eat a Peach by Sandlin, Wooley was \\"blown away\\" and accepted the offer at half his usual salary. He arranged to have the band's New Year's Eve performance at New Orleans' Warehouse live simulcast on radio. \\"I took a gamble and cobbled together a network of radio stations in the Southeast via Ma Bell phone lines,\\" said Wooley. The stunt helped launch Eat a Peach, which was issued by Capricorn in February 1972 and became an instant success. The album shipped enough copies to be certified by the RIAA as gold and peaked at number four on Billboard Top 200 Pop Albums chart. \\"We'd been through hell, but somehow we were rolling bigger than ever,\\" said Gregg Allman. Rolling Stone Tony Glover wrote that, even without their leader, \\"the Allman Brothers are still the best goddamned band in the land ... I hope the band keeps playing forever‚Äîhow many groups can you think of who really make you believe they're playing for the joy of it?\\" In Christgau's Record Guide: Rock Albums of the Seventies (1981), Robert Christgau called side three \\"a magnificent testament\\", but was relatively unimpressed by the rest of the album, especially the low-tempo \\"Mountain Jam\\" sides: \\"I know the pace of living is slow down there, but this verges on the comatose. And all the tape in the world isn't going to bring Duane back.\\" In a retrospective review, Stephen Thomas Erlewine of AllMusic gave the record a solid five stars, calling the record a showcase of \\"the Allmans at their peak\\". David Quantick of BBC Music also considered it their \\"creative peak\\", praising the album's \\"well-played, surprisingly lean bluesy rock\\". The album is mentioned as the band's top studio recording in the 2008 book 1,000 Recordings to Hear Before You Die (2008), with author Tom Moon praising the record's \\"sedate, beautifully contemplative studio material\\". pp. 16‚Äì17. \\"Melissa\\" was the album's most successful single, peaking at number 65 on the Billboard Hot 100. \\"Ain't Wastin' Time No More\\" and \\"One Way Out\\" were also singles, charting at numbers 77 and 86, respectively. Touring Biographer Alan Paul notes that the band's members \\"all profoundly felt the absence of their guiding light\\" during the touring cycle for Eat a Peach. Dickey Betts had to convince the band members to tour, since all other members were reluctant. Despite rumors, the band did not replace Duane Allman, and simply toured as a five-piece. The Allman Brothers Band played 90 shows in 1972 in support of the record. \\"We were playing for him and that was the way to be closest to him,\\" said Trucks. Allman and Oakley took turns introducing songs, which was traditionally Duane's role. Betts learned Duane's slide guitar parts, but put his own spin on it. Oakley had a downward spiral following Duane's death and was significantly inebriated for many shows on the tour. \\"He wasn't playing like he used to‚Äîinstead, he'd hit maybe every fifth note,\\" recalled Allman. Occasionally, the band would have bassist Joe Dan Petty, later of Grinderswitch, cover for Oakley for the show. After nearly a year of severe depression, Oakley was killed in a motorcycle accident not dissimilar from his friend's in November 1972. The band were headliners for the first time on the Eat a Peach tour, and many label mates on Capricorn opened for the band, including Wet Willie, Cowboy, and Dr. John.

Gloves, now, medicine Pouch in museum)) was a Native American chief of the Tabeguache (Uncompahgre) band of the Ute tribe, then located in western Colorado. Because of his leadership ability, Ouray was acknowledged by the United States government as a chief of the Ute and he traveled to Washington, D.C. to negotiate for the welfare of the Utes. Raised in the culturally diverse town of Taos, Ouray learned to speak many languages that helped him in the negotiations, which were complicated by the manipulation of his grief over his five-year-old son lost during an attack by the Sioux. Ouray met with Presidents Lincoln, Grant, and Hayes and was called the man of peace because he sought to make treaties with settlers and the government. Following the Meeker Massacre (White River War) of 1879, he traveled in 1880 to Washington, D.C.. He tried to secure a treaty for the Uncompahgre Ute, who wanted to stay in Colorado; but, the following year, the United States forced the Uncompahgre and the White River Ute to the west to reservations in present-day Utah. Early life and education Illustration of Taos Pueblo, 1893 Ouray was born in 1833 near the Taos Pueblo in Nuevo M√©xico, now in the state of New Mexico. His father, Guera Murah, also called Salvador, was a Jicarilla Apache adopted into the Ute, and his mother was Uncompahgre Ute. His parents had another son named Quench, and then his mother died soon after. His father remarried and his stepmother left Ouray and his brother to live on a ranch with a Spanish-speaking couple around 1843 or 1845. His father returned to Colorado and became a leader of the Tabeguache Ute band and the boys remained in Taos. Ouray received a Catholic education and was raised in the Catholic faith. Living in a culturally diverse location, he learned Ute and Apache languages, sign language, Spanish, and English, which he found helpful later in life in negotiating with whites and Native Americans. He spent much of his youth working for Mexican sheepherders. He also hauled wood and packed mules that were bound for the Santa Fe Trail. In 1850, Ouray and his brother left Taos to join their father, who died soon after. Ouray was the band's best rider, hunter, and fighter, and he became an enforcer (like a chief of police) and then sub-chief of the band. He fought both the Kiowa and the Sioux while living among the Tabeguache. Chief and negotiator =Chief= In 1860, Ouray became chief of the band at the age of 27. That year, he engaged in a \\"fact-finding tour\\" to determine the number of whites that were settling in the Uncompahgre and Gunnison River valleys and was alarmed by the number of miners and settlers on ancestral lands of the Utes. He understood, though, that fighting the whites would not turn back the tide of emigrants. Instead, he believed that the solution was to engage in treaty negotiations to protect their interests. =Treaty negotiation= Ouray was known as the \\"White man's friend,\\" and his services were almost indispensable to the government in negotiating with his tribe, who kept in good faith all treaties that were made by him. He protected their interests as far as possible, and set them the example of living a civilized life. Although Ouray sought reconciliation between different peoples, with the belief that war with the whites likely meant the demise of the Ute tribe, other, more militant Utes, considered him a coward for his propensity to negotiate. Disturbed by the treaties that Ouray entered into, his brother-in-law \\"Hot Stuff\\" tried to kill him with an axe during his near-daily visit to the Los Pi√±os Indian Agency in 1874. Treaty of Conejos of 1863 Colorado Territory was established on February 28, 1861. In 1862, he convinced Utes to negotiate with the government to enter into a treaty to ensure the protection of hereditary lands of the Tabeguache. Kit Carson had noticed in 1862 that prospectors were mining and settling in areas that had been traditional hunting grounds for the Utes and game was becoming scarce. Carson helped him draft a treaty. Ouray was part of the delegation and was the translator in a meeting with the new Territorial Governor John Evans, after which he traveled to Washington, D.C. to meet with President Abraham Lincoln. Manitou Springs, where Ute came to hunt and take the mineral springs. The center of the photograph shows a \\"lone encampment\\" of Ute Native Americans, between 1874 and 1879. Ouray negotiated with the U.S. government for the Treaty of Conejos (1863), which reduced their lands to 50% of what it had been, losing all lands east of the Continental Divide that included healing waters at Manitou Springs and the sacred land on Pikes Peak. It guaranteed that they would have the western one third of the state of the Colorado. The Utes agreed that they would allow roads and military forts to be built on the land. As an encouragement to take up farming, they were given sheep, cattle, and $10,000 in goods and provisions over ten years. The government generally did not provide the goods, provisions, or livestock mentioned in the treaty, and since game was scarce many Ute continued to hunt on ancestral Ute lands until they were removed to reservations in 1880 and 1881. Treaty of 1868 The Treaty of 1868 resulted in the creation of a reservation for the Utes in western Colorado Around 1866, there were some Native Americans who had stolen livestock and otherwise upset new settlers. Following an uprising by Chief Kaniatse, Colonel Kit Carson successfully negotiated a treaty with the Ouray and other Ute leaders in 1867. In the meantime, the government became interested in obtaining some more Ute land. Since the government had not lived up to its agreement to provide provisions for the winter months, Ouray was reluctant to give to government more land. Many Native Americans, though, were \\"in dire straits\\" and he agreed to be part of a delegation. In 1868, Ouray, Nicaagat, with Kit Carson were among a delegation to negotiate a treaty that would result in the creation of a reservation for the Ute, served by an Indian Agencies at White River and near Montrose with a school, blacksmith shop, sawmill, and warehouse. They lost a little land in the treaty, but Ouray hoped that having a government presence would mean that their lands would be protected. The treaty was signed by 47 Ute chiefs. Brunot Treaty of 1873 Silver deposits were found in the San Juan Mountains in 1872 and the government wanted again to negotiate for more land. Feeding on his grief due to the unknown status of his son after the Utes were attacked by the Sioux, U.S. Commissioner of Indian Affairs Felix Brunot had a 17-year-old orphan brought by Arapaho Chief Powder Face to meet Ouray and Chipeta in Washington, D.C. ten years after the abduction. This was the first of many attempts by Brunot to find his son and was conducted so that Ouray would relinquish mining property and keep treaty talks open. The boy was clearly not Ouray's son, he did not know anything from the Ute language, did not want to go with Ouray, and the details of his capture did not match the experience of Ouray's son. Tribal historians have stated that this meeting was upsetting to Ouray, but author Richard E. Wood states that the chief was impressed by the effort taken by the government. In 1873, with Ouray's help, the Brunot Agreement was ratified and the United States acquired the mineral-rich property they had been seeking. In exchange, the Native Americans were to receive provisions over time. Ouray was given land and a house in the Uncompahgre Valley near the Indian Agency. The government, though, was again reluctant to provide provisions. His negotiations had included a meeting with President Ulysses S. Grant. =Meeker Massacre= An etching that appeared in the December 6, 1879 edition of Frank Leslie's Illustrated Newspaper depicts the aftermath of the \\"Meeker Massacre.\\" Meeker grave at lower left; W.H. Post grave at lower right Tensions increased in the area following the Meeker Massacre (1879) at the White River Indian Agency. Not understanding the Utes love of horses, Nathan Meeker had their race track plowed and tried to force the nomadic hunters and gatherers to farm, and Meeker sought military help. Seeking peace, a tribe of Ute men led by Chief Douglas asked Meeker for peace, but a fight ensued. This made further negotiations for peace between Native Americans and whites very difficult. Local settlers demanded that the Utes be moved. When Ouray found out about the massacre, he asked, as head of the Utes, for the warriors to disperse and release hostages to him. The hostages, including Josephine Meeker, were delivered to Ouray's house at the Los Pi√±os Indian Agency and were cared for by Chipeta. =Final treaty= Photo taken in 1880 in Washington D.C. when Ouray and other Utes traveled to Washington. D.C. to negotiate a treaty that would result in the removal of the White River and Tabeguache Utes from Colorado to the Uintah Basin in present-day Utah. Ouray died shortly after this trip. Seated from left to right: Ignacio of the Southern Utes, Carl Shurz, Secretary of the Interior, Ouray and his wife, Chipeta. Standing are Woretsiz and General Charles Adams. The U.S. government appointed a commission to determine a reservation for the Ute and Ouray and Chipeta went to Washington, D.C. in 1880 for the final treaty for the Utes. Members of the commission were Alfred B. Meacham, former U.S. Superintendent of Indian Affairs for Oregon; Otto Mears, a railroad executive, and George W. Manypenny, former Commissioner of Indian Affairs. When President Rutherford B. Hayes met Ouray in Washington, DC, he said that the Ute was \\"the most intellectual man I've ever conversed with.\\" When he had returned to Colorado, and while dying with Bright's disease, Ouray traveled to the Ignacio Indian Agency office to have the treaty signed by the Southern Utes. Utes were later put on a reservation in Utah, Uintah and Ouray Indian Reservation, as well as two reservations in Colorado: Ute Mountain Ute Tribe and Southern Ute Indian Reservation. Personal life Chipeta Ouray's first wife, Black Mare, died after the birth of their only child, a boy named Queashegut, called Paron (apple) by his father because of his round, dimpled face. In 1859, Ouray married the sixteen-year old Chipeta (Ute meaning: White Singing Bird), who had been caring for Ouray's son since Black Mare's death earlier that year. When Queashegut was five years old, Ouray took him along on a buffalo hunt with a total party of 31 men in 1860 or 1863. Their hunting camp, near Fort Lupton, was attacked by 300 Sioux warriors and Queashegut left the tepee where he sought shelter with Chipeta to follow Ute warriors. After the fight, they were unable to find him. He had been captured and traded to an Arapaho band. Ouray never saw his son again and remained in deep grief. He tried to find his son for the rest of his life and feared \\"he was raised to fight against his own.\\" While visiting Kit Carson at Fort Garland in 1866, Ouray and Chipeta met and adopted two girls and two boys. Ouray's sister, Shawsheen (also Tsashin and Susan), was in Big Thompson Canyon in 1861 or 1863 when she was abducted by the Arapaho. Soldiers from Fort Collins found her two years later in 1863 or 1865, but she was afraid of them and escaped. She was later found by Utes and returned to Ouray's tribe. He had several homes in Colorado, one of them by the town of Ouray. For twenty years, Ouray lived with Chipeta on a farm on the Uncompahgre River near Montrose. The 300-acre farm had pasture land and 50 acres of irrigated farm land. The six-room adobe house was well-furnished, including a piano and fine china. The Ute Indian Museum is located on their original 8.65 acre homestead in Montrose. Chipeta was a member of a Methodist church; Ouray was an Episcopalian. Ouray never cut his long Ute-fashion hair, though he often dressed in the European-American style. Buckskin Charlie and John McCook at the reburial of Ouray, Ignacio, Colorado, 1925 Ouray died in August 24, 1880 near the Los Pi√±os Indian Agency in Colorado. His people secretly buried him near Ignacio, Colorado. Forty-five years later, in 1925, his bones were re-interred in a full ceremony led by Buckskin Charley and John McCook at the Ignacio cemetery. A 1928 article in the Denver Post reads in part, \\"He saw the shadow of doom on his people\\" and a 2012 article writes, \\"He sought peace among tribes and whites, and a fair shake for his people, though Ouray was dealt a sad task of liquidating a once-mighty force that ruled nearly 23 million acres of the Rocky Mountains.\\" Legacy and honors Ouray's obituary in The Denver Tribune stated: > In the death of Ouray, one of the historical characters passes away. He has > figured for many years as the greatest Indian of his time, and during his > life has figured quite prominently. Ouray is in many respects...a remarkable > Indian...pure instincts and keen perception. A friend to the white man and > protector to the Indians alike.

It was created primarily for the S.S. Kresge Company, though it was employed as a budget label in other discount stores. History Banner was formed in January 1922 as the flagship label of the Plaza Music Company of New York City. Plaza Music produced several cheap labels targeted at discount houses and hired bandleader Adrian Schubert as musical director. At the beginning, Banner concentrated on popular dance hits, though it also recorded comedy, semi-classical music, and a small number of country and blues records. In its first years Banner also leased masters from Paramount Records and Emerson Records. In July 1929 Plaza merged with Cameo-Path√© and the Scranton Button Company to form the (ARC). ARC dropped Path√© and Scranton Button's label Emerson but kept active all of the other labels belonging to the combined company, including Banner. After ARC acquired the rights to Brunswick Records, Banner's product lines began to reflect the general ARC product, and this added more African-American and country music to its catalogue. As part of the ARC-BRC combination, it no longer enjoyed a flagship status accorded to Melotone among the budget labels. Although ARC-BRC dropped some of the dime- store labels, it kept Banner until December 1938, when the CBS Broadcasting Network bought ARC-BRC and liquidated all of the dime-store labels. In December 1946, entrepreneur Sam Selsman formed a new Banner Records label, devoted to Jewish music and Yiddish-language comedy routines;\\"Yiddish Waxery Formed,\\" Billboard December 28, 1946 although this later Banner Records no longer actively records, its catalogue continues.Jewish Jukebox Entry for a Banner Records release There is no relationship between the Hebrew Banner label and the earlier products of Plaza Music or ARC/BRC; nor is there is a relationship to a dime-store label put out by Leeds and Caitlin in the early 1900s, though the label's design is similar. Label Series Banner debuted with two concurrent label series in January 1922: a popular 1000 series side by side with a \\"Standard\\" 2000 series of semi-classical music, comedy, and some Jewish material. Reaching Banner 1999 in the main series in mid-1927, Banner skipped ahead to 6000 and terminated the Standard series at the end of the year at Banner 2183. At this point, Banner also stopped the 6000 series at Banner 6167 and moved again to a 7000 series starting at Banner 7001. This ended in early 1929 at Banner 7265 and the reverted to the old series, starting at Banner 6200. The series survived the merger into ARC, but was ended at the start of 1930 at Banner 6566 and restarted at 0500 until it reached 0872 later in the year. The number series was then started again at 32001 and the price changed from 25 cents to 35 cents in order to bring Banner in line with other dime-store labels being sold 3 for a dollar. This lasted until 1935, when the dime-store labels were all married to a central numbering system. But releases were not necessarily unified; for example, Robert Johnson, who did have some releases on Melotone, did not appear on Banner. Legacy Banner discs are found throughout the United States, indicating their popularity as Plaza's flagship label. The audio fidelity of the records was average to slightly below average for the time, but as Banner was a cheap label they were pressed from cheaper materials that did not withstand repeated playing with the heavy phonograph players of the time. Most Banner discs found today exhibit considerable wear and surface noise, but they are still valued by virtue of the selections. In keeping with their low-price production, it is common for a current hit song on the A-side and a lesser-known song as the B side. Many of these B side songs are eccentric tunes not recorded elsewhere (but, of course, found on the other Plaza/ARC labels). Many of these odd songs have great hot solos, making them quite enjoyable. Also scattered around these B sides are hot tunes by Luis Russell, Duke Ellington, small groups from the Ben Pollack orchestra, among others.

Life Born in Regina, Saskatchewan, Newlove lived in a variety of small Saskatchewan towns, in particular Kamsack. He attended the University of Saskatchewan for a year, worked briefly as a social worker, a teacher and at a radio station before embarking on a cross-Canada trip which eventually landed him in Vancouver, British Columbia. He came to prominence in the 1960s as various collections of his poetry were published to critical acclaim. He left Vancouver in May 1967 and took his family to Deep Springs College in California where composer friend Barney Childs was a professor. After several more moves, he and his family ended up in Toronto by 1970 where he worked as senior editor for McClelland and Stewart. It was during this period that he won the 1972 Governor General's Award for \\"Lies.\\" Various writer-in-residence stints followed his 1974 departure from McCelland and Stewart, including at Concordia University in Montreal, the University of Toronto and University of Western Ontario in London. He lived for several years in Regina in the early 1980s where he served as writer-in-residence at the public library, then in Nelson, British Columbia, where he taught at David Thompson University. Finally, he moved to Ottawa in 1986 and took a position as an editor with the federal Office of the Commissioner of Official Languages; he would spend the rest of his life in that city. His 1986 collection, The Night the Dog Smiled, was short-listed for that year's English language poetry Governor General's Award, and he won the 1984 Saskatchewan Writers' Guild Founders Award. Newlove suffered a stroke in 2001 and died in 2003. Newlove was the subject of two documentaries: New Canadian Writers: John Newlove (1971) which was broadcast on TVO, and What to Make of It All? The Life and Poetry of John Newlove (2006) which was broadcast on Bravo! in 2007.

Biometrics authentication (or realistic authentication) is used in computer science as a form of identification and access control. It is also used to identify individuals in groups that are under surveillance. Biometric identifiers are the distinctive, measurable characteristics used to label and describe individuals. Biometric identifiers are often categorized as physiological versus behavioral characteristics. Physiological characteristics are related to the shape of the body. Examples include, but are not limited to fingerprint, palm veins, face recognition, DNA, palmprint, hand geometry, iris recognition, retina and odour/scent. Behavioral characteristics are related to the pattern of behavior of a person, including but not limited to typing rhythm, gait, and voice. Some researchers have coined the term behaviometrics to describe the latter class of biometrics. More traditional means of access control include token-based identification systems, such as a driver's license or passport, and knowledge-based identification systems, such as a password or personal identification number. Since biometric identifiers are unique to individuals, they are more reliable in verifying identity than token and knowledge-based methods; however, the collection of biometric identifiers raises privacy concerns about the ultimate use of this information. Biometric functionality Many different aspects of human physiology, chemistry or behavior can be used for biometric authentication. The selection of a particular biometric for use in a specific application involves a weighting of several factors. Jain et al. (1999) identified seven such factors to be used when assessing the suitability of any trait for use in biometric authentication. * Universality means that every person using a system should possess the trait. *Uniqueness means the trait should be sufficiently different for individuals in the relevant population such that they can be distinguished from one another. * Permanence relates to the manner in which a trait varies over time. More specifically, a trait with 'good' permanence will be reasonably invariant over time with respect to the specific matching algorithm. * Measurability (collectability) relates to the ease of acquisition or measurement of the trait. In addition, acquired data should be in a form that permits subsequent processing and extraction of the relevant feature sets. * Performance relates to the accuracy, speed, and robustness of technology used (see performance section for more details). * Acceptability relates to how well individuals in the relevant population accept the technology such that they are willing to have their biometric trait captured and assessed. * Circumvention relates to the ease with which a trait might be imitated using an artifact or substitute. Proper biometric use is very application dependent. Certain biometrics will be better than others based on the required levels of convenience and security. No single biometric will meet all the requirements of every possible application. upright=1.5The block diagram illustrates the two basic modes of a biometric system. First, in verification (or authentication) mode the system performs a one-to-one comparison of a captured biometric with a specific template stored in a biometric database in order to verify the individual is the person they claim to be. Three steps are involved in the verification of a person. In the first step, reference models for all the users are generated and stored in the model database. In the second step, some samples are matched with reference models to generate the genuine and impostor scores and calculate the threshold. The third step is the testing step. This process may use a smart card, username or ID number (e.g. PIN) to indicate which template should be used for comparison.Systems can be designed to use a template stored on media like an e-Passport or smart card, rather than a remote database. 'Positive recognition' is a common use of the verification mode, \\"where the aim is to prevent multiple people from using the same identity\\". Second, in identification mode the system performs a one-to-many comparison against a biometric database in an attempt to establish the identity of an unknown individual. The system will succeed in identifying the individual if the comparison of the biometric sample to a template in the database falls within a previously set threshold. Identification mode can be used either for 'positive recognition' (so that the user does not have to provide any information about the template to be used) or for 'negative recognition' of the person \\"where the system establishes whether the person is who she (implicitly or explicitly) denies to be\\". The latter function can only be achieved through biometrics since other methods of personal recognition such as passwords, PINs or keys are ineffective. The first time an individual uses a biometric system is called enrollment. During enrollment, biometric information from an individual is captured and stored. In subsequent uses, biometric information is detected and compared with the information stored at the time of enrollment. Note that it is crucial that storage and retrieval of such systems themselves be secure if the biometric system is to be robust. The first block (sensor) is the interface between the real world and the system; it has to acquire all the necessary data. Most of the times it is an image acquisition system, but it can change according to the characteristics desired. The second block performs all the necessary pre-processing: it has to remove artifacts from the sensor, to enhance the input (e.g. removing background noise), to use some kind of normalization, etc. In the third block, necessary features are extracted. This step is an important step as the correct features need to be extracted in an optimal way. A vector of numbers or an image with particular properties is used to create a template. A template is a synthesis of the relevant characteristics extracted from the source. Elements of the biometric measurement that are not used in the comparison algorithm are discarded in the template to reduce the filesize and to protect the identity of the enrollee. However, depending on the scope of the biometric system, original biometric image sources may be retained such as the PIV-cards used in the Federal Information Processing Standard Personal Identity Verification (PIV) of Federal Employees and Contractors (FIPS 201). During the enrollment phase, the template is simply stored somewhere (on a card or within a database or both). During the matching phase, the obtained template is passed to a matcher that compares it with other existing templates, estimating the distance between them using any algorithm (e.g. Hamming distance). The matching program will analyze the template with the input. This will then be output for a specified use or purpose (e.g. entrance in a restricted area), though it is a fear that the use of biometric data may face mission creep. Selection of biometrics in any practical application depending upon the characteristic measurements and user requirements. In selecting a particular biometric, factors to consider include, performance, social acceptability, ease of circumvention and/or spoofing, robustness, population coverage, size of equipment needed and identity theft deterrence. The selection of a biometric is based on user requirements and considers sensor and device availability, computational time and reliability, cost, sensor size, and power consumption. Multimodal biometric system Multimodal biometric systems use multiple sensors or biometrics to overcome the limitations of unimodal biometric systems.M. Haghighat, M. Abdel-Mottaleb, & W. Alhalabi (2016). Discriminant Correlation Analysis: Real-Time Feature Level Fusion for Multimodal Biometric Recognition. IEEE Transactions on Information Forensics and Security, 11(9), 1984‚Äì1996. For instance iris recognition systems can be compromised by aging irises and electronic fingerprint recognition can be worsened by worn-out or cut fingerprints. While unimodal biometric systems are limited by the integrity of their identifier, it is unlikely that several unimodal systems will suffer from identical limitations. Multimodal biometric systems can obtain sets of information from the same marker (i.e., multiple images of an iris, or scans of the same finger) or information from different biometrics (requiring fingerprint scans and, using voice recognition, a spoken passcode). Multimodal biometric systems can fuse these unimodal systems sequentially, simultaneously, a combination thereof, or in series, which refer to sequential, parallel, hierarchical and serial integration modes, respectively. Fusion of the biometrics information can occur at different stages of a recognition system. In case of feature level fusion, the data itself or the features extracted from multiple biometrics are fused. Matching-score level fusion consolidates the scores generated by multiple classifiers pertaining to different modalities. Finally, in case of decision level fusion the final results of multiple classifiers are combined via techniques such as majority voting. Feature level fusion is believed to be more effective than the other levels of fusion because the feature set contains richer information about the input biometric data than the matching score or the output decision of a classifier. Therefore, fusion at the feature level is expected to provide better recognition results. Spoof attacks consist in submitting fake biometric traits to biometric systems, and are a major threat that can curtail their security. Multi-modal biometric systems are commonly believed to be intrinsically more robust to spoof attacks, but recent studiesZahid Akhtar, \\"Security of Multimodal Biometric Systems against Spoof Attacks\\" , Department of Electrical and Electronic Engineering, University of Cagliari, Cagliari, Italy, 6 March 2012. have shown that they can be evaded by spoofing even a single biometric trait. Performance The following are used as performance metrics for biometric systems: * False match rate (FMR, also called FAR = False Accept Rate): the probability that the system incorrectly matches the input pattern to a non-matching template in the database. It measures the percent of invalid inputs that are incorrectly accepted. In case of similarity scale, if the person is an imposter in reality, but the matching score is higher than the threshold, then he is treated as genuine. This increases the FMR, which thus also depends upon the threshold value. * False non-match rate (FNMR, also called FRR = False Reject Rate): the probability that the system fails to detect a match between the input pattern and a matching template in the database. It measures the percent of valid inputs that are incorrectly rejected. * Receiver operating characteristic or relative operating characteristic (ROC): The ROC plot is a visual characterization of the trade-off between the FMR and the FNMR. In general, the matching algorithm performs a decision based on a threshold that determines how close to a template the input needs to be for it to be considered a match. If the threshold is reduced, there will be fewer false non-matches but more false accepts. Conversely, a higher threshold will reduce the FMR but increase the FNMR. A common variation is the Detection error trade-off (DET), which is obtained using normal deviation scales on both axes. This more linear graph illuminates the differences for higher performances (rarer errors). * Equal error rate or crossover error rate (EER or CER): the rate at which both acceptance and rejection errors are equal. The value of the EER can be easily obtained from the ROC curve. The EER is a quick way to compare the accuracy of devices with different ROC curves. In general, the device with the lowest EER is the most accurate. * Failure to enroll rate (FTE or FER): the rate at which attempts to create a template from an input is unsuccessful. This is most commonly caused by low-quality inputs. * Failure to capture rate (FTC): Within automatic systems, the probability that the system fails to detect a biometric input when presented correctly. * Template capacity: the maximum number of sets of data that can be stored in the system. History An early cataloguing of fingerprints dates back to 1881 when Juan Vucetich started a collection of fingerprints of criminals in Argentina.The History of Fingerprints . Josh Ellenbogen and Nitzan Lebovic argued that Biometrics originated in the identification systems of criminal activity developed by Alphonse Bertillon (1853‚Äì1914) and by Francis Galton's theory of fingerprints and physiognomy.Josh Ellenbogen, Reasoned and Unreasoned Images: The Photography of Bertillon, Galton, and Marey (University Park, PA, 2012) According to Lebovic, Galton's work \\"led to the application of mathematical models to fingerprints, phrenology, and facial characteristics\\", as part of \\"absolute identification\\" and \\"a key to both inclusion and exclusion\\" of populations.Nitzan Lebovic, \\"Biometrics or the Power of the Radical Center\\", in Critical Inquiry 41:4 (Summer, 2015), 841‚Äì868. Accordingly, \\"the biometric system is the absolute political weapon of our era\\" and a form of \\"soft control\\".Nitzan Lebovic, \\"Biometrics or the Power of the Radical Center\\", in Critical Inquiry 41:4 (Summer, 2015), p. 853. The theoretician David Lyon showed that during the past two decades biometric systems have penetrated the civilian market, and blurred the lines between governmental forms of control and private corporate control.David Lyon, Surveillance Society: Monitoring Everyday Life (Philadelphia, 2001). Kelly A. Gates identified 9/11 as the turning point for the cultural language of our present: \\"in the language of cultural studies, the aftermath of 9/11 was a moment of articulation, where objects or events that have no necessary connection come together and a new discourse formation is established: automated facial recognition as a homeland security technology.\\"Kelly A. Gates, Our Biometric Future: Facial Recognition Technology and the Culture of Surveillance (New York, 2011), p. 100. Adaptive biometric systems Adaptive biometric systems aim to auto-update the templates or model to the intra-class variation of the operational data.A. Rattani, \\"Adaptive Biometric System based on Template Update Procedures\\", PhD thesis, University of Cagliari, Italy, 2010 The two-fold advantages of these systems are solving the problem of limited training data and tracking the temporal variations of the input data through adaptation. Recently, adaptive biometrics have received a significant attention from the research community. This research direction is expected to gain momentum because of their key promulgated advantages. First, with an adaptive biometric system, one no longer needs to collect a large number of biometric samples during the enrollment process. Second, it is no longer necessary to enrol again or retrain the system from scratch in order to cope with the changing environment. This convenience can significantly reduce the cost of maintaining a biometric system. Despite these advantages, there are several open issues involved with these systems. For mis-classification error (false acceptance) by the biometric system, cause adaptation using impostor sample. However, continuous research efforts are directed to resolve the open issues associated to the field of adaptive biometrics. More information about adaptive biometric systems can be found in the critical review by Rattani et al. Recent advances in emerging biometrics In recent times, biometrics based on brain (electroencephalogram) and heart (electrocardiogram) signals have emerged.[R. Palaniappan, \\"Electroencephalogram signals from imagined activities: A novel biometric identifier for a small population\\", published in E. Corchado et al. (eds): Intelligent Data Engineering and Automated Learning ‚Äì IDEAL 2006, Lecture Notes in Computer Science, vol. 4224, pp. 604‚Äì611, Springer-Verlag, Berlin Heidelberg, 2006. DOI:10.1007/11875581_73]R. Palaniappan, and S. M. Krishnan, \\"Identifying individuals using ECG signals\\", Proceedings of International Conference on Signal Processing and Communications, Bangalore, India, pp. 569‚Äì572, 11‚Äì14 December 2004. DOI:10.1109/SPCOM.2004.1458524] The research group at University of Kent led by Ramaswamy Palaniappan has shown that people have certain distinct brain and heart patterns that are specific for each individual. Another example is finger vein recognition, using pattern-recognition techniques, based on images of human vascular patterns. The advantage of such 'futuristic' technology is that it is more fraud resistant compared to conventional biometrics like fingerprints. However, such technology is generally more cumbersome and still has issues such as lower accuracy and poor reproducibility over time. This new generation of biometrical systems is called biometrics of intent and it aims to scan intent. The technology will analyze physiological features such as eye movement, body temperature, breathing etc. and predict dangerous behaviour or hostile intent before it materializes into action. On the portability side of biometric products, more and more vendors are embracing significantly miniaturized biometric authentication systems (BAS) thereby driving elaborate cost savings, especially for large-scale deployments. =Operator signatures= An operator signature is a biometric mode where the manner in which a person using a device or complex system is recorded as a verification template. One potential use for this type of biometric signature is to distinguish among remote users of telerobotic surgery systems that utilize public networks for communication. = Proposed requirement for certain public networks = John Michael (Mike) McConnell, a former vice admiral in the United States Navy, a former Director of U.S. National Intelligence, and Senior Vice President of Booz Allen Hamilton promoted the development of a future capability to require biometric authentication to access certain public networks in his keynote speech at the 2009 Biometric Consortium Conference. A basic premise in the above proposal is that the person that has uniquely authenticated themselves using biometrics with the computer is in fact also the agent performing potentially malicious actions from that computer. However, if control of the computer has been subverted, for example in which the computer is part of a botnet controlled by a hacker, then knowledge of the identity of the user at the terminal does not materially improve network security or aid law enforcement activities. Recently, another approach to biometric security was developed, this method scans the entire body of prospects to guarantee a better identification of this prospect. This method is not globally accepted because it is very complex and prospects are concerned about their privacy. =Animal biometrics= Rather than tags or tattoos, biometric techniques may be used to identify individual animals: zebra stripes, blood vessel patterns in rodent ears, muzzle prints, bat wing patterns, primate facial recognition and koala spots have all been tried. = Video = Videos have become a pronounced way of identifying information. There are features in videos that look at how intense certain parts of a frame are compared to others which help with identification. Issues and concerns =Surveillance humanitarianism in times of crisis= Biometrics are employed by many aid programs in times of crisis in order to prevent fraud and ensure that resources are properly available to those in need. Humanitarian efforts are motivated by promoting the welfare of individuals in need, however the use of biometrics as a form of surveillance humanitarianism can create conflict due to varying interests of the groups involved in the particular situation. Disputes over the use of biometrics between aid programs and party officials stalls the distribution of resources to people that need help the most. In July 2019, the United Nations World Food Program and Houthi Rebels were involved in a large dispute over the use of biometrics to ensure resources are provided to the hundreds of thousands of civilians in Yemen whose lives are threatened. The refusal to cooperate with the interests of the United Nations World Food Program resulted in the suspension of food aid to the Yemen population. The use of biometrics may provide aid programs with valuable information, however its potential solutions may not be best suited for chaotic times of crisis. Conflicts that are caused by deep-rooted political problems, in which the implementation of biometrics may not provide a long-term solution.https://www.nytimes.com/2019/07/11/opinion/data-humanitarian-aid.html =Human dignity= Biometrics have been considered also instrumental to the development of state authorityBreckenridge K. (2005). \\"The Biometric State: The Promise and Peril of Digital Government in the New South Africa\\". Journal of Southern African Studies, 31:2, 267‚Äì82 (to put it in Foucauldian terms, of discipline and biopowerEpstein C. (2007), \\"Guilty Bodies, Productive Bodies, Destructive Bodies: Crossing the Biometric Borders\\". International Political Sociology, 1:2, 149‚Äì64). By turning the human subject into a collection of biometric parameters, biometrics would dehumanize the person,Pugliese J. (2010), Biometrics: Bodies, Technologies, Biopolitics. New York: Routledge infringe bodily integrity, and, ultimately, offend human dignity.French National Consultative Ethics Committee for Health and Life Sciences (2007), Opinion N¬∞ 98, \\"Biometrics, identifying data and human rights\\" In a well- known case,Agamben, G. (2008). \\"No to bio-political tattooing\\". Communication and Critical/Cultural Studies, 5(2), 201‚Äì202. Reproduced from Le Monde (10 January 2004). Italian philosopher Giorgio Agamben refused to enter the United States in protest at the United States Visitor and Immigrant Status Indicator (US-VISIT) program's requirement for visitors to be fingerprinted and photographed. Agamben argued that gathering of biometric data is a form of bio-political tattooing, akin to the tattooing of Jews during the Holocaust. According to Agamben, biometrics turn the human persona into a bare body. Agamben refers to the two words used by Ancient Greeks for indicating \\"life\\", zoe, which is the life common to animals and humans, just life; and bios, which is life in the human context, with meanings and purposes. Agamben envisages the reduction to bare bodies for the whole humanity.Agamben G.(1998), Homo Sacer: Sovereign Power and Bare Life. Trans. Daniel Heller- Roazen. Stanford: Stanford University Press For him, a new bio-political relationship between citizens and the state is turning citizens into pure biological life (zoe) depriving them from their humanity (bios); and biometrics would herald this new world. In Dark Matters: On the Surveillance of Blackness, surveillance scholar Simone Browne formulates a similar critique as Agamben, citing a recent study relating to biometrics R&D; that found that the gender classification system being researched \\"is inclined to classify Africans as males and Mongoloids as females.\\" Consequently, Browne argues that the conception of an objective biometric technology is difficult if such systems are subjectively designed, and are vulnerable to cause errors as described in the study above. The stark expansion of biometric technologies in both the public and private sector magnifies this concern. The increasing commodification of biometrics by the private sector adds to this danger of loss of human value. Indeed, corporations value the biometric characteristics more than the individuals value them. Browne goes on to suggest that modern society should incorporate a \\"biometric consciousness\\" that \\"entails informed public debate around these technologies and their application, and accountability by the state and the private sector, where the ownership of and access to one's own body data and other intellectual property that is generated from one's body data must be understood as a right.\\" Other scholarsMordini, E; Massari, S. (2008), \\"Body, Biometrics and Identity\\" Bioethics, 22, 9:488 have emphasized, however, that the globalized world is confronted with a huge mass of people with weak or absent civil identities. Most developing countries have weak and unreliable documents and the poorer people in these countries do not have even those unreliable documents.UNICEF, Birth Registration Without certified personal identities, there is no certainty of right, no civil liberty.Dahan M., Gelb A. (2015) \\"The Role of Identification in the Post-2015 Development Agenda\\" ‚Äì World Bank Working Paper No. 98294 08/2015; One can claim her rights, including the right to refuse to be identified, only if she is an identifiable subject, if she has a public identity. In such a sense, biometrics could play a pivotal role in supporting and promoting respect for human dignity and fundamental rights.Mordini E, Rebera A (2011) \\"No Identification Without Representation: Constraints on the Use of Biometric Identification Systems\\". Review of Policy Research, 29, 1: 5‚Äì20 The biometrics of intent poses further risks. In his paper in Harvard International Review, Prof Nayef Al-Rodhan cautions about the high risks of miscalculations, wrongful accusations and infringements of civil liberties. Critics in the US have also signalled a conflict with the 4th Amendment. =Privacy and discrimination= It is possible that data obtained during biometric enrollment may be used in ways for which the enrolled individual has not consented. For example, most biometric features could disclose physiological and/or pathological medical conditions (e.g., some fingerprint patterns are related to chromosomal diseases, iris patterns could reveal genetic sex, hand vein patterns could reveal vascular diseases, most behavioral biometrics could reveal neurological diseases, etc.).Mordini E, Ashton H,(2012), \\"The Transparent Body ‚Äì Medical Information, Physical Privacy and Respect for Body Integrity\\", in Mordini E, Tzovaras D (eds), Second Generation Biometrics: the Ethical and Social Context. Springer-Verlag: Berlin Moreover, second generation biometrics, notably behavioral and electro- physiologic biometrics (e.g., based on electrocardiography, electroencephalography, electromyography), could be also used for emotion detection.Mordini E, Tzovaras D,(2012), Second Generation Biometrics: the Ethical and Social Context. Springer-Verlag: Berlin There are three categories of privacy concerns: # Unintended functional scope: The authentication goes further than authentication, such as finding a tumor. # Unintended application scope: The authentication process correctly identifies the subject when the subject did not wish to be identified. # Covert identification: The subject is identified without seeking identification or authentication, i.e. a subject's face is identified in a crowd. =Danger to owners of secured items= When thieves cannot get access to secure properties, there is a chance that the thieves will stalk and assault the property owner to gain access. If the item is secured with a biometric device, the damage to the owner could be irreversible, and potentially cost more than the secured property. For example, in 2005, Malaysian car thieves cut off the finger of a Mercedes-Benz S-Class owner when attempting to steal the car. =Presentation attacks= In the context of biometric systems, presentation attacks may also be called \\"spoofing attacks\\". As per the recent ISO/IEC 30107 standard, presentation attacks are defined as \\"presentation to the biometric capture subsystem with the goal of interfering with the operation of the biometric system\\". These attacks can be either impersonation or obfuscation attacks. Impersonation attacks try to gain access by pretending to be someone else. Obfuscation attacks may, for example, try to evade face detection and face recognition systems. Recently several methods have been proposed to counteract presentation attacks. =Cancelable biometrics= One advantage of passwords over biometrics is that they can be re-issued. If a token or a password is lost or stolen, it can be cancelled and replaced by a newer version. This is not naturally available in biometrics. If someone's face is compromised from a database, they cannot cancel or reissue it. If the electronic biometric identifier is stolen, it is nearly impossible to change a biometric feature. This renders the person's biometric feature questionable for future use in authentication, such as the case with the hacking of security-clearance-related background information from the Office of Personnel Management (OPM) in the United States. Cancelable biometrics is a way in which to incorporate protection and the replacement features into biometrics to create a more secure system. It was first proposed by Ratha et al.N. K. Ratha, J. H. Connell, and R. M. Bolle, \\"Enhancing security and privacy in biometrics- based authentication systems\\", IBM Systems Journal, vol. 40, pp. 614‚Äì634, 2001. \\"Cancelable biometrics refers to the intentional and systematically repeatable distortion of biometric features in order to protect sensitive user-specific data. If a cancelable feature is compromised, the distortion characteristics are changed, and the same biometrics is mapped to a new template, which is used subsequently. Cancelable biometrics is one of the major categories for biometric template protection purpose besides biometric cryptosystem.\\" In biometric cryptosystem, \\"the error-correcting coding techniques are employed to handle intraclass variations.\\" This ensures a high level of security but has limitations such as specific input format of only small intraclass variations. Several methods for generating new exclusive biometrics have been proposed. The first fingerprint-based cancelable biometric system was designed and developed by Tulyakov et al.S. Tulyakov, F. Farooq, and V. Govindaraju, \\"Symmetric Hash Functions for Fingerprint Minutiae\\", Proc. Int'l Workshop Pattern Recognition for Crime Prevention, Security, and Surveillance, pp. 30‚Äì38, 2005 Essentially, cancelable biometrics perform a distortion of the biometric image or features before matching. The variability in the distortion parameters provides the cancelable nature of the scheme. Some of the proposed techniques operate using their own recognition engines, such as Teoh et al.A. B. J. Teoh, A. Goh, and D. C. L. Ngo, \\"Random Multispace Quantization as an Analytic Mechanism for BioHashing of Biometric and Random Identity Inputs\\", IEEE Transactions on Pattern Analysis and Machine Intelligence, vol. 28, pp. 1892‚Äì1901, 2006. and Savvides et al.,M. Savvides, B. V. K. V. Kumar, and P. K. Khosla, \\"'Corefaces' ‚Äì Robust Shift-Invariant PCA based Correlation Filter for Illumination Tolerant Face Recognition\\", presented at IEEE Computer Society Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR'04), 2004. whereas other methods, such as Dabbah et al.,M. A. Dabbah, W. L. Woo, and S. S. Dlay, \\"Secure Authentication for Face Recognition\\", presented at Computational Intelligence in Image and Signal Processing, 2007. CIISP 2007. IEEE Symposium on, 2007. take the advantage of the advancement of the well-established biometric research for their recognition front-end to conduct recognition. Although this increases the restrictions on the protection system, it makes the cancellable templates more accessible for available biometric technologies =Soft biometrics= Soft biometrics traits are physical, behavioral or adhered human characteristics that have been derived from the way human beings normally distinguish their peers (e.g. height, gender, hair color). They are used to complement the identity information provided by the primary biometric identifiers. Although soft biometric characteristics lack the distinctiveness and permanence to recognize an individual uniquely and reliably, and can be easily faked, they provide some evidence about the users identity that could be beneficial. In other words, despite the fact they are unable to individualize a subject, they are effective in distinguishing between people. Combinations of personal attributes like gender, race, eye color, height and other visible identification marks can be used to improve the performance of traditional biometric systems.Ratha, N. K., J. H. Connell, and R. M. Bolle. (2001). \\"Enhancing security and privacy in biometrics based authentication systems\\". IBM Systems Journal 40(3): 614‚Äì634. Most soft biometrics can be easily collected and are actually collected during enrollment. Two main ethical issues are raised by soft biometrics.Mordini E, Ashton H (2012), \\"The Transparent Body ‚Äì Medical Information, Physical Privacy and Respect for Body Integrity'\\". In Mordini E, Tzovaras D (eds), Second Generation Biometrics: the Ethical and Social Context. Berlin: Springer-Verlag , 2057‚Äì83 First, some of soft biometric traits are strongly cultural based; e.g., skin colors for determining ethnicity risk to support racist approaches, biometric sex recognition at the best recognizes gender from tertiary sexual characters, being unable to determine genetic and chromosomal sexes; soft biometrics for aging recognition are often deeply influenced by ageist stereotypes, etc. Second, soft biometrics have strong potential for categorizing and profiling people, so risking of supporting processes of stigmatization and exclusion.Mordini E (2013) Biometrics. In Henk A. M. J. ten Have, Bert Gordijn (eds) Handbook of Global Bioethics Berlin: Springer, 341‚Äì356 =International sharing of biometric data= Many countries, including the United States, are planning to share biometric data with other nations. In testimony before the US House Appropriations Committee, Subcommittee on Homeland Security on \\"biometric identification\\" in 2009, Kathleen Kraninger and Robert A Mocny commented on international cooperation and collaboration with respect to biometric data, as follows: According to an article written in 2009 by S. Magnuson in the National Defense Magazine entitled \\"Defense Department Under Pressure to Share Biometric Data\\" the United States has bilateral agreements with other nations aimed at sharing biometric data. To quote that article: =Likelihood of full governmental disclosure= Certain members of the civilian community are worried about how biometric data is used but full disclosure may not be forthcoming. In particular, the Unclassified Report of the United States' Defense Science Board Task Force on Defense Biometrics states that it is wise to protect, and sometimes even to disguise, the true and total extent of national capabilities in areas related directly to the conduct of security-related activities. This also potentially applies to Biometrics. It goes on to say that this is a classic feature of intelligence and military operations. In short, the goal is to preserve the security of 'sources and methods'. Countries applying biometrics Countries using biometrics include Australia, Brazil, Canada, Cyprus, Greece, China, Gambia, Germany, India, Iraq, Ireland, Israel, Italy, Malaysia, Netherlands, New Zealand, Nigeria, Norway, Pakistan, South Africa, Saudi Arabia, Tanzania,web article dated 24 February 2015 in planet biometrics entitled \\"Biometric voter registration launches in Tanzania\\" accessed 21 January 2016 Ukraine, United Arab Emirates, United Kingdom, United States and Venezuela. Among low to middle income countries, roughly 1.2 billion people have already received identification through a biometric identification program. There are also numerous countries applying biometrics for voter registration and similar electoral purposes. According to the International IDEA's ICTs in Elections Database, some of the countries using (2017) Biometric Voter Registration (BVR) are Armenia, Angola, Bangladesh, Bhutan, Bolivia, Brazil, Burkina Faso, Cambodia, Cameroon, Chad, Colombia, Comoros, Congo (Democratic Republic of), Costa Rica, Ivory Coast, Dominican Republic, Fiji, Gambia, Ghana, Guatemala, India, Iraq, Kenya, Lesotho, Liberia, Malawi, Mali, Mauritania, Mexico, Morocco, Mozambique, Namibia, Nepal, Nicaragua, Nigeria, Panama, Peru, The Philippines, Senegal, Sierra Leone, Solomon Islands, Somaliland, Swaziland, Tanzania, Uganda, Uruguay, Venezuela, Yemen, Zambia, and Zimbabwe. = India's national ID program = India's national ID program called Aadhaar is the largest biometric database in the world. It is a biometrics-based digital identity assigned for a person's lifetime, verifiable online instantly in the public domain, at any time, from anywhere, in a paperless way. It is designed to enable government agencies to deliver a retail public service, securely based on biometric data (fingerprint, iris scan and face photo), along with demographic data (name, age, gender, address, parent/spouse name, mobile phone number) of a person. The data is transmitted in encrypted form over the internet for authentication, aiming to free it from the limitations of physical presence of a person at a given place. About 550 million residents have been enrolled and assigned 480 million Aadhaar national identification numbers as of 7 November 2013. It aims to cover the entire population of 1.2 billion in a few years.\\"Building a Biometric National ID: Lessons for Developing Countries from India's Universal ID Program\\", Alan Gelb and Julia Clark, The Center for Global Development, October 2012, However, it is being challenged by critics over privacy concerns and possible transformation of the state into a surveillance state, or into a Banana republic.¬ß The project was also met with mistrust regarding the safety of the social protection infrastructures. To tackle the fear amongst the people, India's supreme court put a new ruling into action that stated that privacy from then on was seen as a fundamental right. On 24 August 2017 this new law was established.

It is designed for layout, typesetting, and preparation of files for professional-quality image-setting equipment. Scribus can also create animated and interactive PDF presentations and forms. Example uses include writing newspapers, brochures, newsletters, posters, and books. Scribus is written in Qt and released under the GNU General Public License. There are native versions available for Unix, Linux, BSD, macOS, Haiku, Microsoft Windows, OS/2 (including ArcaOS and eComStation) operating systems. Many free programs are included in this DTP package. Books about Scribus are available in several languages, including an official manual for v1.3, published through FLES Books in 2009. General feature overview Scribus supports most major bitmap formats, including TIFF, JPEG, and PSD. Vector drawings can be imported or directly opened for editing. The long list of supported formats includes Encapsulated PostScript, SVG, Adobe Illustrator, and Xfig. Professional type/image-setting features include CMYK colors and ICC color management. It has a built-in scripting engine using Python (actual 2.7.13 in 1.5.4). It is available in 60 languages. High-level printing is achieved using its own internal level 3 PostScript driver, including support for font embedding and sub-setting with TrueType, Type 1, and OpenType fonts. The internal driver supports full Level 2 PostScript constructs and a large subset of Level 3 constructs. PDF support includes transparency, encryption, and a large set of the PDF 1.5 specification including layers (OCG), as well as PDF/X-3 and PDF/X-4 (since 1.5.1), including interactive PDFs form fields, annotations, and bookmarks. The current file format, called SLA, is XML. Old versions of SLA were based on XML. Text can be imported from OpenDocument (ODT) text documents (such as from LibreOffice Writer), OpenOffice.org XML (OpenOffice.org Writer's SXW files), Microsoft Word's DOC, PDB, and HTML formats (although some limitations apply). ODT files can typically be imported along with their paragraph styles, which are then created in Scribus. HTML tags which modify text, such as bold and italic, are supported. Word and PDB documents are only imported as plain text.https://wiki.scribus.net/wiki/images/9/93/Scribus-specs-152.pdf Initially, Scribus did not properly support complex script rendering and so could not be used with Unicode text for languages written in Arabic, Hebrew, Indic, and South East Asian writing systems, even though it supported Unicode character encoding. In August 2012, it was announced that a third party had developed a system to support complex Indic scripts. In May 2015 it was announced that the ScribusCTL project had started to improve complex layout by integrating the OpenType text-shaping engine HarfBuzz into the official Scribus 1.5.1svn branch. In July 2016 it was announced that the text layout engine had been rewritten from scratch in preparation for support of complex scripts coming in Scribus 1.5.3 and later. In December 2016 Scribus announced they got support for OpenType advanced feature in 1.5.3svn, as well as complex script and RTL direction. Scribus 1.4.7 did not have OpenType alternative glyph support, so ligatures, for example, were not inserted automatically; this became available from v1.5.3. Support for other programs and formats Scribus cannot read or write the native file formats of other DTP programs such as QuarkXPress or InDesign; the developers consider that reverse engineering those file formats would be prohibitively complex and could risk legal action from the makers of those programs. Support for importing Microsoft Publisher is incorporated into version 1.5, and QuarkXPress Tag files, InDesign's IDML, as well as InCopy's ICML formats were added to the development branch. Due to licensing issues, the software package does not include support for the Pantone color matching system (PMS), which is included in some commercial DTP applications. Pantone colors can be obtained and incorporated within Scribus without licensing issues. Scribus is shipped with more than 100 color palettes (more than 300 since 1.5.3) most donated by various commercial color vendors, but also including scientific, national, and government color standards. German Organisation freieFarbe e.V. built last HLC Colour Atlas for real colours based on CIELAB. This free Colour Palette is also available in Scribus 1.5.4.

The southern terminus is at US 60 in Wickenburg, Arizona. The northern terminus is at the Canada‚ÄìUS border north of Eureka in Lincoln County, Montana, where the roadway continues into Roosville, British Columbia, as Highway 93. Major cities that US 93 travels through include: Las Vegas, Nevada; Twin Falls, Idaho; Missoula, Montana; and Kalispell, Montana. Route description =Arizona= US 93 begins at US 60 in Wickenburg, a small town about northwest of Phoenix. northwest of Wickenburg, it passes through a large forest of Joshua trees, and is thus labeled the Joshua Forest Parkway of Arizona until it reaches Wikieup. From there it heads north, eventually merging with I-40 to head west to Kingman. US 93 then splits from I-40 in Kingman and heads north to the Hoover Dam. Chloride is located off this highway and Santa Claus is on the west side about before the Chloride Road intersection. This highway was known to be one of the deadliest highways in America until recently. The years of improvements have made it a much safer road to travel, according to the Federal Highway Administration. =Nevada= U.S. 93 heading towards Alamo, Nevada US 93 enters Nevada where Interstate 11 begins here on the Hoover Dam Bypass, then winds its way west-southwest through Boulder City before it merges with U.S. Route 95 past the interchange with State Route 173 and then curves northwest towards Las Vegas. These combined routes then join and run concurrent with the Interstate 11 and Interstate 515 freeway through Henderson and southeastern Las Vegas, before US 93 exits at the Las Vegas Spaghetti Bowl interchange just northwest of downtown, heading northbound concurrently with Interstate 15. Those two routes then run in a northeasterly direction through the city of North Las Vegas until they exit the metro area, where US 93 eventually diverges from I-15 to head north towards Great Basin National Park. Near there, the highway joins with the combined U.S. Route 6 and U.S. Route 50 to run northwest towards Ely. At that city, US 6 first departs to the west towards Tonopah, then shortly thereafter US 50 departs US 93 to continue west towards Fallon, Reno (via US 50 ALT west, US 95 ALT north and I-80 west) and Carson City. Upon reaching Lages Station, US 93 ALT splits off in a northeasterly direction towards West Wendover. The main route of US 93 continues north from there, intersecting Interstate 80 at Wells before crossing the Idaho state line near Jackpot. Between State Route 318 and Majors Junction (US 6 and 50), US 93 is designated a Nevada Scenic Byway. From Ely to Schellbourne Ranch, US 93 is part of the Lincoln Highway, the first road across the United States. =Idaho= US 93 entering Grand View Canyon (between Mackay and Challis, Idaho) Shortly after entering Idaho at Jackpot, Nevada, US 93 passes US 30 as it enters Twin Falls. North of here, the highway crosses the Snake River Canyon via the Perrine Bridge en route to an interchange with Interstate 84. US 93 passes through Shoshone and runs concurrently with both US 26 and US 20 before reaching Arco. The highway then turns northwest to enter the Big Lost River valley through Mackay. Just south of Challis, US 93 becomes the northern leg of the Salmon River Scenic Byway as it heads towards the town of Salmon.Idaho Scenic Byways - Salmon River From there, the highway follows portions of the Lewis and Clark Trail and passes through the Salmon-Challis National Forest before entering Montana. =Montana= Montana State Line, US 93 at Lost Trail Pass US 93 enters Montana from Idaho at Lost Trail Pass and travels north descending through the Bitterroot National Forest. The highway continues along the Lewis and Clark Trail into the Bitterroot Valley towards Missoula, passing through Darby and Hamilton. At Lolo, US 12 joins from the west and they run concurrently northeast for , where US 93 heads due north on Reserve Street in Missoula. US 93 then joins I-90 and runs concurrently westward for to Wye, where it heads north. The \\"Animals' Bridge\\" on the Flathead Indian Reservation is used by grizzly and black bears. From Wye, US 93 continues north through the Flathead Indian Reservation, where its signage includes the historic Salish and Kutenai names for towns, rivers, and streams. Portions of this section run along the National Bison Range. North of the reservation, US 93 traverses the western shore of Flathead Lake, the largest freshwater lake west of the Mississippi River. North of the lake the highway runs through the cities of Kalispell and Whitefish, traveling through the Flathead National Forest and the Stillwater State Forest before reaching its terminus at the Canada‚ÄìUS border near Eureka. The portion north of Hamilton travels through one of the most densely populated areas in Montana. This section also serves as a popular north-south connection between Yellowstone National Park and Glacier National Park. As a result, the road tends to become more congested between Hamilton and Whitefish. A popular bumper sticker in Montana reads, \\"Pray for me, I drive Hwy 93!\\" Total US 93 mileage in Montana as of 2013 is : from the Idaho line to Reserve Street in Missoula via corridor N-7 (C000007) (includes concurrency with US 12), via corridor N-92 (C000092) (Reserve Street), concurrent with I-90 and MT 200 (C000090) and from Wye to the Canadian border via corridor N-5 (C000005) (includes concurrency with MT 200). =Canada= British Columbia Highway 93 continues the numbering from the U.S. version, with the highway continuing north and eventually into Alberta as Alberta Highway 93, finally terminating just outside the town of Jasper, Alberta. History U.S. Route 93 was not one of the original U.S. highways proposed in the 1925 Bureau of Public Roads plan. However, the revised numbering plan approved by the American Association of State Highway Officials (AASHO) on November 11, 1926, established US 93 from the Canada‚ÄìUS border near Eureka, Montana, south through Montana and Idaho to a southern terminus at Wells, Nevada. US 93's original northern terminus was a few miles west of its current terminus, along the Kootenai River at the Gateway Port of entry. This was the case until around 1934, when US 93 was routed along its current route. AASHO, at its June 8, 1931, meeting, approved a southerly extension of US 93 south to Glendale, Nevada. By 1932, the Nevada Department of Highways had marked the continuation of the highway using the routing of several preexisting state highways. At the request of the Arizona State Highway Department, the AASHO route numbering committee approved another extension of US 93 in 1935. This shifted the southern terminus south to Kingman, Arizona, by way of Las Vegas. Nevada officials again extended the route along preexisting highways; however, they may not have signed the extension right away as it was not shown on Nevada's state-published maps until 1939. Until 1993, US 93 ended a short distance north of Wickenburg, Arizona, at a junction with U.S. Route 89. When US 89 was decommissioned in the area, the US 93 designation was carried on into Wickenburg. A highway segment opened on October 19, 2010, in the area of Hoover Dam; the Hoover Dam Bypass replaces a segment of US 93 over the dam that had been closed to truck traffic due to security concerns since the September 11, 2001, attacks.Illia 2009, p. 18. \\"After Sept. 11, 2001, more than 2000 trucks a day have been diverted 23 miles away from the dam, costing consumers some $30 million annually in added fuel and delays, reports the Nevada Motor Transport Association, a Sparks, Nev.-based group.\\" The bypass crosses the Colorado River on a bridge downstream of the dam. The bypass eliminated the permanent truck detour through either Laughlin, Nevada, or Needles, California, that had been in place since 2001. Future US 93 (with US 60 to the southeast of Wickenburg) is currently the shortest and most direct route between Las Vegas and Phoenix, two of the fastest-growing cities in the United States. Upgrades of US 60 and US 93 to expressway status are scheduled between Las Vegas and Phoenix. Most recently, in the 2012 Fixing America's Surface Transportation Act, the United States Congress officially designated a new Interstate freeway corridor between the two cities as I-11, which would mostly or completely replace US 93 in Arizona. A new US 93 Alt. was built to bypass through traffic around downtown Kalispell, Montana, from 2010 to 2016. Currently, US 93 through Kalispell is Main Street and Sunset Boulevard, a arterial. Three segments of the bypass comprising a total of were completed and opened to traffic from 2010 to 2013. The remaining opened October 28, 2016. The southwest segment of the bypass is currently only two lanes, and is slated for expansion to four lanes with two additional grade-separated interchanges when funding permits.

The film was adapted from the novel of the same name by Stephen McCauley and the screenplay was written by Wendy Wasserstein. The story concerns a pregnant New York social worker who develops romantic feelings for her gay best friend and decides to raise her child with him, and the complications that ensue. It was filmed in 1997 in various locations around New York City, New Jersey, and Connecticut.IMDb.com filming locations ‚Äì The Object of My Affection The film received mixed reviews and was a moderate box office success grossing $46.9 million on a $15 million budget. Plot Social worker Nina Borowski (Jennifer Aniston) is a bright young woman living in a cozy Brooklyn apartment. Nina attends a party given by her stepsister Constance (Allison Janney) and her husband, Sidney (Alan Alda). There Nina meets George Hanson (Paul Rudd), a young, handsome, and gay first grade teacher. Nina tells George that her stepsister is constantly trying to fix her up with somebody from higher society, completely ignoring the fact that Nina has a boyfriend, Vince (John Pankow). During the conversation, Nina offers George a room in her apartment as she has just heard from his boyfriend, Dr. Robert Joley (Tim Daly), that George is looking for somewhere to live. George, not knowing about Robert's plans, is taken aback and heartbroken, and after the party the two split up. George accepts Nina's offer and moves into her apartment. The two soon become best friends; they watch films together and go ballroom dancing. Everything is great until Nina announces that she is pregnant. Vince, the baby's father, wants to marry her, but his constant control drives Nina crazy; she leaves him and George offers to help raise her child. For some time, they live together in her apartment in Brooklyn. Everything is perfect again until Nina finds that her love for George is growing every day, especially after he tells her he had a girlfriend in high school, leading her to believe they might have a sexual relationship. One afternoon, George and Nina are about to have sex when George gets a phone call from Robert who tells him how much he has missed him and invites him away for the weekend. George is confused but agrees to go. Nina feels threatened and gets jealous. George and Robert do not re-establish their relationship, but George meets Paul James (Amo Gulinello), a young actor, and the two are attracted to each other and have sex. Meanwhile, Nina is staying with Constance at a vacation mansion and is extremely moody. She has a horrible time and decides to head back home and asks George to return as well. Her purse is snatched on the way and a friendly police officer, Louis (Kevin Carroll), gives her a ride home. Nina decides to invite Paul and his older acting mentor with whom he lives, Rodney (Nigel Hawthorne), for Thanksgiving after a rather prickly brunch with a late arriving George, and his brother and his brother's latest fiancee. After the evening winds down, Paul stays the night with George, resulting in a heated argument between George and Nina, and heartache for Rodney. At George's brother's wedding, they continue their discussion as Nina has begun to realize the reality of the situation. Nina fully explains to George her feelings for him. George, who loves Nina as his best friend, tells her that, ultimately, he wants to be with Paul. A few hours later, Nina gives birth to a beautiful girl she names Molly. Vince, ecstatic, visits her in the hospital, but when he leaves to complete paperwork, Nina and George remain alone with Molly. Nina asks George when he plans to move out to which he replies that he doesn't know. She asks him to move out of her apartment before she gets home from the hospital, stating that it would hurt her too much to have him stay any longer knowing that he doesn't love her the same way she does him. The end of the film takes place at George's school eight years later, in which all of the main characters go to see Molly in a musical production that George has directed. George is now the principal of the school. Nina is now in a relationship with Louis, and George is still with Paul, both of them now happy. Rodney is also there, still considered 'one of the family' by Louis & Nina. The film ends as Nina, George, and young Molly (Sarah Hyland) (who refers to George as her \\"Uncle George\\") walk together down the sidewalk, hand- in-hand, on their way to get coffee and talk.

There are efforts to use the game of chess as a tool to aid the intellectual development of young people. Chess is significant in cognitive psychology and artificial intelligence (AI) studies, because it represents the domain in which expert performance has been most intensively studied and measured. Although the results of research studies have failed to produce unambiguous support for the intellectual benefits of playing chess, several local governments, schools, and student organizations all over the world are implementing chess programs. New York-based Chess-In-The-Schools, Inc. chessinschools.org has been active in the public school system in the city since 1986. It currently reaches more than 30,000 students annually. America's Foundation for Chess has initiated programs in partnership with local school districts in several U.S. cities, including Seattle, San Diego, Philadelphia, and Tampa. The Chess'n Math Association promotes chess at the scholastic level in Canada. Chess for Success is a program for at-risk schools in Oregon.Chess for Success Since 1991, the U.S. Chess Center in Washington, D.C. teaches chess to children, especially those in the inner city, \\"as a means of improving their academic and social skills.\\" There are a number of experiments that suggest that learning and playing chess aids the mind. The Grandmaster Eugene Torre Chess Institute in the Philippines, the United States Chess Federation's chess research bibliography, and English educational consultant Tony Buzan's Brain Foundation, among others, continuously collect such experimental results. The advent of chess software that automatically record and analyze the moves of each player in each game and can tirelessly play with human players of various levels, further helped in giving new directions to experimental designs on chess as mental training.  History  As early as 1779chesscafe.com (pdf): ‚ÄûIt is said that Franklin wrote the essay for the amusement of Anne Louise Brillon de Jouy in 1779 during his stay in France.‚Äú Benjamin Franklin, in his article The morals of chess, has advocated such a view: > \\"The Game of Chess is not merely an idle amusement; several very valuable > qualities of the mind, useful in the course of human life, are to be > acquired and strengthened by it, so as to become habits ready on all > occasions; for life is a kind of Chess, in which we have often points to > gain, and competitors or adversaries to contend with, and in which there is > a vast variety of good and ill events, that are, in some degree, the effect > of prudence, or the want of it. By playing at Chess then, we may learn: 1st, > Foresight, which looks a little into futurity, and considers the > consequences that may attend an action ... 2nd, Circumspection, which > surveys the whole Chess-board, or scene of action: - the relation of the > several Pieces, and their situations; ... 3rd, Caution, not to make our > moves too hastily....\\" Alfred Binet demonstrated in the late 19th century that good chess players have superior memory and imagination. Adriaan de Groot concurred with Alfred Binet that visual memory and visual perception are important attributors and that problem-solving ability is of paramount importance. Thus, since 1972, at the collegiate level, the University of Texas at Dallas and the University of Maryland, Baltimore County both recruit chessplayer-scholars and run scholastic outreach programs in their respective communities.

He was regarded as one of the most influential contemporary literary critics in the field of German literature and has often been called Literaturpapst (\\"Pope of Literature\\") in Germany.WHO'S WHO profile: Marcel Reich-Ranicki Life =Early life= Marcel Reich was born on 2 June 1920 in W≈Çoc≈Çawek, Poland, to David Reich, a Polish Jewish merchant, and his wife, Helene (n√©e Auerbach) Reich, who came from a German Jewish family. Reich and his family moved to Berlin in 1929. He attended a German school there but was later sent to Berlin to study. Reich dedicated himself to the reading of German classics and practicing the theatre. The literary critic Volker Weidermann wrote that \\"he found his salvation in literature\\". As a Jew he was unable to enroll at university and was then expelled back to Poland in 1938. After being denied at university of Berlin, he was arrested and deported to Poland. In his 1999 autobiography, My Life, Ranicki affirmed, \\"I had a ticket for [a] premi√®re that evening ‚Äì I wouldn't be needing it.\\" In November 1940, Reich and his parents found themselves in the Warsaw Ghetto, during which time he worked for the Judenrat as a chief translator, and contributed to the collaborative newspaper Gazeta ≈ªydowska (The Jewish Newspaper) as a music critic. Reich's translation work meant that he was an eyewitness to meetings between the Jewish and Nazi authorities. Ranicki survived to the Jewish deportation in the Warsaw Ghetto (Poland), where he married his wife Teofila, whereas his parents were killed in the Treblinka concentration camp. In 1943 Reich and his wife managed to escape the Ghetto. His parents and brother were killed in the Holocaust. His sister survived, having escaped to England shortly before the war. In 1944 he joined the Polish People's Army, and became an officer in UrzƒÖd Bezpiecze≈Ñstwa, Soviet-controlled Poland's intelligence service, where he worked in the censorship department. He joined the Polish Workers' Party after the war. From 1948 to 1949 he was a Polish diplomat and intelligence worker (operating under the pseudonym \\"Ranicki\\") in London. The couple's only child, Andrew Ranicki, who became a notable math professor, was born in London in 1948. Reich was recalled from London in 1949, sacked from the intelligence service, and expelled from the Party on charges of \\"ideological estrangement\\", for which he was also jailed for a short time. Subsequently, he developed a career as an editor, publisher of East German authors, and freelance writer for newspapers and radio with a focus on German literature. =Life in Germany= Frustrated by the curtailment of his liberty in the People's Republic of Poland he emigrated in 1958 with his wife and son to the Federal Republic of Germany, living in the city of Hamburg. Here he began writing for leading German periodicals, including Die Welt and the Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung. In Poland, he had published under the pseudonym \\"Ranicki\\" as his intelligence codename. On the advice of the arts editor of the Frankfurter Allgemeine he adopted the name Marcel Reich-Ranicki professionally. From 1963 to 1973, he was literary critic for the German weekly Die Zeit, published in Hamburg. In 1973 he moved to Frankfurt, where, from 1973 to 1988, he was head of the literature staff at the daily Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung. Reich- Ranicki would go on to write and edit for the Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung for the rest of his life. In 1969 he taught at an American university. From 1971 to 1975 he held visiting professorships at Stockholm and Uppsala. In 1974 he was awarded an honorary professorship at the University of T√ºbingen, Germany. In 1990 and 1991 he received the Heinrich-Hertz visiting professorship of the University of Karlsruhe, and in 1991 and 1992 he received the Heinrich-Heine visiting professorship at the University of D√ºsseldorf. From 1988 to 2001, Reich-Ranicki hosted the literary talk show Literarisches Quartett on German public television. Through the show he became a household name in Germany; according to a survey 98% of Germans knew his name.https://www.ruhrnachrichten.de/Leben-und-Erleben/Auch-mit-90-ist-Reich- Ranicki-noch-streitlustig-879389.html In Summer 2000, fellow panelist Sigrid L√∂ffler left the panel, complaining because Reich-Ranicki had put forward Haruki Murakami's erotic novel South of the Border, West of the Sun for discussion, which L√∂ffler disliked. Reich-Ranicki answered that she had a problem with erotic literature in general. Although differences over the Murakami provided a catalyst for L√∂ffler's widely publicised departure from the programme, it does appear that tensions between L√∂ffler and Reich-Ranicki were more broadly based and longstanding, having indeed nourished the programme's dynamic over the years. In 2002 the show was followed by a similar but short-lived programme, Reich-Ranicki Solo, which consisted of him talking about old and new books in front of a studio audience. Jack Zipes wrote: \\"On his television show Reich-Ranicki often played the clown, a mixture of Milton Berle and Jack Benny, but you always had to take him seriously because his knowledge of German culture was so comprehensive.\\" In 1993, the weekly Der Spiegel gave him a dossier of about fifteen pages, under the title The Lord of Books, tracing his career, first to Die Zeit, then to the Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung. Many writers, and readers too, disagreed with some traits of his complex personality, while universally recognizing his culture and passion for German literature. Having written about German literature for most of his life, he published books on American and Polish literature, after cutting down on his television appearances. Reich-Ranicki's wife and son encouraged him to write an autobiography \\"before it was too late\\". Published in 1999, Mein Leben (\\"My Life\\") was a bestseller in Germany, cementing his status. Mainly dealing with life and survival during the war, the book was adapted for television and broadcast starring Matthias Schweigh√∂fer as Reich- Ranicki in April 2009. In February 2006 he received the honorary degree of Doctor Philosophiae Honoris Causa from Tel Aviv University, which later that year established an endowed chair for German literature named after him. In February 2007 the Humboldt University in Berlin awarded him an honorary degree. This is the same university that Reich-Ranicki applied to in 1938, when his application was turned down because of his Jewish ancestry. In October 2008, he was awarded a lifetime achievement award during at the German Television Awards telecast for Literarisches Quartett. He made headlines with his acceptance speech, in which he spurned the prize and criticized the state of German television.Article in The Guardian on Marcel Reich-RanickiVideo of the acceptance speech (full length) at YouTube He also declared he would have paid any monetary award back, had the prize been associated with a monetary. In 2012, Reich-Ranicki made a speech at the Bundestag at the International Holocaust Remembrance Day. He continued to write a weekly column in the Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung until shortly before his death. The autobiographic book \\"My life\\", published in 1999, begins with Reich-Ranicki reporting a conversation of 1958 with G√ºnter Grass asking him: \\"Are you German, or Polish, or what?\\". The answer was: \\"Half German...\\". =Personal life = Reich-Ranicki died on 18 September 2013 in Frankfurt, having previously been diagnosed with prostate cancer. German Chancellor Angela Merkel paid tribute: \\"We lose in him a peerless friend of literature, but also of freedom and democracy. I will miss this passionate and brilliant man.\\" The S√ºddeutsche Zeitung described Reich-Ranicki as \\"the man who taught us how to read.\\" Marcel's son, Andrew Ranicki (1948‚Äì2018),http://literaturkritik.de/zum- tod-von-andrew-ranicki-sohn-von-teofila-und-marcel-reich-ranicki,24261.html was a professor of mathematics at the University of Edinburgh. Marcel's wife, Teofila Reich-Ranicki, predeceased her husband by two years, dying in 2011.\\"Teofila Reich-Ranicki ist tot\\" (in German), hr-online.de] According to The Economist, \\"He appreciated Jewish culture, especially its way with words, but found religion pointless and, after Warsaw, God inconceivable.\\"https://www.economist.com/obituary/2013/09/28/marcel-reich- ranicki Marcel Reich-Ranicki Relationships with authors As a tough critic Reich-Ranicki had a difficult relationship with other authors. Following the publication of Too Far Afield by his fellow Gruppe 47 member G√ºnter Grass, Reich-Ranicki appeared on the cover of the magazine Der Spiegel, tearing the novel apart. The magazine included his unfavorable review of the book. Reich- Ranicki praised Grass' next book, Crabwalk. Another frequent target of Reich- Ranicki was writer Martin Walser. In 2002, Walser published the crime novel Death of a Critic (Tod eines Kritikers) as a revenge against Reich-Ranicki. In the book a prominent, bigoted critic named Andr√© Ehrl-K√∂nig ‚Äì who shares many similarities with Reich-Ranicki ‚Äì is murdered. The novel became a hot topic of debate in Germany. Australian writer Clive James stated, \\"Every living German writer wants his praise, but it has always been hard to get: the reason, of course, why they would like to have it.\\" Works * Literarisches Leben in Deutschland 1963 * Deutsche Literatur in Ost und West Piper 1963, DTV 1983 (revised) * Literarisches Leben in Deutschland.

Moroni means \\"at the river\\" (mroni in Shingazidja). Moroni is the capital of the semi-autonomous island of Ngazidja, the largest of the three main islands of the republic. The city's estimated population in 2003 was 41,557 residents. Moroni, which lies along the Route Nationale 1, has a port and several mosques such as the Badjanani Mosque. History Moroni in 1908 The early history of Moroni was not concrete. The earliest written evidence for settlement in the Comoros Islands comes no earlier than the 7th century, possibly by Arab navigations and Bantu-speaking agriculturalists,Crowther, et al. \\"Coastal Subsistence, Maritime Trade, and the Colonization of Small Offshore Islands in Eastern African Prehistory.\\" Journal of Island and Coastal Archaeology, 11:211‚Äì237, 2016 while ceramic finds from the 7th to 10th century demonstrate that the Islands were part of the developing Swahili civilization,Fleisher, Jeremy, et al. \\"Ceramics and the Early Swahili: Deconstructing the Early Tana Tradition.\\" African Archaeology Review (2011) 28:245‚Äì278Britannica, Moroni, britannica.com, USA, accessed on July 7, 2019 but when Moroni itself was first settled is not known. By the middle of the second millennium, however, Moroni was clearly a well established town, engaged in trade networks throughout the Indian Ocean, and the Badjanani mosque, built in 1427, is a testament to the city's wealth, contemporary with the golden ages of other Swahili cities.Ouledi, Ahmed, and Mahmoud Ibrahime. 2007. Les Comores Au Jour Le Jour: Chronologie. Moroni: Komedit. Together with neighbouring port and royal capital Ikoni, Moroni was one of two centres of economic and political power of the kingdom of Bambao. Nevertheless, until the end of the nineteenth century it was just one of a number of large towns on the island, and it wasn't until the Sultan of Bambao, Said Ali ibn Said Omar, negotiated a treaty of Protectorate with France in 1886 that his town became the seat of the colonial administration.V√©rin, Pierre. 1994. Les Comores. Paris: Karthala. Moroni grew slowly through the twentieth century for, although it was now the capital of Ngazidja, it was not the seat of the territorial administration, which was located at Dzaoudzi on Mayotte, and in 1958 its population was still only 6545.Maximy, Ren√© de. 1968. \\"Moroni, capitale des Comores.\\" Madagascar Revue de G√©ographie 12: 59-80. However, in that same year the decision was taken to move the capital of the archipelago from Dzaoudzi to Moroni, and the town slowly grew to become the largest in the country. An agreement on broad autonomy to the three islands was refused by the Anjouan representatives which resulted in an eruption of violence affecting Moroni in April 1999, during which Colonel Azali Assoumani assumed power in a coup d'√©tat. In December 2003, the Moroni Agreement on Transition Agreements was signed by the island presidents of the Union of Comoros. In the run up to the 2006 elections, the government-owned Radio Ngazidja and private station Moroni FM were raided by armed assailants and forced off the air temporarily. In 2010, the U.S. Navy's Seabees constructed Hamramba School in Moroni as a humanitarian project, in partnership with the local military and Comoros' federal government; construction methods included mixing concrete by hand before using buckets and wheel barrels to move the concrete to the school site.  Geography  Itsandra beach The city is on the western coast of Ngazidja. Moroni has a rocky volcanic coastline, mostly without beaches. Settlements to the north of Moroni include Itsandra, Ntsoudjini, Ouellah, Bahani, Batsa, Vanambouani and Vanadjou, and to the south are Ikoni, Mvouni, Daoueni and Selea. = Landmarks = Badjanani Mosque The historic town centre, the Medina, contains a maze of narrow alleys and ancient buildings but is poorly maintained. The old city centre is similar to but smaller than the old town of Lamu. There are many mosques, notably the Badjanani Mosque or Ancienne Mosqu√©e de Vendredi (old Friday mosque), which is the oldest mosque in the Medina. It was originally built in 1427, and a minaret was added in 1921. The 300-seat theatre of the Alliance Franco- Comorienne serves as a venue for national and international performances, ceremonies, conferences, film screenings, and seminars. Other venues include the 700-seat Al-Kamar, the 500-seat Palais du Peuple, and the 300-seat Foyer des Jeunes de Foumbouni. Moroni has a few hotels and nightclubs. The nearby Karthala volcano is also an attraction for hiking when the volcano is dormant. = Environment =  Climate  Moroni features a tropical rainforest climate (Af), with generally heavy precipitation throughout the year‚Äîonly October sees on average less than of rain (roughly ). The average annual rainfall is and it rains during all months of the year. The monsoon season lasts from November to April. Humidity is in the range of 69 to 79 percent. Moroni's average temperatures throughout the year are relatively constant with a high in the range of and a low in the range of . The region experiences frequent cyclones and as the islands are located more than 10 degrees below the equator in the western part of the Indian Ocean, the climate is generally termed as \\"maritime tropical\\".  Mount Karthala  Moroni is situated at the foot of Mount Karthala, northwest from the volcano's crater. The high active volcano is reported to be one of the largest active volcanoes in the world, with a diameter of about , and erupting approximately every eleven years over the past two hundred years. The eruption of 2005 caused displacement of a large number of people due to volcanic ash.  Wildlife  The volcano which forms the backdrop of the Moroni city has numerous bird species including Comoro pigeon, Karthala scops owl, Comoro cuckoo-roller, Comoro drongo, Comoro thrush, Comoro bulbul, Humblot's flycatcher, Comoro cuckoo-shrike, Kirk's white-eye, Karthala white-eye, Comoro brush-warbler, Comoro green sunbird, and Comoro fody.  Demographics  , Moroni had a population of about 54,000. Sunni Muslims account for 98%, and there is a minority of Roman Catholics. The official languages of the Comoros are Shikomori (a Bantu language closely related to Swahili), Arabic and French.  Places of worship  Among the places of worship, they are predominantly Muslim mosques. There are also Christian churches and temples : Apostolic Vicariate of the Comoros Archipelago (Catholic Church), Protestant churches, Evangelical Churches.J. Gordon Melton, Martin Baumann, Religions of the World: A Comprehensive Encyclopedia of Beliefs and Practices, ABC-CLIO, USA, 2010, p. 762  Economy  Goods produced on the island are vanilla, soft drinks, processed and distilled essential oils, metal and wood products, and processed pozzolana (cement); these are exported from the port. The tourist infrastructure is poorly developed. Financial institutions include Banque Centrale des Comores, Banque de Development des Comores, and Banque pour Industries et le Commerce. There are several markets in Moroni, including the old market and the larger market at Volo Volo in the north of the city.  Transport  Moroni Harbour The country's civil aviation authority, Minist√®re des Postes et T√©l√©communications de la Promotion des Nouvelles Technologies de l'Information et de la Communication charg√© des Transports et du Tourisme, is located in Moroni, as is the National Agency of Civil Aviation and Meteorology. Moroni is served by the Prince Said Ibrahim International Airport, located at Hahaya, about north of the town. However, there are no direct flights to Europe. It is a civilian airport at an elevation of and has a paved runway which has dimensions of . Airlines which operate international flights to this airport are Air Austral and Kenya Airways. However, between the islands the local airlines, Int'Air Iles and AB Aviation operate. On 30 June 2009, Yemenia Flight 626, en route from Yemen to Moroni, crashed into the Indian Ocean with 153 passengers and crew on board, many from France. Moroni Port in the foreground There is a major harbour though small in size with regular transport to the African mainland and the other islands in the Comoros archipelago, as well as Madagascar and other Indian ocean islands. The port is a small quay of with a draught of , and hence is not suitable for large ships to enter as coral reefs pose a threat to safety. It supports a maximum vessel size of . The channel depth is , with an anchorage depth of , a cargo pier depth of and a terminal depth of . Within the harbour's mini industrial zone, a local container terminal was managed by Gulfcom Port Management SA during the period of 2006‚Äì2012, after which Bollor√© Africa Logistics won the concession and it will partner with Cofipri, a Luxembourg investment company. Storage facilities such as warehouses have been established to facilitate imports and exports and also for petroleum storage.

Biography Born the son of a seaman at Port Glasgow, Scotland, he arrived in Sydney (at that time the principal city of the British colony of New South Wales) in 1855. He worked as a joiner for \\"some years\\". Details of his earlier years, prior to his arrival in Australia, are shadowy. He spent most of his life employed by the NSW Education Department. In 1863 he was appointed teacher-in charge of at St Mary's National School and went on to teach at the Presbyterian denominational school in the Sydney suburb of Woolloomooloo in 1867. He then moved to Dowling Plunkett Street Public School in 1878 where he remained until 1885. McCormick was heavily involved in the Scottish Presbyterian Church and was active in a number of community and benevolent organisations. He began his involvement with Sydney's St Stephen's Church as a stonemason, working on the now demolished Phillip Street Church (where Martin Place now stands). The Rev Hugh Darling was so impressed with his singing on the job he asked him to join the choir. McCormick's musical ability led him to becoming the precentor of the Presbyterian Church of NSW, which gave him the opportunity to conduct very large massed choirs. He was also convenor of the Presbyterian Church Assembly's Committee on Psalmody. Also a talented composer, he published around 30 patriotic and Scottish songs, some of which became very popular. Included in his collected works was \\"Advance Australia Fair\\", which was first performed in public by Andrew Fairfax at the St Andrew's Day concert of the Highland Society on 30 November 1878. \\"Advance Australia Fair\\" became quite a popular patriotic song. The Sydney Morning Herald described the music as bold and stirring, and the words \\"decidedly patriotic\\" ‚Äì it was \\"likely to become a popular favourite\\". Later under the pseudonym Amicus (which means 'friend' in Latin), he had the music and four verses published by W. H. Paling & Co. Ltd. The song quickly gained popularity and an amended version was sung by a choir of 10,000 at the inauguration of the Commonwealth of Australia on 1 January 1901. In 1907, the New South Wales Government awarded McCormick ¬£100 for his patriotic composition which he registered for copyright in 1915. In a letter to R. B. Fuller Esq., dated 1 August 1913, McCormick described the circumstances that inspired him to pen the lyrics of his famous song: Death McCormick died in 1916, aged 83, at his home, Clydebank, in the Sydney suburb of Waverley and he was buried at Rookwood Cemetery. He had no children; he was survived by his second wife Emma. His obituary in the Sydney Morning Herald stated: \\"Mr. McCormick established a reputation with the patriotic song, Advance Australia Fair, which ... has come to be recognised as something in the nature of an Australian National Anthem\\". The song was performed by massed bands at the Federal capital celebrations in Canberra in 1927. In 1984 it was formally declared as the Australian national anthem.

Prometea is a Haflinger just like this foal (This is not Prometea). Science The horse is the seventh species to be cloned.(See Cloning for a list and names) Dr. Cesare Galli and others at the lab experimented with 841 reconstructed embryos; of the 14 viable embryos, four were implanted in surrogate mothers - only that of Prometea succeeded in being born. Prometea was born to her twin mother who her cloning cells originated from. Texas A&M; University was also undertaking a horse-cloning project when the Italian team first succeeded. Horse cloning like Prometea could eliminate the problem of champion racing geldings. The Jockey Club of North America Thoroughbred Horses has proclaimed, however, that it will allow no cloned horse in their races. Although horses are not threatened with extinction or other major problem now, cloning may create less genetic diversity among horses by using these horses to breed. This increases the life time of one breeding set of genetics resulting in less variability in a population. In conservation biology, there are concerns related to the lack of genetic diversity that allows for continuation of the species through genetic variation.

Currently the site of Stevens Institute of Technology. Replica of John Stevens' steam carriage Col. John Stevens, III (June 26, 1749 ‚Äì March 6, 1838) was an American lawyer, engineer, and inventor who constructed the first U.S. steam locomotive, first steam-powered ferry, and first U.S. commercial ferry service from his estate in Hoboken. He was influential in the creation of U.S. patent law. Early life Stevens was born June 26, 1749, in New York City, New York. He was the only son of John Stevens Jr. (1715‚Äì1792), a prominent state politician who served as a delegate to the Continental Congress, and Elizabeth Alexander (1726‚Äì1800). His sister, Mary Stevens (d. 1814), married Robert R. Livingston, the first Chancellor of the State of New York. His maternal grandparents were James Alexander (1691‚Äì1756), the Attorney General of New Jersey, and Mary (n√©e Spratt) Provoost Alexander (1693‚Äì1760), herself a prominent merchant in New York City. His paternal grandfather, John Stevens, emigrated from London England around 1695, and was married to Mary Campbell. He graduated King's College (which became Columbia University) in May 1768. Career After his graduation from King's College, he studied law and was admitted to the bar of New York City in 1771. He practiced law in New York and lived across the river. At public auction, he bought from the state of New Jersey a piece of land which had been confiscated from a Tory landowner. The land, described as \\"William Bayard's farm at Hoebuck\\" comprised approximately what is now the city of Hoboken. Stevens built his estate at Castle Point, on land that would later become the site of Stevens Institute of Technology (bequeathed by his son Edwin Augustus Stevens).\\"Hoboken, Castle Point\\", Historic Houses of New Jersey (1902). Stevens bought a farm in Dutchess County, New York from John Armstrong Jr.. Armstrong had converted a barn into a two-story Federal style dwelling with twelve rooms. Stevens made improvements to the estate, including a half-mile race track.Historical and Genealogical Record Dutchess and Putnam Counties New York, Press of the A. V. Haight Co., Poughkeepsie, New York, 1912 He later sold the property to John Church Cruger (1807‚Äì1879), husband of Euphemia Van Rensselaer, daughter of Stephen Van Rensselaer. The Crugers named the estate \\"Annandale\\". In 1776, at age 27, he was appointed a Captain in Washington's army in the American Revolutionary War. During the War, he was promoted to Colonel and became Treasurer of New Jersey, serving from 1776 to 1779. =Steamboats= In 1790, Stevens petitioned Congress for a bill that would protect American inventors. Through his efforts, his bill became a law on April 10, 1790, which introduced the patent system as law in the United States. In 1802, he built a screw- driven steamboat and in 1806, he built the Phoenix, a steamboat that ultimately sailed from Hoboken to Philadelphia in 1809, thereby becoming the first steamship to successfully navigate the open ocean. In October 1811, Stevens' ship the Juliana began operation as the first steam-powered ferry (service was between New York, New York, and Hoboken, New Jersey). The first railroad charter in the U.S. was given to Stevens and others in 1815 for the New Jersey Railroad. The charter essentially gave Stevens and his partners, through the Camden & Amboy Railroad, a monopoly on railroads in the state of New Jersey. In 1825, he designed and built a steam locomotive, which he operated on a circle of track at his estate in Hoboken, New Jersey. He also helped develop United States patent law. Personal life On October 17, 1782, he married Rachel Cox (1761‚Äì1839), the daughter of John Cox. She was a descendant of the Langeveldts (or Longfields) who originally settled New Brunswick, New Jersey. Together, they had thirteen children of which seven were sons. The children included: * John Cox Stevens (1785‚Äì1857), first commodore of the New York Yacht Club who married Maria C.

In North America, a conch is often identified as a queen conch, indigenous to the waters of the Gulf of Mexico and Caribbean. Queen conchs are valued for seafood and are also used as fish bait. The group of conchs that are sometimes referred to as \\"true conchs\\" are marine gastropod molluscs in the family Strombidae, specifically in the genus Strombus and other closely related genera. For example, Lobatus gigas, the queen conch, and Laevistrombus canarium, the dog conch. Many other species are also often called \\"conch\\", but are not at all closely related to the family Strombidae, including Melongena species (family Melongenidae) and the horse conch Triplofusus papillosus (family Fasciolariidae). Species commonly referred to as conchs also include the sacred chank or shankha shell (Turbinella pyrum) and other Turbinella species in the family Turbinellidae. The Triton's trumpet (family Charoniidae) may also be fashioned into a horn and referred to as a conch. Etymology The English word \\"conch\\" is attested in Middle English, coming from Latin concha (shellfish, mussel), which in turn comes from Greek konchƒì (same meaning) ultimately from Proto-Indo-European root *konkho-, cognate with Sanskrit ≈õa·πÖkha.  General description  A conch is a sea snail and it is a mollusca in the phylum division. A conch shell has superior strength and is used as musical instrument or decoration. It consists of about 95% calcium carbonate and 5% organic matter. The conch meat is edible.; Food A group of large eastern conchs or whelks of the species Busycotypus canaliculatus for sale at a California seafood market The meat of conchs is eaten raw in salads or cooked in burgers, chowders, fritters, and gumbos. All parts of the conch meat are edible. Conch is indigenous to the Bahamas and is typically served in fritter, salad, and soup forms. Conch is also eaten in the West Indies (Jamaica in particular); locals in Jamaica eat conch in , stews, and , other types of food curries. Restaurants all over the islands serve this particular meat. In the Dominican Republic, Grenada, and Haiti, conch is commonly eaten in curries or in a spicy soup. It is locally referred to as lambi. In Puerto Rico, conch is served as a ceviche, often called ensalada de carrucho (conch salad), consisting of raw conch marinated in lime juice, olive oil, vinegar, garlic, green peppers, and onions. It is also used to fill empanadas. In Panama, conch is known as cambombia and is often served as ceviche de cambombia, consisting of raw conch marinated in lime juice, chopped onions, finely chopped habaneros, and often vinegar. Conch is very popular in Italy and among Italian Americans. Called scungille (pl. scungilli), it is eaten in a variety of ways, but most often in salads or cooked in a sauce for pasta. It is often included as one of the dishes prepared for the Feast of the Seven Fishes. In East Asian cuisines, conch is often cut into thin slices and then steamed or stir-fried. Eighty percent of the queen conch meat in international trade is imported into the United States. The Florida Keys were a major source of queen conchs until the 1970s, but the conchs are now scarce and all harvesting of them in Florida waters is prohibited and individuals who have harvested them have been punished by law enforcement. =Festival= In the Turks and Caicos Islands, the Conch Festival is held in November each year at the Three Queens Bar/Restaurant in Blue Hills. Local restaurateurs compete for the best and most original conch dishes, which are then judged by international chefs. Other competitions, events, and music performances occur.Turks & Caicos Conch Festival. Musical instruments Conch shells can be used as wind instruments. They are prepared by cutting a hole in the spire of the shell near the apex and then blowing into the shell as if it were a trumpet, as a blowing horn. Sometimes a mouthpiece is used, but some shell trumpets are blown without one. Pitch is adjusted by moving one's hand in and out of the aperture; the deeper the hand, the lower the note. Various species of large marine gastropod shells can be turned into blowing shells, but some of the best-known species used are the sacred chank or shankha Turbinella pyrum, the Triton's trumpet Charonia tritonis, and the queen conch Strombus gigas. Examples of this practice in the Americas can be seen in the form of historical artifacts at the Museo Larco in Lima, Peru, and Museo Nacional de Antropolog√≠a in Mexico City, Mexico. Pearls Conch pearl necklace Many kinds of molluscs can produce pearls. Pearls from the queen conch, S. gigas, are rare and have been collectors' items since Victorian times. Conch pearls occur in a range of hues, including white, brown, and orange, with many intermediate shades, but pink is the colour most associated with the conch pearl, such that these pearls are sometimes referred to simply as \\"pink pearls\\". In some gemological texts, non- nacreous gastropod pearls used to be referred to as \\"calcareous concretions\\" because they were porcellaneous (shiny and ceramic-like in appearance), rather than nacreous (with a pearly lustre). The Gemological Institute of America and World Jewellery Confederation now use the simple term \\"pearl\\"‚Äîor, where appropriate, the more-descriptive term \\"non-nacreous pearl\\"‚Äîfor such items,CIBJO 'Pearl Book' . Giathai.net; GIA Gems & Gemology magazine news archive . Gia.edu. and, under Federal Trade Commission rules, various mollusc pearls may be referred to as \\"pearls\\" without qualification.Guides for the Jewelry, Precious Metals, and Pewter Industries. FTC.gov. Although not nacreous, the surfaces of fine conch pearls have a unique and attractive appearance of their own. The microstructure of conch pearls comprises partly aligned bundles of microcrystalline fibres that create a shimmering, slightly iridescent effect known as flame structure. The effect is a form of chatoyancy, caused by the interaction of light rays with the microcrystals in the pearl's surface, and it somewhat resembles moir√© silk.

Responding to a 2003 recommendation from CITES, some countries in the Caribbean have banned the export of queen conch shells. CITES has also asked all countries to ban import of these shells from countries that are not complying with CITES recommendations for managing the fishery. Queen conch fisheries have been closed in several countries. Conch shells or fragments taken home by tourists from noncomplying countries may be confiscated on return to the tourist's home country while clearing customs.

This shell is used as an important ritual object in Hinduism. The shell is used as a ceremonial trumpet, as part of religious practices, for example puja. The chank trumpet is sounded during worship at specific points, accompanied by ceremonial bells and singing. As it is an auspicious instrument, it is of purity and brilliance (Om, Devas, Brahman the Almighty Supreme creator, referred to in mantras, the Gayatri mantra explains a meditation on the brilliance of the sun), it is often played in a Lakshmi puja in temple or at home. In the story of Dhruva, the divine conch plays a special part. The warriors of ancient India blew conch shells to announce battle, as is described in the beginning of the war of Kurukshetra, in the Hindu epic the Mahabharata. The god of preservation, Vishnu, is said to hold a special conch, Panchajanya, that represents life, as it has come out of life-giving waters. According to Hindu mythology, Devas (gods) and Asuras (demons) once decided to churn the ocean to get a special divine nectar. This divine nectar, also known as amrit, was known to give immortality to whomever drank it. All the gods were on one side of it and the demons were on the other end. The churning (samudra manthan) produced a number of things from the ocean. One of the first things to come out of it was lethal poison called halahala. Everyone was terrified, as the poison was potent enough to destroy entire creation, so they went to Lord Shiva for protection and he consumed the poison to safeguard the universe. Lord Shiva took the poison in his mouth, but did not swallow it. Shankha also was one of divine objects that was obtained from samudra manthan. Also, the sound of the conch is believed to drive away the evil spirits. The blowing of the conch or \\"the shankha\\" needs a tremendous power and respiratory capacity. Hence, blowing it daily helps keep the lungs healthy. A newlywed Bengali bride wears bangles called shakha paula, made from coral and conch-shell powder. They have been a part of Bengali custom and tradition. In an ancient era, the Bengali farming community is thought to have resided near the river. They collected conch shells and powdered them to create bangles. They also used red coral for the bangles. They gave these beautiful bangles to their wives, as they could not afford ivory bangles. They were also known as poor-man's ivory, as they were cheap substitute for ivory bangles. Literature and the oral tradition * The Old English riddle Ic w√¶s be Sonde describes a conch: \\"I was by sound, near seawall, at ocean-stream; I dwelt alone in my first resting place... Little did I know that I, ere or since, ever should speak mouthless over mead-benches.\\" Another meaning given to this riddle \\"Ic w√¶s be Sonde\\" is that the sound of the conch corresponds to spiritualised sound as heard in higher realms. * In the Hindu tradition, the conch shell is used in ceremony as the sound it makes is said to correspond with higher frequency universal sounds associated with music of the spheres. * Ostional, a pueblo in the municipality of San Juan del Sur in southwest Nicaragua, by accounts of local testimonials, was founded by their ancestors because of an abundant conch population at the seashore. Subsequently, the tribe used conch shells in many rituals and customs. In 2008, witnesses at local archaeological digs reported conch shells were found in the graves of some indigenous people in their recently rediscovered cemetery grounds. Some still maintained jade stones, implying the significance of conch shells within their tribal society. * William Golding's novel Lord of the Flies (1954) features frequent references to \\"the conch\\". In the book, the conch is used as a trumpet to call everyone together and held by whoever is speaking at meetings, symbolically representing democracy and order. The conch is seen as a delicate and beautiful object to represent this concept, although its fragility is shown when it \\"exploded into a thousand white fragments and ceased to exist\\" after Roger drops a huge rock on Piggy's head.

Medieval literature is a broad subject, encompassing essentially all written works available in Europe and beyond during the Middle Ages (that is, the one thousand years from the fall of the Western Roman Empire ca. AD 500 to the beginning of the Renaissance in the 14th, 15th or 16th century, depending on country). The literature of this time was composed of religious writings as well as secular works. Just as in modern literature, it is a complex and rich field of study, from the utterly sacred to the exuberantly profane, touching all points in-between. Works of literature are often grouped by place of origin, language, and genre. Languages Since Latin was the language of the Roman Catholic Church, which dominated Western and Central Europe, and since the Church was virtually the only source of education, Latin was a common language for medieval writings, even in some parts of Europe that were never Romanized. However, in Eastern Europe, the influence of the Eastern Roman Empire and the Eastern Orthodox Church made Greek and Old Church Slavonic the dominant written languages. The common people continued to use their respective vernaculars. A few examples, such as the Old English Beowulf, the Middle High German Nibelungenlied, the Medieval Greek Digenis Acritas, the Old East Slavic Tale of Igor's Campaign, and the Old French Chanson de Roland, are well known to this day. Although the extant versions of these epics are generally considered the works of individual (but anonymous) poets, there is no doubt that they are based on their peoples' older oral traditions. Celtic traditions have survived in the lais of Marie de France, the Mabinogion and the Arthurian cycles. Another host of vernacular literature has survived in the Old Norse literature and more specifically in the saga literature of Iceland. Anonymity A notable amount of medieval literature is anonymous. This is not only due to the lack of documents from a period, but also due to an interpretation of the author's role that differs considerably from the romantic interpretation of the term in use today. Medieval authors often deeply respected the classical writers and the Church Fathers and tended to re-tell and embellish stories they had heard or read rather than invent new stories. And even when they did, they often claimed to be handing down something from an auctor instead. From this point of view, the names of the individual authors seemed much less important, and therefore many important works were never attributed to any specific person. Types of writing =Religious= Theological works were the dominant form of literature typically found in libraries during the Middle Ages. Catholic clerics were the intellectual center of society in the Middle Ages, and it is their literature that was produced in the greatest quantity. Countless hymns survive from this time period (both liturgical and paraliturgical). The liturgy itself was not in fixed form, and numerous competing missals set out individual conceptions of the order of the mass. Religious scholars such as Anselm of Canterbury, Thomas Aquinas, and Pierre Ab√©lard wrote lengthy theological and philosophical treatises, often attempting to reconcile the teachings of the Greek and Roman pagan authors with the doctrines of the Church. Hagiographies, or \\"lives of the saints\\", were also frequently written, as an encouragement to the devout and a warning to others. The Golden Legend of Jacobus de Voragine reached such popularity that, in its time, it was reportedly read more often than the Bible. Francis of Assisi was a prolific poet, and his Franciscan followers frequently wrote poetry themselves as an expression of their piety. Dies Irae and Stabat Mater are two of the most powerful Latin poems on religious subjects. Goliardic poetry (four-line stanzas of satiric verse) was an art form used by some clerics to express dissent. The only widespread religious writing that was not produced by clerics were the mystery plays: growing out of simple tableaux re-enactments of a single Biblical scene, each mystery play became its village's expression of the key events in the Bible. The text of these plays was often controlled by local guilds, and mystery plays would be performed regularly on set feast-days, often lasting all day long and into the night. During the Middle Ages, the Jewish population of Europe also produced a number of outstanding writers. Maimonides, born in Cordoba, Spain, and Rashi, born in Troyes, France, are two of the best-known and most influential of these Jewish authors. =Secular= The first page of Beowulf Secular literature in this period was not produced in equal quantity as religious literature. The earliest tales are based on oral traditions: the British Y Gododdin and Preiddeu Annwfn, along with the Germanic Beowulf and Nibelungenlied. They relate to myths or certain 6th-century events, but the surviving manuscripts date from centuries later‚ÄîY Gododdin from the late 13th century, Preiddu Annwfn from the early 14th century, Beowulf from c. 1000, and the Nibelungenlied from the 13th century. The makers and performers were bards (British/Welsh) and scops (Germanic), elite professionals attached to royal or noble courts to praise the heroes of legendary history. Prose tales first emerged in Britain: the intricate Mabinogi quartet about princely families, notably anti-war in theme, and the romantic adventure Culhwch and Olwen. (The Mabinogi is not the same as the Mabinogion, a collection of disconnected prose tales, which does, however, include both the Mabinogi and Culhwch and Olwen.) These works were compiled from earlier oral tradition c. 1100. At about the same time a new poetry of \\"courtly love\\" became fashionable in Europe. Traveling singers‚Äîtroubadours and trouv√®res‚Äîmade a living from their love songs in French, Spanish, Galician-Portuguese, Catalan, Proven√ßal, and Greek. Germanic culture had its Minnes√§nger tradition. The songs of courtly love often express unrequited longing for an ideal woman, but there are also aubades (dawn farewells by lovers) and humorous ditties. Following the earliest epic poems, prose tales, and romances, more long poems were crafted‚Äîthe chansons de geste of the late 11th and early 12th centuries. These extolled conquests, as in The Song of Roland (part of the Matter of France) and Digenis Acritas (one of the Acritic songs). The rather different chivalric romance tradition concerns adventures about marvels, love, and chivalry. They tell of the Matter of Britain and the Matter of Rome. Political poetry threads throughout the period from the very early Armes Prydein (10th-century Britain) to the goliard rebels of 12th and 13th centuries, who were church trained clerics unable or unwilling to be employed in the church. Travel literature was highly popular in the Middle Ages, as fantastic accounts of far-off lands (frequently embellished or entirely false) entertained a society that supported sea voyages and trading along coasts and rivers, as well as pilgrimages to such destinations as Jerusalem; Canterbury and Glastonbury in England; St. David's in Wales; and Santiago de Compostela in Spain. Geoffrey Chaucer's Canterbury Tales became popular at the end of the 14th century. The most prominent authors of Jewish secular poetry in the Middle Ages were Solomon ibn Gabirol and Yehuda Halevi, both of whom were also renowned religious poets. =Women's literature= While it is true that women in the medieval period were never accorded full equality with men, some women were able to use their skill with the written word to gain renown. Religious writing was the easiest avenue--women who would later be canonized as saints frequently published their reflections, revelations, and prayers. Much of what is known about women in the Middle Ages is known from the works of nuns such as Clare of Assisi, Bridget of Sweden, and Catherine of Siena. Frequently, however, the religious perspectives of women were held to be unorthodox by those in power, and the mystical visions of such authors as Julian of Norwich, Mechthild of Magdeburg, and Hildegard of Bingen provide insight into a part of the medieval experience less comfortable for the institutions that ruled Europe at the time. Women wrote influential texts in the secular realm as well --reflections on courtly love and society by Marie de France and Christine de Pizan continue to be studied for their glimpses of medieval society. For modern historical reflection, D.H. Green's (2007) historical work entitled, Women Readers of the Middle Ages explores literacy and literature in terms of women in medieval society.Green, D.H. \\"Women Readers of the Middle Ages\\". Cambridge University Press, England. The book has been reviewed as \\"a radical reassessment of women's contribution to medieval literary culture.\\" McDonald, Nicola. \\" Women Readers in the Middle Ages (review)\\" =Allegory= While medieval literature makes use of many literary devices, allegory is so prominent in this period as to deserve special mention. Much of medieval literature relied on allegory to convey the morals the author had in mind while writing‚Äîrepresentations of abstract qualities, events, and institutions are thick in much of the literature of this time. Probably the earliest and most influential allegory is the Psychomachia (Battle of Souls) by Aurelius Clemens Prudentius. Other important examples include the Romance of the Rose, Everyman, Piers Plowman, Roman de Fauvel, and The Divine Comedy.

Written by Joanna Cole and illustrated by Bruce Degen, it is a picture book and introduces most of the main characters of the series, including Ms. Frizzle, Arnold, Dorothy Ann, Ralphie (called \\"Ralph\\" in the book), Tim, Wanda and Liz as well as several students who did not appear in the later television series. Carlos, Keesha and Phoebe do not appear in this book, though a student called \\"John\\" in the book bears an uncanny physical resemblance to Carlos. The book depicts the class's first field trip with Ms. Frizzle. Despite the title, the bus is not depicted as directly causing the strange events of the field trip as it would be in later books and the television series. In this book, strange events just seem to happen with no explanation and continue to happen after the kids leave the bus in a cloud. Synopsis The book begins by introducing the character of Ms. Frizzle and describing her unusual teaching methods. Soon, she decides to take the class on a field trip to the waterworks, which the kids are sure will be boring, especially compared to the trips the kids in other classes go on. However, after driving through a tunnel, the bus becomes plastered with images of octopuses and everyone inside finds themselves wearing swimming outfits. Once this occurs, the bus rises up into a cloud along with evaporating water. Ms. Frizzle makes all the kids get out of the bus. The kids did not want to leave. But she threatened to give them extra homework if they didn't. However, the kids begin shrinking once they're outside and, once they're each the size of a raindrop, they rain down into a river, which carries them into the town's water purification system. After going through the waterworks, the pipes take the class back to the school. They come out in the girls' bathroom. But when a seventh grader girl turned on one of the faucets, the class appeared from one of them. Once out of the faucet, they are instantly restored to their regular size and normal clothing (except for Ms. Frizzle still being in her octopus dress). Ms. Frizzle, however, appears to have no memory of the strange trip and the class later sees the bus outside. They wonder how it returned from the cloud and even consider that they may have imagined their whole adventure. The book ends with Ms. Frizzle informing them that they will be studying volcanoes next. The main story is then followed by two pages listing things that couldn't happen in real life. Notes * Notably, the book does not portray the kids in the class as having very distinct personalities, although there are some hints that Arnold is more timid than the other students. However, in this book and the earlier books in the series, he appears to be more shy than anything. * This book contains the first instance of Arnold's infamous catch- phrase from the television series, \\"I knew I should've stayed home today.\\" In the book, however, he thinks it rather than saying it aloud. * All of the books in the series feature \\"reports\\" supposedly written by students in the class and this book begins that with ten \\"water facts\\" each being presented by a different student. This book and the ones that follow also contain reports written specifically by Dorothy Ann that define new vocabulary words as they crop up in the story. This presumably led to her \\"know-it-all\\" personality in the television series. * In this book, Liz appears to be a normal lizard and she only appears in the scenes taking place in the classroom. In the television series, she became considerably more anthropomorphic and joined the class on most of their field trips. * The illustration of the waterworks on the book's cover does not match the illustrations of the waterworks that appear inside the book, despite both being drawn by Degen. However, in the television adaptation discussed below, the waterworks appear as seen on the book's cover. * One girl (who is not given a name) appears only in this book. She wears her hair in pigtails and is on pages 10 and 23. Television adaptation In the second season of the Magic School Bus television series, the book was loosely adapted into the episode \\"Wet All Over,\\" which featured a far greater amount of plot. In the episode, Arnold and Wanda collect water in the girls' bathroom and Arnold accidentally leaves Ms. Frizzle's key in there and forgets to turn off the water. While the class is on the field trip, Liz comically struggles to try and stop the bathroom from flooding. Unlike in the book, the class is actually turned into water and the bus journeys with them on their trip through the water cycle. Being and behaving like water, they find themselves trapped in the water cycle and realize the only way they can escape is to get Ms. Frizzle's key back. This is when Arnold remembers he left the key in the bathroom and that he forgot to turn off the water. The bus manages to redirect them to the waterworks and they then travel through the pipes to get to the bathroom, where they get the key and are restored to their human forms. When Arnold and the others get into a pickle jar in the following episode, referencing this episode, he will say \\"I hope we're not back in the water cycle\\".

The company produced a grade-based system of learning software and tools to improve productivity. Products for preschoolers through second graders included Reader Rabbit, and software for more advanced students included The ClueFinders. The company was also known for publishing licensed educational titles featuring characters such as Arthur, Scooby-Doo, Zoboomafoo, and Caillou. Founding and ownership The Learning Company was founded in 1980 by Ann McCormick, Leslie Grimm, Teri Perl, and Warren Robinett, a former Atari employee who had programmed the popular game Adventure. They saw the Apple II as an opportunity to teach young children concepts of math, reading, science, problem-solving, and thinking skills. Part of the original funding for the company came from a National Science Foundation grant. TLC produced launch titles for the PCjr, announced in late 1983. From 1980 through 1984, it created a line of 15 widely acclaimed children's educational software products, which were sold through the U.S. retail and school computer software channels. In the first half of 1985, the Board hired as CEO Bill Dinsmore. Shortly after Mr. Dinsmore was hired, Reece Duca, a founding Partner of the Investment Group of Santa Barbara (IGSB), became a member of the Board of Directors and purchased shares from several founders and original venture firms. In late 1986, Mr. Duca was elected Chairman of the Board . IGSB became The Learning Company's largest shareholder. During the 10-year period from 1985 to 1995, TLC's revenues grew at a 36% compounded rate from $2.4M to $53.2M and profitability increased from breakeven in 1985 to a 20% pre-tax margin. The leading families of products were the \\"Reader Rabbit\\" series for ages 2‚Äì8, the \\"Treasure Mountain\\" Reading- Math-Science series for ages 5‚Äì9, the \\"Super Solver\\" series for ages 7‚Äì12, the \\"Student Writing & Publishing Center\\" for ages 7-adult, and the \\"Foreign Language Learning\\" series for ages 15-adult. TLC went public on April 28, 1992 in an IPO led by Morgan Stanley and Robertson, Stephens & Co. From 1992 to 1995, TLC achieved 16 consecutive quarters of revenues and profits growth, never experiencing a down quarter or year. TLC's early struggles, followed by 10 consecutive years of outstanding performance, were the subject of case studies at both Harvard and Stanford universities. =Softkey acquisition= On December 8, 1995, TLC was acquired by Softkey for $606M. Subsequent to the acquisition, TLC was reformed from the merger of WordStar, Spinnaker, and SoftKey Software. Prior to that, SoftKey was a Canadian company that was founded by Kevin O'Leary and traded on the Toronto Stock Exchange. During the years following the three-way merger, the combined company was led by Michael J. Perik as CEO, Kevin O'Leary as President and R. Scott Murray as CFO. TLC acquired many leading brands through acquisitions of such companies as Broderbund, Mindscape and Creative Wonders. The company held some of the best- known educational, entertainment and home productivity brands in the market. These included Reader Rabbit, Carmen Sandiego, The Oregon Trail, Myst, Riven, The Print Shop, and PrintMaster. The software sold in retail chains and in direct mail channels across Europe, and in the OEM channels as well as creating one of the first online imaging models in the market. In 1996, SoftKey changed its name to \\"The Learning Company\\". =Later owners= In the fall of 1998, Mattel agreed to acquire The Learning Company in a stock-for- stock merger valuing the company at approximately $4.2 billion. Mattel sold The Learning Company as well as Mattel Interactive in 2000 at a loss to Gores Technology group. The total financial losses to Mattel have been estimated to be as high as $3.6 billion. Mattel's acquisition of The Learning Company has been referred to as \\"one of the worst acquisitions of all time\\" by several prominent business journals. The Learning Company was acquired by Riverdeep Interactive Learning in September 2001. Riverdeep merged with Houghton Mifflin in December 2006, and the following year Houghton Mifflin Riverdeep became Houghton Mifflin Harcourt after it acquired Harcourt. HMH released several book sets under The Learning Company brand umbrella, including Oregon Trail Adventures, The Little Box of Love, and The Little Box of Laughs. In April 2018, The Learning Company was folded into Houghton Mifflin Harcourt, who currently uses the company's name as its slogan.

It encompasses different ranges from language learning software to classroom management software to reference software, etc. The purpose of all this software is to make some part of education more effective and efficient. History =1946s‚Äì1970s= The use of computer hardware and software in education and training dates to the early 1940s, when American researchers developed flight simulators which used analog computers to generate simulated onboard instrument data. One such system was the type19 synthetic radar trainer, built in 1943. From these early attempts in the WWII era through the mid-1970s, educational software was directly tied to the hardware, on which it ran. Pioneering educational computer systems in this era included the PLATO system (1960), developed at the University of Illinois, and TICCIT (1969). In 1963, IBM had established a partnership with Stanford University's Institute for Mathematical Studies in the Social Sciences (IMSSS), directed by Patrick Suppes, to develop the first comprehensive CAI elementary school curriculum which was implemented on a large scale in schools in both California and Mississippi.Instructional Systems Development In 1967 Computer Curriculum Corporation (CCC, now Pearson Education TechnologiesPearson Education Technologies launches concert.  North America > United States from AllBusiness.com ) was formed to market to schools the materials developed through the IBM partnership. Early terminals that ran educational systems cost over $10,000, putting them out of reach of most institutions. Some programming languages from this period, p3), and LOGO (1967) can also be considered educational, as they were specifically targeted to students and novice computer users. The PLATO IV system, released in 1972, supported many features which later became standard in educational software running on home computers. Its features included bitmap graphics, primitive sound generation, and support for non-keyboard input devices, including the touchscreen. =1970s‚Äì1980s= The arrival of the personal computer, with the Altair 8800 in 1975, changed the field of software in general, with specific implications for educational software. Whereas users prior to 1975 were dependent upon university or government owned mainframe computers with timesharing, users after this shift could create and use software for computers in homes and schools, computers available for less than $2000. By the early 1980s, the availability of personal computers including the Apple II (1977), Commodore PET (1977), Commodore VIC-20 (1980), and Commodore 64 (1982) allowed for the creation of companies and nonprofits which specialized in educational software. Br√∏derbund and The Learning Company are key companies from this period, and MECC, the Minnesota Educational Computing Consortium, a key non-profit software developer. These and other companies designed a range of titles for personal computers, with the bulk of the software initially developed for the Apple II. Categories of Educational Software =Courseware= ' is a term that combines the words 'course' with 'software'. It was originally used to describe additional educational material intended as kits for teachers or trainers or as tutorials for students, usually packaged for use with a computer. The term's meaning and usage has expanded and can refer to the entire course and any additional material when used in reference an online or 'computer formatted' classroom. Many companies are using the term to describe the entire \\"package\\" consisting of one 'class' or 'course' bundled together with the various lessons, tests, and other material needed. The courseware itself can be in different formats: some are only available online, such as Web pages, while others can be downloaded as PDF files or other types of document. Many forms of educational technology are now covered by the term courseware. Most leading educational companies solicit or include courseware with their training packages. =Classroom aids= Some educational software is designed for use in school classrooms. Typically such software may be projected onto a large whiteboard at the front of the class and/or run simultaneously on a network of desktop computers in a classroom. The most notable are SMART Boards that use SMART Notebook to interact with the board which allows the use of pens to digitally draw on the board. This type of software is often called classroom management software. While teachers often choose to use educational software from other categories in their IT suites (e.g. reference works, children's software), a whole category of educational software has grown up specifically intended to assist classroom teaching. Branding has been less strong in this category than in those oriented towards home users. Software titles are often very specialized and produced by various manufacturers, including many established educational book publishers. =Assessment software= Moodle is a very popular assessment websites used by teachers to send assignments and grade students' works. With the impact of environmental damage and the need for institutions to become \\"paperless\\", more educational institutions are seeking alternative ways of assessment and testing, which has always traditionally been known to use up vasts amount of paper. Assessment software refers to software with a primary purpose of assessing and testing students in a virtual environment. Assessment software allows students to complete tests and examinations using a computer, usually networked. The software then scores each test transcript and outputs results for each student. Assessment software is available in various delivery methods, the most popular being self-hosted software, online software and hand-held voting systems. Proprietary software and open-source software systems are available. While technically falling into the Courseware category (see above), Skill evaluation lab is an example for Computer-based assessment software with PPA-2 (Plan, Prove, Assess) methodology to create and conduct computer based online examination. Moodle is an example of open-source software with an assessment component that is gaining popularity. Other popular international assessment systems include Assessment Master, Google Classroom, Blackboard Learn, EvaluNet XT and Eduroan. =Reference software= Many publishers of print dictionaries and encyclopedias have been involved in the production of educational reference software since the mid-1990s. They were joined in the reference software market by both startup companies and established software publishers, most notably Microsoft. The first commercial reference software products were reformulations of existing content into CD- ROM editions, often supplemented with new multimedia content, including compressed video and sound. More recent products made use of internet technologies, to supplement CD-ROM products, then, more recently, to replace them entirely. Wikipedia and its offspins (such as Wiktionary) marked a new departure in educational reference software. Previously, encyclopedias and dictionaries had compiled their contents on the basis of invited and closed teams of specialists. The Wiki concept has allowed for the development of collaborative reference works through open cooperation incorporating experts and non-experts. =Custom platforms= Some manufacturers regarded normal personal computers as an inappropriate platform for learning software for younger children and produced custom child-friendly pieces of hardware instead. The hardware and software is generally combined into a single product, such as a child laptop-lookalike. The laptop keyboard for younger children follows an alphabetic order and the qwerty order for the older ones. The most well-known example are Leapfrog products. These include imaginatively designed hand-held consoles with a variety of pluggable educational game cartridges and book-like electronic devices into which a variety of electronic books can be loaded. These products are more portable than laptop computers, but have a much more limited range of purposes, concentrating on literacy. While mainstream operating systems are designed for general usages, and are more or less customized for education only by the application sets added to them, a variety of software manufacturers, especially Linux distributions, have sought to provide integrated platforms for specifically education. =Corporate training and tertiary education= Earlier educational software for the important corporate and tertiary education markets was designed to run on a single desktop computer (or an equivalent user device). In the years immediately following 2000, planners decided to switch to server-based applications with a high degree of standardization. This means that educational software runs primarily on servers which may be hundreds or thousands of miles from the actual user. The user only receives tiny pieces of a learning module or test, fed over the internet one by one. The server software decides on what learning material to distribute, collects results and displays progress to teaching staff. Another way of expressing this change is to say that educational software morphed into an online educational service. US Governmental endorsements and approval systems ensured the rapid switch to the new way of managing and distributing learning material. See also: * Educational technology * SCORM * Virtual learning environment, LMS (learning management system) * Training Management System * Web-based training =Specific educational purposes= Educational software for learning Standard Chinese using Pinyin. There are highly specific niche markets for educational software, including: * teacher tools and classroom management software (remote control and monitoring software, filetransfer software, document camera and presenter, free tools,...) * Driving test software * Interactive geometry software * Language learning software * Mind Mapping Software which provides a focal point for discussion, helps make classes more interactive, and assists students with studying, essays and projects. * Designing and printing of card models for use in education - eg. Designer Castles for BBC Micro and Acorn Archimedes platforms * Notetaking (Comparison of notetaking software) * Software for enabling simulated dissection of human and animal bodies (used in medical and veterinary college courses) * Spelling tutor software * Typing tutors * Reading Instruction * Medical and healthcare educational software = Video Game and Gamification = Video games can be used to teach a user technology literacy or more about a subject. Some operating systems and mobile phones have these features. A notable example is Microsoft Solitaire, which was developed to familiarize users with the use of graphical user interfaces, especially the mouse and the drag-and-drop technique. Mavis Beacon Teaches Typing is a largely know program with built in mini-games to keep the user entertained while improving their typing skills. Gamification is the use of game design elements in nongame contexts and has been shown to be effective in motivating behavior change. By seeing game elements as \\"motivational affordances,\\" and formalizing the relationship between these elements and motivational affordances. Classcraft is a software tool used by teachers that has games elements alongside an educational goal. Tovertafel is a games console designed for remedial education and counter-acting the effects of dementia.  Effects and Use of Educational Software  = Tutor Based Software = Tutor based education software is defined as software that mimics the teacher student one on one dynamic of tutoring with software in place of a teacher. Research was conducted to see if this type of software would be effective in improving students understanding of material. It concluded that there was a positive impact which decreased the amount of time students need to study for and relative gain of understanding. = Helping Those With Disabilities = A study was conducted to see the effects of education software on children with mild disabilities. The results were that the software was a positive impact assisting teaching these children social skills though team based learning and discussion, videos and games. = Education Software Evaluation = There is a large market of educational software in use today. A team decided that they were to develop a system in which educational software should be evaluated as there is no current standard. It is called the Construction of the Comprehensive Evaluation of Electronic Learning Tools and Educational Software (CEELTES). The software to be evaluated is graded on a point scale in four categories: the area of technical, technological and user attributes; area of criteria evaluating the information, content and operation of the software; the area of criteria evaluating the information in terms of educational use, learning and recognition; the area of criteria evaluating the psychological and pedagogical use of the software. = Use In Higher Education = In university level computer science course, learning logic is an essential part of the curriculum. There is a proposal on using two logistical education tool FOLST and LogicChess to understand First Order Logic for university students to better understand the course material and the essentials of logistical design.  Trends In Educational Software  = Virtual and Augmented Reality (VR/AR) = VR/AR are increasingly being used in the classroom as their technology becomes more powerful and affordable. ClassVR is a company that makes their own headsets and software specifically for using VR in the classroom. They have a vast amount of lesson plans that go along with their product. VR/AR are used as reinforcement of old concepts and as a way to introduce new ones as well. Many believe that there is great potential to make VR/AR common place to improve learning. = Artificial Intelligence (AI) = AI has become increasingly more advanced over the years. Now it is being used in the classroom as teaching assistants that students can ask questions to and it will find and explain the answer. They're being used because it reduces the amount of time a teacher needs to spend on a specific question allow the teacher to explain the more complex material. One of the most popular examples is Brainly, a website that is used for asking educational questions. Once a student asks a question, another student can answer it and Brainly will check its databases to make sure that the information is correct.

The legal system is bi-jurisdictional, as the responsibilities of public (including criminal) and private law are separated and exercised exclusively by Parliament and the provinces respectively. Quebec, however, still retains a civil system for issues of private law (as this domain falls within the exclusive jurisdiction of the provinces). Both legal systems are subject to the Constitution of Canada. The federal government has jurisdiction over certain domains which are regulated exclusively by Parliament, as well as all matters and disputes between provinces. These generally include interprovincial transport (rail, air and marine transport) as well as interprovincial trade and commerce (which generally concerns energy, the environment, agriculture). The criminal law is an area of exclusive federal jurisdiction and has its origins in the English common law. Prosecutions of most criminal offences are conducted by the provincial Attorneys General, acting under the Criminal Code. Canada recognizes only two levels of government with sovereignty, arising from heritage, common law and the constitution: federal and provincial. All other forms of government, including municipal governments, must receive their powers through delegation, making municipal, local and regional governments creatures of sovereign governments. Territories receive their powers via delegation from the Federal Government. Constitution of Canada Cover of the Constitution Act, 1867 Pursuant to section 52 of the Constitution Act, 1982, Canada's constitution is its supreme law, and any law passed by any federal, provincial, or territorial government that is inconsistent with the constitution is invalid.Constitution Act, 1982, Schedule B to the Canada Act 1982 (UK), 1982, c 11, s 52. The Constitution Act, 1982 stipulates that Canada's constitution includes that act, a series of thirty Acts and orders referred to in a schedule to that Act (the most notable of which is the Constitution Act, 1867), and any amendment to any of those Acts.Craik 94 However, the Supreme Court of Canada has found that this list is not intended to be exhaustive, and in 1998's Reference re Secession of Quebec identified four \\"supporting principles and rules\\" that are included as unwritten elements of the constitution: federalism, democracy, constitutionalism and the rule of law, and respect for minorities.Craik 96 While these principles are an enforceable part of Canada's constitution, Canadian courts have not used them to override the written text of the constitution, instead confining their role to \\"filling gaps\\".Craik 98 Because the Constitution Act, 1867 provides that Canada's constitution is \\"similar in Principle to that of the United Kingdom\\", which is considered to be an uncodified constitution, the Supreme Court has also recognized the existence of constitutional conventions. In 1981's Reference re a Resolution to amend the Constitution, the Court provided three factors necessary for the existence of a constitutional convention: a practice or agreement developed by political actors, a recognition that they are bound to follow that practice or agreement, and a purpose for that practice or agreement. It also found that, while these conventions are not law and are therefore unenforceable by the courts, courts may recognize conventions in their rulings.Craik 105 Copies of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms The Constitution Act, 1867 assigns powers to the provincial and federal governments. Matters under federal jurisdiction include criminal law, trade and commerce, banking, and immigration. The federal government also has the residual power to make laws necessary for Canada's \\"peace, order and good government\\". Matters under provincial jurisdiction include hospitals, municipalities, education (except education on First Nation reserves), and property and civil rights.Craik 125 The Constitution Act, 1867 also provides that, while provinces establish their own superior courts, the federal government appoints their judges. It also gives the federal Parliament the right to establish a court system responsible for federal law and a general court of appeal to hear appeals of decisions of both federal and provincial courts.Craik 127 This last power resulted in the federal Parliament's creation of the Supreme Court of Canada, which is, despite its role as supreme arbiter of all Canadian law, a creation of simple, rather than constitutional, statute.Craik 127‚Äì128 The Constitution Act, 1982 created a mechanism by which Canada's constitution could be amended by joint action of federal and provincial governments; prior to 1982, it could be amended only by the Parliament of the United Kingdom.Craik 131 It also created the Charter of Rights and Freedoms, which grants individual rights which may not be contravened by any provincial or federal law.Craik 119 Legislation Acts passed by the Parliament of Canada and by provincial legislatures are the primary sources of law in Canada. Sections 91 and 92 of the Constitution Act, 1867 enumerate the subject matters upon which either level of government (federal and provincial) may legitimately enact legislation. Laws passed by the federal government are initially announced in the Canada Gazette, a regularly published newspaper for new statutes and regulations.Statutory Instrument Act Federal bills that receive Royal Assent are subsequently published in the Annual Statutes of Canada. From time to time, the federal government will consolidate its current laws into a single consolidation of law known as the Revised Statutes of Canada.Legislation Revision and Consolidation Act The most recent federal consolidation was in 1985. Laws passed by the provinces follow a similar practice. The Acts are pronounced in a provincial gazette, published annually and consolidated from time to time. The Revised Statutes of Canada is the federal statutory consolidation of statutes enacted by the Parliament of Canada. In each Canadian province, there is a similar consolidation of the statute law of the province. The Revised Statutes of British Columbia, Revised Statutes of Alberta, Statutes of Manitoba, Revised Statutes of Saskatchewan, 1978, Revised Statutes of New Brunswick, Revised Statutes of Nova Scotia, Statutes of Prince Edward Island, Consolidated Statutes of Newfoundland and Labrador, Revised Statutes of Ontario, and Revised Statutes of Quebec are the statutory consolidations of each Canadian province. They contain all of the major topic areas and most of the statutes enacted by the governments in each province. These statutes in these provinces do not include criminal law, as the criminal law in Canada is an exclusive jurisdiction of the federal Parliament, which has enacted the Criminal Code, which is included in the Revised Statutes of Canada. Legal traditions =Common law= All provinces and territories within Canada, excluding Quebec, follow the common law legal tradition. Equally, courts have power under the provincial Judicature Acts to apply equity. As with all common law countries, Canadian law adheres to the doctrine of stare decisis. Lower courts must follow the decisions of higher courts by which they are bound. For instance, all Ontario lower courts are bound by the decisions of the Ontario Court of Appeal and, all British Columbia lower courts are bound by the decisions of the British Columbia Court of Appeal. However, no Ontario court is bound by decisions of any British Columbia court and no British Columbia court is bound by decisions of any Ontario court. Nonetheless, decisions made by a province's highest court (provincial Courts of Appeal) are often considered as \\"persuasive\\" even though they are not binding on other provinces. Only the Supreme Court of Canada has authority to bind all lower courts in the country with a single ruling, but the Supreme Court cannot bind itself. The busier courts, such as the Court of Appeal for Ontario, for example, are often looked to for guidance on many local matters of law outside the province, especially in matters such as evidence and criminal law. When there is little or no existing Canadian decision on a particular legal issue and it becomes necessary to look to a non-Canadian legal authority for reference, decisions of English courts and American courts are often utilized. In light of the long-standing history between English law and Canadian law, the English Court of Appeal and the House of Lords are often cited as and considered persuasive authority, and are often followed. If the legal question at issue relates to matters of constitutional or privacy law, however, decisions of United States courts are more likely to be utilized by Canadian lawyers because there is a much greater body of jurisprudence in U.S. law than English law in these areas. Decisions from Commonwealth nations, aside from England, are also often treated as persuasive sources of law in Canada. A major difference between U.S. and Canadian common law is that Canada does not follow the doctrine of Erie Railroad Co. v. Tompkins (1938), and this is so taken for granted that the Supreme Court of Canada has never needed to actually rule upon the question. In other words, there is no distinction in Canada between federal and provincial common law, and the Supreme Court can and does dictate common law directly to the provinces on all matters traditionally encompassed by common law (to the extent not superseded by legislation). From the American perspective, Canadian federalism is thus relatively incomplete, since Canada continues to operate as a unitary state with respect to common law (and is truly federal only as to statutory law). Due to Canada‚Äôs historical connection with the United Kingdom, decisions of the House of Lords before 1867 are technically still binding on Canada unless they have been overturned by the Supreme Court of Canada, and Canada is still bound by the decisions of the Privy Council before the abolishment of appeals to that entity in 1949. In practice, however, no court in Canada has declared itself bound by any English court decision for decades, and it is highly unlikely that any Canadian court will do so in the future. Criminal offences are found only within the Criminal Code and other federal statutes; an exception is that contempt of court is the only remaining common law offence in Canada.A Compendium of Law and Judges =Civil law= For historical reasons, Quebec has a hybrid legal system. Private law follows the civil law tradition, originally expressed in the Coutume de Paris as it applied in what was then New France. Today, the jus commune of Quebec is codified in the Civil Code of Quebec. As for public law, it was made that of the conquering British nation after the fall of New France in 1760, that is the common law. It is important to note that the distinction between civil law and common law is not based on the division of powers set out in the Constitution Act, 1867. Therefore, legislation enacted by the provincial legislature in matters of public law, such as the Code of Penal Procedure, should be interpreted following the common law tradition. Likewise, legislation enacted by the federal Parliament in matters of private law, such as the Divorce Act, is to be interpreted following the civil law tradition and in harmony with the Civil Code of Quebec. =Indigenous legal traditions= Canada was founded on the original territories of over 900 different Indigenous groups' countries, each using different Indigenous legal traditions. Cree, Inuit, Blackfeet, M√©tis, Mi'kmaq and numerous other First Nations will apply their own legal traditions in daily life, creating contracts, working with governmental and corporate entities, ecological management and criminal proceedings and family law. Most nations maintain their laws through traditional governance alongside the elected officials and federal laws. The legal precedents set millennia ago are known through stories and derived from the actions and past responses as well as through continuous interpretation by elders and law-keepers‚Äìthe same process by which near all legal traditions, from common laws and civil codes, are formed. While the many legal traditions appear similar in that none were codified, each country has quite different sets of laws. Many laws stem from stories which in turn may stem from writings or markings, such as geographic features, petroglyphs, pictographs, wiigwaasabakoon and more. Inuit Nunangat's governance differs quite markedly from its many-nationed neighbour Denendeh, as Denendeh's diverse Dene Laws differ quite markedly from laws governing Ling√≠t Aan√≠, GitxÃ±san LaxÃ±yip or Wet'suwet'en Yin'tah; and, as those countries' laws differ from Haudenosaunee's, Eeyou-Istchee's or Mi'kma'ki's. One thing most First National legal and governance traditions have in common is their use of clans such as Anishinaabek's doodeman (though most are matrilineal like GitxÃ±san's Wilps). Areas of law =Aboriginal law= Aboriginal law is the area of law related to the Canadian Government's relationship with its Indigenous peoples (First Nations, M√©tis and Inuit). Section 91(24) of the Constitution Act, 1867 gives the federal parliament exclusive power to legislate in matters related to Aboriginals, which includes groups governed by the Indian Act, different Numbered Treaties and outside of those Acts. =Administrative law= Canadian administrative law is the body of law that addresses the actions and operations of governments and governmental agencies. =Contract law= Individual provinces have codified some principles of contract law in a Sale of Goods Act, which was modeled on early English versions. Outside of Quebec, most contract law is still common law, based on the rulings of judges in contract litigation over the years. Quebec, being a civil law jurisdiction, does not have contract law, but rather has its own law of obligations. =Constitutional law= Constitutional law is the area of Canadian law relating to the interpretation and application of the Constitution of Canada by the Courts.Leuprecht/Russell, 2011. p. 451. This is represented in the Constitution Act, 1867, Constitution Act, 1982 and Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms. =Copyright law= Copyright law of Canada governs the legally enforceable rights to creative and artistic works under the laws of Canada. =Criminal law= Canadian Criminal Cases collection Criminal law in Canada falls under the exclusive legislative jurisdiction of the federal government. The power to enact criminal law is derived from section 91(27) of the Constitution Act, 1867. Most criminal laws have been codified in the Criminal Code, as well as the Controlled Drugs and Substances Act, Youth Criminal Justice Act, and several other peripheral Acts. The provinces are responsible for the administration of justice, including criminal trials within their respective provinces, despite their inability to enact criminal laws. Provinces do have the power to promulgate quasi-criminal or regulatory offences in a variety of administrative and other areas, and every province has done so with myriad rules and regulations across a broad spectrum. =Evidence law= The Canada Evidence Act is an Act of the Parliament of Canada, first passed in 1893, that regulates the rules of evidence in court proceedings under federal law. Each province also has its own evidence statute, governing the law of evidence in civil proceedings in the province. =Family law= Family law in Canada concerns the body of Canadian law dealing with family relationship, marriage, and divorce. The federal government has exclusive jurisdiction over the substance of marriage and divorce. Provinces have exclusive jurisdiction over the procedures surrounding marriage. Provinces also have laws dealing with marital property and with family maintenance (including spousal support). =Human Rights Law= There are currently four key mechanisms in Canada to protect human rights: the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms, the Canadian Human Rights Act, the Canadian Human Rights Commission, and provincial human rights laws and legislation. =Immigration and refugee law= Canadian immigration and refugee law concerns the area of law related to the admission of foreign nationals into Canada, their rights and responsibilities once admitted, and the conditions of their removal. The primary law on these matters is in the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act. =Inheritance law= Inheritance law in Canada is constitutionally a provincial matter. Therefore, the laws governing inheritance in Canada are legislated by each individual province. =Insolvency law of Canada= The Parliament of Canada has exclusive jurisdiction to regulate matters relating to bankruptcy and insolvency, by virtue of s.91 of the Constitution Act, 1867. It has passed some statutes as a result, i.e., The Bankruptcy and Insolvency Act (\\"BIA\\") and the Winding-Up and Restructuring Act (which essentially applies only to financial institutions under federal jurisdiction). In applying these statutes, provincial law has important consequences. Section 67(1)(b) of the BIA provides that \\"any property that as against the bankrupt is exempt from execution or seizure under any laws applicable in the province within which the property is situated and within which the bankrupt resides\\" is not divisible among their creditors.http://laws-lois.justice.gc.ca/eng/acts/b-3/page-23.html#h-26 Provincial legislation under the property and civil rights power of the Constitution Act, 1867 regulates the resolution of financial difficulties that occur before the onset of insolvency. =Labour and employment law= Canadian labour law is that body of law which regulates the rights, restrictions obligations of trade unions, workers and employers in Canada. Canadian employment law is that body of law which regulates the rights, restrictions obligations of non-unioned workers and employers in Canada. Most labour regulation in Canada is conducted at the provincial level by government agencies and boards. However, certain industries under federal regulation are subject solely to federal labour legislation and standards. =Patent law= Canadian patent law is the legal system regulating the granting of patents for inventions within Canada, and the enforcement of these rights in Canada. =Procedural law= The functioning of the Courts is regulated by the laws of civil procedure which are codified in each province's civil procedures rules. =Property law= Property law in Canada is the body of law concerning the rights of individuals over land, objects, and expression within Canada. It encompasses personal property, real property, and intellectual property. =Tort law= Tort law in Canada concerns the treatment of the law of torts within the Canadian jurisdiction excluding Quebec, which is covered by the law of obligations. =Trademark law= Canada's trademark law provides protection for distinctive marks, certification marks, distinguishing guises, and proposed marks against those who appropriate the goodwill of the mark or create confusion between different vendors' goods or services. Judicial system Canadian court system (Source Canadian Department of Justice) Under the Constitution Act, 1867, the federal Parliament and the provincial legislatures both have the constitutional authority to create courts: Parliament under s. 101, and the Provinces under s. 92(14). However, the federal power to create courts is much more limited than the provincial power. The provincial courts have a much more extensive jurisdiction, including the constitutionally entrenched power to determine constitutional issues. The Supreme Court of Canada () is the highest court of Canada and is the final court of appeal in the Canadian justice system. Parliament created it by Act of Parliament in 1875, as a \\"general court of appeal for Canada\\". Prior to 1949, cases could be appealed to the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council in the United Kingdom, and some cases bypassed the Supreme Court of Canada entirely. Other than the Supreme Court, the Canadian court system is divided into two classes of courts: superior courts of general jurisdiction, and courts of limited jurisdiction, sometimes referred to as inferior courts. The superior courts, created and maintained by the provinces, are divided into superior courts of original jurisdiction and superior courts of appeal. These courts are sometimes also referred to as \\"Section 96\\" courts, in reference to s. 96 of the Constitution Act, 1867, which grants the federal government the power to appoint the judges of these courts. As courts of general jurisdiction, the provincial superior courts of original jurisdiction have jurisdiction over all matters, under both federal and provincial law, unless the matter has been assigned to some other court or administrative agency by a statute passed by the appropriate legislative body. The superior courts of original jurisdiction have an extensive civil jurisdiction, under both federal and provincial laws. Under the Criminal Code, a federal statute, they have jurisdiction over the most serious criminal offences, such as murder. They also hear appeals from the Provincial Courts in criminal matters and some civil matters. A further appeal normally lies to superior court of appeal, the highest court in each province. The provinces also can establish courts of limited jurisdiction, whose jurisdiction is limited solely to what is included in the statutory grant of jurisdiction. These courts are often called \\"Provincial Courts\\", even though the superior courts established by the provinces are also provincial courts. The Provincial Courts have an extensive criminal jurisdiction under the Criminal Code, a federal statute, and also typically have a limited civil jurisdiction in matters under provincial jurisdiction, such as small claims and some family matters. The judges of the Provincial Courts are appointed by the provincial governments. There are also additional federal courts established by Parliament, which have a specialised jurisdiction in certain areas of federal law. These courts are the Federal Court of Appeal, the Federal Court, the Tax Court of Canada, and the Court Martial Appeal Court of Canada.

A nephelometer measures suspended particulates by employing a light beam (source beam) and a light detector set to one side (often 90¬∞) of the source beam. Particle density is then a function of the light reflected into the detector from the particles. To some extent, how much light reflects for a given density of particles is dependent upon properties of the particles such as their shape, color, and reflectivity. Nephelometers are calibrated to a known particulate, then use environmental factors (k-factors) to compensate lighter or darker colored dusts accordingly. K-factor is determined by the user by running the nephelometer next to an air sampling pump and comparing results. There are a wide variety of research-grade nephelometers on the market as well as open source varieties.Bas Wijnen, G. C. Anzalone and Joshua M. Pearce, Open-source mobile water quality testing platform. Journal of Water, Sanitation and Hygiene for Development, 4(3) pp. 532‚Äì537 (2014). doi:10.2166/washdev.2014.137 open access Nephelometer uses Particulate contaminants (size in micrometers) The main uses of nephelometers relate to air quality measurement for pollution monitoring, climate monitoring, and visibility. Airborne particles are commonly either biological contaminants, particulate contaminants, gaseous contaminants, or dust. The chart to the left shows the types and sizes of various particulate contaminants. This information is helpful toward understanding the character of particulate pollution inside a building or in the ambient air. It is also useful for understanding the cleanliness level in a controlled environment. Biological contaminants include mold, fungus, bacteria, viruses, animal dander, dust mites, pollen, human skin cells, cockroach parts, or anything alive or living at one time. They are the biggest enemy of indoor air quality specialists because they are contaminants that cause health problems. Levels of biological contamination depend on humidity and temperature that supports the livelihood of micro-organisms. The presence of pets, plants, rodents, and insects will raise the level of biological contamination. = Sheath air = Sheath air is clean filtered air that surrounds the aerosol stream to prevent particulates from circulating or depositing within the optic chamber. Sheath air prevents contamination caused by build-up and deposits, improves response time by containing the sample, and improves maintenance by keeping the optic chamber clean. The nephelometer creates the sheath air by passing air through a zero filter before beginning the sample. = Global radiation balance = Radiation balance (thickness of Earth's atmosphere is greatly exaggerated) Nephelometers are also used in global warming studies, specifically measuring the global radiation balance. Three wavelength nephelometers fitted with a backscatter shutter can determine the amount of solar radiation that is reflected back into space by dust and particulate matter. This reflected light influences the amount of radiation reaching the earth's lower atmosphere and warming the planet. = Visibility = Nephelometers are also used for measurement of visibility with simple one- wavelength nephelometers used throughout the world by many EPAs. Nephelometers, through the measurement of light scattering, can determine visibility in distance through the application of a conversion factor called Koschmieder's formula. =Medicine= In medicine, nephelometry is used to measure immune function. =Fire detection= Gas-phase nephelometers are also used in the detection of smoke and other particles of combustion. In such use, the apparatus is referred to as an aspirated smoke detector. These have the capability to detect extremely low particle concentrations (to 0.005%) and are therefore highly suitable to protecting sensitive or valuable electronic equipment, such as mainframe computers and telephone switches. Turbidity units A nephelometer installation at Acadia National Park Turbidimeters used at a water purification plant to measure turbidity (in NTU) of raw water and clear water after filtration *Because optical properties depend on suspended particle size, a stable synthetic material called \\"Formazin\\" with uniform particle size is often used as a standard for calibration and reproducibility.Formazin was first used for standardizing turbidity measurements in 1926. The unit is called Formazin Turbidity Unit (FTU). *Nephelometric Turbidity Units (NTU) specified by United States Environmental Protection Agency is a special case of FTU, where a white light source and certain geometrical properties of the measurement apparatus are specified.

However, there can be differences between models of turbidimeters, depending upon the arrangement (geometry) of the source beam and the detector. A nephelometric turbidimeter always monitors light reflected off the particles and not attenuation due to cloudiness. In the United States environmental monitoring the turbidity standard unit is called Nephelometric Turbidity Units (NTU), while the international standard unit is called Formazin Nephelometric Unit (FNU). The most generally applicable unit is Formazin Turbidity Unit (FTU), although different measurement methods can give quite different values as reported in FTU (see below). Gas-phase nephelometers are also used to study the atmosphere. These can provide information on visibility and atmospheric albedo.

Kelly is an AVN Hall of Fame inductee.  Career  Kelly's stage name was derived from the names of the Charlie's Angels characters portrayed by Farrah Fawcett and Jaclyn Smith. She started out as a stripper at the Babydolls adult entertainment theater in her hometown, first performing at the age of 15 with false identification. After she broke up with her then-boyfriend, he informed the club of her true age, which caused them to fire her. When Kelly turned 18 she returned to the club, commenting that \\"they didn't even recognize me.\\" She later did live sex shows with Tiffany Million at the O'Farrell Theatre in San Francisco. =Mainstream appearances= Kelly has appeared in over 50 B movies, including The Legend of the Roller Blade Seven, Toad Warriors, and Big Sister 2000. In the spring of 1998 she appeared in Spike Lee's He Got Game. =Other ventures= Kelly started her own company, Jill Kelly Productions (JKP), in October 1998. In April 2005, following the company's bankruptcy filing, Penthouse magazine paid $1.765 million to acquire its assets, which included the entire JKP back catalogue and nearly 60 unreleased features. Personal life A native of Southern California, Kelly was born in the Los Angeles suburb of Pomona. She married porn actor Cal Jammer, whom she met at a CES convention in Las Vegas in 1993. They were married a month later. Jammer introduced her to the world of adult movies and her career was launched. However, she separated from him due to his infidelities off-camera, which she called \\"the deal breaker\\". Jammer took the separation hard, committing suicide by shooting himself to death on the road in front of Kelly's house on January 25, 1995. On May 6, 2000, she married adult star Julian, but the couple was divorced by the end of 2001. She then married a third time, to porn actor/producer/director Corey Jordan on September 20, 2003. This marriage would not last, either, and the couple parted ways a year later only to finalize their divorce in October 2004. Kelly also had an off-screen relationship with her fellow female colleague P.J. Sparxx in the mid-'90s. The pair would tour together and dance on stage as part of a dance duo act called \\"Fire & Ice\\". They also released a porn feature film of the dance act called Fire & Ice: Caught In The Act. Kelly and Sparxx elucidated on their relationship in the \\"Behind the Scenes\\" documentary series Sex Under Hot Lights. Sparxx posited that she and Kelly had similar sexual personalities. Kelly stated that Sparxx had supported her following her husband's suicide in January 1995. Sparxx and Kelly claimed to be exclusively involved in terms of women, but were in an open relationship in regards to other men, with Kelly claiming she was also involved with a boyfriend at the time. Kelly identifies as bisexual.

This track is normally sent to a loudspeaker that is specially designed to enable it to reproduce low-pitched sounds, called the subwoofer. While LFE channels originated in Dolby Stereo 70 mm film prints, they became commonplace in the 1990s and 2000s in home theater systems used to reproduce film soundtracks for DVDs and Blu-ray discs.  Types  = Low-pitched musical arts = LFEs include both low-pitched musical notes and low-pitched sound effects. The musical soundtrack for many films includes bass instruments that produce very low notes. Until the 1970s, most of the low-pitched instruments were natural, acoustic instruments, such as the double bass or the pipe organ's pedal keyboard. After the 1980s, film scores increasingly used synthesized instruments, including synth bass keyboards, which incorporated very low-pitched notes. = Sound effects = The most challenging sounds to reproduce from a sound engineering standpoint are usually the extremely low- pitched sound effects in the 20 Hz range, such as those used to simulate the sound of an explosion, earthquake, a rocket launch, or submarine depth charges. The human ear is not very sensitive to sounds at these low frequencies, so it takes a tremendous amount of amplification for the human ear to hear them. Further, sounds at these frequencies are more felt in the body, rather than heard. As well, since they are sound effects, they may have a longer duration or sustain than many low-pitched musical notes, which makes them harder to reproduce accurately. It is a formidable challenge for an amplifier, subwoofer speakers, and cabinet to reproduce these sound effects at a high volume without encountering problems such as power amplifier clipping (distortion), unwanted rattle or resonance in the wooden cabinet, or excessive \\"chuffing\\" sounds from the bass reflex vent (if a vent or port is used in the cabinet). Sound recording magazines sometimes use the loud, rumbling sound effects simulating the sound of the submarine depth charges which were used in the World War II film U-571 (2000) to test the accuracy of subwoofer systems.  Development  The LFE channel originated in Dolby Stereo 70 mm Six Track film prints, as a way of providing louder bass and sub-bass effects, without detracting from the quality of the standard audio channels. The LFE channel is conventionally played back 10 dB louder than the main channels, giving significantly more recording headroom. Also, the separate recording allowed a straightforward installation of extra dedicated subwoofers, and removed the need to upgrade the main speakers. Later formats such as Dolby Digital retained the LFE channel, although this is more through convention and backwards compatibility than necessity, as digital formats have greater dynamic range than the magnetic analogue recordings on 70 mm prints, and modern sound processors have a bass management system to redirect bass from all channels to a subwoofer.  Home theater systems  In the 1990s surround sound home theater systems became available to enhance the experience of viewing DVD and Blu-ray films. Prior to the advent of home theater systems, when VCRs were used, the enhanced sound option was stereo high-fidelity sound or Dolby Pro Logic for Dolby Surround-encoded tapes. With home theater systems, a multichannel audio system was used to deliver different sounds to six or more different speakers. The widely used 5.1-channel audio system consists of five full range main (Left, Center, Right, Left rear Surround, and Right rear Surround) plus a Low-Frequency Effects (LFE) channel. Many typical home theater systems, especially home theater in a box systems, are incapable of accurately reproducing LFE in the 20 Hz range. The LFE channel delivers bass-only information to supplement the overall bass content. The LFE channel content is not the same as the content of a subwoofer-out jack. The LFE channel is used to carry additional bass information in the surround sound programming, while the subwoofer output is bass information from up to all six channels that has been selected to be reproduced by the subwoofer via a bass management system. The bass management in surround sound replay systems is that bass content in the incoming signal, irrespective of channel, should be directed only to loudspeakers capable of handling it. The bass management system may direct bass to one or more subwoofers (if present) from any channel, not simply the content of the LFE channel.  Bass Shaker  The LFE channel can be output to one or more Tactile transducers, also known as \\"bass shakers\\". When connected to the subwoofer output, the bass shaker will vibrate at the frequency of the bass, usually between 20 and 200 Hz, without producing much audible sound. Tactile transducers are frequently mounted directly to the frame of a chair or sofa. A listener's body can feel the vibrations from the LFE, enhancing the overall sensation of the bass.

Originally his popular songs in the early days in Puerto Rico, with his sister Nelly, had a religious theme. He was also a television presenter. Biography Born in Attimis, a comune in the province of Udine, Italy. Croatto's family moved to the border town of La Paz, Uruguay when he was 9 years old. While being raised as a carpenter, lumberjack and farmer, music was very much a part of his household. In 1959, at 19, he created his first pop music group with his brother Edelweiss (nicknamed \\"Tim\\") and his sister Argentina (nicknamed \\"Nelly\\") which was named \\"TNT\\". The group came about at Nelly's insistence; since their mother frowned upon the idea of Nelly (who was 15 years old at the time and adamantly wanted to become a singer) touring solo, she would only allow her to sing in public with her brothers as a backup group. The group eventually developed a very strong following, first in Uruguay, then Argentina, then in Spain, where TNT moved as their popularity soared.https://prpop.org/biografias/tony-croatto/ =The TNT Years= Tony Croatto, with his sister and brother when they were Los TNT (1960). Tony is the first one from below. TNT were renowned for their vocal harmonies, their onstage chemistry and Nelly's voice and magnetic personality. At the time, Tony stated once, he was happy with just singing background and playing guitar, claiming he was rather shy. Eventually, he developed a strong stage presence, which allowed him to take over vocal duties occasionally. In 1960, TNT recorded a song, \\"Eso, eso, eso\\", written by tango composers Virgilio and Homero Exp√≥sito, for RCA Records, which sold more than 100,000 copies in that country alone. They were part of the first broadcast ever by Argentina's television station, Canal 9, their personal appearances were solidly attended, and their popularity ensured the success of a media campaign they did for the Argentine brewer, Cerveza Quilmes. Their group was also popular in Venezuela, Colombia, Per√∫, Chile and Mexico, where they eventually toured. Their LP records for RCA-Victor were fast sellers all over Latin America. They even appeared in a movie, \\"Fiebre de Juventud\\", along with Mexican pop idol Enrique Guzm√°n, in 1962. After attaining some success in Spain, TNT moved there in 1963. They went as far as representing the country in the Eurovision Song Contest 1964 in Copenhagen, billed as \\"Nelly, Tim and Tony\\". Tony stated once that the group was handpicked by the powers that be behind TVE, the Spanish state television, to substitute that year's winners in the Spanish classification round, Michel and Teresa Mar√≠a, popular Spanish singers of the time. TVE toned down their normally dynamic act for the contest, in which they sang what was originally a slow ballad, \\"Caracola\\" (written by Spanish songwriter Fina de Calder√≥n). Tony and his siblings suspected that this was a disaster waiting to happen. Disappointed by their twelfth-place finish in the competition, and the subsequent reaction in Spain, their willingness to tour and record there diminished with time. They moved back to Argentina in 1965. Tim eventually left the group in 1966 and returned to his native Italy to become a concert promoter. =Nelly and Tony's move to Puerto Rico= The music pairing of Nelly and Tony then became a duo. In 1968, after travelling across South America and spending two years in Venezuela (his then-wife Raquel Montero was an Argentine-born telenovela actress, whose good looks and dramatic talent were popular in the country; their mutual children Mara and Alejandro Croatto were born there). Tony moved to what would eventually become his adoptive homeland, Puerto Rico, when \\"Nelly y Tony\\" were hired by Puerto Rican promoter Alfred D. Herger to appear on his popular youth television shows. \\"Nelly y Tony\\" would perform together until 1974, when Nelly married a Puerto Rican surgeon. She retired from pop music and eventually moved to the United States (she currently lives in Redlands, California). While performing with his sister Nelly in New York's Teatro Puerto Rico in 1973, Tony was introduced to New York-bred but Puerto Rico-born vocalist Roberto TiradoTirado, Roberto (2006). \\"The Chosen Journey: A Memoir\\". Trafford Publishing. . who suggested that he compose a hit song for his idol Lucecita Ben√≠tez, who was going through hard times in her career. Tony obliged, and with poet David Ortiz, wrote her number one career refreshing hit, \\"Soy De Una Raza Pura.\\" That would be the only song that Lucecita Ben√≠tez would claim as her opening song for many years later on. While he was almost as successful in Puerto Rico singing pop tunes with his sister as he was in other countries, Tony Croatto was very much impressed by Puerto Rican j√≠baro singers, who could improvise d√©cimas on the spot, something that reminded him of the payadores of Uruguay and Argentina he used to listen to when he was growing up. He also found a richness in musical traditions in Puerto Rico that, he claimed, was extremely rare elsewhere in Latin America. He started singing Puerto Rican folk songs with Nelly, and noticed that their pop treatment of these songs was far more in demand that the pop material they would normally sing together. He was also well impressed by the Puerto Rican people, who ‚Äî he claimed ‚Äî treated him better on his first night on the island than what he had experienced touring extensively in a country or two. That, plus various personal reasons, persuaded him to stay in Puerto Rico for good; he even went as far as saying he was a \\"born again Puerto Rican.\\" Montero also made Puerto Rico her permanent residence, even after divorcing Croatto later on. =The Haciendo Punto years= Croatto then formed Haciendo Punto en Otro Son, a group famous for its songs (particularly protest songs), which were composed and arranged in the \\"Nueva Trova\\" tradition. He joined Puerto Rican singers Silverio P√©rez, Josy Latorre, Irvin Garc√≠a, and Nano Cabrera. \\"Haciendo Punto\\" was quite heterogeneous: P√©rez's strength was in j√≠baro music, Latorre was a classically trained singer, Cabrera was a rocker and Garc√≠a was also a strong salsa percussionist and singer, but Croatto's vast experience with pop music (in the opinion of P√©rez) made all the difference in the group's success. Croatto was instrumental in both the musical and technical aspects of the group, not only as singer, guitarist and keyboardist, but also as arranger, producer and studio technician. In fact, he founded a record label at the time, named Artomax, which was financed by local singer Chucho Avellanet and local producer Tom√°s Figueroa. =Tony goes solo= His first solo record, featuring both synthesizers and Puerto Rican folk instruments, was well received by the public at large. Since then he was well regarded for his interpretations of Puerto Rican folk music, which spanned over thirty albums. Croatto worked in Puerto Rico by remaking old Puerto Rican standards such as the plena standard \\"La M√°quina\\" (\\"The Train's Engine\\") and a medley of plenas by C√©sar Concepci√≥n, both rearranged as pop songs. He made also an adaptation of \\"El Cocuy Que Alumbra\\" ('The Firefly That Shines') from the Venezuelan parranda band Un Solo Pueblo, which was renamed \\"A Correr Sabana\\" once set to new lyrics written by salsa composer Tite Curet Alonso. Curet and Croatto wrote another firefly song together, this time an original named Cucubano (the song was also versioned by the Puerto Rican boy band, Menudo). In 1985, Croatto recorded El Ni√±ito Jes√∫s (aka \\"Se llama Jes√∫s\\"), released during the Christmas season, which told about a poor and hungry child, named Jes√∫s (a thinly-veiled reference to the Christ child), with wornout pants and no shoes, who walked into a house of well-doers begging for attention, while the people in the household rejected him, first euphemistically, then rather openly. Croatto divorced Montero and married former singer, actress (and later children television hostess) Glorivee (Gloria Esther Viera Pantojas) in 1979. His son Hermes Gabriel Croatto Viera was born during his marriage to Glorivee. Croatto was identified himself as a Roman Catholic, although he could not participate fully in church rituals given his status as a divorced man. In part as a way to compensate for this and contribute to his faith he wrote a j√≠baro mass, which gave him one of his latter hits, \\"Creo en Dios\\" (\\"I believe in God\\"). Croatto recorded musical versions of poems and lullabies written by Georgina L√°zaro, a Puerto Rican poet whose works were mostly intended for children. Glorivee had a bout with brain cancer, from which she successfully recovered. Croatto eventually divorced Glorivee and married Lillian Arroyo. He eventually moved to Carolina where he spent his later years. =\\"Desde Mi Pueblo\\"= Parallel to his singing career, Croatto also became a presenter on \\"Desde mi pueblo\\" (\\"From My Town\\"), a variety show / weekly documentary that aired weekly on WIPR-TV. His co-hosts were local comedian Luis Antonio Rivera (Yoyo Boing), the former Miss Universe 1985, Deborah Carthy Deu and Mar√≠a Falc√≥n. The program's concept involved traveling to a different municipality of Puerto Rico every week and highlighting all cultural aspects found in each town. Given the fact that Puerto Rico has 78 municipalities, there was enough material to show and research over the program's six-year run. Carthy is on record stating that Croatto was genuinely interested in researching each program carefully, and became far more knowledgeable about Puerto Rican culture than most of the program's producers, co-hosts and film crew. Because of his background as a farmer, Croatto was very much interested in local agricultural issues; he jumped at trying local folklore, particularly j√≠baro music, bomba and plena variations that were unique to each town or region, \\"sometimes fearlessly\\", said Rivera once. In 1983 Croatto had also a kind of TV cultural show on Telemundo (Puerto Rico) called Tony Croatto Y Tu Pueblo (Tony Croatto And Your Town . =Achievements= Croatto's daughter, Mara Croatto, born in Venezuela, is a famous actress, who considers herself Puerto Rican. In 2000, the City of San Juan, Puerto Rico proclaimed him as its adoptive son. See proclamation. =Death and legacy= Croatto, a lifelong smoker, was diagnosed in March 2005 with lung and brain cancer. He refused medical treatment, opting for natural treatments instead. He expected his health to eventually improve, but probably was not aware of how sick he was, since his death came just three weeks after the announcement. Croatto dictated a letter published in local papers to notify the public of his illness and leave a message of gratitude to the people of Puerto Rico who adopted him as son and patriot. After requesting to be released from the hospital to spend his last days with his family, Croatto died on April 3, 2005. His fellow former Haciendo Punto bandmates had staged a benefit concert for him the night before, which was filmed for later release on a DVD. As a gift from them, the production company provided a live audio feed to what would become Croatto's deathbed; it has been stated that Croatto smiled when the band requested a standing ovation to him, just before losing consciousness for the last time. His funeral was held at the Instituto de Cultura Puertorrique√±a (Institute of Puerto Rican Culture) and he was given a state funeral. Thousands of Puerto Ricans paid their respects and later accompanied the funeral procession en route to his burial in Santa Mar√≠a Magdalena de Pazzis Cemetery located in Old San Juan. He will always be remembered for how he rekindled and boosted in Puerto Ricans the love for their country, their nature, and the \\"j√≠baro\\" concept, without political colors nor beliefs.

The term also describes the standards of education and training that prepare members of the profession with the particular knowledge and skills necessary to perform their specific role within that profession. In addition, most professionals are subject to strict codes of conduct, enshrining rigorous ethical and moral obligations. Professional standards of practice and ethics for a particular field are typically agreed upon and maintained through widely recognized professional associations, such as the IEEE. Some definitions of \\"professional\\" limit this term to those professions that serve some important aspect of public interest and the general good of society.Sullivan, William M. (2nd ed. 2005). Work and Integrity: The Crisis and Promise of Professionalism in America. Jossey Bass.Gardner, Howard and Shulman, Lee S., The Professions in America Today: Crucial but Fragile. Daedalus, Summer 2005. (pgs. 13‚Äì14) In some cultures, the term is used as shorthand to describe a particular social stratum of well-educated workers who enjoy considerable work autonomy and who are commonly engaged in creative and intellectually challenging work.Gilbert, D. (1998). The American class structure: In an age of growing inequality. Belmont, CA: Wadsworth Press.Beeghley, L. (2004). The structure of social stratification in the United States.

New York: Harper Perennial. Trades In narrow usage, not all expertise is considered a profession. Occupations such as skilled construction and maintenance work are more generally thought of as trades or crafts. The completion of an apprenticeship is generally associated with skilled labour, or trades such as carpenter, electrician, mason, painter, plumber and other similar occupations. Theory Although professional training appears to be ideologically neutral, it may be biased towards those with higher class backgrounds and a formal education. In his 2000 book, Disciplined Minds: A Critical Look at Salaried Professionals and the Soul-Battering System that Shapes Their Lives, Jeff Schmidt observes that qualified professionals are less creative and diverse in their opinions and habits than non-professionals, which he attributes to the subtle indoctrination and filtering which accompanies the process of professional training. His evidence is both qualitative and quantitative, including professional examinations, industry statistics and personal accounts of trainees and professionals.Schmidt, J. (2000). Disciplined Minds ‚Äì A Critical Look at Salaried Professionals and the Soul-Battering System that Shapes their Lives. Rowman & Littlefield, pp.293. A key theoretical dispute arises from the observation that established professions (e.g. lawyers, medical doctors, architects, civil engineers, surveyors) are subject to strict codes of conduct. Some have thus argued that these codes of conduct, agreed upon and maintained through widely recognized professional associations, are a key element of what constitutes any profession. Others have argued that strict codes of conduct and the professional associations that maintain them are merely a consequence of 'successful' professionalization, rather than an intrinsic element of the definition of professional(ism); this implies that a profession arises from the alignment between a shared purpose (connected to a 'greater good'), a body of knowledge, actual behavior in terms of actions and decisions, and expectations held by societal stakeholders. Etymology The etymology and historical meaning of the term professional is from Middle English, from profes, adjective, having professed one's vows, from Anglo-French, from Late Latin professus, from Latin, past participle of profitƒìri to profess, confess, from pro- before + fatƒìri to acknowledge; in other senses, from Latin professus, past participle. Thus, as people became more and more specialized in their trade, they began to 'profess' their skill to others, and 'vow' to perform their trade to the highest known standard. With a reputation to uphold, trusted workers of a society who have a specific trade are considered professionals. Ironically, the usage of the word 'profess' declined from the late 1800s to the 1950s, just as the term 'professional' was gaining popularity from 1900‚Äì2010. Notably, in American English the rise in popularity of the term 'professional' started at the beginning of the 20th century whereas in British English it started in the 1930s and grew fastest in the 1960s and 70s.

Its attendance area serves the central third of Arlington, and it also offers the International Baccalaureate Program countywide. In January 2019, the Arlington Public Schools Board voted to rename the school to Washington-Liberty High School beginning the 2019‚Äì20 school year. History View of the high school from across Quincy Street (2017) The original name of Washington-Liberty High School was Washington-Lee High School, whose name was taken from the Washington and Lee University, but the and was omitted and replaced with a hyphen to distinguish from the university. While the name comes from the university, there are also Northern Virginia and Arlington County landmarks that are associated with the naming of the school: The proximity of the home of two prominent Virginians: General George Washington and General Robert E. Lee. Construction on Washington-Lee began in 1924, with the school opening in 1925 and graduating its first class in 1927. The architectural firm Upman & Adams designed the building in a simplified version of the Colonial Revival style. The school fronted on 13th St. N, which separated the school from its athletic field, eventually dedicated as Arlington County's War Memorial Stadium. In 1932, 41 classrooms, new offices, and another gym were added to the original building. A new wing and a large library with Palladian windows and two reading rooms were built in 1942 with WPA funds. The rifle range was also constructed in the shop area. In 1951, noted architect Rhees Burkett designed an addition that fronted on N. Quincy Street in the International Style. Along with the new Stratford Junior High School, it helped usher in a wave of contemporary commercial and school architecture that defined much of Arlington until the 1980s. In 1960, some Sophomores and Juniors were sent to form the core of the then new Yorktown High School, to relieve overcrowding resulting from the baby boomer generation reaching high school age.. In 1975, the school board made the controversial decision to demolish the original sections of the school and construct a new facility with an open space instructional environment. The new school opened in 1977, and a new auditorium was constructed a few years later. In 1984, with the introduction of a new \\"closed campus\\" policy for underclassmen, a cafeteria was constructed in the school's commons. Beginning in 2006, the school underwent a complete reconstruction; none of the older buildings remain. The theater and nearby classrooms were demolished to allow for the construction of the new classroom building, which opened in January 2008. An axial orientation to War Memorial Stadium and the primary parking areas is the defining characteristic of the new school. A ten-lane regulation NCAA short course swimming pool (with optional 25 meter lanes), gym and other indoor athletic facilities, and an 800-seat auditorium opened to the public in July 2009. The demolition of the 1951 building and the construction of auxiliary athletic fields and additional landscaping was completed in December 2009. The renovation cost Arlington County nearly $100 million and making it one of the most expensive high school construction projects in the United States. In the wake of the August 2017 Charlottesville, Virginia, deadly white supremacist rally protesting the removal of a statue of Robert E. Lee, the Arlington County School Board voted unanimously in June 2018 to rename Washington-Lee High School to remove Lee's name, sparking a community discussion on whether or not this was wanted. This included debates on the process in which the school board took to change the name of the school. In the months prior to the name change, an appointed committee considered several options before narrowing them to \\"Washington-Loving High School\\", in honor of the Loving v. Virginia court case, and \\"Washington-Liberty High School\\". On January 10, 2019, the school board voted unanimously for the latter name. The name change took effect with the 2019-2020 school year. Campus The new four-story building frames the northern end of War Memorial Stadium, referencing the orientation of the original three story 1924 building. A stepped terrace leads to the field from the school's student commons and outdoor eating areas. The school's primary corridor on the ground floor is the focal point for the more public spaces, which include the performing arts center, student commons, alumni conference room, cyber cafe, and journalism suite. It spans the distance between the commons and a primary entrance with access to a multistory parking structure and bus lanes. A public entrance is located on N Stafford St, and a separate public entrance serves the pool. The compact massing of the new building allowed for the construction of additional athletic fields on land previously occupied by the former school. The orientation of the new school within the surrounding open space and the abundant pedestrian connections across the site that connect neighborhoods adhere to Arlington County's urban design guidelines, which follow \\"smart growth\\" planning principles. The new building was certified LEED gold by the U.S. Green Building Council (USGBC) rating system, the second high school in Virginia to achieve that benchmark. Crossed sabres logo above the bleachers at Washington-Lee, 2011 Academics In 1985, Washington-Lee was named a National (Blue Ribbon) School of Excellence by the US Department of Education. In 2007, Newsweek magazine ranked Washington-Lee 33rd among the nation's top high schools. Washington-Liberty is the only school in Arlington that offers both the Advanced Placement Program as well as the International Baccalaureate Program. The vast majority of its students take advantage of these advanced courses or diploma programs. Fine arts The school offers fine arts courses and electives. Within the music department, electives include the marching and symphonic bands, madrigals, women's chorale, choir, orchestra, music theory, and guitar. In 2007, the music department received the Blue Ribbon Award, the highest award given by the Virginia Music Educators Association. The school was also a blue ribbon school for 2010‚Äì11.

The book depicts arguably the most well-known adventure of the series and introduces the character of Janet. Synopsis Ms. Frizzle's class is learning about the solar system and Arnold's unpleasant cousin Janet, who constantly raves about herself, has joined them. The Friz decides to take the kids on a field trip to the planetarium. But once they get there, they find the planetarium is closed for repairs. However, on the way back to school, Ms. Frizzle pushes a button that makes the bus transform into a rocket and blast off into outer space. Once in outer space, the bus flies to Earth's Moon, where the kids make the most of the lesser gravity. Ms. Frizzle then takes them to the Sun and then Mercury, Venus and Mars before flying into the asteroid belt. However, while in the belt, one of the bus's tail lights is damaged by an asteroid and the Friz flies out to fix the tail light with a tether line connecting her to the bus. However, the bus's autopilot malfunctions, causing the bus to fly off, breaking Ms. Frizzle's tether line and leaving her stranded in the asteroid belt. Janet looks through the Friz's things and finds Ms. Frizzle's lesson book, which documents the information she is supposed to tell the kids during the field trip (complete with \\"Arnold, are you listening?\\" written into it.) Janet reads through the book as they pass the outer planets and until they pass Pluto, leaving the solar system. Janet then flips through the book and finds the instructions for the autopilot, so they can fly back to the asteroid belt and rescue Ms. Frizzle. After they rescue the Friz, they return to Earth. The children tell various adults about their trips, but unfortunately they don't believe them, thinking that instead it was all their imagination - perhaps some kind of game they played with their friends. Reception Michele Landsberg of Entertainment Weekly gave a very positive review of the book, saying that, \\"The fun is irresistible and the information substantial [...]\\". Television adaptation The book was adapted into the first episode of the Magic School Bus television series to be broadcast. It is likely not the first episode produced (i.e. the pilot episode) since Arnold at one point mentions that the class went on a field trip inside a rotten log, probably referring to the events of the episode The Magic School Bus Meets The Rot Squad. (He also mentions that they've gone to the bottom of the ocean, but they never did that until the 4th episode of the first season The Magic School Bus Gets Eaten and the second-season episode The Magic School Bus Blows Its Top.) The episode is infamous for its third act in which it unintentionally teaches that one could survive without a helmet in the vacuum of space if brought back into an oxygen-filled environment quickly. For the most part, the episode remains faithful to the book. Most notably, in the episode, Janet's bragging about herself does not appear to be empty bragging and she constantly raves about how \\"proof\\" is needed for all extraordinary claims, prompting her to force Arnold to collect \\"proof\\" from every planet in the solar system, so she can prove to the students in her class that she actually traveled to all the planets. Also in this one Arnold surprisingly suggests going to outer space himself to prove to Janet the truth. Also, instead of remaining in the asteroid belt, Ms. Frizzle uses her jet pack to fly off to another planet and provides the kids with clues as to her location via the radio on the bus. She, of course, turns out to be on Pluto. The ending is changed too, with all of Janet's possessions (\\"proof\\") falling out of the bus on Pluto and her refusing to leave without it. Janet refuses to go home without her possessions, while Arnold refuses to go home without her. Arnold (in protest against her desire for proof), he demonstrates to Janet what would happen to her if she remains on Pluto by removing his helmet, which freezes him (despite Janet's pleads of Arnold not to do it), and forces Janet to leave Pluto immediately. Then Janet is shocked and she and the class have to carry him back on to the school bus. Janet (as she and the class are holding Arnold) says, \\"BACK TO EARTH!\\", and to Ms. Frizzle, she says, \\"AND STEP ON IT!\\". This ending, of course, makes Arnold the hero instead of Janet. Among arriving back to Earth, all Arnold got from the freeze-over was a cold, and then the alien-obsessed Ralphie fakes a news announcement about aliens discovered on Pluto, complaining about the junk Janet left. Despite the producer segment indicating otherwise, it is not implausible that Arnold survive exposure to the thin atmosphere of Pluto after removing his helmet for long enough to be rescued. The show does, however, repeat the urban legend that one could catch a cold from the cold. The common cold is a viral infectious disease and one particularly could not catch it in the virtually airless atmosphere of Pluto as Arnold does in the episode. This episode also marks the introduction of Janet in the TV series, and it is also the first time the bus is driven by the kids or someone other than Ms. Frizzle (the bus does not appear to have autopilot in the episode). Software adaptation The Magic School Bus Explores the Solar System is the first software game developed based on the Magic School Bus series (The Magic School Bus Explores the Human Body was released the same year.) In the game, Ms. Frizzle is lost as soon as the bus flies off into space and got hit by a meteor in a meteor shower and the goal of the game is to locate her using the clues she provides. The Friz's hiding place varies throughout the game. As would become the standard for the remainder of the games in the original software series, the main screen consists of the bus's dashboard, where the user can \\"drive\\" the bus to any of the nine planets or Earth's moon. Since Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus and Neptune lack solid surfaces, the Bus (unlike in the book and TV adaptations) in this version instead lands on one of their moons (Io for Jupiter, Mimas for Saturn, Miranda for Uranus and Triton for Neptune). Once on a planet, the user can exit the bus, where a strange satellite called the \\"whatsit\\" must be clicked on to bring up an arcade-styled game in which the user, controlling one of the students, must collect one of Ms. Frizzle's tokens (giant coins with Ms. Frizzle's face on them) which provide the user with a clue as to the Friz's whereabouts and activate the \\"Friz-finder.\\" There are only three clues available, but tokens will still need to be collected to activate the \\"Friz-finder\\" after all the clues have been exhausted. Clicking on the \\"Friz-finder\\" will determine whether Ms. Frizzle is anywhere on the current planet. If she is, then the game is completed, but if she is not then the user will have to collect another token to activate the \\"Friz-finder\\" to try again. =Notes= * In three of the Magic School Bus games, Liz has the ability to speak (only the player can hear her). * Most of the voices in the software sound similar to those in the TV series, except for Ms. Frizzle. Lily Tomlin did not reprise the role in the game, being replaced by Tina Marie Goff. * When Keesha says \\"It's really cloudy down here\\", her voice is that of Phoebe's. Similar goofs happened in other software; Phoebe speaks in Keesha's voice showing her report about the Small Intestines, Dorothy Ann has Keesha and Phoebe's voices and not her own while exploring the Large Intestines, and Ralphie speaks in Tim's voice saying how ugly garbage is on the beach.

Born in Newark, New Jersey, he served in the United States Army from 1974 to 1977. He then worked various law enforcement jobs in the United States and abroad, joining the New York Police Department (NYPD) in 1986. He is perhaps best known for his 1998‚Äì2000 tenure as commissioner of the New York City Department of Correction and his 2000‚Äì01 tenure as New York City Police Commissioner, during which he oversaw the police response to the September 11 attacks. After the 2003 invasion of Iraq, President George W. Bush appointed Kerik as the interior minister of the Iraqi Coalition Provisional Authority. In 2004, Bush nominated Kerik to lead the Department of Homeland Security. However, Kerik soon withdrew his candidacy, explaining that he had employed an undocumented immigrant as a nanny. His admission touched off state and federal investigations. In 2006, Kerik pleaded guilty in Bronx Supreme Court to two unrelated misdemeanor ethics violations and was ordered to pay $221,000 in fines. In 2009, Kerik pleaded guilty in the Southern District of New York to eight federal felony charges, and in February 2010, he was sentenced to four years in federal prison.Ed Shanahan, Bernard Kerik Was Pardoned by President Trump.

His paternal grandfather emigrated from Russia to a coal-mining town in Pennsylvania and changed his surname from Kapurik to Kerik. Kerik was raised Catholic and grew up in Paterson, New Jersey. He attended Eastside High School in Paterson, and dropped out in 1972.via Associated Press. \\"Former NYPD top cop now asked to protect nation\\", USA Today, December 2, 2004. Accessed August 29, 2019. \\"Kerik, 49, grew up without knowing his birth mother, a tough kid in Paterson, N.J., where he usually cut classes from the trouble-filled Eastside High School later depicted in the 1989 film Lean on Me.... Kerik dropped out of high school, getting an equivalency degree, to join the Army, where he became a military policeman stationed in South Korea.\\" In July 1974, he enlisted in the United States Army and received a General Educational Development (GED) certificate from the State of North Carolina while assigned to Fort Bragg, North Carolina. After leaving the New York City Police Department, he received a B.S. in social theory, social structure and change, from (ESC) Empire State College of the State University of New York in 2002. Career =Military= After dropping out of high school, Kerik enlisted in the U.S. Army and served in the Military Police, stationed in Korea. =Private sector= After leaving the Army, Kerik worked as a security expert in the Middle East; for a time, his clients included the Saudi royal family. =Law enforcement= Kerik at press conference concerning crime scene evidence collection from the WTC site in 2001 Kerik at the NYFPC briefing on \\"New York City ‚Äì 1 Year After 9/11\\" with Rudy Giuliani, Richard Sheirer, and Thomas Von Essen in 2002 From December 1981 to October 1982 and then July 1984 to July 1986, Kerik worked at the Passaic County sheriff's office, in New Jersey. He served as the department's training officer and commander of the special weapons and operations, and ultimately chief and warden of the Passaic County jail. Kerik worked from 1982 to 1984 as chief of investigations for the security division of the King Faisal Specialist Hospital in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia. Six members of the hospital security staff, including Kerik, were fired and deported after an investigation in 1984 by the Saudi secret police. In his autobiography, Kerik wrote that he was expelled after a physical altercation with a Saudi secret police interrogator; however, in 2004, after his nomination as Secretary of Homeland Security, nine former employees of the hospital told The Washington Post that Kerik worked with a hospital administrator to surveil people's private affairs, leading to a scandal partly based on part on Feteih's use of \\"the institution's security staff to track the private lives of several women with whom he was romantically involved, and men who came in contact with them.\\" Kerik joined the New York City Police Department in 1986.Bernard Kerik Fast Facts, CNN (last updated March 4, 2020). He first met Rudolph W. Giuliani in 1990,Michael Powell, Loyal to Kerik, Giuliani Missed Warning Signs, The New York Times (November 3, 2007). and during the 1993 New York City mayoral election campaign, served as Giuliani's bodyguard and driver. He joined the New York City Department of Corrections in 1994, and enjoyed a series of promotions with Giuliani's backing. He was credited with reducing violence among the city's jail inmates.A Street Cop's Rise From High School Dropout to Cabinet Nominee, The New York Times (December 2, 2004). Giuliani appointed Kerik commissioner of the city Department of Corrections, a post he served in from 1998 to 2000. Giuliani appointed Kerik the 40th Police Commissioner of New York City on August 21, 2000.Eric Lipton, New Leader For the Police Fills a Need For Loyalty, The New York Times (August 21, 2000). Giuliani made the appointment against the advice of the outgoing police commissioner and many members of Giuliani's cabinet. Kerik's critics noted that he did not have a college degree, which at the time was a requirement for police officers to advance to the rank of captain and above. As police commissioner, Kerik had a tense relationship with the FBI, in part because he criticized federal agencies for not sharing enough intelligence with local police. Although crime in New York dropped during Kerik's tenure, he was sometimes criticized for use of power. The New York Times reported that: \\"Behind the scenes Mr. Kerik ruled like a feudal lord, many former employees have said. He had taken up with a woman who was a correction officer; he was accused of directing officers to staff his wedding. He befriended the agency's inspector general, whose watchdog responsibilities require keeping an arm's-length relationship, and the investigator attended his wedding.\\" On one occasion, Kerik sent homicide investigators to interview and fingerprint a number of Fox News employees whom Kerik's publisher, Judith Regan, suspected of stealing a necklace and mobile phone. During his time as police commissioner he made five arrests, including one involving two ex- convicts‚Äîone a paroled killer, wanted for a carjacking at gunpoint in Virginia‚Äîfor allegedly driving a stolen van in Harlem. Kerik was serving as police commissioner during the September 11 attacks. He was in his office when American Airlines Flight 11 hit the North Tower. He arrived at the base of the North Tower three minutes before United Airlines Flight 175 hit the South Tower, showering him and his staff with debris as Giuliani, Kerik, and their top aides were trapped inside a building at 75 Barclay Street.John Marzulli, Giuliani and Group of Top Cops Barely Dodged Death as Tower, New York Daily News (September 27, 2001). The September 11 attacks gave Kerik a national profile. Kerik served 16 months as commissioner, leaving office on December 31, 2001, at the end of Giuliani's term. Kerik later claimed that \\"over the eight-year period that Giuliani was in office, we dropped the violent crime by 63 percent, dropped the murder by 70 overall in the city.\\" =Return to private sector= Following his departure from the New York City Police Department, he was employed by Giuliani Partners, a consulting firm formed by Giuliani. He was senior vice president at Giuliani Partners and as chief executive officer of Giuliani‚ÄìKerik LLC, an affiliate of Giuliani Partners. Kerik resigned from these positions in December 2004. In March 2005 he created The Kerik Group LLC, where he served as chairman until June 2009, consulting in crisis management and risk mitigation, counterterrorism and law enforcement, and jail/prison management strategies.

Bush administration as interim Interior Minister of Iraq and senior policy adviser to U.S. presidential envoy to Iraq, Paul Bremer. When Kerik arrived in Iraq the Ministry of Interior did not exist, having collapsed and dissolved during the U.S.‚Äìled coalition's invasion of Iraq. Kerik was responsible for restructuring and rebuilding the ministry and all its constituent parts: the national police, intelligence service, and border and customs police, as well as choosing the officials who would take control of these institutions when he left. Prior to Kerik's departure from Iraq on September 2, 2003, more than 35,000 Iraqi police were reinstated, 35 police stations were stood up in Baghdad with several more around the country, the senior deputy interior ministers were appointed, and the newly established governing council appointed the first Iraqi minister of interior, post‚ÄìSaddam Hussein, Nuri Badran. A United Nations UNODC fact-finding mission report dated May 18, 2003 at the beginning of his term, noted that Kerik's team made \\"positive interventions in a number of areas.\\" During his tenure as Interior Minister of Iraq Bernard Kerik secretly accepted and failed to report a $250,000 interest free \\"loan\\" from Israeli billionaire Eitan Wertheimer, a gift later determined to be a bribe for which he was indicted by the US federal government and sentenced to prison. Precisely what Wertheimer expected to receive in return for the money is an open question. =Nomination as U.S. Secretary of Homeland Security= President George W. Bush announcing Kerik's nomination to be the Secretary of Homeland Security in 2004 On December 3, 2004, Kerik was nominated by President Bush to succeed Tom Ridge as United States Secretary of Homeland Security. Incoming Attorney General Alberto Gonzales vetted Kerik during that nomination period. But on December 10, after a week of press scrutiny, Kerik withdrew acceptance of the nomination. Kerik stated that he had unknowingly hired an undocumented worker as a nanny and housekeeper. Similar violations of immigration law had previously caused the withdrawal of the nominations of Linda Chavez as secretary of labor by George W. Bush and of Zo√´ Baird and Kimba Wood for attorney general by President Bill Clinton. Shortly after withdrawing his name from consideration, Kerik became the target of a New York State grand jury investigation by the Bronx District Attorney's Office, and later, the United States Attorney's Office.  Criminal investigation and convictions After an 18-month-long grand jury investigation conducted by the Bronx District Attorney's Office, Kerik pleaded guilty in Bronx Supreme Court on June 30, 2006 to two ethics violations (unclassified misdemeanors). Kerik acknowledged that during the time he was Interior Minister of Iraq, he accepted a $250,000 interest-free \\"loan\\" from Israeli billionaire Eitan Wertheimer and failed to report it. Kerik first met the billionaire, whose vast holdings include major defense contractors, when Kerik took a four-day trip to Israel less than two weeks before September 11, 2001 to discuss counter-terrorism with Israeli officials. On November 8, 2007, Kerik was indicted by a federal grand jury in White Plains, New York on charges of tax fraud, and making false statements to the federal government about the $250,000 he received from Wertheimer. Prosecutors further accused Kerik of receiving about $236,000 from New York real estate mogul Steven C. Witkoff between 2001 and 2003. Some of the New York charges were dropped in December 2008, but Kerik was then re-indicted on the same charges in Washington, D.C. On November 5, 2009, Kerik pleaded guilty to eight felony tax and false statement charges, specifically two counts of tax fraud, one count of making a false statement on a loan application, and five counts of making false statements. He was sentenced to forty-eight months in federal prison and three years' supervised release (probation). Kerik was represented by criminal defense attorney Michael F. Bachner. He surrendered to the U.S. minimum security prison camp in Cumberland, Maryland, on May 17, 2010. He was discharged from federal custody on October 15, 2013, and after serving five months' home confinement, his supervised release concluded in October 2016. Kerik was granted a presidential pardon by Donald Trump on February 18, 2020. Awards and honors CPAC in 2014 In October 2001, Queen Elizabeth II gave Kerik (as well as New York Fire Commissioner Thomas Von Essen) honorary appointments as Commander of the Most Excellent Order of the British Empire (CBE) for their work responding to the September 11 attacks.http://www.aparchive.com/metadata/youtube/486d3b6ce35096fcfee26754994a2b07 Kerik has received an honorary degree from Michigan State University in 2003 and the President's Medal from Hunter College in 2002.184th Commencement Exercises: January 24, 2001, Hunter College. Personal life Kerik's first child was born in October 1975 when he was 20 and serving in South Korea as a military policeman. In February 1976, Kerik completed his tour of duty in South Korea and left mother and daughter behind. In his autobiography, Kerik called the episode \\"a mistake I will always regret, and I pray to God that one day I can make it right.\\" Kerik has been married three times. His first marriage was in August 1978; he and his wife were divorced in 1983. Kerik's second marriage lasted from September 1983 to July 1992; the marriage produced a son. Kerik's third marriage took place in 1998, and the couple had two daughters. In 2001 Kerik published a memoir, The Lost Son: A Life in Pursuit of Justice, a The New York Times best-seller. In March 2014, Kerik published his second book, From Jailer to Jailed: My Journey from Correction and Police Commissioner to Inmate 84888-054, documenting the 13 prior years of his life including his incarceration and personal observations of the U.S. criminal justice system. Kerik's novel The Grave Above the Grave was published by Humanix Books in September 2018. Kerik was close friends with Lawrence V. \\"Larry\\" Ray, who was accused of running a sex cult at Sarah Lawrence College, and was charged, in 2020, with extortion, forced prostitution and forced labor. Ray was the best man at Kerik's wedding before the two had a falling out in 2000, when Ray cooperated with the prosecution against his former friend. Kerik has since called Ray \\"a psychotic con man\\".

Born in Lausanne, Switzerland, Carpentier grew up in Havana, Cuba, and despite his European birthplace, he strongly self-identified as Cuban throughout his life. He traveled extensively, particularly in France, and to South America and Mexico, where he met prominent members of the Latin American cultural and artistic community. Carpentier took a keen interest in Latin American politics and often aligned himself with revolutionary movements, such as Fidel Castro's Communist Revolution in Cuba in the mid-20th century. Carpentier was jailed and exiled for his leftist political philosophies. With a developed knowledge of music, Carpentier explored musicology, publishing an in-depth study of the music of Cuba, La m√∫sica en Cuba and integrated musical themes and literary techniques throughout his works. He explored elements of Afro-Cubanism and incorporated the cultural aspects into the majority of his writings. Although Carpentier wrote in a myriad of genres, such as journalism, radio drama, playwrighting, academic essays, opera and libretto, he is best known for his novels. He was among the first practitioners of magical realism using the technique, lo real maravilloso to explore the fantastic quality of Latin American history and culture. The most famous example of Afro-Cuban influence and use of lo real maravilloso is Carpentier's 1949 novel El reino de este mundo (The Kingdom of this World) about the Haitian revolution of the late 18th century. Carpentier's writing style integrated the resurgent Baroque style, or New World Baroque style that Latin American artists adopted from the European model and assimilated to the Latin American artistic vision. With a first-hand experience of the French Surrealist movement, Carpentier also adapted the Surrealist theory to Latin American literature. Always eager to explore more than Cuban identity, Carpentier used his traveling experiences throughout Europe and Latin American to expand his understanding of Latin American identity. Carpentier wove elements of Latin American political history, music, social injustice and art into the tapestries of his writings, all of which exerted a decisive influence on the works of younger Latin American and Cuban writers like Lisandro Otero, Leonardo Padura and Fernando Vel√°zquez Medina. Carpentier died in Paris in 1980 and was buried in Havana's Colon Cemetery with other Cuban political and artistic luminaries. Life =Early life and education= Carpentier was born on December 26, 1904, in Lausanne, Switzerland, to Jorge Juli√°n Carpentier, a French architect, and Lina Valmont, a Russian language teacher. For a long time it was believed that he was born in Havana, where his family moved immediately after his birth; however, following Carpentier's death, his birth certificate was found in Switzerland. In 1912, Alejo and his family moved from Cuba to Paris. He also spoke French and as an adolescent, he read Balzac, Flaubert, and Zola. In 1921, Carpentier attended the School of Architecture of the University of Havana. When he was 18, his parents' marriage broke up and his father left. The following year, Carpentier left his studies and tried to find work to support his mother. He turned to journalism, working for the Cuban newspapers Carteles and Social. He also studied music.Colchie, Thomas (editor), A Hammock Beneath the Mangoes: stories from Latin America; Penguin Group, 416‚Äì417 (1991). =Cuba and exile in France= In 1921, while studying in Havana, Carpentier became a cultural journalist, writing mostly about avant-garde developments in the arts, particularly music.\\"Bergh 1972, p. 19. He contributed columns to La Discusi√≥n, a daily journal from Havana. His journalistic work, which was considered leftist, helped establish the first Cuban Communist Party. During 1923 and 1924 he continued to work as a columnist and also edited musical and theatre reviews for La Discusi√≥n and El Heraldo de Cuba.Bergh 1972, p. 24. In 1927, with the help of Jorge Ma√±ach, Juan Marinello, Francisco Ichaso, and Mart√≠ Casanovas, he became a founding member of Revista de Avance, a magazine devoted to nationalism, radicalism and new ideas in the arts.Bergh 1972, p. 33. The first issue appeared on March 15, 1927; it lasted until September 15, 1930, and became the \\"voice of the vanguard\\" and the primary voice of expression of the Cuban movement. Because of his involvement in such projects, Carpentier was often suspected of having subversive and ultramodern cultural ideas. Carpentier was arrested in 1927 for opposing Gerardo Machado y Morales dictatorship and had signed a democratic and anti-imperialist manifesto against Machado's regime and, as a result, spent forty days in jail. During this brief period in jail he started working on his first novel, Ecu√©-Yamba-O, an exploration of Afro-Cuban traditions among the poor of the island. (The book was eventually completed in 1933.) After his release, he escaped Cuba with the help of journalist Robert Desnos who lent him his passport and papers. Carpentier decided on a voluntary exile to France and arrived in Paris in 1928; he remained there until 1939, when he returned to Havana. When he left Cuba, he was fortunate enough to avoid the political conflicts which had occurred during the 1930s. During this time certain positions were unacceptable to the authorities and Cuban intellectuals were forced to define their political position and for these and other political reasons he decided to leave. During this time abroad, his disconnection from Cuba and the interaction with different groups of intellectuals and artists in Paris helped with his \\"critical vision\\".Bergh 1972, p. 18. Carpentier felt that it was important for him to remain outside the influences of movements because he believed in maintaining a ‚Äúbalance against the insularity of his homeland‚Äù.Echevarr√≠a 1990, p. 34. Upon arriving in Paris he immediately began working on poems and editorials in Parisian and Cuban magazines. Contributions to the Parisian Journal such as the short story \\"Cahiers du Sud\\" (1933), in French, were an effort to acquire European readers as a way to improve his recognition. He also contributed to the magazines Documents and L‚ÄôIntransigeant.Bergh 1972, p. 42. Carpentier was familiar with the activities of the Comit√© de Jeunes Revolutionnaires Cubains, a group of exiled Cuban leftists who had published La Terreur √° Cuba, a brochure against the Machado government. He documented the latest news about this group and their activities in his book Homenaje a nuestros amigos de Paris.Bergh 1972, p. 43. It was also during this time that, with the help of Robert Desnos, Carpentier became part of the surrealist movement which became a positive influence in his work. While in France, Carpentier also founded a literary magazine called Im√°n in 1931, for which he became editor-in-chief.Mocega-Gonzalez 1980, p. 54. Most of the authors who worked with him in La Revolution Surrealiste also contributed works in Im√°n under the title ‚ÄúConocimiento de America‚Äù.Janney 1981, p. 69. Carpentier contributed the short story Histoire de Lunes (1933); it was experimental for its time as it contained elements of fantasy and folklore characterized as magical reality. Surrealism helped Carpentier to see contexts and aspects, especially those of American life, which he did not see before and after working among the leading artistic figures for some time, Carpentier did not feel overly enthusiastic about his work within surrealism and had felt that his ‚Äúsurrealist attempts ha[d] been in vain‚Äù describing his frustration, as he felt he had ‚Äúnothing to add to this movement in France\\".Bergh 1972, p. 45. As Carpentier became acquainted with those among the arts community he had several encounters to meet other famous authors such as Pablo Neruda, who had sent him a draft of his book ‚ÄúResidencia el la Tierra‚Äù to review; Guatemalan author Miguel √Ångel Asturias, whose work on pre- Columbian mythology influenced his writing; and Pablo Picasso, an introduction made possible through Carpentier's connection with friends in the arts.Bergh 1972, p. 32. Throughout his time in France Carpentier was occupied with not only literary works, but also other projects that kept him engaged within the arts. He collaborated with French composer Marins Fran√ßois Gaillard on the musical Yamba-O, ‚Äúa burlesque tragedy‚Äù, that was presented in the Th√©√¢tre Beriza in Paris (1928); and with composer Amadeo Rold√°n helped organize the Cuban premieres of works by Stravinsky and Poulenc. In film, Carpentier wrote text and edited music for the French documentary Le Vaudou.Bergh 1972, p. 31. He continued to earn his living by writing on contemporary culture, both in French and Spanish. He also began working for a French radio station as a sound-technician and producer. From 1932 until 1939 Carpentier worked on several projects produced by Foniric Studios. He directed the production of Le Livre de Christophe Colomb and collaborated with Desnos on arranging readings of Edgar Allan Poe's The Murders in the Rue Morgue, and Walt Whitman's Salute to the World. Although abroad, Carpentier still maintained contact with Cuba by sending articles and poems to contribute to Havana publications such as Ensayos Convergentes. When the Machado regime came to an end in 1933, Carpentier decided to make plans to return to his native land to visit, and in 1936 he made the trip back to Cuba. The time he had spent in Paris for over eleven years had enriched and \\"oriented his expressive abilities\\".Bergh 1972, p. 77. Carpentier himself indicated that he was tiring of Paris, and \\"...in 1939 without any other reason than the nostalgia of Cuba, I vacated my apartment and started the return to La Havana\\".Bergh 1972, p. 131. = Years in Haiti and return to Cuba = In 1943, accompanied by French theatrical director Louis Jouvet, Carpentier made a crucial trip to Haiti, during which he visited the fortress of the Citadelle Laferri√®re and the Palace of Sans- Souci, both built by the black king Henri Christophe. This trip, along with readings from Oswald Spengler's cyclical interpretation of history, provided the inspiration for his second novel, El Reino de Este Mundo (The Kingdom of this World) (1949). Carpentier returned to Cuba and continued to work as a journalist at the outbreak of World War II. He worked on a history of Cuban music, eventually published in 1946 as La m√∫sica en Cuba.Carpentier, Alejo 1972. La Musica en Cuba. Mexico. = Life in Venezuela = In 1945, Carpentier moved to Caracas as an exile. From 1945 to 1959 he lived in Venezuela, which is the inspiration for the unnamed South American country in which much of his novel The Lost Steps takes place. He wrote short stories which were later collected in The War of Time (1958). While in Cuba, Carpentier attended a santer√≠a ceremony that was to further deepen his interest in Afro-Cubanism. In 1949, he finished his novel The Kingdom of this World. This novel has a prologue that \\"outlines Carpentier's faith in the destiny of Latin America and the aesthetic implications of its peculiar cultural heritage.\\" =Later life= Carpentier returned to Cuba after the triumph of the revolution led by Fidel Castro in 1959. He worked for the State Publishing House while he completed the baroque-style book, El Siglo de las Luces (Explosion in a Cathedral) (1962). This novel discusses the advent of the Enlightenment and the ideas of the French Revolution in the New World. It has twin leitmotifs of the printing press and the guillotine and can be read as a \\"meditation on the dangers inherent in all revolutions as they begin to confront the temptations of dictatorship.\\" After reading the book, Gabriel Garc√≠a M√°rquez is said to have discarded the first draft of One Hundred Years of Solitude and begun again from scratch.Echevarr√≠a In 1966, Carpentier settled in Paris where he served as Cuban ambassador to France. In 1975 he was the recipient of the Prix mondial Cino Del Duca. He received the Cervantes PrizeUne autre vision de Cuba in 1977 and was recipient of the French Laureates Prix M√©dicis √©tranger in 1979 for La harpe et l'ombre.Prix M√©dicisLettres de Cuba, Alejo Carpentier Carpentier was struggling with cancer as he completed his final novel, El arpa y la sombra, and finally died in Paris on April 24, 1980. His remains were returned to Cuba for interment in the Colon Cemetery, Havana. √âcole Fran√ßaise de la Havane \\"Alejo Carpentier\\", a French international school in Havana, is named after him. Themes =Lo real maravilloso= Carpentier is widely known for his theory of lo real maravilloso. This is the notion that the history and the geography of Latin America are both so extreme as to appear fictional or even magical to outsiders. Thus, Latin America is a region where the line between magic and reality is blurred. It was in the prologue to The Kingdom of this World, a novel of the Haitian Revolution, that he described his vision of lo real maravilloso: \\"But what is the history of Latin America but a chronicle of magical realism?\\". The novel itself develops the outlandish (but true) history of Henri Christophe, first king of Haiti, as an example of how the real history of Latin America is so strange as to appear fictional. Some critics interpret the real maravilloso as being synonymous with magical realism. However, Carpentier's theory and its development in his work are more limited in their scope than is the magical realism of, for example, Gabriel Garc√≠a M√°rquez. Whereas Garc√≠a M√°rquez's works include events that the reader never mistakes for reality (rainfall of flowers, old men with wings, etc.), Carpentier, for the most part, simply writes about extreme aspects of the history and geography of Latin America, aspects that are almost unbelievable, but that are in fact true. =Music= As a young child Carpentier was exposed to a great deal of music. Carpentier himself played the piano, as did his mother; his father played cello, studying under Pablo Casals, and his grandmother played the organ. Carpentier studied music theory at the Lyc√©e Janson-de-Sailly when he lived in Paris for the first time. Carpentier's own compositions made him an important part of the contemporary Cuban musical landscape, but he also studied the origins and political nuances of Cuban music. His devotion to the adaptations of European artistic styles into Latin American music styles can also be seen in his admiration for Afro-Cuban musical themes. Early in his career Carpentier collaborated with other young musicians eager to explore Cuban musical roots. One such collaborator was Amadeo Rold√°n, a French musician of Cuban background. They helped to organize the Cuban premiere of popular orchestral music of the era Conciertos de m√∫sica nueva (Concerts of New Music), featuring composers such as Stravinsky, Milhaud, Ravel, Malipiero, Poulenc and Satie. In regards to their own music, Carpentier and Rold√°n were far more interested in integrating African rhythms and melodies into their works and abandoned imitation of European musical styles. \\"¬°Abajo la lira, arriba el bong√≥!\\" (Down with the lyre, up with the bongo!) was the popular slogan for their style of music. Carpentier and Rold√°n collaborated on numerous works, including the 1925 orchestral piece Obertura sobre temas cubanos (Overture on Cuban Themes) which was regarded as scandalous for its betrayal of what was seen as the proper European-style symphony in favor of Afro-Cuban inspired music. Other well-known collaborations between the two included Tres peque√±as poemas: Oriente, Preg√≥n, Fiesta negra (Three little poems) produced in 1926, and two Afro-Cuban ballets: La Rebambaramba, a colonial ballet in two parts (1928) and El milagro de Anaquille (1929). Carpentier's interest in music had great influence on his prose writing. Navarro suggests that readers of Carpentier's works are more listeners than they are readers. Lyrical use of colloquial dialects, literary rhythms such as alliteration and assonance and the theme of music within the world of the narrative (drums, footsteps, etc.) are a few examples of music's influence over Carpentier's work. In an interview the author himself was quoted as saying \\"Music is present in all of my work.\\" For Carpentier, analysis of Cuban identity was grounded in the analysis of Cuban music. As such, for Carpentier to better understand Cuban identity through his work, he eagerly integrated music into his writing. =Ethnomusicology and Afro- Cubanism= With this intrinsic appreciation of music and a fascination with Cuban identity, Carpentier began investigating the origins of Cuban music in a more academic sense. In 1946, Carpentier published the ethnomusicological study La M√∫sica en Cuba which explores how European music, transplanted African music and the indigenous music of the island all blended together to create Cuban music. Carpentier took particular interest in Afro-Cuban themes. Particularly fascinated with the overwhelming influence of African music in Cuban music, Carpentier introduced Afro-Cuban influenced music called lo afrocubano, (i.e. heavily improvised and rhythm based music) into what was deemed more formal music venues dependent on European styles, called lo guajiro. Carpentier once wrote that lo guajiro was, \\"very poetic, but lo guajiro is not music...On the other hand, in mestizo and black music...the rich material has an incredible wealth to it...to make it the work of national expression.\\" Because of racial tensions between white Cubans and black and criollo Cubans, such preferences were not well received by the Cuban elite of the mid century. Carpentier devoted the majority of his musicology research to the Afro-Cuban influences present in Cuba. For example, Carpentier paid particular attention to Contradanza, a wildly popular Cuban dance derived from the European style of music and dance, Contredanse. The ample room left for musical improvisation and the element of group dance were easily adapted into African musical tradition where improvisation and dance play integral roles. Hence, a hybrid musical form unique to Cuba was created. Carpentier argued that the improvisation inherent in African influenced music allowed for varied interpretations that catalyzed regional differences and therefore regional identity, and concluded that this was why Cuba had such a varied musical identity. Major works Carpentier's major works include: ;Novels: *¬°√âcue- Yamba-O (1933) (Praised Be the Lord!) *El reino de este mundo (1949) (The Kingdom of this World) *Los pasos perdidos (1953) (The Lost Steps) *El acoso (1956) (The Chase, American English translation 1989 by Alfred Mac Adam) *El siglo de las luces (1962) (Explosion in a Cathedral) *Concierto barroco (1974) (Concierto barroco; English: Baroque Concert), based on the 1709 meeting of Vivaldi, Handel and Domenico Scarlatti, with cameo appearances by Wagner and Stravinsky, and fictional characters from the new world who inspire the Venetian composer's opera, Motezuma. *El Recurso del m√©todo (1974) (Reasons of State) *La consagraci√≥n de la primavera (1978) (The Rite of Spring; Le Sacre du Printemps, ballet by Igor Stravinsky) *El arpa y la sombra (1979) (The Harp and the Shadow) dealing with Columbus. ;Short stories: *Guerra del tiempo (1956) (War of Time) *Otros relatos (1984) (Other Stories) ;Essays: *La m√∫sica en Cuba (1946) (The Music of Cuba), an ethno-musicological study of Cuba starting from the 16th century, the arrival of European explorers, till the present day of publication, the mid-20th century. =El reino de este mundo (The Kingdom of This World)= Carpentier's El reino de este mundo (1949) highlights the Haitian Revolution of the 18th century when the African slaves fought the French colonists for their freedom and basic human rights. The novel combines not only historical references of the event with aspects of African faith and rituals, most notably Haitian vodou; but also the connections between corporeal and spiritual self. The story is seen through the eyes of the protagonist Ti No√´l, a black slave. Being a white, European/Cuban writer who published on the subject of the Haitian Revolution, it has been implied that Carpentier chose to write from Ti No√´l's point of view so that he would avoid being criticized for any racial stereotyping. Carpentier incorporates symbolic architecture throughout the novel; representing the dictatorship of colonial rule with structures such as the Sans-Souci Palace and the fortress of La Ferri√®re. =La m√∫sica en Cuba (The Music of Cuba)= La m√∫sica en Cuba (The Music of Cuba) is an ethno- musicological study of the Music of Cuba starting from the sixteenth century with the arrival of European explorers, until the present day of publication, the mid-twentieth century. The blending of different cultures--black, white, mulattoes, criollos and natives--mirrors the blending of Cuba's two main musical styles, the Christian European music and the elemental percussion and rhythm-based music of the transported Africans and aboriginal peoples of the island. The book includes a general history of music in colonized Latin America but mainly focuses on Cuban styles of music and dance, influential Cuban musicians and Cuban musical identity. Carpentier devotes a great deal of his study to exploring the influence African descendants had on Cuban music. He has an entire chapter titled, ‚ÄúLos Negros‚Äù (\\"The Blacks\\") that explores the many substantial ways African music influenced all of Latin American music. According to Carpentier, the African influence on Cuban music in particular was deliberately concealed by the colonist prejudice of 18th- and 19th-century Cuba. At the time of the book's publication many white Cubans were reluctant to even acknowledge the blending of the cultures much less investigate it. Carpentier, though, was eager to do so and by making bold statements about Cuba's past and integral relationships with a wide range of cultures he succeeded in giving back to Cuba an in-depth academic perspective of its own cultural identity through its music. =Guerra del tiempo (The War of Time)= Guerra del tiempo (The War of Time) is a set of surrealistic short stories, in a variety of styles, which evidences Carpentier's ability to work with the fantastic and the surreal. The most important is the first one, \\"El Camino de Santiago\\" (The Way of Santiago), which narrates the adventures of a commoner, a Spaniard in the Age of Discovery, who is today a soldier, tomorrow pilgrim, then a sailor, a colonizer, prisoner, and so on; he pursues every dream and suffers every disappointment. The second tale is called \\"Viaje a la semilla\\" (Journey Back to the Source). This narrative is striking for the function of the time inversion that the narrator operates to tell the life of the main character, Don Marcial (Marqu√©s de Capellan√≠as). = El Acoso (The Chase) = Carpentier's masterpiece, El Acoso, was originally published in Spanish in 1956. It was translated into American English by Alfred Mac Adam as The Chase and published by Farrar, Straus and Giroux in 1989, after over three decades of suppression in the United States for Carpentier's affiliation with Fidel Castro's Cuba (Carpentier had been Cuba's ambassador to France during this time). The novel is one of the most influential novels in contemporary Latin American literature, cited by authors such as Gabriel Garcia Marquez, Mario Vargas Llosa, Jose Donoso and others as a major influence in the movement known in North America as Latin American Magical Realism. The novel is highly compressed, richly atmospheric, philosophical, stylistically brilliant, and non-linear; plot is treated almost as an inconsequential side-effect. Though short (121 pages in English), the novel exhibits a certain labyrinthine quality as its fragmented narrative cycles and circles in upon itself. Ostensibly a man is being chased by somewhat shadowy, probably sinister, perhaps governmental, forces. The action starts on a rainy night at a symphonic concert and music plays a part in the clues necessary to piece together what is happening. The Chase is perhaps Carpentier's strongest novel, and easily one of the better novels written in the 20th century, though it is almost unknown in the English-speaking world in spite of Mac Adam's superb 1989 translation. = El arpa y la sombra (The Harp and the Shadow) = The Harp and the Shadow is a historic novel (also considered the first novel in the literary style of La nueva cr√≥nica de Indias) published in 1979. It follows two attempts by popes Pius IX and Leo XIII to beatify Christopher Columbus, both of which eventually fail. The second part of the novel, which is considerably longer than the other two, is a confession by Columbus, to be given to a Franciscan confessor. Raymond L. Williams sees the novel as \\"a fictional narrative about the life of Christopher Columbus and his fate as a historical figure. This novel is laden with allusions to Western literary tradition, from classical antiquity to modern Caribbean\\". James J. Pancrazio writes that \\"the confession is ironic because it never occurs; when the priest arrives to administer the Last Rites, Columbus, after painstakingly contemplating his life, decides that he has nothing to confess. In this regard, the mediation of guilt, not repentance, is what structures the confession.\\" Style =Baroque= The Baroque style dates back to the cultural period of the 17th and early 18th centuries. It is most often defined as \\"the dominant style of art in Europe between the Mannerist and Rococo eras, a style characterized by dynamic movement, overt emotion and self-confident rhetoric\\". Carpentier first became fascinated with this style in architecture and sculpture; however, he later describes el barroco as un esp√≠ritu, and not un estilo hist√≥rico (\\"a spirit, not an historical style\\"). Wakefield insists that this attitude towards the Baroque stemmed from Carpentier's background in both Europe and Latin America which allowed him to take on a superior front in the face of post-colonialism and ultimately have the literary upper-hand where he could use European style to tell the Latin American story. Carpentier developed his vision of the baroque in his early works before he described himself as a baroque writer. He experimented with the technique in several developmental stages: \\"first as a cultural style of aesthetic fascination, later as a literary device to create period ambiance, and finally as a weapon of postcolonial pride, defiance and one-upmanship\\". This style strongly presents itself when comparing works such as the early Ecue-Yamba-O to the celebrated El reino de este mundo, regarding Carpentier's use of more historically eloquent vocabulary in the latter, instead of the authentic language of the ethnically-inspired characters. Here he escapes the stereotype of \\"nativism\\" by incorporating European standards, but continues to achieve a sense of normalcy without the expected use of the colloquialisms which the protagonist Ti Noel would undoubtedly use. Kaup claims that Carpentier utilizes what is known as the \\"New World Baroque\\", since Latin America didn't come into contact with the Enlightenment or \\"European modernity\\". This contraconquista (counter conquest) allows the New World authors to experiment with new identities and the manners of expressing them. As such, Carpentier observed in his 1975 essay that \\"American Baroque develop[ed] along with criollo culture ...: the awareness of being Other, of being new, of being symbiotic, of being a criollo; and the criollo spirit is itself a Baroque spirit.\\" This criollo of the New World Baroque is often seen as the dominant style of European literature emerging as a subordinate literary construction in Latin America. =Influence of travel= Wakefield notes that Carpentier's diverse travels were motivated by his need to incorporate the sights he experienced into familiar descriptions within his novels. Carpentier's El reino de este mundo was inspired by his 1943 trip to Haiti, and Los pasos perdidos drew on his visit to Venezuela in 1949. Similarly, his travels to Guadeloupe and the Gulf of Sante Fe inspired El siglo de las luces, and Vera and Enrique's firsthand descriptions of Baku and Mexico in La consegraci√≥n de la primavera were drawn from Carpentier's trips to those places. =Surrealism= During his visit to France early in his life, Carpentier met and collaborated with many figures of the French Surrealist movement. Taken with Surrealist theory, Carpentier absorbed much of it from his contemporaries, mainly his friend and colleague, the Parisian journalist Robert Desnos. Striving to portray unlikely beauty, termed, \\"the third beauty\\", Surrealist theory embraced unique perspectives of the world. Within the Surrealist theory was the concept of Primitivism or a reverence for presiding folkloric tradition. Carpentier, inspired by French Surrealists, learned to view his Cuban home in this new light. He left France with a bursting sense of Cuban and Latin American pride and the artistic goal to capture what it meant to be both.

He is sixth in the line of succession to the Danish throne, following his elder brother, Crown Prince Frederik, and Frederik's four children. Early life HRH Prince Joachim was born on 7 June 1969 at Rigshospitalet, part of the Copenhagen University Hospital in Copenhagen, and was christened on 15 July 1969 in Aarhus Cathedral, the first member of the royal family to have been christened outside of Copenhagen. His godparents were his maternal aunt, Princess Benedikte of Denmark; his paternal uncle, Jean Baptiste de Laborde de Monpezat; the Crown Prince of Norway (later King Harald V); and Princess Christina of Sweden. Prince Joachim attended school as a private pupil from 1974 until 1976 at Amalienborg Palace and then from 1976 until 1982 at Krebs' Skole in Copenhagen. In the period 1982‚Äì1983 the Prince studied as a boarder at √âcole des Roches in Normandy, France. In 1986, Prince Joachim graduated from the √òregaard Gymnasium. In 1991‚Äì1993, he completed his studies in agrarian economics at Den Classenske Agerbrugskole N√¶sgaard. The Prince's first language is Danish, but he also speaks French, English and German.  Schackenborg  In 1993, Prince Joachim took over the estate of Schackenborg Castle in the town of M√∏gelt√∏nder, in Southern Jutland, having been granted the estate in the will of Count Hans Schack in 1978. The Prince and his first wife, now Alexandra, Countess of Frederiksborg, received 13 million Danish kroner collected by the people of Denmark as a national gift, reserved for restoration of the estate. The restoration was completed in 1999. The couple was divorced in 2005, whereupon Countess Alexandra moved with their two sons to Copenhagen, while Prince Joachim remained at Schackenborg. In 2007 The Danish Royal House announced the engagement of Prince Joachim and French native Marie Cavallier, whom the Prince had first met in 2004. The couple was married 24 May 2008 and resided at Schackenborg Castle for the following six years. In 2014, the estate was handed over to the Schackenborg Foundation, which consists of Prince Joachim, Bitten and Mads Clausens foundation, Ole Kirks Foundation, and Ecco Holding. Prince Joachim, Princess Marie and their children moved from the castle to Klampenborg north of Copenhagen, but the couple remains patrons of the Schackenborg foundation.  France  During the summer of 2019 Prince Joachim, Princess Marie and their two children moved to Paris, France, while the Prince had been admitted to the highest-ranking military educational program at √âcole Militaire by invitation from the French Minister of Defense. Prince Joachim graduated 26 June 2020, being the first Danish Officer to complete the two-part special education. Earlier in June 2020 the Danish Secretary of Defense appointed the Prince to Brigadier General due to his new acquired educational merits at √âcole Militaire. He was subsequently appointed to Military Attach√© at the Royal Danish Embassy in Paris, France for the next three years by the Danish Ministry of Defense. The Prince will commence his new position 1 September 2020. Prince Joachim will maintain his patronages and royal engagements when possible. Princess Marie will continue her work with her patronages and partner organizations as usual. On 24 July 2020, Prince Joachim was admitted to Toulouse University Hospital for surgery on a blood clot in his brain. His condition was described by the Palace as stable.

The couple had two sons: Prince Nikolai of Denmark and Prince Felix of Denmark. On 16 September 2004 the couple announced their separation, and divorced on 8 April 2005. Alexandra, Countess of Frederiksborg subsequently married again and lost the title Princess of Denmark. She continues to live and work in Denmark and the couple share joint custody of their sons. =Second marriage= On 3 October 2007 the Danish Royal Court announced that Prince Joachim had become engaged to Marie Cavallier, now Princess Marie of Denmark.

He initiated the Antisemitic League of France in 1889, and was the founder and editor of the newspaper La Libre Parole. After spending years of research, he synthesised three major types of antisemitism. The first type was traditional Catholic attitudes toward the alien \\"Christ killers\\" augmented by vehement antipathy toward the French Revolution. The second type was hostility toward capitalism. The third type was so-called scientific racism, based on the argument that races have fixed characteristics, and asserting that Jews have negative characteristics.Richard S. Levy, Antisemitism: A historical encyclopedia of prejudice and persecution (2005) 1:191 Drumont's biographer, Gr√©goire Kauffmann, places Drumont within the counter-revolutionary tradition of Louis Veuillot, Antoine Blanc de Saint-Bonnet, and anti-modern Catholicism. Socialist leader Jean Jaur√®s stated that \\"all the ideas and arguments of Drumont were taken from certain clerical opponents of the French Revolution. Early life Drumont was born in Paris in 1844 to a family of porcelain- painters from Lille. He lost his father at the age of seventeen, and had to care for himself and earn his own livelihood from then onwards.Deutsch, Gotthard, and A.M. Friedenberg. \\"DRUMONT, EDOUARD ADOLPHE, JewishEncyclopedia.com (accessed 9 November 2007). Public career He first worked in government service, and later became a contributor to the press and was the author of a number of works, of which Mon vieux Paris (1879) was awarded by the French Academy. He also worked for Louis Veuillot's L'Univers. Drumont's 1886 book, La France juive (Jewish France), attacked the role of Jews in France and argued for their exclusion from society. In 1892, Drumont initiated the newspaper the La Libre Parole which became known for intense antisemitism. Gaston M√©ry was soon made editor in chief due to his skill in exploiting scandalous affairs and his daring invective. The newspaper took \\"France for the French\\" as its motto. The newspaper was sceptical of L√©o Taxil's anti-Catholic Diana Vaughan hoax before Taxil admitted it in 1897. For the French legislative election of May 1898, the antisemitic activist Max R√©gis endorsed Drumont before this election from Algiers. On 8 May 1898, √âdouard Drumont was elected triumphantly with 11,557 votes against 2,328 and 1,741 for his opponents. Of six Algerian national deputies, four were elected on the platform of Regis's Anti-Jewish League. Drumont represented Algiers in the Chamber of Deputies from 1898 to 1902. He was sued for accusing a parliamentary deputy of having accepted a bribe from the wealthy Jewish banker √âdouard Alphonse de Rothschild to pass a piece of legislation the banker wanted. Drumont had many devotees.Drumont's Jewish disciple, 2 June 2008 He exploited the Panama Company scandalArendt, Hannah. The Origins of Totalitarianism. Harvest Books, 1973; , pp. 95-99. and reached the maximum of his notoriety during the Dreyfus Affair, in which he was the most strident of Alfred Dreyfus' accusers. For his anti-Panama articles, Drumont was condemned to three months' imprisonment. In 1893, he was an unsuccessful candidate for the representation of Amiens; the next year he retired to Brussels. The Dreyfus affair helped him to regain popularity, and in 1898, he returned to France and was elected deputy for the first division of Algiers, but was defeated as a candidate for re-election in April‚ÄìMay 1902.

The novels are examples of a picaresque novel genre, which was previously rare in Russian literature.\\"–û—Å—Ç–∞–ø –ë–µ–Ω–¥–µ—Ä\\", Radio Liberty, transcript of a talk from cycle \\"Heroes of the Time\\", host:–ü–µ—Ç—Ä –í–∞–π–ª—å, guests: culturologist –ú–∞—Ä–∏—ç—Ç—Ç–∞ –ß—É–¥–∞–∫–æ–≤–∞ and actors Archil Gomiashvili (Bender ‚Äì 1971) and Sergey Yursky (Bender ‚Äì 1993) Bender is an attractive, resourceful crook, full of energy while operating within the law (\\"Bender knew 400 relatively legal ways to make the population part with their money.\\"); his description as \\"The Great Combinator\\" became a catch phrase in the Russian language. His exploits have been enjoyed by readers throughout the Soviet times and in modern Russia. In post-Soviet times Bender's character was elevated from the status of a con man to that of an entrepreneur. His statues may be found in several cities, and a commemorative plaque was set in Odessa, the city of his birth.Olga Fedina, pp. 36‚Äì38. Appearances A monument to The Twelve Chairs in Odessa The Twelve Chairs was released in January 1928. In the first novel, Ostap Bender searches for a stash of diamonds hidden in one of the twelve eponymous chairs. The action takes place in the Soviet Union in 1927 during the New Economic Policy era. At the end of the novel, Bender is killed by his partner, Ippolit Matveyevich Vorobianinov, who does not want to share the treasure when it seems like they are about to reach their goal. Ilf and Petrov retconned the character's death away in 1931 in the sequel novel The Little Golden Calf, where Bender claimed that \\"surgeons barely saved my life\\". This book provided an extended satire on certain elements of Soviet life. Here, Bender follows Soviet underground multi-millionaire Koreiko, hoping to acquire some of his riches and thus amass a fortune. Bender gets his money, but soon discovers he cannot spend it in the USSR. He proceeds to lose it as he attempts to flee the country by crossing the border into Romania. Film-makers have produced a number of screen adaptations of the novels; see The Twelve Chairs adaptations and The Little Golden Calf adaptations. Character Ostap Bender's origins are mysterious; he mentions only that his father was \\"a Turkish subject\\",quotes: *–ò–∑ —Å–≤–æ–µ–π –±–∏–æ–≥—Ä–∞—Ñ–∏–∏ –æ–Ω –æ–±—ã—á–Ω–æ —Å–æ–æ–±—â–∞–ª —Ç–æ–ª—å–∫–æ –æ–¥–Ω—É –ø–æ–¥—Ä–æ–±–Ω–æ—Å—Ç—å: ¬´–ú–æ–π –ø–∞–ø–∞, ‚Äî –≥–æ–≤–æ—Ä–∏–ª –æ–Ω, ‚Äî –±—ã–ª —Ç—É—Ä–µ—Ü–∫–æ-–ø–æ–¥–¥–∞–Ω–Ω—ã–π¬ª *–ù–µ –æ—Å–∫–æ—Ä–±–ª—è–π—Ç–µ –º–µ–Ω—è, ‚Äî –∫—Ä–æ—Ç–∫–æ –∑–∞–º–µ—Ç–∏–ª –ë–µ–Ω–¥–µ—Ä. ‚Äî –Ø —Å—ã–Ω —Ç—É—Ä–µ—Ü–∫–æ-–ø–æ–¥–¥–∞–Ω–Ω–æ–≥–æ –∏, —Å–ª–µ–¥–æ–≤–∞—Ç–µ–ª—å–Ω–æ, –ø–æ—Ç–æ–º–æ–∫ —è–Ω—ã—á–∞—Ä–æ–≤. his mother was \\"a Countess and received unearned incomes\\" and that his full name is Ostap-Sulayman-Berta-Maria-Bender- Bey (–û—Å—Ç–∞–ø-–°—É–ª–µ–π–º–∞–Ω-–ë–µ—Ä—Ç–∞-–ú–∞—Ä–∏—è-–ë–µ–Ω–¥–µ—Ä-–ë–µ–π). In the comments to the Complete Works of Ilf and Petrov by M. Odessky and D. Feldman, this phrase is explained as a hint to his supposed Jewish origin from a port city in Novorossiya, most probably Odessa, where many Jews claimed Turkish citizenship to evade discrimination and conscription for military service.\\"–ò–ª—å—è –ò–ª—å—Ñ, –ï–≤–≥–µ–Ω–∏–π –ü–µ—Ç—Ä–æ–≤. –î–≤–µ–Ω–∞–¥—Ü–∞—Ç—å —Å—Ç—É–ª—å–µ–≤. \\"–í–∞–≥—Ä–∏—É—Å\\", –ú., 2003\\" Some of them indeed held Turkish citizenship, such as Julius Martov.

The city of Bender and the Danube river are historically and geographically close to both the large regional city of Odessa and the former Ottoman (Turkish) Empire. Bender dreams of travelling to Rio de Janeiro, \\"the city of his dreams\\", while admitting the futility of that obsession. There were a number of possible prototypes for Bender, most famously Ostap (Osip) Shor (1899‚Äì1978), a friend of the authors who spent his youth in Odessa gaining money as a con man and then‚Äîas a Cheka inspector. He was a good story-teller, and many of his tales inspired the adventures of Ostap Bender.\\"The Great Combinator was Taken for a Ukrainian Nationalist\\", Komsomolskaya Pravda (Ukrainian edition), May 30, 2008 \\"The Hero Enters (Part II)\\" Valentin Kataev who came up with the idea for the novel (which, in turn, is dedicated to him) is named as another prototype; he also led an adventurous life and was known as a literary hoaxer, adding many original touches to the biography of Osip Shor whom he saw as fitting the readers' expectations of a \\"real-life combinator\\".Sergei Belyakov. Lonely Sail of Ostap Bender from Novy Mir ‚Ññ 12, 2005 (in Russian) Another suggested influence was the character of Alexander Ametistov from Mikhail Bulgakov's play Zoyka's Flat that had been written and staged in 1926, before the work on The Twelve Chairs was even started. Also an elegant con man with many names and occupations, he is seen as a direct inspiration by a number of modern researches, to the point that some of them believe that both novels were ghostwritten by Bulgakov.Irina Amlinsky (2013). 12 Chairs from Mikhail Bulgakov. ‚Äì Berlin: Kirschner Verlag, 328 pages Asya Kramer. So What Should We Do With All This? article from Russian Bazaar ‚Ññ27, July 2015 (in Russian)What's Necessary to Know about Mikhail Bulgakov by Dmitry Galkovsky, 1 September 2016 (in Russian) =Bender's leadership= The entrepreneurial abilities of Bender attracted attention of researchers in management. Parallels have been drawn of Bender's schemes with failures of businesses in early post-Soviet Russia, a period compared to that of NEP when Bender operated.Kari Ketola, Timo Vihavainen, \\"Changing Russia?: History, Culture and Business\\", p. 85Rubinsky, Shekshnya Bender is educated and has an analytical mind; is full of energy; in the case of a failure keeps his optimism and has an ability to reassess the situation; has an empathy towards his subordinates, opponents and \\"marks\\"; has exceptional organizational skills, even when limited by scarce resources. While Bender is endowed with many traits of a charismatic leader, it was concluded that the major reason of his failures was lack of clear understanding of his own goals and needs, and short-term perspective. A serious drawback of Bender as a leader is his paternalism. Also, while he is aware of the drawbacks of his companions, he puts no efforts into their betterment. While at times he can be a motivational speaker, he did not care about the long-term motivation of his subordinates; instead, he preferred to manipulate or simply force them. Cultural influence A chapter in The Little Golden Calf was called \\"The Great Combinator\\" (\\"–í–µ–ª–∏–∫–∏–π –∫–æ–º–±–∏–Ω–∞—Ç–æ—Ä\\", \\"The Great Schemer\\").

She served as a commissioned ship for 20 months. Her keel was laid down as a Type C2-S-AJ3 ship on 13 June 1944 (as MC hull 1392), under Maritime Commission contract, by North Carolina Shipbuilding Company of Wilmington, North Carolina. She was launched on 18 August 1944, sponsored by Mrs. C. L. Griffin and acquired by the Navy from the War Shipping Administration on a bareboat charter; and was commissioned on 29 September 1944 with Commander Frederick O. Goldsmith in command. Service history =World War II, 1944-1945= Starr completed fitting out at Charleston, South Carolina, and sailed on 31 October for the Chesapeake Bay on her shakedown cruise. After loading cargo, she stood out of Norfolk, Virginia, on 27 November and proceeded, via the Panama Canal, to the Pacific. She arrived at Pearl Harbor on 18 December 1944 and remained there until after Christmas. Starr participated in amphibious landing exercises during the first week of January and then entered Kahului Harbor, Maui, for combat loading. Starr joined a large convoy and sailed west on 27 January, stopping at Eniwetok for two days, before proceeding to Saipan, where the Iwo Jima assault force was staging. The force cleared Tanapag Harbor on 16 February. At 0640 three days later, Starr launched her boats against the Iwo Jima beaches. The attack cargo ship had multiple duties: she was a receiving ship for wounded; an ammunition ship for ; and she had a priority cargo of vehicles which were to be delivered only when requested and then, as quickly as possible. She waited until 25 February to begin discharging her cargo and finished on 5 March. She then got underway for Leyte. Starr loaded combat cargo from 9 to 27 March and joined a convoy for the Ryukyu Islands. On 1 April, her first boats hit the water at 0615; and they soon joined their prearranged waves for hitting the Okinawa beaches. At 0420 on 9 April the ship was raked from stem to stern by an explosion. At first, it was thought that she had been torpedoed; but it was soon learned that she had been attacked by a Japanese suicide boat. The suicide boat had exploded as it contacted one of a cluster of Starrs landing craft that were moored alongside. The explosion was sufficiently removed from the side of the ship, and the water absorbed the shock so Starr suffered little damage. Starr sailed for Guam on 10 April with a convoy and was routed onward to Pearl Harbor. She arrived there on 26 April and was notified that she was to return to the West Coast for overhaul. She arrived at San Pedro, California, on 5 May; and repairs were begun immediately. When they were completed, the ship participated in an amphibious exercise and then loaded cargo at San Francisco, California, to be delivered to Guam. She sailed on 24 June and arrived at Guam on 11 July. On 20 July, she steamed to Pearl Harbor for another load of cargo for Guam. Starr was several days out of Guam when word was received that hostilities with Japan had ended. =Post-war activities, 1945-1946= After discharging her cargo at Guam, the ship was routed to the Philippines on 2 September; she arrived at Leyte on 5 September. Starr operated in the Philippines until 29 November when she got underway for China and arrived at Tsingtao on 4 December 1945. Starr sailed from China to Sasebo, Japan, and thence to Vladivostok. She arrived there on 2 January 1946, unloaded her cargo, and returned to Sasebo where she received orders to proceed, via San Diego, to San Francisco. She remained at San Francisco from 9 to 18 March and then got underway for Hampton Roads. Starr arrived at Norfolk, Virginia, on 4 April 1946; was decommissioned on 31 May 1946, and was returned to the War Shipping Administration on 1 June 1946. She was struck from the Naval Vessel Register on 19 June 1946. =In commercial service, 1947-1970= As a civilian vessel, Starr was sold on 3 December 1947 to Pacific Far East Lines, which changed her name to SS India Bear. In April 1957 she was sold to Trans-Pacific Company, who sold her in turn on 11 November 1959 to Dorama, Incorporated. On 10 July 1959 she was named Lanakila, and on 27 May 1960 she was sold to Long Island Tankers Corporation which renamed her India Bear. On 7 February 1961 she was again sold to Pacific Far East Line. Finally, on 9 September 1970 she was sold to Sing Cheng Yung Iron & Steel Company for scrapping in Taiwan. Awards Starr received two battle stars for World War II service.

It is now part of the RATP's RER line B, though the name is still used informally. The line originally opened in 1846, built under the supervision of chief engineer Jean-Claude-R√©publicain Arnoux. It ran from a Paris terminal near the present-day metro station of Denfert Rochereau through Bourg-la-Reine - where a branch to Robinson via Sceaux (actually the original main line of 1846) originates - Massy Palaiseau (present-day TGV connection), and Saint-R√©my-l√®s-Chevreuse to Limours. Plans to extend it to Chartres never bore fruit, as competing lines made the project superfluous. It was originally built with a track gauge of and very tight bends in the area around Sceaux: Arnoux had devised a new articulation system that allowed train wheels to turn, the (\\"Arnoux system\\"), and the line was to test his prototypes. Shortly after opening, the bogie was invented in the United States, rendering Arnoux's system pointlessly complicated. The section of track from Bourg-La-Reine to Sceaux was rebuilt to the current terminus of Robinson. For much of its history, the line operated in splendid isolation from other railways. Most notably, the line was extended from its original Denfert terminus further into Paris to a terminus station built underground at Luxembourg between 1889 and 1895. Perhaps because of this deep penetration into the city center, the line was acquired by the Chemin de Fer M√©tropolitain de Paris (CMP) (see Paris Metro) in 1937. The CMP immediately proceeded to upgrade its new property, electrifying it with an overhead system down to Saint R√©my-les-Chevreuse in 1938. The outlying section to Limours, where traffic was minimal, was never electrified and closed to passengers on May 15, 1939. From this time on it was generally considered as a metro line, even though it ran on different gauge and with different rolling stock. Maps of the metro network show it along with the numbered lines with an 'S'. The line was operated as a separate division of the CMP and its descendant RATP, with dedicated rolling stock (other CMP lines used third-rail electrification), until 1977, when it was incorporated into the RER as the southern part of its new line B.

(; ) is a Chinese multinational technology company headquartered in Shenzhen, Guangdong. It designs, develops, and sells telecommunications equipment and consumer electronics (mainly smartphones). The company was founded in 1987 by Ren Zhengfei, a former Deputy Regimental Chief in the People's Liberation Army. Initially focused on manufacturing phone switches, Huawei has expanded its business to include building telecommunications networks, providing operational and consulting services and equipment to enterprises inside and outside of China, and manufacturing communications devices for the consumer market. Huawei has over 194,000 employees . Huawei has deployed its products and services in more than 170 countries. It overtook Ericsson in 2012 as the largest telecommunications equipment manufacturer in the world, and overtook Apple in 2018 as the second- largest manufacturer of smartphones in the world, behind Samsung Electronics. In December 2019, Huawei reported that its annual revenue had risen to $121.72 billion US dollars in 2019. Although successful internationally, Huawei has faced difficulties in some markets, due to claims of undue state support, links to the People's Liberation Army, and cybersecurity concerns‚Äîprimarily from the United States government‚Äîthat Huawei's infrastructure equipment may enable surveillance by the Chinese government. With the development of 5G wireless networks, there have been calls from the U.S. and its allies to not do any kind of business with Huawei or other Chinese telecommunications companies such as ZTE. Huawei has argued that its products posed \\"no greater cybersecurity risk\\" than those of any other vendor and that there is no evidence of the U.S. espionage claims. Questions regarding Huawei's ownership and control as well as concerns regarding the extent of state support also remain. Huawei has also been accused of assisting in the surveillance and mass detention of Uyghurs in the Xinjiang re-education camps, which have resulted in sanctions by the United States Department of State. In the midst of an ongoing trade war between China and the United States, Huawei was restricted from doing commerce with U.S. companies due to alleged previous willful violations of U.S. sanctions against Iran. On 29 June 2019, U.S. President Donald Trump reached an agreement to resume trade talks with China and announced that he would ease the aforementioned sanctions on Huawei. Huawei cut 600 jobs at its Santa Clara research center in June, and in December 2019 founder Ren Zhengfei said it was moving the center to Canada because the restrictions would block them from interacting with US employees. In July 2020, Huawei surpassed Samsung and Apple to become the leading smartphone mobile brand in the world for the first time primarily due to a drop in Samsung's global sales in the second quarter of 2020 owing to the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic. Name According to the company founder Ren Zhengfei, the name Huawei comes from a slogan he saw on a wall, Zhonghua youwei meaning \\"China has promise\\" (‰∏≠ÂçéÊúâ‰∏∫, Zh≈çnghu√° y«íuw√©i), when he was starting up the company and needed a name. Zhonghua or Hua means China, while youwei means \\"promising/to show promise\\". Huawei has also been translated as \\"splendid achievement\\" or \\"China is able\\" which are possible readings to the name. In Chinese pinyin, the name is Hu√°w√©i, and pronounced in Mandarin Chinese; in Cantonese, the name is transliterated with Jyutping as Waa4-wai4 and pronounced . However, pronunciation of Huawei by non-Chinese varies in other countries, for example \\"Hoe-ah-wei\\" in Belgium and the Netherlands. The company had considered changing the name in English as it was concerned that non-Chinese may find the name hard to pronounce, but decided to keep the name, and launched a name recognition campaign instead to encourage a pronunciation closer to \\"Wah-Way\\" using the words \\"Wow Way\\". History =Early years= During the 1980s, the Chinese government tried to modernize the country's underdeveloped telecommunications infrastructure. A core component of the telecommunications network was telephone exchange switches, and in the late 1980s, several Chinese research groups endeavored to acquire and develop the technology, usually through joint ventures with foreign companies. Ren Zhengfei, a former deputy director of the People's Liberation Army engineering corps, founded Huawei in 1987 in Shenzhen. The company reports that it had RMB 21,000 in registered capital at the time of its founding (about $5,000 at the time). Ren sought to reverse engineer foreign technologies with local researchers. At a time when all of China's telecommunications technology was imported from abroad, Ren hoped to build a domestic Chinese telecommunication company that could compete with, and ultimately replace, foreign competitors.Peilei Fan, \\"Catching Up through Developing Innovation Capacity: Evidence from China's Telecom Equipment Industry,\\" Technovation 26 (2006): 359‚Äì368 During its first several years the company's business model consisted mainly of reselling private branch exchange (PBX) switches imported from Hong Kong. Meanwhile, it was reverse-engineering imported switches and investing heavily in research and development to manufacture its own technologies. By 1990 the company had approximately 600 R&D; staff and began its own independent commercialization of PBX switches targeting hotels and small enterprises. The company's first major breakthrough came in 1993 when it launched its C&C08; program controlled telephone switch. It was by far the most powerful switch available in China at the time. By initially deploying in small cities and rural areas and placing emphasis on service and customizability, the company gained market share and made its way into the mainstream market. Huawei also won a key contract to build the first national telecommunications network for the People's Liberation Army, a deal one employee described as \\"small in terms of our overall business, but large in terms of our relationships\\". In 1994, founder Ren Zhengfei had a meeting with Party general secretary Jiang Zemin, telling him that \\"switching equipment technology was related to national security, and that a nation that did not have its own switching equipment was like one that lacked its own military.\\" Jiang reportedly agreed with this assessment. In the 1990s Canadian telecom giant Nortel outsourced production of their entire product line to Huawei. They subsequently outsourced much of their product engineering to Huawei as well. Another major turning point for the company came in 1996 when the government in Beijing adopted an explicit policy of supporting domestic telecommunications manufacturers and restricting access to foreign competitors. Huawei was promoted by both the government and the military as a national champion, and established new research and development offices. =Foreign expansion= In 1997, Huawei won a contract to provide fixed-line network products to Hong Kong company Hutchison Whampoa. Later that year, Huawei launched its wireless GSM-based products and eventually expanded to offer CDMA and UMTS. In 1999, the company opened a research and development (R&D;) center in Bangalore, India to develop a wide range of telecom software. In May 2003, Huawei partnered with 3Com on a joint venture known as H3C, which was focused on enterprise networking equipment. It marked 3Com's re-entrance into the high-end core routers and switch market, after having abandoned it in 2000 to focus on other businesses. 3Com bought out Huawei's share of the venture in 2006 for US$882 million. In 2004, Huawei signed a $10 billion credit line with the China Development Bank (CDB) to provide low-cost financing to customers buying its telecommunications equipment to support its sales outside of China. This line of credit was tripled to $30 billion in 2009. In 2005, Huawei's foreign contract orders exceeded its domestic sales for the first time. Huawei signed a Global Framework Agreement with Vodafone. This agreement marked the first time a telecommunications equipment supplier from China had received Approved Supplier status from Vodafone Global Supply Chain. Huawei also signed a contract with British Telecom (BT) for the deployment of its multi-service access network (MSAN) and Transmission equipment for BT's 21st Century Network (21CN). In 2007, Huawei began a joint venture with U.S. security software vendor Symantec Corporation, known as Huawei Symantec, which aimed to provide end-to-end solutions for network data storage and security. Huawei bought out Symantec's share in the venture in 2012, with The New York Times noting that Symantec had fears that the partnership \\"would prevent it from obtaining United States government classified information about cyberthreats\\". In May 2008, Australian carrier Optus announced that it would establish a technology research facility with Huawei in Sydney. In October 2008, Huawei reached an agreement to contribute to a new GSM-based HSPA+ network being deployed jointly by Canadian carriers Bell Mobility and Telus Mobility, joined by Nokia Siemens Networks. Huawei delivered one of the world's first LTE/EPC commercial networks for TeliaSonera in Oslo, Norway in 2009. In July 2010, Huawei was included in the Global Fortune 500 2010 list published by the U.S. magazine Fortune for the first time, on the strength of annual sales of US$21.8 billion and net profit of US$2.67 billion. In October 2012, it was announced that Huawei would move its UK headquarters to Green Park, Reading, Berkshire. In September 2017, Huawei created a Narrowband IoT city-aware network using a \\"one network, one platform, N applications\\" construction model utilizing IoT, cloud computing, big data, and other next-generation information and communications technology, it also aims to be one of the world's five largest cloud players in the near future. In April 2019, Huawei established Huawei Malaysia Global Training Centre (MGTC) at Cyberjaya, Malaysia, which is Huawei's first training center outside of China. =Recent performance= IFA 2018 in Berlin As of the end of 2018, Huawei sold 200 million smartphones. They reported that strong consumer demand for premium range smart phones helped the company reach consumer sales in excess of $52 billion in 2018. Huawei announced worldwide revenues of $105.1 billion for 2018, with a net profit of $8.7 billion. Huawei's Q1 2019 revenues were up 39% year-over-year, at US$26.76 billion. In 2019, Huawei reported revenue of US$122 billion. During the second quarter 2020, Huawei became the world's top smartphone seller, overtaking Samsung for the first time. Corporate affairs Huawei classifies itself as a \\"collective\\" entity and prior to 2019 did not refer to itself as a private company. Richard McGregor, author of The Party: The Secret World of China's Communist Rulers, said that this is \\"a definitional distinction that has been essential to the company's receipt of state support at crucial points in its development\\". McGregor argued that \\"Huawei's status as a genuine collective is doubtful.\\" Huawei's position has shifted in 2019 when, Dr. Song Liuping, Huawei's chief legal officer, commented on the US government ban, said: \\"Politicians in the US are using the strength of an entire nation to come after a private company.\\" (emphasis added). =Leadership= Ren Zhengfei is the founder and CEO of Huawei and has the power to veto any decisions made by the board of directors. Board of Directors Huawei disclosed its list of board of directors for the first time in 2010. Liang Hua is the current chair of the board. , the members of the board are Liang Hua, Guo Ping, Xu Zhijun, Hu Houkun, Meng Wanzhou (CFO and deputy chairwoman, currently out on bail in Vancouver, after being arrested there on December 1, 2018, after an extradition request of US authorities on suspicion of Iran sanctions evasion), Ding Yun, Yu Chengdong, Wang Tao, Xu Wenwei, Shen-Han Chiu, Chen Lifang, Peng Zhongyang, He Tingbo, Li Yingtao, Ren Zhengfei, Yao Fuhai, Tao Jingwen, and Yan Lida. Executives Guo Ping is the Chairman of Huawei Device, Huawei's mobile phone division. Huawei's Chief Ethics & Compliance Officer is Zhou Daiqi who is also Huawei's Communist Party Committee Secretary. Their Chief legal officer is Song Liuping. =Ownership= Huawei claims it is an employee-owned company, but it remains a point of dispute. Ren Zhengfei retains approximately 1 percent of the shares of Huawei's holding company, Huawei Investment & Holding, with the remainder of the shares held by a trade union committee (not a trade union per se, and the internal governance procedures of this committee, its members, its leaders or how they are selected all remain undisclosed to the public) that is claimed to be representative of Huawei's employee shareholders. The company's trade union committee is registered with and pay dues to the Shenzhen federation of the All-China Federation of Trade Unions, which is controlled by the Chinese Communist Party. This is also due to a limitation in Chinese law preventing limited liability companies from having more than 50 shareholders. About half of Huawei staff participate in this scheme (foreign employees are not eligible), and hold what the company calls \\"virtual restricted shares\\". These shares are non-tradable and are allocated to reward performance. When employees leave Huawei, their shares revert to the company, which compensates them for their holding. Although employee shareholders receive dividends, their shares do not entitle them to any direct influence in management decisions, but enables them to vote for members of the 115-person Representatives‚Äô Commission from a pre-selected list of candidates. The Representatives‚Äô Commission selects Huawei Holding's Board of Directors and Board of Supervisors. Scholars have found that, after a few stages of historical morphing, employees do not own a part of Huawei through their ‚Äúshares‚Äù. Instead, the ‚Äúvirtual stock is a contract right, not a property right; it gives the holder no voting power in either Huawei Tech or Huawei Holding, cannot be transferred, and is cancelled when the employee leaves the firm, subject to a redemption payment from Huawei Holding TUC at a low fixed price‚Äù. The same scholars added, \\"given the public nature of trade unions in China, if the ownership stake of the trade union committee is genuine, and if the trade union and its committee function as trade unions generally function in China, then Huawei may be deemed effectively state-owned.\\" In September 2019 Huawei filed a defamation lawsuit against a French researcher and a television show which had hosted her. The researcher, with the Foundation for Strategic Research, had noted that Ren Zhengfei was a former PLA member and that Huawei functions as an arm of the Chinese government. This was the first time Huawei had sued a researcher for defamation for stating common opinions and recognized facts.

Their portfolio of phones includes both high-end smartphones, its Huawei Mate series and Huawei P series, and cheaper handsets that fall under its Honor brand. File:HUAWEI Ascend P6.jpgHuawei Ascend P6 File:Huawei Honor 6 MWC 2015.jpgHuawei Honor 6 File:Huawei Mate 7.jpgHuawei Mate 7 History of Huawei phones The Huawei P30 with rear triple-lens Leica optics camera In July 2003, Huawei established their handset department and by 2004, Huawei shipped their first phone, the C300. The U626 was Huawei's first 3G phone in June 2005 and in 2006, Huawei launched the first Vodafone-branded 3G handset, the V710. The U8220 was Huawei's first Android smartphone and was unveiled in MWC 2009. At CES 2012, Huawei introduced the Ascend range starting with the Ascend P1 S. At MWC 2012, Huawei launched the Ascend D1. In September 2012, Huawei launched their first 4G ready phone, the Ascend P1 LTE. At CES 2013, Huawei launched the Ascend D2 and the Ascend Mate. At MWC 2013, the Ascend P2 was launched as the world's first LTE Cat4 smartphone. In June 2013, Huawei launched the Ascend P6 and in December 2013, Huawei introduced Honor as a subsidiary independent brand in China. At CES 2014, Huawei launched the Ascend Mate2 4G in 2014 and at MWC 2014, Huawei launched the MediaPad X1 tablet and Ascend G6 4G smartphone. Other launched in 2014 included the Ascend P7 in May 2014, the Ascend Mate7, the Ascend G7 and the Ascend P7 Sapphire Edition as China's first 4G smartphone with a sapphire screen. In January 2015, Huawei discontinued the \\"Ascend\\" brand for its flagship phones, and launched the new P series with the Huawei P8. Huawei also partnered with Google to build the Nexus 6P in 2015. The current models in the P and Mate lines, the Mate 30, Mate 30 Pro, Mate 30 5G, Mate 30 Pro 5G P30, P30 Pro, Mate 20, Mate 20 Pro and Mate 20 X were released in 2018 and 2019. =Laptops= thumb In 2016, Huawei entered the laptop markets with the release of its Huawei MateBook series of laptops. They have continued to release laptop models in this series into 2020 with their most recent models being the MateBook X Pro and Matebook 13 2020. =Tablets= The HUAWEI MatePad Pro, launched in November 2019. Huawei is number one in the Chinese tablet market and number two globally as of 4Q 2019. =Wearables= The Huawei Watch is an Android Wear-based smartwatch developed by Huawei. It was announced at 2015 Mobile World Congress on March 1, 2015, and was released at Internationale Funkausstellung Berlin on September 2, 2015. It is the first smartwatch produced by Huawei. Their latest watch, the Huawei Watch GT 2e, was launched in India in May, 2020. =Software= EMUI (Emotion User Interface) Emotion UI (EMUI) is a ROM/OS developed by Huawei Technologies Co. Ltd. and based on Google's Android Open Source Project (AOSP). EMUI is pre-installed on most Huawei Smartphone devices and its subsidiaries the Honor series. The latest version of EMUI is EMUI 10. Harmony OS On 9 August 2019, Huawei officially unveiled Harmony OS at its inaugural developers' conference in Dongguan. Huawei described Harmony as a free, microkernel-based distributed operating system for various types of hardware, with faster inter-process communication than QNX or Google's \\"Fuchsia\\" microkernel, and real-time resource allocation. The ARK compiler can be used to port Android APK packages to the OS. Huawei stated that developers would be able to \\"flexibly\\" deploy Harmony OS software across various device categories; the company focused primarily on IoT devices, including \\"smart displays\\", wearable devices, and in-car entertainment systems, and did not explicitly position Harmony OS as a mobile OS. Huawei Mobile Services (HMS) Huawei Mobile Services (HMS) is Huawei's app store created as a competitor to Google's Android Play Store. As of December, 2019 it was in version 4.0 and as of January 16, 2020 the company reports it has signed up 55,000 apps using its HMS Core software. Competitive position Huawei Technologies Co. Ltd. is the world's largest telecom equipment maker and China's largest telephone-network equipment maker. With 3,442 patents, Huawei became the world's No. 1 applicant for international patents in 2014. =R&D; centers= It has 21 R&D; institutes in countries including China, the United States,Some of Huawei's US operations include FutureWei Technologies Inc. (in at least Santa Clara CA, Plano TX, and Bridgetwater NJ), which is a wholly owned subsidiary of Huawei North America. Canada, the United Kingdom, Pakistan, Finland, France, Belgium, Germany, Colombia, Sweden, Ireland, India, Russia, Israel, and Turkey. Huawei is considering opening a new research and development (R&D;) center in Russia (2019/2020), which would be the third in the country after the Moscow and St. Petersburg R&D; centers. Huawei also announced plans (November 2018) to open an R&D; center in the French city of Grenoble, which would be mainly focused on smartphone sensors and parallel computing software development. The new R&D; team in Grenoble was expected to grow to 30 researchers by 2020, said the company. The company said that this new addition brought to five the number of its R&D; teams in the country: two were located in Sophia Antipolis and Paris, researching image processing and design, while the other two existing teams were based at Huawei's facilities in Boulogne-Billancourt, working on algorithms and mobile and 5G standards. The technology giant also intended to open two new research centers in Z√ºrich and Lausanne, Switzerland. Huawei at the time employed around 350 people in Switzerland. Huawei also funds research partnerships with universities such as the University of British Columbia, the University of Waterloo, the University of Western Ontario, the University of Guelph, and Universit√© Laval. Criticism and controversies  Huawei has faced criticism for various aspects of its operations, with its most prominent controversies having involved U.S. allegations of its products containing backdoors for Chinese government espionage‚Äîconsistent with domestic laws requiring Chinese citizens and companies to cooperate with state intelligence when warranted. Huawei executives have consistently denied these allegations, having stated that the company has never received any requests by the Chinese government to introduce backdoors in its equipment, would refuse to do so, and that Chinese law did not compel them to do so. = Allegations of espionage = Huawei has been at the center of espionage allegations over Chinese 5G network equipment. In 2018, the United States passed a defense funding bill that contained a passage barring the federal government from doing business with Huawei, ZTE, and several Chinese vendors of surveillance products, due to security concerns. The Chinese government has threatened economic retaliation against countries that block Huawei's market access. German and British intelligence agencies have pushed back against the US' allegations, stating that after examining Huawei's 5G hardware and accompanying source code, they have found no evidence of malevolence and that a ban would therefore be unwarranted. Additionally, the head of Britain's National Cyber Security Centre (the information security arm of GCHQ) stated that the US has not managed to provide the UK with any proof of its allegations against Huawei. However, on July 14, 2020 the UK government announced a ban on the use of company's 5G network equipment, citing security concerns. In October 2020, the Defence Select Committee in the UK announced that it found evidence of Huawei's collusion with the Chinese state and that it supported accelerated purging of Huawei equipment from Britain's telecom infrastructure by 2025. Following the 2020 China‚ÄìIndia skirmishes, India announced that Huawei would be blocked from participating in the country's 5G network for national security reasons. On 28 August 2020, French President Emmanuel Macron assured China that it did not ban Huawei products from participating in its fifth-generation mobile roll-out, but favored European providers for security reasons. The head of the France's cybersecurity agency also stated that it has granted time-limited waivers on 5G for wireless operators that use Huawei products, a decision that likely started a ‚Äúphasing out‚Äù of the company's products.  Exploitable backdoors  In February 2020, US government officials claimed that Huawei has had the ability to covertly exploit backdoors intended for law enforcement officials in carrier equipment like antennas and routers since 2009. = Allegations of fraud and conspiracy to subvert sanctions against Iran = In December 2012, Reuters reported that \\"deep links\\" existed as early as 2010 between Huawei through Meng Wanzhou (who was then CFO of the firm) and an Iranian telecom importer named Skycom. The US had long-standing sanctions on Iran, including against the importation of US technology goods into Iran. On August 22, 2018, a New York court issued an arrest warrant for Meng to stand trial in the United States. On 1 December 2018, Meng was arrested in Canada at the request of U.S. authorities. She faced extradition to the United States on charges of violating the sanctions regime. On 28 January 2019, U.S. federal prosecutors formally indicted Meng and Huawei with 13 counts of bank and wire fraud (in order to mask the sale that is illegal under sanctions of U.S. technology to Iran), obstruction of justice, and misappropriating trade secrets. The Department also filed a formal extradition request for Meng with Canadian authorities that same day. Huawei responded to the charges and said that it \\"denies that it or its subsidiary or affiliate have committed any of the asserted violations\\", as well as asserted Meng was similarly innocent. The China Ministry of Industry and Information Technology believed the charges brought on by the United States were \\"unfair\\". The case for extradition of Meng to the US to face charges is ongoing as of May, 2020 with the B.C. Supreme Court judge on May 27, 2020 ruling that extradition proceedings against the Huawei executive should proceed, denying the claim of double criminality brought by Meng's defense team. = Allegations of intellectual property theft = Huawei has been accused of various instances of intellectual property theft against parties such as Nortel, Cisco Systems, and T-Mobile US (where a Huawei employee had photographed a robotic arm used to stress-test smartphones and taken a fingertip from the robot). The management of the company claims the US government persecutes it because Huawei's expansion can affect American business interests. In August 2018, a Texas court found that Huawei had infringed on patents held by the American firm PanOptis. Huawei later settled the case. In November 2018, a German court ruled against Huawei and ZTE in a patent infringement case. In February 2020, the United States Department of Justice charged Huawei with racketeering and conspiring to steal trade secrets from six U.S. firms. In 2019 Huawei's chief legal officer stated \\"In the past 30 years, no court has ever concluded that Huawei engaged in malicious IP theft...no company can become a global leader by stealing from others.\\" = Allegations of involvement in Xinjiang re- education camps = In 2019, the Australian Strategic Policy Institute accused Huawei of assisting in the mass detention of Uyghurs in Xinjiang re-education camps. Huawei technology used by the Xinjiang internal security forces for data analysis, and companies supplying Huawei operating in the Xinjiang region are accused of using forced labour. However, Huawei denied these reports. = Allegations of collusion between Huawei and the Chinese Communist Party apparatus = On 7 October 2020, the U.K. Parliament's Defence Committee released a report claiming that there was evidence of collusion between Huawei and Chinese state and the Chinese Communist Party. The U.K. Parliament's Defence Committee said that the conclusion was evidenced by Huawei's ownership model and government subsidies it has received. = U.S. business restrictions = In August 2018, the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2019 (NDAA 2019) was signed into law, containing a provision that banned Huawei and ZTE equipment from being used by the U.S. federal government, citing security concerns. Huawei filed a lawsuit over the act in March 2019, alleging it to be unconstitutional because it specifically targeted Huawei without granting it a chance to provide a rebuttal or due process. Additionally, on 15 May 2019, the Department of Commerce added Huawei and 70 foreign subsidiaries and \\"affiliates\\" to its entity list under the Export Administration Regulations, citing the company having been indicted for \\"knowingly and willfully causing the export, re-export, sale and supply, directly and indirectly, of goods, technology and services (banking and other financial services) from the United States to Iran and the government of Iran without obtaining a license from the Department of Treasury's Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC)\\". This restricts U.S. companies from doing business with Huawei without a government license. Various U.S.-based companies immediately froze their business with Huawei to comply with the regulation. These actions have negatively affected Huawei production, sales and financial projections. However, on 29 June 2019 at the G20 summit, the US President made statements implicating plans to ease the restrictions on U.S. companies doing business with Huawei. Despite this statement, on 15 May 2020, the U.S. Department of Commerce extended its export restrictions to bar Huawei from producing semiconductors derived from technology or software of U.S. origin, even if the manufacturing is performed overseas. In June 2020, the Federal Communications Commission designated Huawei a national security threat, thereby barring it from any U.S. subsidies. In July 2020, the Federal Acquisition Regulation Council published a Federal Register notice prohibiting all federal government contractors from selling Huawei hardware to the federal government and preventing federal contractors from using Huawei hardware.  Replacement operating systems  During the sanctions, it was noted that Huawei had been working on its own in-house operating system codenamed \\"HongMeng OS\\": in an interview with Die Welt, executive Richard Yu stated that an in-house OS could be used as a \\"plan B\\" if it were prevented from using Android or Windows as the result of U.S. action. Huawei filed trademarks for the names \\"Ark\\", \\"Ark OS\\", and \\"Harmony\\" in Europe, which were speculated to be connected to this OS. On 9 August 2019, Huawei officially unveiled Harmony OS at its inaugural developers' conference in Dongguan with the ARK compiler which can be used to port Android APK packages to the OS. In September 2019, Huawei began offering the Chinese Linux distribution Deepin as an optional pre-loaded operating system on selected Matebook models in China, as an alternative to Windows.

He is considered a saint and a Church Father by both the Orthodox and Roman Catholic Churches. He gained a reputation as a strong defender of orthodoxy. He is best known for composing the Panarion, a very large compendium of the heresies up to his own time, full of quotations that are often the only surviving fragments of suppressed texts. According to Ernst Kitzinger, he \\"seems to have been the first cleric to have taken up the matter of Christian religious images as a major issue\\", and there has been much controversy over how many of the quotations attributed to him by the Byzantine Iconoclasts were actually by him. Regardless of this he was clearly strongly against some contemporary uses of images in the church.Kitzinger, 92‚Äì93, 92 quoted Life Epiphanius was either born into a Romaniote Christian family or became a Christian in his youth. Either way, he was a Romaniote Jew who was born in the small settlement of Besanduk, near Eleutheropolis (modern-day Beit Guvrin, Israel),The Panarion of Epiphanius of Salamis: Book I (Sects 1‚Äì46), By Epiphanius, Epiphanius of Salamis, Translated by Frank Williams, 1987 p xi and lived as a monk in Egypt, where he was educated and came into contact with Valentinian groups. He returned to Palestine around 333, when he was still a young man, and he founded a monastery at Ad nearby,The more famous Monastery of Epiphanius near Thebes, Egypt was founded by an anchorite named Epiphanius towards the end of the sixth century; it was explored by an expedition from the Metropolitan Museum of Art, 1912‚Äì14. which is often mentioned in the polemics of Jerome with Rufinus and John, Bishop of Jerusalem. He was ordained a priest, and lived and studied as superior of the monastery in Ad that he founded for thirty years and gained much skill and knowledge in that position. In that position he gained the ability to speak in several tongues, including Hebrew, Syriac, Egyptian, Greek, and Latin, and was called by Jerome on that account Pentaglossos (\\"Five tongued\\").Ruf 3.6 His reputation for learning prompted his nomination and consecration as Bishop of Salamis, Cyprus,Salamis was also known as Constantia after Constantine II. in 365 or 367, a post which he held until his death. He was also the Metropolitan of the Church of Cyprus. He served as bishop for nearly forty years, as well as travelled widely to combat unorthodox beliefs. He was present at a synod in Antioch (376) where the Trinitarian questions were debated against the heresy of Apollinarianism. He upheld the position of Bishop Paulinus, who had the support of Rome, over that of Meletius of Antioch, who was supported by the Eastern Churches. In 382 he was present at the Council of Rome, again upholding the cause of Paulinus. Origenist controversy and death During a visit to Palestine in 394 or 395, while preaching in Jerusalem, he attacked Origen's followers and urged the Bishop of Jerusalem, John II, to condemn his writings. He urged John to be careful of the \\"offence\\" of images in the churches. He noted that when travelling in Palestine he went into a church to pray and saw a curtain with an image of Christ or a saint which he tore down. He told Bishop John that such images were \\"opposed . . . to our religion\\" (see below).Part 9, Letter LI. From Epiphanius, Bishop of Salamis, in Cyprus, to John, Bishop of Jerusalem (c. 394), http://www.newadvent.org/fathers/3001051.htm. This event sowed the seeds of conflict which erupted in the dispute between Rufinus and John against Jerome and Epiphanius. Epiphanius fuelled this conflict by ordaining a priest for Jerome's monastery at Bethlehem, thus trespassing on John's jurisdiction. This dispute continued during the 390s, in particular in the literary works by Rufinus and Jerome attacking one another. In 399, the dispute took on another dimension, when the Bishop of Alexandria, Theophilus, who had initially supported John, changed his views and started persecuting Origenist monks in Egypt. As a result of this persecution, four of these monks, the so-called Tall Brothers, fled to Palestine, and then travelled to Constantinople, seeking support and spreading the controversy. John Chrysostom, Bishop of Constantinople, gave the monks shelter. Bishop Theophilus of Alexandria saw his chance to use this event to bring down his enemy Chrysostom: in 402 he summoned a council in Constantinople, and invited those supportive of his anti-Origenist views. Epiphanius, by this time nearly 80, was one of those summoned, and began the journey to Constantinople. However, when he realised he was being used as a tool by Theophilus against Chrysostom, who had given refuge to the monks persecuted by Theophilus and who were appealing to the emperor, Epiphanius started back to Salamis, only to die on the way home in 403.Frances Young with Andrew Teal, From Nicaea to Chalcedon: A Guide to the Literature and its Background, (2nd edn, 2004), pp202-3 The curtain incident Letter LI in Jerome's letters gives Jerome's Latin translation, made at Epiphanius' request, of his letter, originally in Greek from c. 394, \\"From Epiphanius, Bishop of Salamis, in Cyprus, to John, Bishop of Jerusalem\\" (see previous section for wider context). The final section covers the often quoted incident of the curtain, which unlike other passages attributed to Epiphanius and quoted by the Iconoclasts, is accepted as authentic by modern scholars:Kitzinger, 92‚Äì93 and long note > 9\\\\. Moreover, I have heard that certain persons have this grievance against > me: When I accompanied you to the holy place called Bethel, there to join > you in celebrating the Collect, after the use of the Church, I came to a > villa called Anablatha and, as I was passing, saw a lamp burning there. > Asking what place it was, and learning it to be a church, I went in to pray, > and found there a curtain hanging on the doors of the said church, dyed and > embroidered. It bore an image either of Christ or of one of the saints; I do > not rightly remember whose the image was. Seeing this, and being loth that > an image of a man should be hung up in Christ‚Äôs church contrary to the > teaching of the Scriptures, I tore it asunder and advised the custodians of > the place to use it as a winding sheet for some poor person.

Since then there has been some little delay, due to the fact that I > have been seeking a curtain of the best quality to give to them instead of > the former one, and thought it right to send to Cyprus for one. I have now > sent the best that I could find, and I beg that you will order the presbyter > of the place to take the curtain which I have sent from the hands of the > Reader, and that you will afterwards give directions that curtains of the > other sort‚Äîopposed as they are to our religion‚Äîshall not be hung up in any > church of Christ.

I pray that you may fare well in the > Lord.NPNF2-06. Jerome: The Principal Works of St. Jerome, CCEL Writings =Panarion= His best-known book is the Panarion which means \\"medicine-chest\\" (also known as Adversus Haereses, \\"Against Heresies\\"), presented as a book of antidotes for those bitten by the serpent of heresy. Written between 374 and 377, it forms a handbook for dealing with the arguments of heretics. It lists, and refutes, 80 heresies, some of which are not described in any other surviving documents from the time. Epiphanius begins with the 'four mothers' of pre-Christian heresy ‚Äì 'barbarism', 'Scythism', 'Hellenism' and 'Judaism' ‚Äì and then addresses the sixteen pre- Christian heresies that have flowed from them: four philosophical schools (Stoics, Platonists, Pythagoreans and Epicureans), and twelve Jewish sects. There then follows an interlude, telling of the Incarnation of the Word. After this, Epiphanius embarks on his account of the sixty Christian heresies, from assorted gnostics to the various trinitarian heresies of the fourth century, closing with the Collyridians and Messalians.Andrew Louth, 'Palestine', in Frances Young, Lewis Ayres and Andrew Young, eds, The Cambridge History of Early Christian Literature, (2010), p286 While Epiphanius often let his zeal come before facts ‚Äì he admits on one occasion that he writes against the Origenists based only on hearsay (Panarion, Epiphanius 71) ‚Äì the Panarion is a valuable source of information on the Christian Church of the fourth century. It is also an important source regarding the early Jewish gospels such as the Gospel according to the Hebrews circulating among the Ebionites and the Nazarenes, as well as the followers of Cerinthus and Merinthus.Epiphanius, Panarion, 30 iii 7 One unique feature of the Panarion is in the way that Epiphanius compares the various heretics to different poisonous beasts, going so far as to describe in detail the animal's characteristics, how it produces its poison, and how to protect oneself from the animal's bite or poison. For example, he describes his enemy Origen as \\"a toad noisy from too much moisture which keeps croaking louder and louder.\\" He compares the Gnostics to a particularly dreaded snake \\"with no fangs.\\" The Ebionites, a Christian sect that followed Jewish law, were described by Epiphanius as \\"a monstrosity with many shapes, who practically formed the snake-like shape of the mythical many- headed Hydra in himself.\\" In all, Epiphanius describes fifty animals, usually one per sect. Another feature of the Panarion is the access its earlier sections provide to lost works, notably Justin Martyr's work on heresies, the Greek of Irenaeus' Against Heresies, and Hippolytus' Syntagma.Andrew Louth, 'Palestine', in Frances Young, Lewis Ayres and Andrew Young, eds, The Cambridge History of Early Christian Literature, (2010), 286 The Panarion was first translated into English in 1987 and 1990. =Other works= His earliest known work is the Ancoratus (the well anchored man), which includes arguments against Arianism and the teachings of Origen. Aside from the polemics by which he is known, Epiphanius wrote a work of biblical antiquarianism, called, for one of its sections, On Weights and Measures (œÄŒµœÅ·Ω∂ ŒºŒ≠œÑœÅœâŒΩ Œ∫Œ±·Ω∂ œÉœÑŒ¨Œ∏ŒºœâŒΩ). It was composed in Constantinople for a Persian priest, in 392,Allen A. Shaw, \\"On Measures and Weights by Epiphanius\\" National Mathematics Magazine 11.1 (October 1936: 3‚Äì7). and survives in Syriac, Armenian, and Georgian translations (this last is found in Shatberd ms 1141 along with Physiologus and De Gemmis).English translation is Dean (1935) The first section discusses the canon of the Old Testament and its versions, the second of measures and weights, and the third, the geography of Palestine. The texts appear not to have been given a polish but consist of rough notes and sketches, as Allen A. Shaw, a modern commentator, concluded; nevertheless Epiphanius' work on metrology was important in the history of measurement. Another work, On the Twelve Gems (De Gemmis), survives in a number of fragments, the most complete of which is the Georgian.Frances Young with Andrew Teal, From Nicaea to Chalcedon: A Guide to the Literature and its Background, (2nd edn, 2004), p201 The letter written by Epiphanius to John, Bishop of Jerusalem, in 394 and preserved in Jerome's translation, is discussed above.Ep 51, available at http://www.ccel.org/ccel/schaff/npnf206.v.LI.html The collection of homilies traditionally ascribed to a \\"Saint Epiphanius, bishop\\" are dated in the late fifth or sixth century and are not connected with Epiphanius of Salamis by modern scholars.Alvar Erikson, Sancti Epiphani Episcopi Interpretatio Evangelorum (Lund) 1938, following Dom Morin.

He made major contributions to the topology of point sets and introduced the entire concept of metric spaces. He also made several important contributions to the field of statistics and probability, as well as calculus. His dissertation opened the entire field of functionals on metric spaces and introduced the notion of compactness. Independently of Riesz, he discovered the representation theorem in the space of Lebesgue square integrable functions. Biography =Early life= He was born to a Protestant family in Maligny to Jacques and Zo√© Fr√©chet. At the time of his birth, his father was a director of a Protestant orphanage in Maligny and was later in his youth appointed a head of a Protestant school. However, the newly established Third Republic was not sympathetic to religious education and so the laws were enacted requiring all education to be secular. As a result, his father lost his job. To generate some income his mother set up a boarding house for foreigners in Paris. His father was able later to obtain another teaching position within the secular system ‚Äì it was not a job of a headship, however, and the family could not expect as high standards as they might have otherwise. Maurice attended the secondary school Lyc√©e Buffon in Paris where he was taught mathematics by Jacques Hadamard. Hadamard recognised the potential of young Maurice and decided to tutor him on an individual basis. After Hadamard moved to the University of Bordeaux in 1894, Hadamard continuously wrote to Fr√©chet, setting him mathematical problems and harshly criticising his errors. Much later Fr√©chet admitted that the problems caused him to live in a continual fear of not being able to solve some of them, even though he was very grateful for the special relationship with Hadamard he was privileged to enjoy. After completing high-school Fr√©chet was required to enroll in the military service. This is the time when he was deciding whether to study mathematics or physics ‚Äì he chose mathematics out of dislike of chemistry classes he would have had to take otherwise. Thus in 1900 he enrolled to √âcole Normale Sup√©rieure to study mathematics. He started publishing quite early, having published four papers in 1903. He also published some of his early papers in the American Mathematical Society due to his contact with American mathematicians in Paris‚Äîparticularly Edwin Wilson. =Middle life= Fr√©chet served at many different institutions during his academic career. From 1907‚Äì1908 he served as a professor of mathematics at the Lyc√©e in Besan√ßon, then moved in 1908 to the Lyc√©e in Nantes to stay there for a year. After that he served at the University of Poitiers between 1910‚Äì1919. He married in 1908 to Suzanne Carrive (1881‚Äì1945) and had four children: H√©l√®ne, Henri, Denise and Alain. =First World War= Fr√©chet was planning to spend a year in the United States at the University of Illinois but his plan was disrupted when the First World War broke out in 1914. He was mobilised on 4 August the same year. Because of his diverse language skills, gained when his mother ran the establishment for foreigners, he served as an interpreter for the British Army. However, this was not a safe job; he spent two and a half years very near to or at the front. French egalitarian ideals caused many academics to be mobilised. They served in the trenches and many of them were lost during the war. It is remarkable that during his service in the war, he still managed to produce cutting edge mathematical papers frequently, despite having little time to devote to mathematics. =After the war= After the end of the war, Fr√©chet was chosen to go to Strasbourg to help with the reestablishment of the university. He served as a professor of higher analysis and Director of the Mathematics Institute. Despite being burdened with administrative work, he was again able to produce a large amount of high quality research. In 1928 Fr√©chet decided to move back to Paris, thanks to encouragement from Borel, who was then Chair in the Calculus of Probabilities and Mathematical Physics at the Sorbonne. Fr√©chet briefly held a position of lecturer at the Sorbonne's Rockefeller Foundation and from 1928 was a Professor (without a Chair). Fr√©chet was promoted to tenured Chair of General Mathematics in 1933 and to Chair of Differential and Integral Calculus in 1935. In 1941 Fr√©chet succeeded Borel as Chair in the Calculus of Probabilities and Mathematical Physics, a position Fr√©chet held until he retired in 1949. From 1928 to 1935 Fr√©chet was also put in charge of lectures at the √âcole Normale Sup√©rieure; in this latter capacity Fr√©chet was able to direct a significant number of young mathematicians toward research in probability, including Doeblin, Fortet, Loeve, and Ville. Despite his major achievements, Fr√©chet was not overly appreciated in France. As an illustration, while being nominated numerous times, he was not elected a member of the Academy of Sciences until the age of 78. In 1929 he became foreign member of the Polish Academy of Science and Arts and in 1950 foreign member of the Royal Netherlands Academy of Arts and Sciences. Fr√©chet was an Esperantist, publishing some papers and articles in that constructed language.La kanonaj formoj de la 2, 3, 4-dimensiaj paraanalitikaj funkcioj He also served as president of the Internacia Scienca Asocio Esperantista (\\"International Scientific Esperantist Association\\") from 1950‚Äì53.from the Esperanto Wikipedia Main works His first major work was his outstanding 1906 PhD thesis Sur quelques points du calcul fonctionnel, on the calculus of functionals. Here Fr√©chet introduced the concept of a metric space, although the name is due to Hausdorff. Fr√©chet's level of abstraction is similar to that in group theory, proving theorems within a carefully chosen axiomatic system which can then be applied to a large array of particular cases. Here is a list of his most important works, in chronological order: * Sur les op√©rations lin√©aires I-III, 1904‚Äì1907 (On linear operators) * Les Espaces abstraits, 1928 (Abstract spaces) * Recherches th√©oriques modernes sur la th√©orie des probabilit√©s, 1937‚Äì1938 (Modern theoretical research in the theory of probability) * Les Probabilit√©s associ√©es √† un syst√®me d'√©v√©nements compatibles et d√©pendants, 1939‚Äì1943 (Probabilities Associated with a System of Compatible and Dependent Events) * Pages choisies d'analyse g√©n√©rale, 1953 (Selected Pages of General Analysis) * Les Math√©matiques et le concret, 1955 (Mathematics and the concrete) Fr√©chet also developed ideas from the article Deux types fondamentaux de distribution statistiqueJarom√≠r Korƒç√°k (1938): Deux types fondamentaux de distribution statistique.

(1938; an English translation The Two Fundamental Types of Statistical Distribution) of Czech geographer, demographer and statistician Jarom√≠r Korƒç√°k. Fr√©chet is sometimes credited with the introduction of what is now known as the Cram√©r‚ÄìRao bound, but Fr√©chet's 1940s lecture notes on the topic appear to have been lost.

Perhaps the most typical Venezuelan music is joropo, a rural form which originated in the llanos, or plains. Genres =Joropo= Venezuelan Joropo. Drawing by Eloy Palacios (1912) Joropo was developed by creative artists such as Juan Vicente Torrealba, Ignacio Figueredo, Augusto Bracca, Eneas Perdomo and Angel Custodio Loyola, who helped to popularize the music throughout the country. Since then a slick, contemporary form of pop-llanera has developed which has earned the scorn of some purists who perceive it as stale and watered-down. Some singers, such as Adilia Castillo, Lorenzo Herrera, Simon Diaz, Mario Suarez, Edith Salcedo, Magdalena Sanchez, Rafael Monta√±o, Reyna Lucero, Cristina Maica, Jos√© Catire Carpio, Cristobal Jimenez, Juan de los Santos Contreras (El Carrao de Palmarito) and Reynaldo Armas have maintained a huge following over the years. In a similar vein, there is also neo-folklore, which takes traditional music and arranges it in an electronic style. =Folk= Velorio de Cruz de Mayo, drawing by Anton Goering (1892) Another very popular music in Venezuela is the Gaita Zuliana. This genre originated from the region of Zulia State and is very popular during the Christmas season. The gaita united to the Aguinaldo, conforms the national representation of the Venezuelan Christmas. In the east, the malague√±a, punto and galer√≥n accompanies the velorios de cruz de mayo, (religious tradition, that is celebrated on 3 May in honor to the Christian cross). In the Venezuelan Andes, the Venezuelan bambuco is a local variation of the bambuco. Other forms include polo and the Venezuelan waltz. The Quinteto Contrapunto, founded by Rafael Su√°rez and Aida Navarro, was a celebrated Venezuelan vocal quintet which reached nationwide and international celebrity in the early 1960s, and was very active for about a decade. Other forms of Venezuelan folk music are tensively recorded and researched due to the work of Caracas-based Fundaci√≥n Bigott. African-derived percussion (including multiple rhythms, such as sangueo, fulia, parranda and tamborera) is perhaps the best documented musical form. Fundacion Bigott has also produced groups such Un Solo Pueblo, Hurac√°n de Fuego and Grupo Madera. These more experimental fusion artists combine rumba, Latin jazz, joropo, salsa, Venezuelan traditional chants and other forms of Latin American music. Then there is also the genre commonly known as \\"Onda Nueva\\" (New Wave), which is a combination of joropo and jazz music, with influences from the Brazilian Bossa Nova. The genre was introduced by Aldemaro Romero with a special contribution by famed drummer and timpanist Frank Hernandez, nicknamed \\"El Pavo\\" (The Peacock) by employing a very peculiar drum beat. The term was coined by jazz analyst Jacques Braunstein after having been shown a copy of Romero's earliest composition called \\"Araguita\\", (originally to be used as jingle material), which Braunstein described as \\"something of a new wave\\". Onda Nueva music was heralded as the Venezuelan Bossa Nova with a very particular seal. =Caribbean= Venezuelan calypso music (including Calypso de El Callao), imported from Trinidad in the 1880s by immigrants arriving during a gold rush, has its own distinctive rhythms and lyrical style. Another imported genre is Cuban-American salsa, which has produced several domestic superstars, including Oscar D'Leon. Dominican merengue, Cuban and Colombian Latin pop acts such as Billo's Caracas Boys, the Porfi Jim√©nez Orchestra and Los Mel√≥dicos. Aldemaro Romero directing the Municipal Symphony Orchestra of Caracas, at the celebration of the 50th anniversary of Dinner in Caracas The galer√≥n is a genre of Venezuelan typical song. It is related to the guajiro (Cuba), torbellino (Colombia), and trova (Puerto Rico). In general, it is accompanied by mandolin, cuatro, and guitar. =Pop and rock= Los Amigos Invisibles Desorden P√∫blico Pop and rock music are very popular too, and several bands have had considerable success over the years. Venezuelan pop musicians such as Ricardo Montaner, Kiara, Karina, Los Chamos, Urbanda, Uff, Jos√© Luis Rodr√≠guez \\"El Puma\\", Franco DeVita, and Ilan Chester have gained popularity in other Latin American countries. On the other hand, same history for many well-known bands like Devendra Banhart (Naturalismo), Aditus, Resistencia, Los Amigos Invisibles (Acid Jazz), Arkangel founded by Paul Gilmann and Freddy Marshall, Desorden Publico (Ska/Pop), King Chango (Ska/Latin American music), Culto oculto (Experimental/Rock), Caramelos de Cianuro (Pop/Rock), Mikel Erentxun (Pop/Rock), Candy 66, Tan Fr√≠o El Verano, La Vida Boh√®me and the now extinct but influential groups Sentimiento Muerto (Post-punk), Zapato 3 (Pop/Rock), and Dermis Tat√∫ (Rock). = Electronic music = In the late 1960s and early 1970s a few Venezuelan artists began experimenting with sounds, using emerging electronic equipment that was being produced. Artists like Vytas Brenner and Grupo C.I.M. used Moog style synthesizers and effects to embrace the shift in new sounds. Alfredo del M√≥naco, who founded the Venezuelan branch of ISCM, is considered the pioneer in electronic music in Venezuela having released Estudio electr√≥nico I para cinta in 1968. Jose Enrique Sarabia also known as \\"Chelique,\\" who was already internationally known for producing songs since the late 50s like \\"Ansiedad,\\" helped by other gifted musicians, recorded and released a record in 1971 through a private press titled: 4 Fases del Cuatro - M√∫sica Venezolana desarrollada Electr√≥nicamente por Chelique Sarabia (4 Phases of Four - Venezuelan Music Electronically Developed by Chelique Sarabia). In 1973, when exclusivity of the private contract ended, Chelique commercially released the record under a different title: Revoluci√≥n \\"Electr√≥nica\\" en M√∫sica Venezolana (Electronic Revolution in Venezuelan Music). Revoluci√≥n \\"Electr√≥nica\\" en M√∫sica Venezolana is notable for being one of the earliest electronic records in Venezuela and is considered a trailblazing album for electronic music in Latin America. In the late 1990s a very strong electronic music movement spread through the country. Several big multimedia festivals took place, such as \\"Caracas No Duerme,\\" \\"AX,\\" \\"Petaquire,\\" and \\"Mare Nostrum.\\" These events combined music with the video and performance art of Venezuelan artists such as Luis Poleo, Frank Wow, and Sony. The main bands/DJ's of this era are Ojo Fatuo, DJ Oddo and DJ Wyz. Patafunk \\"Playa\\" 2011 From 2000 until present, a lot of Venezuelan artists have made a strong movement into different underground music styles. The most significant ones are: Arca (experimental/industrial) Masseratti 2lts (downtempo), La Vida Boheme (post-punk), Lmca (Electronic/Synthpop/post-punk/experimental), Viniloversus (indie rock), KP-9000 (trip hop), Cardopusher (breakcore), Nuuro (IDM), Patafunk (Tropical/funk), FamasLoop (trip hop/electronica), Todosantos (nu rave/indietronica), Jimmy Flamante (breakbeat), Las Americas (shoegazing), Dondi (drum and bass/downtempo), Retrov√©rtigo (post-rock), Lis (instrumental rock), Tercer Cuarto (alternative metal), Panasuyo (neo-folklore), Pacheko (dubstep), Dame Pa' Matala (reggaeton/hip hop) and Los Javelin (surf rock/rockabilly) AC/Boy (Techno) =Classical music= Serenata Guayanesa Venezuela has also produced classical composers such as: Reynaldo Hahn, Teresa Carre√±o (who was also a world-renowned pianist), Antonio Lauro, V√≠ctor Varela, Antonio Estevez, Evencio Castellanos, Modesta Bor, Prudencio Esaa, Mois√©s Moleiro, Sylvia Constantinidis, Gustavo Dudamel, Alfredo Rugeles and Eduardo Marturet (who are primarily international conductors), Federico Ruiz (who also works with other genres) and Vicente Emilio Sojo (known for his contributions to Venezuelan musicology and music education). Roberto Ruscitti followed in their footsteps. Venezuela also houses a national network of public conservatories and music schools; there are also private music schools and institutions. Institutes of higher learning that specialize in music or have a music department include Universidad de las Artes, whose music department is the former Instituto Universitario de Estudios Musicales; Universidad Central de Venezuela, which gives diplomas in music performance and postgraduate degrees in musicology, including doctorates; Universidad Sim√≥n Bol√≠var, whose music department awards Master of Music degrees in several areas including composition, conducting, and music education; and Universidad de los Andes. Prominent composers and musicians who have taught, founded, or studied in these institutions include Alberto Grau, Isabel Aretz, Mar√≠a Guinand (who was one of the founders of the Master of Music program of Universidad Sim√≥n Bol√≠var), Diana Arismendi, Ricardo Teruel, Inocente Carre√±o, Adina Izarra, Marianela Arocha, Maurice Hasson, Pedro Eustache, David Ascanio, Josefina Benedetti, Alfredo del Monaco, Alfredo Rugeles, Humberto Bruni Lamanna, Abraham Abreu, Aldo Abreu, Aquiles Baez, Pablo Gil, Carlos Duarte and Sylvia Constantinidis. Venezuela also has El Sistema, a publicly financed voluntary sector music education program founded by Jos√© Antonio Abreu in 1975. Prominent musicians of El Sistema are Gustavo Dudamel director of Los Angeles Philharmonic, Rafael Payare director of San Diego Symphony and doublebassist Edicson Ruiz who at age 17, became the youngest member of the Berlin Philharmonic Orchestra. The country's symphony orchestras include the Venezuela Symphony Orchestra, Maracaibo Symphony Orchestra, Municipal Symphony Orchestra, M√©rida State Symphony Orchestra, and the Orquesta Sinf√≥nica Sim√≥n Bol√≠var. Composers Juana Maria de la Concepcion, commonly referred to as Conny M√©ndez, born 11 April 1898 in Caracas, was a composer, singer, writer, caricaturist and actress who produced more than 40 compositions, such as: Yo soy venezolana, Chucho y Ceferina, La Negrita Marisol, Venezuela Habla Cantando, and many others. Rub√©n Cede√±o, composer of folk and children's music of Venezuela, he appears in the Venezuelan music encyclopedia.Catalogofunves.org Singer, composer, investigator, painter and writer. His most recognized works are: The Aguinaldo Que Navidad part of the Venezuelan Christmas repertoire and interpreted by the mezzo-soprano Morella Mu√±oz, Cantata infantil Sim√≥n Bol√≠var, Misa de mi Tierra among others. It was National Prize of popular music of the INAVI with his valse Nora. The hymn Hail to the Statue of Liberty, received the congratulation of President Ronald Reagan. Antonio Lauro composed a large body of classical guitar works, adapting traditional Venezuelan waltz and folk songs for the instrument. Gustavo Matamoros is a renowned Venezuelan composer dedicated to the experimentation with sound and its relationship with the human mind and culture. He has worked mainly with contemporary techniques such as electroacoustics, mixed media, performance, installations, radiophony and multimedia spectacles. He resides in the US. The work of composer, arranger and musical producer Jes√∫s \\"Chuchito\\" Sanoja is considered an important part of the Venezuelan cultural patrimony. Notable musicians and groups Other Venezuelan performers of note are Chino y Nacho, Franco de Vita, Alirio Diaz, Hern√°n Gamboa, Gualberto Ibarreto, Enrique Hidalgo, Rudy Regalado, Jesus Sanoja, Otmaro Ruiz, Vytas Brenner, Yordano, Juan Carlos Salazar, Hu√°scar Barradas, Billo Fr√≥meta, Cecilia Todd, Homero Parra, Gerry Weil, Diego Matheuz, Domingo Hindoyan, Soledad Bravo, Vidal Colmenares, Mar√≠a Teresa Chac√≠n, Luis G√≥mez-Imbert, Luis Mariano Rivera, Maurice Hasson, Luis Laguna, Italo Pizzolante, Cecilia Todd, Lilia Vera, Renato Capriles, Al√≠ Primera, Jos√© Luis Rodr√≠guez, Graciela Naranjo, Mario Carniello, Henry Mart√≠nez, Pedro Eustache and Alberto Naranjo, as well as the groups Serenata Guayanesa, Dimensi√≥n Latina, Los Cu√±aos, Los Ca√±oneros, Guaco, Mango, Grupo Madera, Percujazz Ensamble, Ensamble Gurrufio, Lloviznando Cantos, Los Chamos and El Trabuco Venezolano, among others.

It was composed in 1806 and premiered in March 1807 at a private concert in Vienna at the town house of Prince Lobkowitz. The first public performance was at the Burgtheater in Vienna in April 1808. The symphony is in four movements. It is predominantly genial in tone, and has tended to be overshadowed by the weightier Beethoven symphonies that preceded and followed it ‚Äì the Third Symphony (Eroica) and the Fifth. Although later composers including Berlioz, Mendelssohn and Schumann greatly admired the work it has not become as widely known among the music-loving public as the Eroica, the Fifth and other Beethoven symphonies. Background Beethoven spent the summer of 1806 at the country estate of his patron, Prince Lichnowsky, near Glogau. In September Beethoven and the Prince visited the house of one of the latter's friends, Count Franz von Oppersdorff. The Count maintained a private orchestra, and the composer was honoured with a performance of his Second Symphony, written four years earlier.Kemp, Linsday. Notes to LSO Live set LSO0098D After this, Oppersdorff offered the composer a substantial sum to write a new symphony for him. Beethoven had been working on what later became his Fifth Symphony, and his first intention may have been to complete it in fulfilment of the Count's commission. There are several theories about why, if so, he did not do this. According to George Grove, economic necessity obliged Beethoven to offer the Fifth (together with the Pastoral) jointly to Prince Lobkowitz and Count Razumovsky.

It typically takes between 30 and 35 minutes to perform. In general the symphony is sunny and cheerful, with light instrumentation that for some listeners recalls the symphonies of Joseph Haydn, with whom Beethoven had studied a decade before.Grove, pp. 97‚Äì99 In a commentary on the symphony Grove comments that Haydn ‚Äì who was still alive when the new symphony was first performed ‚Äì might have found the work too strong for his taste.

First movement = Adagio ‚Äì Allegro vivace The first movement is in time. Like those of the first, second, and seventh of Beethoven's nine symphonies, it has a slow introduction.

Slow movement = Adagio The second movement, in time (E major) is a slow rondo. The rhythmic figure of the opening theme persists throughout, and underpins, the whole movement: upright=1.8 Tovey calls the first episode (or second subject) \\"a still more subtle melody\\": upright=1.8 The main theme returns in an elaborate variation, followed by a middle episode and the reappearance of the varied main theme, now played by the flute.

Finale = The last movement is in time in B major. The tempo marking is Allegro ma non troppo; this, like that of the scherzo, is an afterthought on Beethoven's part: the original tempo indication in the autograph score is an unqualified \\"allegro\\". The composer added (in red chalk) \\"ma non troppo\\" ‚Äì i.e. but not too much so.Grove, p. 122 The movement is in a playful style that the composer called aufgekn√∂pft (unbuttoned).Grove, p. 124upright=1.8 After some 340 bars of what Grove describes as a perpetuum mobile, Beethoven concludes the symphony with the Haydnesque device of playing the main theme at half speed, interrupted by pauses, before a final fortissimo flourish.Grove, p. 125 Reception As usual by this stage of the composer's career, the symphony divided opinion among those who heard early performances. In 1809 Carl Maria von Weber, never an admirer of Beethoven, wrote: :First a slow movement full of short disjointed unconnected ideas, at the rate of three or four notes per quarter of an hour; then a mysterious roll of the drum and passage of the violas, seasoned with the proper quantity of pauses and ritardandos; and to end all a furious finale, in which the only requisite is that there should be no ideas for the hearer to make out, but plenty of transitions from one key to another ‚Äì on to the new note at once! never mind modulating! ‚Äì above all things, throw rules to the winds, for they only hamper a genius.Morgenblatt f√ºr die gebildeten St√§nde, December 1809, Quoted in Grove, p. 97 Other critics were less hostile, praising the composer's \\"richness of ideas, bold originality and fullness of power\\" though finding the Fourth and the works premiered alongside it \\"rough diamonds\\".Quoted in Ferraguto, p. 24 Beethoven's biographer Anton Schindler later recalled the Fourth as being a great success from the outset, although later scholars have expressed reservations about his reliability.Ferraguto, pp. 25‚Äì26 When Beethoven's younger contemporary Hector Berlioz heard the symphony he wrote that the slow movement was the work of the Archangel Michael, and not that of a human.Thompson, p. 172 Nonetheless, by the time Berlioz was writing musical criticism, the Fourth was already less often played than other Beethoven symphonies. Robert Schumann is said to have called the Fourth Symphony \\"a slender Greek maiden between two Norse giants\\", and it was an important influence on his First Symphony.Ferraguto, pp. 45‚Äì46 Mendelssohn loved the Fourth, and programmed it when he was conductor of the Leipzig Gewandhaus Orchestra. But their enthusiasm was not shared by the wider musical public. As early as 1831 a British critic noted that the Fourth was the \\"least frequently brought forward\\" of the first six, though, in his view \\"not inferior to any\\".\\"Music: Philharmonic Society\\", London literary gazette and journal of belles lettres, arts, sciences, etc. for the year 1831, quoted in Ferraguto, p. 12 In 1838 the French impresario Louis-D√©sir√© V√©ron called the Fourth sublime and regretted that in Paris it was not merely neglected but denigrated.Ferraguto, p. 12 In 1896 Grove commented that the work had \\"met with scant notice in some of the most prominent works on Beethoven\\". In the 20th century, writers continued to contrast the Fourth with the Eroica and the Fifth. In a study of the Fourth written in 2012 Mark Ferraguto quotes a 1994 description of the work as \\"a rich, verdant valley of yin expressiveness ‚Ä¶ poised between the two staggering yang peaks of the Third and the Fifth\\".Ferraguto, pp. 51‚Äì52 According to the musicologist Robert Greenberg of the San Francisco Conservatory of Music: :If any of Beethoven's contemporaries had written this symphony, it would be considered that composer's masterwork, and that composer would be remembered forever for this symphony, and this symphony would be played ‚Äì often ‚Äì as an example of that composer's great work. As it is, for Beethoven, it is a work in search of an audience. It's the least known and least appreciated of the nine.Greenberg, Part 2: Lecture 14: \\"Symphony No. 4: Consolidation of the New Aesthetic IV\\" Recordings The symphony has been recorded, in the studio and in concert performances, more than a hundred times.Ford, pp. 127‚Äì128 Early recordings were mostly issued as single sets, sometimes coupled with another Beethoven symphony, such as the Second. More recently, recordings of the Fourth have often been issued as part of complete cycles of the Beethoven symphonies.

Among conductors of such versions of the Fourth Symphony have been Christopher Hogwood (1986), Roger Norrington (1988), Frans Br√ºggen (1991) and John Eliot Gardiner (1994). More recently some conductors of modern symphony or chamber orchestras have recorded the Fourth (along with other Beethoven symphonies), drawing to a greater or lesser degree on the practices of the specialist groups. Among these are Nikolaus Harnoncourt (1992), and Sir Charles Mackerras (2007).

It built upon the Franco-Russian Alliance of 1894, the Entente Cordiale of 1904 between Paris and London, and the Anglo-Russian Entente of 1907. It formed a powerful counterweight to the Triple Alliance of Germany, Austria-Hungary, and Italy. The Triple Entente, unlike the Triple Alliance or the Franco-Russian Alliance itself, was not an alliance of mutual defence. The Franco-Japanese Treaty of 1907 was a key part of building a coalition as France took the lead in creating alliances with Japan, Russia and (informally) with Britain. Japan wanted to raise a loan in Paris, so France made the loan contingent on a Russo-Japanese agreement and a Japanese guaranty for France's strategically vulnerable possessions in Indochina. Britain encouraged the Russo-Japanese rapprochement. Thus was built the Triple Entente coalition that fought World War I.Ewen W. Edwards, \\"The Far Eastern Agreements of 1907.\\" Journal of Modern History 26.4 (1954): 340-355. online At the start of World War I in 1914, all three Triple Entente members entered it as Allied Powers against the Central Powers: Germany and Austria-Hungary.Robert Gildea, Barricades and Borders: Europe 1800‚Äì1914 (3rd ed. 2003) ch 15 On September 4, 1914, the Triple Entente issued a declaration undertaking not to conclude a separate peace and only to demand terms of peace agreed between the three parties. Historians continue to debate the importance of the alliance system as one of the causes of World War I.  Alliance system  During the Franco- Prussian War of 1870‚Äì1871, Prussia and its allies defeated the Second French Empire, resulting in the establishment of the Third Republic. In the Treaty of Frankfurt, Prussia forced France to cede Alsace-Lorraine to the new German Empire. Ever since, relations had been poor. France, worried about the escalating military development of Germany, began building up its own war industries and army to deter German aggression. Russia had previously been a member of the League of the Three Emperors, an alliance in 1873 with Austria- Hungary and Germany. The alliance was part of German Chancellor Otto von Bismarck‚Ä≤s plan to isolate France diplomatically; he feared that France's revanchist aspirations might lead it to attempt to regain its 1871 losses stemming from the Franco-Prussian War.Edgar Feuchtwanger, Imperial Germany 1850‚Äì1918 (2002). p 216. The alliance also served to oppose such socialist movements as the First International, which the conservative rulers found unsettling.Gildea 2003, p. 237. However, the League faced great difficulty with the growing tensions between Russia and Austria-Hungary, mainly over the Balkans, where the rise of nationalism and the continued decline of the Ottoman Empire made many former Ottoman provinces struggle for independence.Ruth Henig, The Origins of the First World War (2002), p.3. To counter Russian and French interests in Europe, the Dual alliance between Germany and Austria-Hungary was concluded in October 1879 and with Italy in May 1882. The situation in the Balkans, especially in the wake of the 1885 Serbo-Bulgarian War and the 1878 Treaty of Berlin, which made Russia feel cheated of its gains made in the Russo-Turkish War of 1877/8, prevented the League from being renewed in 1887. In an attempt to stop Russia from allying with France, Bismarck signed the secret Reinsurance Treaty with Russia in 1887. This treaty assured that both parties would remain neutral if war broke out. The growing rapprochement between Russia and France and Bismarck's exclusion of Russia from the German financial market in 1887 prevented the treaty from being renewed in 1890, ending the alliance between Germany and Russia.Norman Rich, Great power diplomacy, 1814‚Äì1914 (1992) pp 244‚Äì62 After the forced resignation of Bismarck in 1890, the young Kaiser Wilhelm set out on his imperialist course of Weltpolitik (\\"world politics\\") to increase the empire's influence in and control over the world.Christopher Clark, Kaiser Wilhelm II (2000) pp 35‚Äì47John C.G. Wilhelm II: the Kaiser's personal monarchy, 1888‚Äì1900 (2004).  Franco-Russian Alliance  Russia had by far the largest manpower reserves of all the six European powers, but it was also the most backward economically. Russia shared France's worries about Germany. After the Germans, the Ottomans asked for assistance, and together with the British, under admiral Limpus, started to reorganise the Ottoman army, Russia feared that they would come to control the Dardanelles, a vital trade artery that carried two-fifths of Russia's exports.Fiona K. Tomaszewski, A Great Russia: Russia and the Triple Entente, 1905 to 1914 (2002) There was also Russia's recent rivalry with Austria-Hungary over the spheres of influence in the Balkans and after the Reinsurance Treaty was not renewed in 1890, Russian leaders grew alarmed at the country's diplomatic isolation and joined the Franco-Russian Alliance in 1894.George Frost Kennan, The fateful alliance: France, Russia, and the coming of the First World War (1984) France developed a strong bond with Russia by ratifying the Franco-Russian Alliance, which was designed to create a strong counter to the Triple Alliance. France's main concerns were to protect against an attack from Germany and to regain Alsace- Lorraine. A 1914 Russian poster in which the upper inscription reads \\"agreement\\". The uncertain Britannia (right) and Marianne (left) look to the determined Mother Russia (centre) to lead them in the coming war. Entente cordiale In the last decade of the nineteenth century, Britain continued its policy of \\"splendid isolation\\", with its primary focus on defending its massive overseas empire. However, by the early 1900s, the German threat had increased dramatically, and Britain thought it was in need of allies. London made overtures to Berlin which were not reciprocated so London turned to Paris and St. Petersburg instead. In 1904, Britain and France signed a series of agreements, the Entente cordiale, mostly aimed toward resolving colonial disputes. That heralded the end of British splendid isolation. France and Britain had signed five separate agreements regarding spheres of influence in North Africa in 1904, the Entente cordiale. The Tangier Crisis later encouraged co-operation between the two countries from their mutual fear of apparent German expansionism.Christopher Clark, The Sleepwalkers: How Europe went to war in 1914 (2012), pp. 124‚Äì35, 190‚Äì96, 293‚Äì313, 438‚Äì42, 498‚Äì505. = Naval race with Germany= Britain, traditionally having control of the seas, by 1909 saw the German navy as a serious threat to its Royal Navy. Britain was well ahead in terms of Dreadnought technology and responded with a major building program. They built a Royal Navy that Germany could never rival. the British sent war minister Lord Haldane to Berlin in February 1912 to reduce friction stemming from the Anglo-German naval arms race. The mission was a failure because the Germans attempted to link a \\"naval holiday\\" with a British promise to remain neutral if Germany should become engaged in a war where \\"Germany could not be said to be the aggressor.\\" Zara Steiner says, \\"It would have meant abandoning the whole system of ententes which had been so carefully nurtured during the past six years. There was no German concession to counter the fear of German aggression.\\"Zara S. Steiner, Britain and the origins of the First World War (1977) p 95. Essentially, the British reserved the right to join whatever country was attacking Germany, even if Germany did not start a war dooming the talks to failure.Christopher Clark, The Sleepwalkers (2012) pp 318-19.John H. Maurer, \\"The Anglo-German naval rivalry and informal arms control, 1912-1914.\\" Journal of Conflict Resolution 36.2 (1992): 284-308. According to German historian Dirk B√∂nker, \\"To be sure, the [naval] race was decided early on; political leaders and diplomats learned to bracket it as an issue, and it did not cause the decision for war in 1914. But the naval competition nonetheless created an atmosphere of mutual hostility and distrust, which circumscribed the space for peaceful diplomacy and public recognition of shared interests, and helped to pave the twisted road to war in Europe.\\" Dirk B√∂nker, \\"Naval Race between Germany and Great Britain, 1898-1912\\" International Encyclopedia of the First World War (2015) =\\"The Entente was not an alliance\\"= The Entente, unlike the Triple Alliance and the Franco-Russian Alliance, was not an alliance of mutual defence and so Britain was free to make its own foreign policy decisions in 1914. As British Foreign Office Official Eyre Crowe minuted, \\"The fundamental fact, of course, is that the Entente is not an alliance. For purposes of ultimate emergencies, it may be found to have no substance at all. For the Entente is nothing more than a frame of mind, a view of general policy which is shared by the governments of two countries, but which may be, or become, so vague as to lose all content\\". Anglo-Russian Convention Russia had also recently lost the humiliating Russo-Japanese War, a cause of the Russian Revolution of 1905 and the apparent transformation into a constitutional monarchy. Although it was perceived as useless during the war with Japan, the alliance was valuable in the European theatre to counteract the threat of the Triple Alliance. Tomaszewski describes the evolution of the triple entente relationship from the Russian standpoint during the period 1908 to 1914 as a progression from a shaky set of understandings that withstood various crises and emerged as a fully fledged alliance after the outbreak of World War I. In 1907, the Anglo- Russian Entente was agreed, which attempted to resolve a series of long- running disputes over Persia, Afghanistan and Tibet and end their rivalry in Central Asia, nicknamed The Great Game.Edward Ingram, \\"Great Britain's Great Game: An Introduction\\" International History Review 2#2 pp. 160‚Äì171 online and helped to address British fears about the Baghdad Railway, which would help German expansion in the Near East. The entente in operation The coming into being of the entente did not necessarily fix a permanent division into two opposing power blocs, the situation remained flexible. The alignment of the autocratic Russian Empire with Europe's two largest democracies was controversial on both sides. Many Russian conservatives mistrusted the secular French and recalled British past diplomatic maneuvers to block Russian influence in the Near East. In turn, prominent French and British journalists, academics and parliamentarians found the reactionary tsarist regime distasteful. Mistrust persisted even during wartime, with British and French politicians expressing relief when Tsar Nicholas II abdicated and was replaced by the Russian Provisional Government after the February Revolution in 1917. An offer of political asylum for the Romanovs was even withdrawn by the British king for fear of popular reaction. Also, France never brought up the subject of asylum with the deposed tsar.

Random House Webster's Unabridged Dictionary. ; Old Chinese: *') was one of the seven major states during the Warring States period of ancient China. It was created from the three-way Partition of Jin, together with Han and Zhao. Its territory lay between the states of Qin and Qi and included parts of modern-day Henan, Hebei, Shanxi, and Shandong. After its capital was moved from Anyi to Daliang (present-day Kaifeng) during the reign of King Hui, Wei was also called Liang (). History =Foundation= Surviving sources trace the ruling house of Wei to the Zhou royalty: Gao, Duke of Bi (), was a son of King Wen of Zhou. His descendants took their surname from his fief. After the destruction of Bi by the Xionites, Bi Wan () escaped to Jin, where he became a courtier of Duke Xian's, accompanying his personal carriage. After a successful military expedition, Bi Wan was granted Wei, from which his own descendants then founded the house of Wei. =Spring and Autumn period= Jin's political structure was drastically changed after the slaughter of its ruling dynasty during and after the Li Ji Unrest. Afterwards, \\"Jin ha[d] no princely house\\" () and its political power diffused into extended relations of the ruling family, including the Wei. In the last years of the Spring and Autumn period, the founders of Wei, Zhao, and Han joined to attack and kill the dominant house of Zhi () in 453 , resulting in the partition of Jin. King Weilie of Zhou finally legitimized the situation in 403 , when he elevated the three houses' heads to the rank of marquess (). =Warring States Period= The state reached its apogee during the reigns of its first two rulers, Marquess Wen of Wei and Marquess Wu of Wei. The third ruler, King Hui of Wei, declared himself an independent sovereign and concentrated on economic developments, including irrigation projects at the Yellow River. Hui felt that Qin in the west was weak and their land a barren waste. He focused on conquering the well-settled eastern lands which were richer in known resources. However, a series of battles including the battle of Maling in 341 checked Wei's ambitions while Qin's expansion went largely unimpeded, boosting its economy and military strength. Early strengthening of the state of Wei resulted from adoption of Legalist reforms proposed by Li Kui (, c. 459 - c. 395 BCE). =Defeat= Wei eventually lost the western Hexi (Ê≤≥Ë•ø) region, a strategic area of pastoral land on the west bank of the Yellow River between the border of modern-day Shanxi and Shaanxi, to Qin. Thereafter, it remained continuously at war with Qin, requiring the capital to be moved from Anyi to Daliang. Wei surrendered to Qin in 225 , after the Qin general Wang Ben diverted the Yellow River into Daliang, destroying the capital in a flood. Rulers #Marquess Wen of Wei, personal name Si (ÊñØ) or Du (ÈÉΩ), (445-396 ) #Marquess Wu of Wei, personal name Ji (Êìä), son of Marquess Wen, (396-370 ) #King Hui of Wei, personal name Ying (ÁΩÉ), son of Marquess Wu, (370-319 ) #King Xiang of Wei (È≠èË•ÑÁéã), personal name Si (Âó£) or He (Ëµ´), son of King Hui, (319-296 ) #King Zhao of Wei (È≠èÊò≠Áéã), personal name Chi (ÈÅ´), son of King Xiang, (296-277 ) #King Anxi of Wei (È≠èÂÆâÈáêÁéã),personal name Yu (Âúâ), son of King Zhao, (277-243 ) #King Jingmin of Wei (È≠èÊôØÊπ£Áéã), personal name Zeng (Â¢û) or Wu (Âçà), son of King Anxi, (243-228 ) #King Jia, (È≠èÁéãÂÅá), personal name Jia (ÂÅá), son of King Jingmin, (228-225 ) According to Sima Qian's Records of the Grand Historian written in the 1st century, the list of rulers is slightly different: King Hui died in 335 and was succeeded by his son King Xiang in 334. King Xiang died in 319 and was succeeded by his son King Ai (), who died in 296 and was succeeded by his son King Zhao. However, the majority of scholars and commentators believe that King Ai, whose personal name is not recorded, never existed. It seems that Sima Qian assigned the second part of the reign of King Hui (starting in 334, on which date Marquess Hui probably proclaimed himself King) to his son King Xiang and added King Ai to fill in the gap between 319 and 296. On the other hand, a minority of scholars believe King Ai did indeed exist.

One day, Longyang began to weep. When questioned, Longyang said he saw his own future in how he had treated a fish. Happy to have the catch at first, Longyang had wanted to throw it back when he caught a better fish. He wept, \\"I am also a previously-caught fish!

Zhao is the 1st surname in the famous Hundred Family Surnames ‚Äì the traditional list of all Chinese surnames ‚Äì because it was the emperor's surname of the Song Dynasty (960‚Äì1279) when the list was compiled. The first line of the poem is in the line Ë∂ôÈå¢Â≠´Êùé (Zhao, Qian, Sun, Li). A 2013 study found it to be the 9th most common surnames, shared by 26,700,000 people or 2.000% of the population, with the province with the most being Henan. Zhao may be romanized as Chiu from the Cantonese pronunciation, and is romanized in Taiwan and Hong Kong as Chao as in the Wade‚ÄìGiles system. It is cognate with the Vietnamese family name Tri·ªáu and with the Korean family name most commonly romanized as Cho (Ï°∞). The romanization is shared with the much rarer family name Zh√†o (ÂÖÜ). History Zhao is one of the most ancient of Chinese surnames, and its origins are partly shrouded in legend. During the reign of King Mu of Zhou (976/956 BC ‚Äì 922/918 BC), an officer named Zaofu () proved exceptionally adept at training horses and driving chariots and won the respect of King Mu. During a battle with the eastern state of Xu, an ethnically different state which was resisting Zhou rule, Zaofu drove a chariot into the battle and escorted King Mu back to the Zhou capital. In gratitude, King Mu enfeoffed Zaofu as the lord of Zhao, a town in what is now Hongdong County, Shanxi Province, to be held by his descendants in perpetuity. Zaofu's descendants took Zhao as a surname to mark their prestigious association with the city. Records such as Sima Qian's Records of the Grand Historian say that Zaofu was a descendant of legendary kings Zhuanxu, Shaohao, and the Yellow Emperor. The town Zhao became part of the state of Jin during the Warring States period, when the Zhou Dynasty began to collapse. In 403 BC, Jin split into three smaller states, one of which was the state of Zhao. The Zhao clan rulers of State of Qin and State of Zhao were highly successful, and State of Zhao were one of the last major states conquered by the State of Qin during its unification of China. As with all ancient Chinese surnames, the Zhao family was constantly added to by marriages, its bestowal upon commoners for meritorious deeds, and its adoption by non-Chinese peoples assimilated into Han Chinese culture. The Zhao name experienced a great revival after Zhao Kuangyin became the first emperor of the Song Dynasty in 960 AD, leading to 300 years of Zhao rule over China. Notably, it is during this dynasty that the famous Hundred Family Surnames ‚Äì the traditional list of all Chinese surnames ‚Äì was compiled, leading the surname Zhao, that of the royal house, to be the first name listed. However, some cadet clans on the mainland have genealogy records preserved from the Cultural Revolution as well as some Hata clans of Japan, which could trace back to a significant amount of generations to verify the authenticity of the bloodline. Evolution of the Zhao clan  Modern culture  In Lu Xun's novel The True Story of Ah Q, Ah Q said he belonged to the same clan as Mr. Zhao, who was an honored landlord of the village. Mr. Zhao was very angry. He slapped Ah Q's face and said, 'How could you be named Zhao!‚ÄîDo you think you are worthy of the name Zhao?' Since 2015 or earlier, in Chinese internet, Zhao became the intimation of Communist Party of China and 'State of Zhao' became the intimation of China. Similarly, 'The Zhao Family' refers to the dignitaries of China, and \\"The Zhao's Army\\" refers to People's Liberation Army. 'How could you be named Zhao!' is popular to satirize the people who are humble but pretend to be powerful. In 2016, the blog writer Program Think set up a GitHub project named Zhao.

Republican era coinage  The Romans replaced the usage of Greek coins, first by bronze ingots, then by disks known as aes rude. The system thus named as was introduced in ca. 280 BC as a large cast bronze coin during the Roman Republic. The following fractions of the were also produced: the (), (), (), (), (), (), ((), also a common weight unit), and (), as well as multiples of the as, the (2), (2), . An etching of a Roman Republican as After the as had been issued as a cast coin for about seventy years, and its weight had been reduced in several stages, a as was introduced (meaning that it weighed one- sixth of a pound). At about the same time a silver coin, the denarius, was also introduced. Earlier Roman silver coins had been struck on the Greek weight standards that facilitated their use in southern Italy and across the Adriatic, but all Roman coins were now on a Roman weight standard. The denarius, or 'tenner', was at first tariffed at ten asses, but in about 140 B.C. it was retariffed at sixteen asses. This is said to have been a result of financing the Punic Wars. During the Republic, the as featured the bust of Janus on the obverse, and the prow of a galley on the reverse. The as was originally produced on the libral and then the reduced libral weight standard. The bronze coinage of the Republic switched from being cast to being struck as the weight decreased. During certain periods, no asses were produced at all.  Imperial era coinage  Nero as Following the coinage reform of Augustus in 23 BC, the as was struck in reddish pure copper (instead of bronze), and the or 'two-and-a-halfer' (originally 2.5 asses, but now four asses) and the (2 asses) were produced in a golden-colored alloy of bronze known by numismatists as . The as continued to be produced until the 3rd century AD. It was the lowest valued coin regularly issued during the Roman Empire, with semis and being produced infrequently, and then not at all sometime after the reign of Marcus Aurelius. The last as seems to have been produced by Aurelian between 270 and 275 and at the beginning of the reign of Diocletian.  Byzantine coinage  The as, under its Greek name assarion, was re-established by the Emperor Andronikos II Palaiologos (r. 1282‚Äì1328) and minted in great quantities in the first half of the 14th century. It was a low-quality flat copper coin, weighing ca. 3‚Äì4 grams and forming the lowest denomination of contemporary Byzantine coinage, being exchanged at 1:768 to the gold hyperpyron. It appears that the designs on the assarion changed annually, hence they display great variations. The assarion was replaced in 1367 by two other copper denominations, the tournesion and the follaro.

It was founded on October 9, 1868 by Brigham Young. For many years it used the slogan, \\"America's First Department Store\\". History Even though The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (LDS Church) had been headquartered in the Salt Lake area for some 20 years by that time, they were despised by the surrounding community, as Young had disparaged non-Mormon merchants who had engaged in price gouging on necessities, and encouraged boycotting these businesses in 1866. Mormon business owners were routinely charged higher prices by wholesalers who discovered they were dealing with Mormons. Partly because of the impending completion of the railroad, and partly to create a more fair business atmosphere, it was Young's idea to encourage Mormon businesses to band together under one roof. By pooling their resources, they were able to make larger orders to sell materials and goods exclusively (at the time) to fellow LDS Church members. ZCMI was formally organized in 1868 and incorporated for a 25-year renewable contract in 1870. The central component of this was the LDS Church's purchase of the Eagle Emporium, a conglomerate of mercantile companies owned by William Jennings. ZCMI became a formidable business force, eventually manufacturing its own line of boots and shoes, and a line of work clothes. It also sold everything from housing needs, lumber, nails, and the like, to household needs such as fabric, needles, thread, food preservation products, furniture, and draperies, even some beauty products; nearly everything the pioneers needed to survive and thrive. Based in Salt Lake City, Utah, it quickly became a household name in the community. The LDS Church was a significant influence in the company, retaining a majority interest in ZCMI until its eventual sale in December 1999. The store was established by a vote from the Council of Fifty, an early organization in the LDS Church. In 1990, ZCMI opened its first concept store called ZCMI II. Featuring a smaller floor plan than its usual stores, this concept sold solely men's and women's clothing and shoes, while lacking other departments such as housewares, linens, and children's clothing. The first of these opened at Tri City Mall in Mesa, Arizona in 1990. In December 1999, as a result of losses for two consecutive years, along with mounting economic and social pressures, ZCMI was sold to the May Department Stores Company (now Macy's, Inc.). ZCMI operated under its original name as a part of May's Portland, Oregon-based Meier & Frank division until April 2002, when the stores adopted the Meier & Frank name. In addition to the name change, the Utah stores in Logan and St. George, along with the Idaho stores in Idaho Falls and Pocatello, were sold to Dillard's. By August 2002 the stores were further consolidated within May into the company's Los Angeles, California division, Robinsons-May, though retaining the Meier & Frank nameplate. The facade of ZCMI was used in the City Creek Center, retaining the original ZCMI nameplate as a front for Macy's.

Santa Giulia Museum, Brescia. The gens Lucilia was a plebeian family at ancient Rome. The most famous member of this gens was the poet Gaius Lucilius, who flourished during the latter part of the second century BC.Dictionary of Greek and Roman Biography and Mythology, vol. II, p. 822 (\\"Lucilia Gens\\"). Although many Lucilii appear in Roman history, the only one known to have obtained any of the higher offices of the Roman state was Lucilius Longus, consul suffectus in AD 7. Origin The nomen Lucilius is a patronymic surname, derived from the common Latin praenomen Lucius.Chase, p. 125 The satirist Lucilius is said to have come from Suessa Aurunca, an ancient town of the Aurunci, where a Latin colony was established in 313 BC.Juvenal, i. 20. Branches and cognomina In the time of the Republic, the surnames of the Lucilii were Balbus and Bassus, the former originally referring to one who stammers, and the latter referring to someone stout or sturdy. Later, in imperial times, we find Capito, given to one with a large or prominent head, and Longus, \\"tall\\". Rufus, commonly given to someone with red hair, appears on coins of the Lucilii, but the cognomen is not mentioned by any ancient writer. A number of the Lucilii are mentioned without a surname.Chase, pp. 109, 110. Members * Gaius Lucilius, the originator of Roman satire, lived during the second century BC, and is said to have served in the Roman cavalry under Scipio Aemilianus during the Numantine War.

She was in commission (in active service) from October 1980 through July 1998. Her primary missions were in defending aircraft carrier task forces in air defense (AAW) and antisubmarine warfare (ASW) by using her guided missiles, radar systems, and sonar systems. Since Arkansas had the high speed and unlimited range provided by her nuclear reactors, she usually escorted the nuclear-powered aircraft carriers of the U.S. Navy. With her Harpoon anti-ship missiles, Tomahawk missiles, and two naval guns, USS Arkansas was also capable of attacking enemy surface ships, carrying out shore bombardments, and attacking land targets over inland (with her Tomahawk cruise missiles in the latter case). For her short-range self-defense, especially for defense against enemy anti-ship missiles, Arkansas carried two automated Phalanx radar-directed rapid-fire guns. Also, her two 5-inch rapid-fire naval guns had some capability for anti-aircraft defense. Her six torpedo tubes, which fired Mk 46 lightweight torpedoes, were for close-in, last-ditch defense against enemy submarines that had evaded her outer defense line of ASROC missiles, and the long-range ASW aircraft of her task force. After USS Arkansas was decommissioned and all of her weapons, computers, sensors, communication equipment and other complex components, removed, her hulk was sent into the Navy's nuclear ship recycling program for the removal, recycling, and disposal of all of her fuel and other radioactive equipment, and this task was completed in Washington state on 1 November 1999, with the rest of her hulk sold as scrap metal. Construction The keel of Arkansas was laid on 17 January 1977 at the Newport News Shipbuilding Company in Newport News, Virginia. This warship was launched on 21 October 1978, sponsored by Betty Bumpers, the wife of U.S. Senator Dale Bumpers of Arkansas). She was commissioned into the U.S. Navy on 18 October 1980, with Captain Dennis S. Read as her first commanding officer. History USS Arkansas spent the first months following her commissioning in the area of Hampton Roads, Virginia, while detailed, minor shortcomings in her construction were corrected. Late in February 1981, she made a voyage from Virginia to Puerto Rico and back, and then preparations were resumed for her shakedown training. In March, she completed contractor's sea trials, and she carried out a public relations visit to Port Everglades, Florida. April brought a series of underway qualifications and certifications. On 28 April, Arkansas steamed out from Norfolk to carry out shakedown training in the West Indies. This training cruise included more tests and trials, port visits at several Caribbean Islands, and her first voyage south of the Equator to visit Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, and Recife, Brazil. Arkansas returned to the port of Norfolk on 25 June, and then she began a period of postshakedown availability at the Newport News Shipbuilding Co. Arkansas completed her maintenance and performance upgrades on 15 December, and then she steamed out for three more days of sea trials. She returned to her seaport for shore leave for her crew for the rest of 1981. An explosive charge is detonated off the starboard side of the nuclear-powered guided missile cruiser USS Arkansas during a shock test, 17 March 1982 The warship did not get underway again until three weeks into 1982. She put to sea on 22 January and then steamed south to Key West, Florida, where she underwent explosive shock tests. In the intervals between the several tests, Arkansas visited Mayport, Florida, and Port Everglades for work on some of her equipment. Returning north at the beginning of March, she entered the yard at the Newport News Shipbuilding Co. for two months of post- shakedown repairs. Arkansas carried out sea trials on 3 and 4 May, and then she returned to Newport News, for another eleven days to correct minor malfunctions. She arrived back in Norfolk on 20 May, and on the next day, she began local operations from her home port. Over the ensuing four months, Arkansas carried out a schedule of training operations conducted mostly off the Virginia Capes. Two missions, however, took her south to the West Indies. From 23 June to 16 July, the vessel steamed to Guant√°namo Bay, Cuba, for refresher training. Between 24 September and 16 October, Arkansas escorted the nuclear aircraft carrier during an operational readiness exercise that was carried out around Puerto Rico. Upon her return to Norfolk in mid-October, Arkansas began preparations for her first tour of duty with the 6th Fleet in the Mediterranean Sea. The guided-missile cruiser embarked upon that assignment on 10 November 1982. She completed the transatlantic voyage on 30 November, then set out across the Mediterranean bound for the coast of troubled Lebanon. She arrived on station near Beirut on 6 December. Though Arkansas spent most of her time supporting the multinational force ashore in its efforts to keep peace in Lebanon, she left the eastern Mediterranean occasionally for port calls and to participate in some of the 6th Fleet's freedom-of-navigation maneuvers into the Gulf of Sidra off the coast of Libya. The warship completed her final tour on station near Lebanon on 4 May 1983 and laid in a course for Gibraltar. After a two-day visit to the \\"Rock,\\" Arkansas got underway for Norfolk on 10 May. The cruiser stood into her home port again at the end of the third week in May. Norfolk, however, remained her home port only for the duration of her post-deployment standdown period. On 8 July, Arkansas began the long voyage to her new base of operations at Alameda, California Steaming by way of Port Everglades in Florida and Charlotte Amalie in the U.S. Virgin Islands, she arrived in the Canal Zone on 21 July and transited the Panama Canal on 22 July. From there, the warship headed north to Alameda, reaching her destination on 31 July.She spent the next five weeks at her new home port clearing up incidentals attendant to the shift of bases and carried out nuclear propulsion safety training. Normal operations at sea resumed during the second week of September and occupied the guided-missile cruiser for the remainder of 1983 and the first six weeks of 1984. Between 12 and 14 February 1984, Arkansas made the passage from Alameda to Bremerton, Washington, where she entered the Puget Sound Naval Shipyard for a three-month repair period. The warship returned to Alameda in mid-May and readied herself for a deployment that became a circumnavigation of the globe. On 1 June, Arkansas put to sea on the first leg of her long voyage. En route to Hawaii, she participated in the multinational exercise Operation RIMPAC 84. She spent the latter half of June conducting exercises in the Hawaiian islands then resumed the voyage west on 2 July. Arkansas arrived at Subic Bay on 20 July and remained in the Philippines until the beginning of August. At that time, she set out for Hong Kong where she visited during the period 6 to 10 August. From there, Arkansas headed for the Indian Ocean. The guided-missile cruiser served almost three months in the Indian Ocean, primarily in that portion known as the Arabian Sea where the protracted war between Iraq and revolutionary Iran threaten to engulf their neighbors and perhaps involve the superpowers as well. On 1 November, Arkansas entered the Red Sea on her way to the Suez Canal. She passed through the canal on 3 November and, after an expeditious passage, became the first nuclear powered vessel to sail the canalhttps://www.washingtonpost.com/archive/politics/1984/11/06/us-nuclear- ship-uses-canal/4df3286a-62cc-4bf3-8599-89ed83bd31de/ before stopping at Toulon, France, from 7 to 12 November. Returning to sea the next day, the warship shaped a course through the Strait of Gibraltar and across the Atlantic. She rounded out her circumnavigation with calls at the Azores, Barbados and St. Thomas. Arkansas transited the Panama Canal on 9 December and reached Alameda on 17 November. Post-deployment standdown kept her in port at Alameda through the end of 1984 and into February 1985. Between 17 and 19 February, Arkansas steamed north to Bremerton for a four-month restricted availability during which she was armed with Tomahawk cruise missiles and the Phalanx CIWS close-in air defense system. Back at Alameda on 25 June, the guided-missile cruiser resumed training operations out of her home port soon thereafter. The usual exercises, inspections and examinations kept her busy through the summer and fall of 1985. On 7 December, the warship began preparations for overseas movement. USS Arkansas passing close along the starboard side of the aircraft carrier in the Pacific Ocean on 9 April 1986 The usual year-end holiday leave and upkeep period interrupted her efforts to get ready for the upcoming deployment, but the guided-missile cruiser put to sea as scheduled on 15 January 1986. Again she participated in exercises during the passage, stopped at Pearl Harbor, and spent only a brief period of time in the western Pacific. By mid-March, after visits to Subic Bay and Singapore, she made her way across the Indian Ocean to Karachi, Pakistan. The guided-missile cruiser called at Karachi between 15 and 20 March then resumed her voyage to the Arabian Sea. Once more, Arkansas patrolled the waters of the troubled Middle East. However, her sojourn in the Arabian Sea lasted only until late April. On 29 and 30 April, she transited the Suez Canal and headed for another hot spot. During the month of May and June, Arkansas served with the aircraft carrier and the guided missile cruiser off the coast of Libya in the wake of the air strikes launched on that country by the United States in reprisal for terrorist activity against Americans. During her stay in the Mediterranean, she paid visits to Monaco and Gaeta, Italy. Arkansas left the Mediterranean at the end of June and shaped a course for Australia. On 4 July, the same day as the Centennial re-dedication of the Statue of Liberty, she held another line-crossing ceremony, somewhere west of Africa. She stopped at Fremantle between 18 and 22 July and then headed for Subic Bay where she laid over for two days at the end of the month. From there, the warship headed for Pearl Harbor, where she paused overnight on 8 and 9 August. She arrived back in her home port on 13 August. Arkansas remained at Alameda until late September for the leave and upkeep period that usually follows an extended tour of duty overseas. Early in October, the warship resumed local operations along the west coast. She remained so occupied for the rest of 1986. =1990s= In 1990 Arkansas conducted extended counter-drug operations off the west coast of Central America. Vigilance was rewarded at the conclusion of that deployment as MV Nordkapp carrying 14 tons of cocaine was interdicted near Clipperton Island. Nordkapp was set afire and scuttled by her crew. Arkansas delivered the crew to the US Coast Guard in San Diego where they were subsequently tried and convicted in federal court. In May 1991, Arkansas deployed to the Persian Gulf as part of the carrier battle group. While en route to the Persian Gulf, Arkansas made a port call at Subic Bay, RP just as Mount Pinatubo erupted in June 1991. Arkansas participated in Operation Fiery Vigil making two voyages from Subic Bay to Cebu transporting military and dependent personnel evacuating from Clark AFB escaping the volcanic activity. In 1996, Arkansas was part of the carrier battle group off the coast of Iraq and participated in the Rugged Nautilus exercise and Operation Desert Strike, though for the latter she played a support role as she was not equipped to fire any land-attack missiles. Early decommissioning The decision had been made in 1993 to cancel the mid-life refueling overhauls of the Virginia-class cruisers. With the end of the Cold War, the extra costs of the nine nuclear powered cruisers was no longer seen as justified and the later stages of the Vietnam War had heightened concerns about the risks of action damage to nuclear powered surface vessels. Arkansas was decommissioned on 7 July 1998 and entered the US Navy's Nuclear-Powered Ships Recycling Program. She had once been considered for preservation as a museum ship in her namesake state, but as an ocean-going vessel, would not have been able to navigate inland rivers, except during the springtime flood of the Mississippi River. Artifacts from Arkansas, including the ship's bell and anchor, are on public display at the Arkansas Inland Maritime Museum in North Little Rock, Arkansas. Her 16,000 pound bow anchor is on display at the Craighead county courthouse, in Jonesboro Arkansas.

Before that, it was first described as a genus. Nowadays, this group is not considered a valid taxon anymore, because it is paraphyletic. The name Cynthia Fabricius, 1807 is now a junior subjective synonym of Vanessa Fabricius, 1807. In English, the species of the Cynthia group are sometimes collectively referred to as the painted ladies, although the name \\"painted lady\\" usually specifically refers to the near-cosmopolitan species Vanessa cardui. The Cynthia group includes at least five species (to which some authors add other South American Vanessa species): * the Painted lady (Vanessa cardui), which is almost global in its distribution, * the Australian painted lady (Vanessa kershawi), mostly present in Australia, * the American (painted) lady (Vanessa virginiensis), mostly in North America, * the West Coast lady (Vanessa annabella) in Western North America, * the Western painted lady (Vanessa carye) in South America. Distinguishing features The Painted lady (V. cardui) is a large butterfly (wing span ) identified by the black and white corners of its mainly deep orange, black-spotted wings. It has five white spots in the black forewing tips and while the orange areas may be pale here and there, there are no clean white dots in them. The hindwings carry four small submarginal eyespots on the dorsal and ventral sides. Those on the dorsal side are black, but in the summer morph sometimes small blue pupils are present. The Australian painted lady (V. kershawi) is quite similar to V. cardui. Its four ventral eyespots are less clearly defined, and it always sports at least three (often four) blue pupil spots on its dorsal hindwing. Caterpillars are found mainly on Ammobium alatum. The American painted lady (V. virginiensis) is most easily distinguishable by its two large hindwing eyespots on the ventral side. V. virginiensis also features a white dot within the subapical field of the forewings set in pink on the ventral side, and often as a smaller clean white dot in the orange of the dorsal side too. A less reliable indicator is the row of eyespots on the dorsal submarginal hindwing; V. virginiensis often has two larger outer spots with blue pupils. The black forewing tips have four to five white spots; usually the largest is whitish orange. The West Coast lady (V. annabella) and the Western painted lady (V. carye) are two very similar- looking species that occur in separate ranges (North and South America, respectively). They do not have obvious ventral eyespots. On the dorsal side, they lack the white dot in the subapical orange found in V. virginiensis, and are a purer orange color. V. annabella and V. carye have a fully orange subapical band and leading edge on the forewing. Their submarginal row of hindwing spots features three or four blue pupils. Their two larger pupils are the inner spots, rather than the outer spots as in corresponding V. virginiensis. 0 Belle-dame (Vanessa cardui) - Echinacea purpurea - Havr√© (3).jpgVanessa cardui Australian painted lady butterfly 01.jpgVanessa kershawi American Lady Vanessa virginiensis Upper Wings 1609px.jpgVanessa virginiensis Painted Lady (32780566383).jpgVanessa annabella Vanessa carye (vista superior) cropped.jpgVanessa carye Painted Lady Vanessa cardui (3951977439).jpgVanessa cardui Australian painted lady feeding.jpgVanessa kershawi American Lady - Independent and Free (2636679841).jpgVanessa virginiensis Painted Lady (25766712178).jpgVanessa annabella Vanessa carye Ecuador 02.jpgVanessa carye References  External links  *Butterflies and Moths of North America: Vanessa cardui, V. virginiensis, V. annabella. *Butterflies of America: Vanessa cardui, V. virginiensis, V. annabella, V. carye.

(stylized as Br√∏derbund) was an American maker of video games, educational software, and productivity tools. Broderbund is best known for the 8-bit video game hits Choplifter, Lode Runner, Karateka, and Prince of Persia (all of which originated on the Apple II), as well as The Print Shop‚Äîoriginally for printing signs and banners on dot matrix printers‚Äîand the Myst and Carmen Sandiego games. The company was founded in Eugene, Oregon, and moved to San Rafael, California, then later to Novato, California.\\"About Broderbund.\\" Broderbund. April 12, 1997. Retrieved on June 3, 2011. \\"Broderbund Software, Inc. 500 Redwood Blvd. Novato, California 94948\\" Broderbund was purchased by The Learning Company in 1998. Many of Broderbund's software titles, such as The Print Shop, PrintMaster, and Mavis Beacon, are still published under the name \\"Broderbund\\". Games released by the revived Broderbund are distributed by Encore, Inc. Broderbund is now the brand name for Riverdeep's graphic design, productivity, and edutainment titles such as The Print Shop, Carmen Sandiego, Mavis Beacon Teaches Typing, the Living Books series, and Reader Rabbit titles, in addition to publishing software for other companies, notably Zone Labs' ZoneAlarm. They would often release school editions of their games, which contained extra features to allow teachers to use the software to facilitate students' learning. Etymology The word \\"br√∏derbund\\" is not an actual word in any language but is a somewhat loose translation of \\"band of brothers\\" into a mixture of Danish, Dutch, German, and Swedish. The \\"√∏\\" in \\"br√∏derbund\\" was used partially as a play on the Norwegian/Danish letter √∏ but was mainly referencing the slashed zero found in mainframes, terminals, and early personal computers. The three crowns above the logo are also a reference to the lesser national coat of arms of Sweden. The company's name is pronounced instead of the popularly used . History Broderbund was founded by brothers Doug and Gary Carlston in 1980 for the purpose of marketing Galactic Empire, a strategy computer game that Doug Carlston had created in 1979. Before founding the company, Doug was a lawyer and Gary had held a number of jobs, including teaching Swedish at an American college. Their sister Cathy joined the company a year later from Lord & Taylor. Galactic Empire had many names taken from African languages; a group of merchants was named Broederbond, Afrikaans for \\"association of brothers\\". To emphasize its family origin while avoiding a connection with the ethnonationalist Afrikaner organization of the same name, the Carlstons altered the spelling when naming their company \\"Broderbund\\". By 1982 Broderbund produced arcade games which, the company told Jerry Pournelle, sold much better than strategy games. Burr, Egan, Deleage & Co. invested in the company that year. By early 1984 InfoWorld estimated that Broderbund was tied with Human Engineered Software as the world's tenth-largest microcomputer- software company and largest entertainment-software company, with $13 million in 1983 sales. That year it took over the assets of the well-regarded but financially troubled Synapse Software. Although intending to keep it running as a business, they were unable to make money from Synapse's products, and closed it down after a year. Broderbund's The Print Shop software produced signs and greeting cards. Broderbund started discussions with Unison World about creating a version that would run on DOS. The two companies could not agree on a contract, but Unison World developed a DOS product with similar function and a similar user interface. Broderbund sued for infringement of their copyright. Broderbund v. Unison (1986) became a landmark case in establishing that the look and feel of a software product could be subject to copyright protection. Sierra On-Line and Broderbund ended merger discussions in March 1991. By that year Broderbund had about $50 million in revenue, and 25% share of the education market. It developed most of its software, as opposed to publishing software others had developed; Doug Carlston stated the company needed \\"to control our own sources, to control our future\\". After an unsuccessful initial public offering in 1987, Broderbund executed a private placement for 20% of shares with Jostens. It became a public company in November 1991; its NASDAQ symbol was BROD. When Broderbund went public The Print Shop comprised 33% of total revenue, and the Carmen Sandiego series 26%. The company's stock price and market capitalization climbed steadily to a maximum of nearly US$80/share in late 1995, and then fell steadily in the face of continued losses for a number of years. Broderbund acquired PC Globe in July 1992. The Learning Company purchased Broderbund in 1998 for about US$420 million in stock. Broderbund had initially attempted to purchase the original The Learning Company in 1995, but was outbid by SoftKey, who purchased The Learning Company for $606 million in cash and then adopted its name. The Learning Company then bought Broderbund in 1998 and in a move to rationalize costs, The Learning Company terminated 500 employees at Broderbund the same year, representing 42% of the company's workforce. Doug Carlston explained that in a bid to roll up Broderbund, The Learning Company utilised one of their previous acquisitions to weaken the company's stronghold over the industry. They allegedly gave a rebate to Mindscape's PrintMaster, a direct competitor to Broderbund's Print Shop, that was more than the product was worth. In 1999, the combined company was purchased by Mattel for $3.6 billion. Mattel reeled from the financial impact of this transaction, and Jill E. Barad, the CEO, ended up being forced out in a climate of investor outrage. Mattel sold their game division Mattel Interactive as well as all its assets in September 2000 to Gores Technology Group, a private acquisitions firm, for a share of whatever Gores could obtain by selling the company. During this time, Broderbund products were owned by The Learning Company Deutschland GmbH, located in Oberhaching, Germany. Headed by Jean-Pierre Nordmann, the company was a subsidiary of The Learning Company LLC, which itself was a wholly owned subsidiary of Gores Technology Group. The company published games under two logos: Blue (Broderbund) and Red (The Learning Company). The Broderbund label was used for \\"high-quality infotainment, design and lifestyle titles such as Cosmopolitan My Style 2 and PrintMaster\\", while The Learning Company label was used for children's software. In 2001, Gores sold The Learning Company's entertainment holdings to Ubi Soft, and most of the other holdings, including the Broderbund name, to Irish company Riverdeep. Many of Broderbund's games, such as the Myst series, are published by Ubisoft. The Broderbund line of products is published by Encore, Inc under license from Riverdeep. Under the terms of the agreement, Encore now manages the Broderbund family of products as well as Broderbund's direct to consumer business. In May 2010 Encore acquired the assets of Punch! Software. In 2014, Doug Carlston donated a collection of Broderbund's business records, software, and a collection of games that includes Myst, Prince of Persia, and Where in the World is Carmen Sandiego? to The Strong National Museum of Play. The Strong National Museum of Play forwarded the collection to the ICHEG museum for preservation. As of 2017, Houghton Mifflin Harcourt is offering the Broderbund, The Print Shop, Calendar Creator, and ClickArt brands for licensing. =Products= Broderbund scored an early hit with the game Galactic Empire, written by Doug Carlston for the TRS-80. The company's first title for the Apple II, Tank Command, was written by the third Carlston brother, Professor Donal Carlston. The company became a powerhouse in the educational and entertainment software markets with titles like Fantavision, Choplifter, Apple Panic, Lode Runner, Karateka, Wings of Fury, Prince of Persia, Where in the World is Carmen Sandiego?, The Guardian Legend, and Myst, which stayed the highest grossing home video game for years. Broderbund became one of the most dominant publishers in the computer market of the 1980s, releasing video games for virtually all major computer systems in the United States.\\"Broderbund Company Information\\" , GameFAQs. Retrieved December 9, 2010. Like most early computer gaming developers, Broderbund began as an Apple II-focused company and began expanding to other platforms as time went along. They released IBM PC ports of a few games very early on, however, it was not until after 1985 that Broderbund would seriously develop for PC compatibles. Due to their strong focus on education titles, they were one of a few devs to actively support the Apple IIgs in the late 1980s. Some of the more popular Broderbund titles were licensed to Western European and Japanese developers and ported to systems in those regions. During the 1990s, Broderbund mostly concentrated on educational titles for PCs and Macintoshes with a few forays into RPGs and strategy games. Broderbund published the Print Shop series of desktop publishing making programs; Family Tree Maker (a genealogy program supported by hundreds of CDs of public genealogy data); 3D Home Architect, a program for designing and visualizing family homes; and Banner Mania, a program for designing and printing multi-page banners. By the end of the 1980s, games represented only a few percent of Broderbund's annual sales, which by then were heavily focused in the productivity arena and early education and learning areas. Just before being acquired by The Learning Company, Broderbund spun off its Living Books series by forming a joint venture with Random House Publishing. Despite the success and quality of the Living Books series, the joint venture was only marginally successful and was dissolved with The Learning Company deal. For a brief time, Broderbund was involved in the video game console market when it published a few games for the Nintendo Entertainment System (NES) through its New Ventures Division. All of Broderbund's games for the NES, including the port of its own franchises Lode Runner, Spelunker, and Raid on Bungeling Bay, were developed by third-party Japanese companies. Broderbund published some titles that were produced by companies that didn't have a North American subsidiary, such as Compile's The Guardian Legend, Imagineer's The Battle of Olympus, and Legacy of the Wizard, the fourth installment in Nihon Falcom's Dragon Slayer series. Broderbund also developed and marketed an ill-fated motion sensitive NES controller device called the U-Force, which was operated without direct physical contact between the player and the device. In 1990, Broderbund sold its New Ventures Division, including manufacturing equipment, inventory, and assets, to then-fledgling company THQ. Broderbund released in the United States Arsys Software's 1986 third-person action RPG shooter WiBArm, Reprinted from Broderbund briefly had a board game division, which published Don Carlston's Personal Preference, along with several board game versions of its video games.

It was also a direct competitor to Sony's MiniDisc (MD), but neither format toppled the then-ubiquitous analog cassette despite their technical superiority, and DCC was discontinued in . Another competing format, the Digital Audio Tape (DAT) had by also failed to sell in large quantities to consumers, although it was popular as a professional digital audio storage format. The DCC form factor is similar to the analog compact cassette, and DCC recorders and players can play back either type: analog as well as DCC. This backward compatibility was intended to allow users to adopt digital recording without rendering their existing tape collections obsolete, but because DCC recorders couldn't record (only play back) analog cassettes, it effectively forced consumers to either replace their cassette deck with a DCC recorder and give up analog recording, or keep the existing cassette deck and make space to add the DCC recorder to their setup.  History  Philips DCC portable player DCC signaled the parting of ways of Philips and Sony, who had previously worked together successfully on the audio CD, CD-ROM, and CD-i. The companies had also worked together on the Digital Audio Tape which was successful in professional environments, but was perceived as too expensive and fragile for consumers. Furthermore, the recording industry had been fighting against digital recording in court, resulting in the Audio Home Recording Act and SCMS. Philips had developed the Compact Cassette in and allowed companies to use the format royalty-free, which made it hugely successful but not a significant money-maker. The company saw a market for a digital version of the cassette, and expected that the product would be popular if it could be made compatible with the analog cassette. Furthermore, it was expected that prerecorded DCC's would generate income via the company's Polygram record company. Around , Philips participated in the Eureka 147 project that eventually produced the DAB standard. For this, it cooperated with the Institute for Perception Research of the Eindhoven University of Technology to create the PASC compression algorithm based on psychoacoustics. On , Philips made the first formal announcement of DCC. Tandy Corporation announced at the same time that it would help Philips with the development and distribution through its Tandy and RadioShack stores. It was expected at the time that DCC recorders would be available in the beginning of 1992 and would cost several hundred dollars less than DAT recorders. Even though this first announcement already used the term \\"digital compact cassette\\" (without capitalization), some publications around this time also referred to it as S-DAT (stationary-head digital audio tape), to distinguish it from R-DAT (rotary-head digital audio tape). On , Philips announced that Matsushita had joined forces with them to develop DCC. The first DCC recorders were introduced at the CES in Chicago in and at the Firato consumer electronics show in Amsterdam in . At that time, not only Philips and Technics (brand of Matsushita) announced DCC recorders but also other brands such as Grundig and Marantz (both related to Philips at the time). Around the same time, Sony introduced the MiniDisc. More recorders and players were introduced by Philips and other manufacturers in the following years, including some portable players and recorders as well as in-dash DCC/radio combinations for automotive use. At the \\"HCC-dagen\\" computer fair in Utrecht, Netherlands, between and , Philips presented the DCC-175 portable recorder that can be connected to an IBM-compatible PC using the \\"PC-link\\" cable. This was the only DCC recorder that can be connected to, and controlled by a computer, and it was only ever available in the Netherlands. Philips marketed the DCC format mostly in Europe, the United States, and Japan. According to the newspaper article that announced the demise of DCC, DCC was more popular than MiniDisc in Europe (especially in the Netherlands). DCC was quietly discontinued in after Philips admitted it had failed at achieving any significant market penetration with the format, and unofficially conceded victory to Sony. However, the MiniDisc format had not done very well either; the price of both systems had been too high for the younger market, while audiophiles rejected MD and DCC because in their opinion, the lossy compression degraded the audio quality too much.  Technology  Hi-Fi- system-sized DCCs and recorder =Magneto-resistive stationary heads= Unlike helical scan systems such as DAT or VHS, the head is stationary and the tape moves in linear direction relative to the head. Like analog audio tapes, the heads use half of the tape width in each direction. There are 9 tracks per side: eight tracks for the audio, and one track for auxiliary information. The track pitch is 195 Œºm. The head assembly has what Philips called \\"Fixed Azimuth Tape Guidance\\" (FATG) pins, which work together with the \\"Azimuth Locking Pins System\\" (ALPS) in the cassette to guide the tape. DCC used magneto-resistive (MR) heads 70 Œºm wide for playback, and miniaturized coils 185 Œºm wide for recording. The heads were produced using photolithography. Some DCC head assemblies had separate MR heads to play analog tapes, others re-used two DCC heads to pick up the left and right analog audio tracks from the tape. All DCC players and recorders are auto-reverse, so every player and recorder must have a way to position the heads for the A-side as well as the B-side of the tape. In stationary recorders, the mechanism switched sides by pivoting the head assembly 180 degrees (Philips used a modified version of an analog auto-reverse cassette deck during development, on which this mechanism was based),Philips Early DCC Deck Prototype, Dutch Audio Classics. but in portable recorders and players, the head assemblies had heads for the tracks on both sides, which saved space in the mechanism, but made the head assembly more complicated: * Pivoting head mechanisms in stationary recorders such as the DCC-900 used a head assembly that had 9 (MR) playback heads and 9 (coil) recording heads for DCC, plus two (MR) heads for playing analog compact cassettes. The head assembly was mounted on a pivoting mechanism that rotated the head assembly by 180 degrees when it switched from one side of the tape to the other. * Playback-only portable players such as the DCC-130 and DCC-134 used head assemblies with 18 MR heads, nine for each side of the tape. When playing analog cassettes, two of the DCC MR heads were used to pick up the analog audio. * Portable recorders such as the DCC-170 and DCC-175 used head assemblies with 18 MR heads for DCC playback, 18 coil heads for DCC recording, and 4 MR heads for analog playback (a total of 40 heads in one head assembly). Magneto-resistive heads do not use iron so they do not build up residual magnetism. They never need to be demagnetized, and if a magnetic field from e.g. a cassette demagnetizer is applied to MR heads, it induces so much current into the heads that they are damaged or destroyed. Also, it is recommended never to use a cleaning cassette as DCC heads are fragile and this operation could ruin them permanently. =Tape specifications and PASC audio compression= DCC tape is the same width as in analog compact cassettes, and operates at the same speed: per second. The tape that was used in production cassettes was chromium dioxide- or cobalt-doped ferric oxide, 3‚Äì4 ¬µm thick in a total tape thickness of 12 ¬µm,Philips DCC page preserved as part of the DCC FAQ page identical to the tape that was widely in use for video tapes. Nine heads are used to read/write half the width of the tape; the other half of the width are used for the B-side. Eight of these tracks contain audio data, the ninth track is used for auxiliary information such as song titles and track markers, as well as markers to make the player switch from side A to side B (with or without winding towards the end of the tape first) and end-of-tape markers. The (theoretical) maximum capacity of a DCC tape is 120 minutes, compared to 3 hours for DAT; however, no 120-minute tapes were ever produced. Also, because of the time needed for the mechanism to switch direction, there is always a short interruption in the audio between the two sides of the tape. DCC recorders could record from digital sources that used the S/PDIF standard, at sample rates of 32 kHz, 44.1 kHz or 48 kHz, or they could record from analog sources at 44.1 kHz. Because of the low tape speed, the achievable bit rate of DCC is limited. To compensate, DCC uses Precision Adaptive Sub-band Coding (PASC) for audio data compression. PASC was later integrated into the ISO/IEC 11172-3 standard as MPEG-1 Audio Layer I (MP1). Though MP1 allows various bit rates, PASC is fixed at 384 kilobits per second. The bandwidth of a CD recording of approximately 1.4 megabits per second is reduced to 384 kilobits per second, a compression ratio of around 3.68:1. The difference in quality between PASC and the 5:1 compression used by early versions of ATRAC in the original MiniDisc is largely a subjective matter. After adding system information (such as emphasis settings, SCMS information, time code) and adding Reed-Solomon error correction bits to the 384 kbit/s data stream, followed by 8b/10b encoding,Method of transmitting information, encoding device for use in the method, and decoding device for use in the method, . the resulting bit rate on the eight main data tracks tape ends up being twice the rate of the original PASC data: 768 kbit/s, which is recorded onto the eight main data tracks at 96 kbit/s per track in an interleaved pattern.Digital Compact Cassette (DCC) - Matsushita and Philips Develop New Standard. Retrieved 2017-01-16. According to the Philips webpage, it is possible for a DCC player to recover all missing data from a tape, even if one of the 8 audio tracks is completely unreadable, or if all tracks are unreadable for 1.45 mm (about 0.03 seconds). =Auxiliary track= On prerecorded tapes, the information about album artist, album title, and track titles and lengths was recorded on the auxiliary ninth track continuously for the length of the entire tape. This made it possible for players to recognize immediately what the tape position is and how to get to any of the other tracks (including which side of the tape to turn to), as soon as a tape was inserted and playback was started, regardless of whether the tape was rewound before inserting or not. On user tapes, a track marker was recorded at the beginning of every track, so that it was possible to skip and repeat tracks automatically. The markers were automatically recorded when a silence was detected during an analog recording, or when a track marker was received in the S/PDIF signal of a digital input source (this track marker is automatically generated by CD players). It was possible to remove these markers (to \\"merge tracks\\"), or add extra markers (to \\"split tracks\\") without rerecording the audio. Furthermore, it was possible to add markers afterwards that would signal the end of the tape or the end of the tape side, so that during playback, the player would stop the mechanism, fast-forward to the end of the A-side, or switch from A-side to B-side immediately. On later generations of recorders, it was possible to enter title information for each track, which was recorded on the auxiliary track after the start-of-track marker. Because the title information was only stored in one place, unlike prerecorded tapes where users could see the names of all tracks on a tape, it was not possible to see tracks names of any other track than the one that is currently playing. There are some minor compatibility problems with user- recorded titles; for example: * On stationary recorders that had simple fourteen-segment displays, all track information had to be converted to upper- case because on those displays, showing lower-case characters is impossible. They were capable of displaying symbols that are impossible to enter with their own track information editors (such as the apostrophe). * The Philips DCC-822/DCC-824 car stereo with DCC player had a full dot-matrix text display which could display upper-case and lower-case characters on prerecorded tapes as well as user-recorded tapes. * Later-generation portable recorders DCC-170 and DCC-175 were capable of displaying text information from prerecorded tapes, but not from user-recorded tapes. The DCC-175 was capable of writing and reading the text information to/from a super-user tape via the PC, but does not show the user-recorded text information on the display. =User Tapes vs. Super User Tapes= Some Philips documentation distinguishes between \\"user tapes\\" and \\"super user tapes\\". Super user tapes are tapes that have a continuously recorded stream of audio, with continuous absolute time codes relative to the start of the tape, and contiguously numbered tracks. In contrast, non-super user tapes may have one or more section that has no absolute time code and tracks that are unnumbered. The Renumber button that makes the recorder find all the track markers on a tape and makes sure that all track numbers are contiguous (which might not be the case if the user splits or merges tracks), only works on super-user tapes. Other than absolute time codes and track numbers that may become discontinuous or unavailable on a non-super user tape, it's impossible to distinguish between user tapes and super user tapes. To make sure that the absolute time codes remain continuous (and the tape remains a super user tape), the user should start every recording at a point where absolute time codes are available. Some recorders have an APPEND button to find the end of the last recording automatically and prepare the recorder for the next recording. When recording mode is engaged (with or without the APPEND function), the electronics actually read the tape for a fraction of a second, to synchronize the internal absolute time counter with the time recorded on tape, and then start the actual recording at the beginning of a tape frame so that the resulting data stream has a continuous absolute time code. =Copy protection= All DCC recorders used the SCMS copy-protection system, which uses two bits in the S/PDIF digital audio stream and on tape to differentiate between protected vs. unprotected audio, and between original vs. copy: * Recording digitally from a source marked \\"protected\\" and \\"original\\" (produced by an prerecorded DCC or Minidisc, for example) was allowed, but the recorder will change the \\"original\\" bit to the \\"copy\\" state on the new tape to prevent copying of the copy. CDs do not have SCMS bits as the format predates this system. However, the recorder treats the absence of SCMS bits as \\"protected\\" and \\"original\\". Consequently the DCC recording cannot be further copied. * Recording digitally from a source marked \\"unprotected\\" is also allowed; the \\"original/copy\\" marker is ignored. The \\"unprotected\\" bit is preserved in the copy. * Recording digitally from a source marked \\"protected\\" and \\"copy\\" is not allowed: the record button will not work and any ongoing recordings will stop, and an error message is shown on the display. Analog recording was not restricted: tapes recorded from analog source were marked \\"unprotected\\". The only limitation to analog recording on DCC as compared to that on DAT recorders is that the A/D converter was fixed to a sample frequency of 44.1 kHz. On the DCC-175 portable recorder it was possible to circumvent the SCMS protection by copying audio to the hard disk and then back to another tape, using the DCC Studio program. =Cassettes and cases= The DCC cassette and the case that Philips (but not some other cassette manufacturers) used, were designed by Peter Doodson who also designed the CD jewel case. DCC with the shutter manually opened DCCs are similar to compact cassettes, except that there are no \\"bulges\\" where the tape-access holes are located. DCC cassettes are flat and there are no access holes for the hubs on the top side (they are not required because auto-reverse is a standard feature on all DCC decks), so this side can be used for a larger label than can be used on an analog compact cassette. A spring-loaded metal shutter similar to the shutters on 3.5 inch floppy disks and MiniDiscs covers the tape access holes and locks the hubs while the cassette is not in use. Cassettes provide several extra holes and indentations so that DCC recorders can tell a DCC apart from an analog compact cassette, and so they can tell what the length of a DCC tape is. Also, there is a sliding write-protect tab on the DCC to enable and disable recording. Unlike the break-away notches on analog compact cassettes and VHS tapes, this tab makes it easier to make a tape recordable again, and unlike on analog compact cassettes, the marker protects the entire tape rather than just one side. The cases that DCCs came in, generally did not have the characteristic folding mechanism used for analog compact cassettes. Instead, DCC cases tended to be simply plastic boxes that were open on one of the short sides. The front side had a rectangular opening that exposed almost the entire cassette, so that any label on the cassette would be visible even when the cassette was in its case. This allowed the user to slide the cassette into and out of the case with one hand (which was seen as a major advantage for mobile use), and it reduced production costs, especially for prerecorded cassettes, because the case did not need a separate label. Format partner Matsushita and other did, however, produce blank cassettes (under their Panasonic brand) with a clam-shell-style case. Because DCCs have no \\"bulges\\" near the tape access holes, there is more space in the case behind the cassette to insert, for example, a booklet for a prerecorded tape, or a folded up card on which users could write the contents of the tape. In spite of the differences, the outside measurements of the standard DCC cases were exactly identical to the cases of analog compact cassettes, so they could be used in existing storage systems. The Matsushita- designed clam-shell case was slightly thinner than an analog compact cassette case is. =Data recording= There is only one DCC recorder that has the capability of being connected to and controlled by a computer: the DCC-175. It is a portable recorder that was developed by Marantz in Japan (unlike most of the other Philips recorders which were developed in the Netherlands and Belgium), and looks very similar to the other portables available from Philips and Marantz at the time: the DCC-134 and the DCC-170. The DCC-175 was sold only in the Netherlands, and was available separately or in a package with the \\"PC-link\\" data cable which can be used to connect the recorder to a parallel port of an IBM-compatible PC. Only small quantities of both recorder and cable were made, leaving many people searching for one or both at the time of the demise of DCC. The DCC-175 Service ManualDCC-175 Service Manual. Retrieved 2017-01-24. shows that in the recorder, the cable is connected to the I¬≤S bus that carries the PASC bitstream, and it is also connected to a dedicated serial port of the microcontroller, to allow the PC to control the mechanism and to read and write auxiliary information such as track markers and track titles. The parallel port connector of the cable contains a custom chip created especially for this purpose by Philips Key Modules, as well as a standard RAM chip. Philips made no detailed technical information available to the public about the custom chip and therefore it is impossible for people who own a DCC-175 but no PC-link cable to make their own version of the PC-link cable. The PC-link cable package included software consisting of: * DCC Backup for Windows, a backup program * DCC Studio, a sound recorder and editor for Windows * A DCC tape database program that works together with DCC Studio Philips also provided a DOS backup application via their BBS, and later on they provided an upgrade to the DCC Studio software to fix some bugs and provide better compatibility with Windows 95 which had come out just before the release of the DCC-175. The software also works with Windows 98, Windows 98SE and Windows ME, but not with any later versions of Windows. The backup programs for DOS as well as Windows does not support long file names which had been introduced by Windows 95 just a few months before the release. Also, because the tape runs at its usual speed and data rate, it takes 90 minutes to record approximately 250 megabytes of uncompressed data. Other backup media common in those days were faster, had more capacity, and supported long file names, so the DCC backup programs were relatively uninteresting for users. The DCC Studio application, however, was a useful application that made it possible to copy audio from tape to hard disk and vice versa, regardless of the SCMS status of the tape. This made it possible to circumvent SCMS with DCC Studio. The program also allowed users to manipulate the PASC audio files that were recorded to hard disk in various ways: they could change equalization settings, cut/copy and paste track fragments, and place and move audio markers and name those audio markers from the PC keyboard. It was possible to record a mix tape by selecting the desired tracks from a list, and moving the tracks around in a playlist. Then the user could click on the record button to copy the entire playlist back to DCC tape, while simultaneously recording markers (such as reverse and end-of-tape) and track titles. It was not necessary to record the track titles and tape markers separately (as you would do with a stationary recorder), and thanks to the use of a PC keyboard, it was possible to use characters in song titles that were not available when using a stationary machine's remote control. The DCC Studio program used the recorder as playback and recording device, avoiding the need for a separate sound card, an uncommon accessory at the time. Working with the PASC data directly without the need to compress and decompress, it also saved a lot of hard disk space, and most computers in that time would have had a hard time compressing and decompressing PASC data in real time anyway. However, many users complained that they would have liked to have the possibility of using uncompressed WAV audio files with the DCC Studio program, and Philips responded by mailing a floppy disk to registered users, containing programs to convert a WAV file to PASC and vice versa. Unfortunately this software was extremely slow (it takes several hours to compress a few minutes of PCM music in a WAV file to PASC) but it was soon discovered that the PASC files are simply MPEG-1 Audio Layer I files that use an under-documented padding feature of the MPEG standard to make all frames the same length, so then it became easy to use other MPEG decoding software to convert PASC to PCM and vice versa. = DCC Revival = After YouTuber Techmoan released a video in 2014 about the DCC format, it started a revival of interest in the format across the globe. The next year (2015) the DCC Museum opened its doors in Redondo Beach, California. The DCC Museum preserves all DCC equipment and releases new albums on DCC in 2017, 2018 and 2019 (in cooperation With Jeremy Heiden and Causing Change Media) and is curated by Ralf \\"DR DCC\\" Porankiewicz. In the DCCMuseum has released a documentary called DCC... There is still music left to write. Derivatives The technology of using stationary MR heads was later developed by OnStream for use as a data storage media for computers. MR heads are now also commonly used in hard disks, although hard disks now use the giant magnetoresistance variant, whereas DCCs used the earlier anisotropic magnetoresistance.Magnetic Multilayers and Giant Magnetoresistance - Uwe Hartmann, R. Coehoorn et al. Retrieved 2007-10-9. A derivative technology developed originally for DCC is now being used for filtering beer. Silicon wafers with micrometer-scale holes are ideal for separating yeast particles from beer. The beer flows through the silicon wafer leaving the yeast particles behind, which results in a very clear beer. The manufacturing process for the filters was originally developed for the read/write heads of DCC decks.

Oxford University Press. retrieved March 30, 2017. is a well-characterized, medium-sized butterfly with black wings, red bands, and white spots. It has a wingspan of about . It was first described by Carl Linnaeus in his 1758 10th edition of Systema Naturae. The red admiral is widely distributed across temperate regions of North Africa, the Americas, Europe, Asia, and the Caribbean. It resides in warmer areas, but migrates north in spring and sometimes again in autumn. Typically found in moist woodlands, the red admiral caterpillar's primary host plant is the stinging nettle (Urtica dioica); it can also be found on the false nettle (Boehmeria cylindrica). The adult butterfly drinks from flowering plants like Buddleia and overripe fruit. Red admirals are territorial; females will only mate with males that hold territory. Males with superior flight abilities are more likely to successfully court females. It is known as an unusually calm butterfly, often allowing observation at a very close distance before flying away, also landing on and using humans as perches. Geographic range The red admiral is found in temperate regions of North Africa, North and Central America, Europe, Asia, and island regions of Hawaii, New Zealand, and the Caribbean. Description The forewing of this butterfly bears on a black ground an oblique vermilion band and a group of white subapical spots. On the hindwing the larger portion of the distal margin is red, with a row of small black spots and at the anal angle an elongate blue spot. The underside is partly variegated with blue; the forewing is on the whole similar in markings to the upper, while the hindwing is brightly variegated and clouded, bearing black markings, of which those in the cell resemble a figure (on the left wing 18 or 98, on the right 81 or 89); in the middle of the costal area there is a pale patch and in the distal marginal area a row of ocellus-like spots. Sometimes, especially in the female, the red band of the forewing bears a small white spot in the middle. Biology In northern Europe, it is one of the last butterflies to be seen before winter sets in, often feeding on the flowers of ivy on sunny days. The red admiral is also known to hibernate, re- emerging individuals showing prominently darker colors than the first brood. The butterfly also flies on sunny winter days, especially in southern Europe. In North America, the red admiral generally has two broods from March through October. Most of North America must be recolonized each spring by southern migrants, but the species over winters in south Texas. Life cycle =Larval and pupal stages= Red admiral larvae measure approximately in length. Their coloration is variable, but they are usually black with white spots and spines. These spines persist into the pupal phase. In laboratory tests where larvae were reared at various constant temperatures, a difference in pupal period and coloration was found. At higher temperatures, around 32 degrees Celsius (90 ¬∞F), the pupal period of the red admiral is 6 days. At 11 to 18 degrees Celsius (51 to 64 ¬∞F) this period increases to 18 to 50 days. At even lower temperatures around 7 degrees Celsius (45 ¬∞F), the pupal period lasts between 47 and 82 days. The pupae are bright scarlet at high temperatures and black with a smaller scarlet area at low temperatures. This differential coloration at various temperatures may explain why the summer form of the red admiral is brighter and more heavily pigmented than the winter form. The primary host plant for the red admiral is the stinging nettle (Urtica dioica), but it can also be found on the false nettle (Boehmeria cylindrica), Pennsylvania pellitory (Parietaria) and other species within Urticaceae. Certain plants of the families Compositae and Cannabaceae may also be used as hosts. =Adult stage= The red admiral is identified by its striking black, orange, and white wing pattern. On the dorsal side, its dark wings possess orange bands on the middle of the forewings and the outer edge of the hindwings. The distal ends of the forewings contain white spots. The ventral side of the wings are brown with patches of red, white, and black. The hindwings have a brown marbled pattern. The red admiral has summer and winter morphs. Summer red admirals are larger and more pigmented than winter morphs. The wingspan ranges from .

Larger territories are optimal and subject to intrusion by other males more frequently than smaller territories. Territories tend to be oval, long and wide. Males patrol their territory by flying around the perimeter between 7 and 30 times per hour. On average, territory holders interact with intruders 10 to 15 times per hour. When another male encroaches on a red admiral's territory, the resident chases away the intruder, often in a vertical, helical path to disorient or tire out the intruder while minimizing the horizontal distance it travels from its perch. The red admiral immediately returns to its territory after chasing off encroaching males. Time spent patrolling increases as number of the intruder interactions increases. Patrolling behavior is correlated with warmer air temperatures, so males begin patrolling early and continue later on warmer days. Overcast skies usually led to patrolling later in the day. It is not clear whether this later start time is due to lower air temperature or a direct effect of decreased solar radiation. Another theory is that males believe it is earlier in the morning on cloudy days because of the reduced solar radiation. Mating Male red admirals court females for several hours before they begin mating. Because of female choice, only males with territory have the opportunity to mate. Females select males with traits that will increase the mating success of their offspring. In order to maintain their territory, males fly around and patrol the area 7 to 30 times per hour. Only males of exceptional flying ability are able to chase off intruding males and successfully court females. Vanessa atalanta on flower, Mount Dikti Migration Mating usually occurs in late fall or early winter following collective migration to southern regions with a warmer climate. The red admiral's main host plant, stinging nettle, is most abundant during this migration. Larval development proceeds through winter and adults are first sighted in early spring. The new generation of adults migrates north before mating, because food is usually diminished by late spring. During migration, the red admiral flies at high altitudes where high-speed winds carry the butterfly, requiring less energy. Physiology =Vision= Red admirals have color vision in the 440‚Äì590 nm range of the visible spectrum which includes indigo, blue, green, and yellow. They have compound eyes with a transparent, crystalline structure called a rhabdom which is similar in function to a human retina. These butterflies do not have the specific lateral filtering pigments coating their rhabdom found in some other nymphalid butterflies that likely evolved later. A consequence of this lack of pigment is that the red admiral cannot differentiate between colors in the 590‚Äì640 nm range, which includes orange and red. In species such as the monarch butterfly that express these lateral filtering pigments, higher wavelengths of light are altered, so they can excite the sensory photopigments. This physiological difference between butterfly species provides insight into the evolutionary adaptation of color vision. Conservation =Climate change= Spring temperatures in central England between 1976 and 1998 increased by 1.5 degrees Celsius and summer temperatures increased by 1 degree Celsius. Following this 22-year period of warming, the red admiral appeared six weeks earlier in the year. Of 35 species of butterflies studied in central England, the change in the duration of flight period was most significant in the red admiral, exhibiting a 39.8 day increase. These changes in migration time and length could result in an increased abundance of red admirals and a northward range expansion. Warmer climates could lead to an increase in time spent finding mates, laying eggs, and collecting nectar. Conversely, more frequent droughts associated with climate change would decrease egg survival and lead to habitat and host plant destruction. In popular culture The red admiral features in several works of Vladimir Nabokov: Speak, Memory (1951), Pale Fire (1962), and King, Queen, Knave (1968).

Fordingbridge is a former market town. The Avon Valley Path passes through the town. The town excluding linear settlement Sandleheath (included in its headline population with other outlying houses, totalling 1,526 residents) has a density of 30.2 persons per hectare.https://www.nomisweb.co.uk/reports/localarea?compare=1119883825 Overview =Landmarks= Fordingbridge is a town and civil parish in Hampshire on the banks of the River Avon. The first Great Bridge, from which the town received its present name, was built in mediaeval times, and is upstream from the ford. The bridge is a major feature of the town with its seven graceful arches, which can be seen very easily from the town's large riverside park where one can walk along the riverbank draped with willows and waterside plants. Close by is a children's play area, secluded memorial gardens, parks and sports playing fields. A bronze statue of the painter Augustus John stands on the banks of the Avon near the Great Bridge. Not far from the High Street is the parish church of St. Mary the Virgin which has some typical Norman characteristics. Lands in Fordingbridge and the advowson of the church were granted to King's College, Cambridge in 1447 by Henry VI, after being given to the Crown by Humphrey, Duke of Buckingham.http://www.kings.cam.ac.uk/files/docs/archives/estates/fordingbridge.doc The Fordingbridge Museum, with many local and forest history exhibits, and the Visitor Information Centre are in King's Yard. A Roman villa is in Rockbourne 5 km north-west, which is open to visitors during the summer. =Amenities and civic events= The local comprehensive school is The Burgate School And Sixth Form Centre, in Burgate, a small hamlet to the north of the town. Fordingbridge Hospital is a small community hospital on the site of a Victorian workhouse. Most of the old buildings remain but the inpatient ward is a more recent addition. The town's medical centre is on the same site in Bartons Road. Since 1982 Fordingbridge has been twinned with Vimoutiers in Normandy. Fordingbridge is also home to Fordingbridge Turks FC, one of the 50 oldest football clubs in England, established circa 1868. The Turks name seems to derive from wishing to emulate the determination shown by Ottoman forces at Siege of Plevna. The recreation ground is also home to Fordingbridge Rugby Club, who have been one of the more successful Hampshire clubs in recent years. The parish of Fordingbridge contains the hamlets of Burgate to the north, Criddlestyle to the east, Bickton to the south, and Ashford to the west. Burgate and Bickton are settlements dating back to the time of the Domesday Book, and Bickton was in male heads of households greater than Fordingbridge in 1086.Bickton, NFDC Criddlestyle is an ancient manor, also known as East Mill, with a history dating back to the 14th century. The largest hamlet today is Ashford, which was the location of an ancient watermill, and hosted Fordingbridge railway station until it was closed in 1964.But now, Ashford is threatened with being built on, and Sandleheath and Ashford will become part of Fordingbridge. History Fordingbridge is recorded in the Domesday Book of 1086 under the name Forde.Domesday Map ‚Äì Fordingbridge The manor was held by a certain Robert from \\"Robert the son of Gerald\\". Prior to 1066 it had been held by Alwy from King Edward. At the beginning of the 13th century Fordingbridge was held by Hugh de Linguire, who, dying around 1231, left a niece and heir Alice, wife of William de la Falaise. Victoria County History of Hampshire: Fordingbridge From that date Fordingbridge followed the same descent as Rowner. The manor was held by Elias de la Falaise at his death in 1254, and his brother William died in possession of the manor in the same year.Victoria County History of Hampshire: Rowner Before 1277 the property had escheated to the Crown by the felony of William de la Falaise, grandson of William, and was granted in that year to Sir William le Brune, chamberlain to the king. The manor then stayed solidly in the Brune family until the death of Charles Brune in 1769, when the family became extinct in the male line. By his will his estates eventually devolved onto his grand-nephew the Rev. Charles Prideaux-Brune of Prideaux Place, Padstow, Cornwall, and the manor then remained in the possession of the Prideaux-Brune family. The lord of the manor had a market before 1273: it was held weekly first on Saturday and then on Friday until the middle of the 19th century, when it was discontinued. A fair was held on 9 September. From the 13th to the 15th century Fordingbridge was governed by a bailiff, and then in later centuries by a constable chosen yearly at the court leet of the manor of Lower Burgate. The constable was the chief officer until 1878, when government by Local District Council was established. A fire in the town in the 18th century destroyed many of the houses, which were never rebuilt. The Town Hall, built in 1879, is almost in the centre of the town. Cloth was made here in the 16th century, and in the 19th century there were factories for the manufacture of sailcloth and canvas and the spinning of flax. By 1900 the chief industries of the town were the manufacture of sailcloth and canvas and the making of bricks and tiles, and there were various flourmills, an iron foundry, and the Neave's food works. Fordingbridge railway station was closed in 1964. It was originally just outside the town, on the road leading to Sandleheath village, and connected the town with Salisbury to the north and Poole to the south. The bridge The first bridge at Fordingbridge was built before 1252, when the bailiff and men of the town received a grant of pontage for one year towards its repairs. Several similar grants followed, the last being dated in 1452. The bridge is 40 metres long and consists of seven stone arches, and it is the one of the two bridges with seven arches in the UK.Salisbury and Fordingbridge Ancient Bridge, www.engineering-timelines.com The bridge brought much traffic through the town. At the east end of the bridge was a Saint John the Baptist Hospital (hospitalry) for poor travellers.Hampshire Treasures Volume 5 (New Forest) Page 141 It was founded 1272, and dissolved 1546; some foundation walls remain, but no other remains. A custom which survived until 1840 obliged the lord of Fordingbridge during one summer month known as \\"fence month\\" to keep the bridge guarded and arrest anyone found taking venison from the New Forest. Significant alterations were made in 1841 when both sides were widened, adding 45 cm to the width of the bridge. The original arches are still visible, being smaller in span than the 19th-century additions. A reinforced concrete footpath on one side was added in 1901 to widen the bridge. In February 2019, the bridge which is located on Bridge Street was closed for maintenance for a period of four weeks starting on the 11th February 2019. The work included blockwork replacement and carriageway resurfacing. Saint Mary's church The church of Saint Mary was originally a 12th-century building. About 1220‚Äì40 the church was greatly enlarged and practically rebuilt. A tower was built in the 15th century. In the 19th century the south vestry was rebuilt and enlarged, and a second vestry added. There was also a great deal of renovation. The church has a memorial to James Alexander Seton, last British person killed in a duel in England. Brookheath Brookheath () is a small hamlet near Fordingbridge.

Constructed in the 18th century in Prussia, the room was dismantled and eventually disappeared during World War II. Before its loss, it was considered an \\"Eighth Wonder of the World\\". A reconstruction was made, starting in 1979 and completed and installed in the Catherine Palace in 2003. The Amber Room was intended in 1701 for the Charlottenburg Palace, in Berlin, Prussia, but was eventually installed at the Berlin City Palace. It was designed by German baroque sculptor Andreas Schl√ºter and Danish amber craftsman Gottfried Wolfram. Schl√ºter and Wolfram worked on the room until 1707, when work was continued by amber masters Gottfried Turau and Ernst Schacht from Danzig (Gda≈Ñsk). It remained in Berlin until 1716, when it was given by the Prussian King Frederick William I to his ally Tsar Peter the Great of the Russian Empire. In Russia, the room was installed in the Catherine Palace. After expansion and several renovations, it covered more than and contained over of amber. The Amber Room was looted during World War II by the Army Group North of Nazi Germany, and taken to K√∂nigsberg for reconstruction and display. Its eventual fate and current whereabouts, if it survives, remain a mystery. In 1979 the decision was taken to create a reconstructed Amber Room at the Catherine Palace. After decades of work by Russian craftsmen and donations from Germany, it was completed and inaugurated in 2003. Architecture The Amber Room is a priceless piece of art, with extraordinary architectural features such as gilding, carvings, 450 kg (990 lb) amber panels, gold leaf, gemstones, and mirrors, all highlighted with candle light. Additional architectural and design features include statues of angels and children. Because of its unique features and singular beauty, the original Amber Room was sometimes dubbed the \\"Eighth Wonder of the World\\". Modern estimates of the room's value range from $142 million (2007) to over $500 million (2016). History =Creation= Corner section of the reconstructed Amber Room The Amber Room was begun in 1701 with the purpose of being installed at Charlottenburg Palace, the residence of Frederick, the first King in Prussia, at the urging of his second wife, Sophia Charlotte. The concept and design of the room was drafted by Andreas Schl√ºter. It was fabricated by Gottfried Wolfram, master craftsman to the Danish court of King Frederick IV of Denmark, with help from the amber masters Ernst Schacht and Gottfried Turau from Danzig, now Gda≈Ñsk in Poland. Although originally intended for installation at Charlottenburg Palace, the complete panels were eventually installed at Berlin City Palace. The Amber Room did not, however, remain at Berlin City Palace for long. Peter the Great of Russia admired it during a visit and in 1716, King Frederick I's son Frederick William I presented the room to Peter as a gift, which forged a Russo-Prussian alliance against Sweden. The original Berlin design of the Amber Room was reworked in Russia in a joint effort by German and Russian craftsmen. It was Peter's daughter Empress Elizabeth who decided the amber treasure should be installed at Catherine Palace, where the Russian Imperial family typically spent their summers. After several other 18th- century renovations, the room covered more than and contained over of amber. The room took over ten years to construct. =Evacuation during World War II= An angel statue featured on the wall of the Amber Room Shortly after the beginning of the German invasion of the Soviet Union in World War II, the curators responsible for removing the art treasures in Leningrad tried to disassemble and remove the Amber Room. However, over the years the amber had dried out and become brittle, making it impossible to move the room without the amber crumbling. The Amber Room was therefore hidden behind mundane wallpaper, in an attempt to keep German forces from seizing it, but the attempt to hide such a well-known piece of art failed. German soldiers of Army Group North disassembled the Amber Room within 36 hours under the supervision of two experts. On 14 October 1941, the priceless room reached K√∂nigsberg in East Prussia, for storage and display in the town's castle. On 13 November 1941, a K√∂nigsberg newspaper announced an exhibition of the Amber Room at K√∂nigsberg Castle. =Last days in K√∂nigsberg= Orders given by Hitler on 21 and 24 January 1945 ordered the movement of looted possessions from K√∂nigsberg. This allowed Albert Speer, Reichminister of Armaments, and his administration team to transport cultural goods of priority. However, before the Amber Room could be moved, Erich Koch, who was in charge of civil administration in K√∂nigsberg during the final months of the war, abandoned his post and fled from the city, leaving General Otto Lasch in command. In August 1944, K√∂nigsberg was heavily fire-bombed by the Royal Air Force. It suffered further extensive damage from artillery from the advancing Red Army before the final occupation on 9 April 1945.  Disappearance and mysteries  After the war, the Amber Room was never seen in public again, though reports have occasionally surfaced stating that pieces of the Amber Room survived the war. Several eyewitnesses claimed to have spotted the famous room being loaded on board the Wilhelm Gustloff, which left Gdynia on 30 January 1945, and was then promptly torpedoed and sunk by a Soviet submarine. In 1997, an Italian stone mosaic that was part of a set of four stones which had decorated the Amber Room was found in Germany, in the possession of the family of a soldier who claimed to have helped pack up the amber chamber. The mosaic came into the hands of the Russian authorities and was used in the reconstruction. K√∂nigsberg Castle, 1925 In 1998, two separate teams, one German and one Lithuanian, announced they had located the Amber Room. The German team pointed to a silver mine while the Lithuanian team believed the amber treasure was buried in a lagoon; neither of the two locations turned out to hold the Amber Room. In 2004, a lengthy investigation by British investigative journalists Catherine Scott-Clark and Adrian Levy concluded that the Amber Room was most likely destroyed when K√∂nigsberg Castle was damaged, first during the bombing of K√∂nigsberg by the Royal Air Force in 1944 and then by the Soviets' burning of the castle followed by shelling of the remaining walls. Official assessments, set out in documents from the Russian National Archives written by Alexander Brusov, head of the Soviet team charged with locating the Amber Room following the war, agreed with this theory. The official report stated: \\"Summarizing all the facts, we can say that the Amber Room was destroyed between 9 and 11 April 1945.\\" These dates correspond with the end of the Battle of K√∂nigsberg, which finished on 9 April with the surrender of the German garrison. A few years later, Brusov publicly voiced a contrary opinion; this is believed to have been done due to pressure from Soviet authorities, who did not want to be seen as responsible for the loss of the Amber Room. Among other information retrieved from the archives was the revelation that the remaining Italian stone mosaics were found in the burned debris of the castle. Scott-Clark and Levy concluded in their report that the reason the Soviets conducted extensive searches for the Amber Room, even though their own experts had concluded that it was destroyed, was because they wanted to know if any of their own soldiers had been responsible for the destruction. Scott- Clark and Levy also assessed that others in the Soviet government found the theft of the Amber Room a useful Cold War propaganda tool. Russian government officials have since denied these conclusions. Adelaida Yolkina, senior researcher at the Pavlovsk Palace, reportedly stated: \\"It is impossible to see the Red Army being so careless that they let the Amber Room be destroyed\\". After the report was made public, Leonid Arinshtein, who was a lieutenant in the Red Army in charge of a rifle platoon during the Battle of K√∂nigsberg, said: \\"I probably was one of the last people who saw the Amber Room\\". At the same time, he explained that the whole city was burning due to artillery bombardments, but also denied allegations that the Red Army burned the city on purpose, saying: \\"What soldiers would burn the city where they will have to stay?\\" A variation of this theory by some present-day residents of Kaliningrad (formerly K√∂nigsberg), is that at least parts of the room were found in the K√∂nigsberg Castle cellars after World War II by the Red Army. The Amber Room was allegedly still in good condition; this was not admitted at the time so the blame could fall upon the Nazis. To preserve this story, access to the ruins of the castle, which was allowed after World War II, was suddenly restricted to all, including historical and archaeological surveys, but the room is said to be in a storehouse near K√∂nigsburg Castle. Then in 1968, despite academic protests worldwide, Soviet Premier Leonid Brezhnev ordered the destruction of K√∂nigsberg Castle, thus making any onsite research of the last known resting place of the Amber Room all but impossible. Later the search for the Amber Room continued in different locations, including near Wuppertal, Germany. Another hypothesis involves a bunker in Mamerki in northeastern Poland, or that Stalin ordered the Amber Room replaced with a replica prior to its looting, hiding the original. The main problem with finding the Amber Room is that the Nazi regime hid many items in many difficult-to-reach places, usually without documentation, leaving a wide search area. Even as early as 1939, the Germans moved items to destinations far from Europe, as in the case of , which carried 4 tons of gold (equal to ), not found until 2017. The search for the Amber Room has also been halted by authorities. In the case of Fr√Ωdlant castle it was halted because of the historic value of the castle. Reconstruction Immense sums were spent on both the original and reconstructed Amber Room. In 1979, the Soviet government decided to construct a replica of the Amber Room at Tsarskoye Selo, a process that was to take 24 years and require 40 Russian and German experts in amber craftsmanship. Using original drawings and old black-and-white photographs, every attempt was made to duplicate the original Amber Room. This included the 350 shades of amber in the original panels and fixtures that adorned the room. A major problem was the lack of skilled workers, since amber carving was a nearly lost art form. The financial difficulties that plagued the reconstruction project from the start were solved with the donation of US$3.5 million from the German company E.ON. By 2003, the work of the Russian craftsmen was mostly completed. The new room was dedicated by Russian President Vladimir Putin and German Chancellor Gerhard Schr√∂der at the 300th anniversary of the city of Saint Petersburg. In Kleinmachnow, near Berlin, there is a miniature Amber Room, fabricated after the original. The Berlin miniature collector Ulla Klingbeil had this copy made of original East Prussian amber.

Geography Varennes-en-Argonne lies on the river Aire to the northeast of Sainte- Menehould, near Verdun. History It was the scene of the Flight to Varennes. In June 1791 Louis XVI, with his immediate family, made a dash for the nearest friendly border, that of the Austrian Netherlands in modern Belgium (Queen Marie-Antoinette being a sister to the Austrian emperor, Leopold II). But in Varennes Louis and his family were arrested, by Citizen Drouet, the local postmaster, who had been alerted by a message received from nearby Sainte-Menehould. It is said that at Sainte-Menehould, where the escaping party had spent the previous night, a merchant alerted the town authorities of their presence after recognizing the King's face on an Assignat, as Louis tried to buy something from a shop. Once more the royal family returned to the Tuileries in humiliating captivity, and Louis and Marie-Antoinette were subsequently guillotined in 1793. Located in the Zone rouge, Varennes was completely destroyed during the First World War but was reconstructed afterwards. The Pennsylvania Memorial, a monument for volunteers from 28th Division Pennsylvania in the First World War, was erected in Varennes during the Interwar period.

She impressed him enough that he called her \\"the ship of my choice\\", and \\"the fittest for service of any I have seen\\". Purchase and refitting Resolution began her career as the North Sea collier Marquis of Granby, launched at Whitby in 1770, and purchased by the Royal Navy in 1771 for ¬£4,151 (equivalent to ¬£ today). She was originally registered as HMS Drake, but fearing this would upset the Spanish, she was soon renamed Resolution, on 25 December 1771. She was fitted out at Deptford with the most advanced navigational aids of the day, including an azimuth compass made by Henry Gregory, ice anchors, and the latest apparatus for distilling fresh water from sea water. Her armament consisted of 12 6-pounder guns and 12 swivel guns. At his own expense Cook had brass door- hinges installed in the great cabin. It was originally planned that the naturalist Joseph Banks and an appropriate entourage would sail with Cook, so a heightened waist, an additional upper deck and a raised poop deck were built to suit Banks. This refit cost ¬£10,080.12.9d. However, in sea trials the ship was found to be top-heavy, and under Admiralty instructions the offending structures were removed in a second refit at Sheerness, at a further cost of ¬£882.3.0d. Banks subsequently refused to travel under the resulting \\"adverse conditions\\" and Johann Reinhold Forster and his son, George, replaced him. Cook's second voyage Resolution departed Sheerness on 21 June 1772, carrying 118 people, including 20 volunteers who had sailed on Cook's first voyage in HMS Endeavour in 1768‚Äì1771,Hough 1995, pp. 235‚Äì236 and two years of provisions.Beaglehole 1959, p. 15 She joined HMS Adventure at Plymouth and the two ships departed English waters on 13 July 1772. Resolutions first port of call was at Funchal in the Madeira Islands, which she reached on 1 August. Cook gave high praise to her sailing qualities in a report to the Admiralty from Funchal Roads, writing that she \\"steers, works, sails well and is remarkably stiff and seems to promise to be a dry and very easy ship in the sea\\".Hough 1995, p. 239 The ship was reprovisioned with fresh water, beef, fruit and onions, and after a further provisioning stop in the Cape Verde Islands two weeks later, set sail due south toward the Cape of Good Hope. Several of the crew had brought monkeys aboard as pets, but Cook had them thrown overboard to prevent their droppings from fouling the ship. On his first voyage Cook had calculated longitude by the usual method of lunars, but on her second voyage the Board of Longitude sent a highly qualified astronomer, William Wales, with Cook and entrusted him with a new marine chronometer, the K1, recently completed by Larcum Kendall, together with three chronometers made by John Arnold. Kendall's K1 was remarkably accurate and was to prove to be most efficient in determining longitude on board Resolution. On 17 January 1773, Resolution was the first ship to cross the Antarctic Circle and crossed twice more on the voyage. The third crossing, on 3 February 1774, was the most southerly penetration, reaching latitude 71¬∞10‚Ä≤ South at longitude 106¬∞54‚Ä≤ West. Resolution thus proved Alexander Dalrymple's Terra Australis Incognita to be a myth. She returned to Britain in 1775 and was then paid off. Cook's third voyage She was recommissioned in February 1776 for Cook's third voyage, which began on 12 July 1776, departing from Plymouth, England, during which Resolution crossed the Arctic Circle on 17 August 1778, and again crossed it on 19 July 1779, under the command of Charles Clerke after Cook's death. She arrived back in Britain on 4 October 1780. Later service and loss In 1780, Resolution was converted into an armed transport and sailed for the East Indies in March 1781. Sphinx and Annibal of Suffren's (French) squadron captured Resolution on 9 June 1782. In early July 1782, during the run-up of the Battle of Negapatam, Suffren sent Resolution to Manila to purchase spare spars, food and ammunition to resupply his fleet.Cunat, p.164 She then sailed on 22 July 1782 and was never seen again. On 5 June 1783, Suffren wrote that Resolution had last been seen in the Sunda Strait, and that he suspected she had either foundered or fallen into the hands of the English. An item from the Melbourne Argus, 25 February 1879, said that she ended her days as a Portuguese coal-hulk at Rio de Janeiro, but this has never been confirmed. Viscount Galway, a Governor-General of New Zealand, owned a ship's figurehead described as that of Resolution, but a photograph of it does not agree with the figurehead depicted in Holman's famous watercolour of her. Alternatively, in 1789 she may have been renamed G√©n√©ral Conway, in November 1790 Amis R√©unis, and in 1792 Libert√©.Demerliac (1996), p.104, No. 725. Martin Dugard's biography of Cook, Farther Than Any Man, published in 2001, states: \\"Her fate, by some cruel twist of historical irony, is as incredible as Endeavours ‚Äì she [Resolution] was sold to the French, rechristened La Libert√©, and transformed into a whaler, then ended her days rotting in Newport Harbor. She settled to the bottom just a mile from Endeavour.\\" (p. 281, Epilogue) However, there is a report from 1881, that the British Consul in Alexandria looking from the Ras el-Tin Palace pointed out the Resolution in the harbour to William N.

The fourth incarnation of the Tonight Show franchise debuted on May 25, 1992, three days after Johnny Carson's retirement as host of the program. The program originated from NBC Studios in Burbank, California, and was broadcast Monday through Friday at 11:35p.m. in the Eastern and Pacific time zones (10:35p.m. Central/Mountain time). Unlike Carson or his predecessor Jack Paar, Leno only once used a guest host, preferring to host the series in person. The series, which followed the same basic format as that of its predecessors (an opening monologue followed by comedy routines, interviews and performances), ran until May 29, 2009, after which Leno was succeeded by Conan O'Brien. NBC signed Leno to a new deal for a nightly talk show in the 10:00 pm ET timeslot. The primetime series, titled The Jay Leno Show, debuted on September 14, 2009, following a similar format to the Leno incarnation of Tonight. Neither O'Brien's version of the program, which premiered June 1, 2009, nor The Jay Leno Show generated the ratings NBC had expected. The network decided to move a condensed 30-minute version of Leno's show to O'Brien's time slot, and O'Brien's Tonight Show a half-hour later. This decision met with opposition from O'Brien, whose stint on The Tonight Show ended January 22, 2010, after which he began his own talk show, Conan, on TBS. The Tonight Show with Jay Leno then began its second incarnation, the sixth of the franchise, on March 1, 2010. Leno left The Tonight Show for good on February 6, 2014 and on February 17, was succeeded by Late Night host Jimmy Fallon, at which time the series returned to New York for the first time since 1972.  History  = Succession from Carson = Jay Leno in 1993 Intertitle used from 2002 until the conclusion of Leno's first incarnation Johnny Carson retired from The Tonight Show on May 22, 1992, and was replaced by Jay Leno. David Letterman wanted to move into the earlier time slot from his late night spot after The Tonight Show, and he was also considered by many as the natural successor (despite Leno having been Carson's permanent guest host for several years). Carson always favored Letterman; notably Carson, who had been interviewed by Letterman, made two appearances on Letterman's rival CBS show, made no mention of Leno during his final shows and regularly sent Letterman monologue jokes in his final years. With his heart set on the earlier time slot, Letterman left NBC in June 1993 and joined CBS that August. The Late Show with David Letterman, airing in the same slot, competed against The Tonight Show for the remainder of Leno's run. Leno would outdo Letterman in ratings for the majority of the show‚Äôs run. Conan O'Brien slid into the late night time slot vacated by Letterman in September 1993. = First end of Leno on Tonight = On September 27, 2004, the 50th anniversary of The Tonight Shows debut, NBC announced Leno would be succeeded by O'Brien, in 2009. Leno explained he did not want to see a repeat of the hard feelings and controversy that occurred when he was given the show over Letterman following Carson's retirement. It was announced on July 21, 2008 that Leno would host his final episode of The Tonight Show on Friday, May 29, 2009 with O'Brien and James Taylor as his guests. O'Brien took over hosting duties commencing the following Monday, on June 1, 2009. On December 9, 2008, it was announced Leno would be hosting a new nightly show in September 2009, which aired at 10 pm ET, during the network's prime time period. The Jay Leno Show ended after a short run on February 9, 2010. = Second incarnation = On January 7, 2010, multiple media outlets reported that effective March 1, 2010, The Jay Leno Show would move from the 10 pm (Eastern/Pacific Time) weeknight time slot to 11:35 pm and O'Brien's The Tonight Show with Conan O'Brien would move from 11:35 pm to 12:05 am. On January 12, 2010, O'Brien publicly announced in an open letter that he intended to leave NBC if they moved The Tonight Show to 12:05 am ET/PT to accommodate moving The Jay Leno Show to 11:35 pm Eastern/10:35 pm Central, due to poor ratings. After several days of negotiations, O'Brien reached a settlement with NBC that allowed him to leave NBC and The Tonight Show on January 22, 2010. On January 21, 2010, NBC announced Leno would return to The Tonight Show. Jay Leno began his second tenure on March 1, 2010, after the 2010 Winter Olympics. The show moved to Stage 11 in Burbank, the former home of The Jay Leno Show, with a similar set and theme song of The Jay Leno Show. Tonight Show bandleader Kevin Eubanks announced on April 12 he would be leaving The Tonight Show on May 28 after 18 years with Leno. Eubanks' replacement was former American Idol musical director Rickey Minor. Minor composed a new main theme when he took over. On July 1, 2010, Variety reported that only six months into its second life, Leno's Tonight Show posted its lowest ratings since 1992. By September 2010, Leno's ratings in the adults 18-49 demographic had fallen below those of O'Brien when he had hosted The Tonight Show. NBC ratings specialist Tom Bierbaum commented that due to the host being out of late night television for a period of time and the subsequent 2010 Tonight Show conflict, Leno's ratings fall was \\"not a surprise at all\\". In October 2010, David Letterman beat Leno's program in the ratings, for the first time since Leno returned to hosting The Tonight Show. By May 2011, Leno's Tonight Show regained the lead and has held it since then. However, by August 2012, The Los Angeles Times was reporting that The Tonight Show was in serious trouble for a number of reasons, most notably that NBC has been losing money. While Leno offered to take a pay cut, at least 24 members of his staff were laid off. By March 2013, there were rumors that NBC would have Jimmy Fallon, who has been hosting Late Night since 2009 when he succeeded O'Brien, become the next host of The Tonight Show when Leno's current contract ends in 2014 and NBC would move the show back to New York for the first time in over 40 years. On May 13, 2013, during its fall \\"upfronts\\" presentation, NBC confirmed Fallon would take over as host of the Tonight Show beginning on February 17, 2014; Seth Meyers, in turn, would leave Saturday Night Live (where he was the anchor of Weekend Update) and take over Fallon's time slot. Leno's final Tonight Show aired on February 6, 2014. Per the terms on his deal with NBC, his staff was paid through September 2014. Leno wrapped up the night before the 2014 Sochi Winter Olympics, which began on February 7. Fallon took over the Tonight Show on February 17. Leno himself would later appear multiple times on Jimmy Fallon's version of Tonight, such as a June 15, 2016 appearance in which Leno not only appeared as a guest, he delivered part of that night's monologue, commenting on the 2016 American election campaign. (Leno came out to do the monologue after Fallon faked an injury.)  Production  On April 26, 1999, the show began broadcasting in 1080i HDTV, becoming the first American nightly talk show to be shot in high definition. The show was shot in 16:9 aspect ratio. = Finances = During the last year with Leno as host, The Tonight Show cost about $1.7 million a week to produce. With 45 weeks of annual production, that amounted to about $76.5 million, excluding the salaries for Leno and the show's \\"top producers.\\" In that same period, the show had been generating an estimated $30‚Äì$40 million a year in profit, down from the $150 million a year the franchise once made.\\" = Format = The show follows an established six-piece format. After the announcer announces the opening credits for the show, the first segment is a long, ten- minute monologue by Leno, with quick one-liners about current events and brief comedy sketches occasionally mixed in. The second segment is a full comedy sketch, often a mini-documentary by a \\"Tonight Show correspondent\\" (e.g., Ross the Intern or Mikey Day), or a trademark of Leno's, like Headlines. As the nightly broadcast approaches midnight, the first guest appears. The interview is divided into two segments, then followed by the fifth segment, which is the interview of the second guest. The sixth and final segment is almost always a musical performance, but occasionally, a stand-up comedian will perform instead. Immediately following the last performance segment, Leno walks on camera to thank the performers, bid farewell to the audience and recommends watching Late Night which immediately follows The Tonight Show. As the closing credits roll on-screen, the closing theme, composed by bandleader Rickey Minor plays the show off the air. Minor composed a new opening and closing theme when he began his reign as bandleader on June 7, 2010. = Bandleader = Branford Marsalis was the original bandleader of the show from 1992 to 1995, leaving the show after feeling displeased with his role on the show, what he called being an \\"ass-kisser\\". Kevin Eubanks, who was the guitarist in Marsalis' band, moved up to bandleader and remained with The Tonight Show and The Jay Leno Show until 2010, leaving the show for unclear \\"personal\\" reasons. Rickey Minor, former American Idol music director, replaced Eubanks. = Announcer = Edd Hall served as announcer on The Tonight Show from 1992 until 2004. Hall occasionally appeared in skits during the opening monologue. These skits often involved slapstick injury to Hall (by using a stunt double, dummy, or film clip), such as vehicles running him over in the studio parking lot. Unlike his predecessors on Tonight (i.e. McMahon with Carson, Hugh Downs with Jack Paar), Hall did not serve as a sidekick for Leno during his tenure on Leno's incarnation of The Tonight Show. Hall was controversially replaced in 2004 by The Howard Stern Show staff member John Melendez in what many perceived as a thinly veiled attempt to attract a younger demographic and nonsensical considering his \\"stuttering\\" moniker. The hiring of Melendez, which was carried out by Leno without Stern's knowledge, prompted, a rift between Stern and Leno. Stern tiraded on his show for weeks on end, touting how Leno was \\"ripping him off\\", citing previously \\"lifted\\" material from his show such as \\"Jaywalking\\" ripping off Stern's \\"homeless game\\"; for example, stating \\"To an 18- to 25-year-old male, Jay Leno is gay. He might as well put a dress on.\\" Since the move to The Jay Leno Show, Melendez was replaced as announcer, but remained on the writing staff. Wally Wingert would be the only off-camera announcer for Leno's second Tonight tenure, carrying over his duties from The Jay Leno Show.  Recurring segments  Notable episodes *On May 25, 1992, The Tonight Show with Jay Leno debuted on NBC. The first show featured Leno's guests; Billy Crystal, Shanice, and Robert Krulwich. *On May 20, 1993, The Tonight Show with Jay Leno traveled to the Bull & Finch Pub in Boston, Massachusetts, to celebrate the final episode of Cheers. This is the first time that The Tonight Show with Jay Leno is taped on the road. *On May 9, 1994, Bobcat Goldthwait appeared on The Tonight Show with Jay Leno, where he set the guest chair on fire. Leno throws a cup of coffee, and tells Bobcat to sit down. *On August 22, 1994, Leno eulogized his father, who had recently died. After his monologue, Leno sat behind his desk and told the audience about his father's life and how his father had supported him in his career. Leno noted a moment when, upon Carson's disapproval at Leno being his successor, his father had encouraged him and told him to \\"fight the good fight\\". Leno ended the tribute saying, \\"You know, it really is lonely at the top. You have no idea. But... we'll fight the good fight, Pop.\\" *On July 10, 1995, Hugh Grant appeared in public for the first time after his arrest on lewd conduct charges the previous month. Leno famously asked him \\"What the hell were you thinking?\\" In response, Grant told Leno, \\"I think you know in life what's a good thing to do and what's a bad thing, and I did a bad thing...and there you have it.\\" The appearance was the first episode in which Leno beat CBS rival David Letterman. *On November 30, 1995, Howard Stern, who had made two highly rated appearances in 1992 and 1993, appeared with bikini- clad porn stars Nikki Tyler and Janine Lindemulder, attempting to show \\"the Tonight Show's first lesbian kiss\\" and encouraging Leno to spank one of them. Stern and the women remained during Siskel and Ebert's segment, where he began to suck one of their toes, to raucous applause and behavior from the crowd. Leno was visibly uncomfortable during both segments, repeatedly telling Stern \\"it will all be edited out\\", and hastily trying to interview Siskel & Ebert while the crowd went wild at Stern's antics. Leno ended the show early by walking off the air, which was edited out when it aired a few hours later, as revealed by Stern when he went on the air (on the Howard Stern Show) the following morning. Despite the situation, Leno called into the show that morning claiming Stern had \\"gone beyond the acceptable standards\\". Stern said Leno should not have \\"been so uptight\\" and he had a \\"real\\" reaction to the situation which was great. Stern recounted Leno had yelled at his producer Gary Dell'Abate saying Stern had \\"'s-d' in his house\\" and supposedly \\"grabbed his crotch\\" and yelled \\"Pussy, Pussy, Pussy! That's all it is with Howard\\" which Leno denied but agreed he had been angered by Stern. *In September 2000, with California in an energy crisis that forced blackouts, Leno did an episode in the dark using only candles and flashlights known as \\"The Tonight Show Unplugged\\". *Following the September 11 attacks, The Tonight Show was off the air for about a week, as were most similar programs. The first post-9/11 episode began with a still image of an American flag and a subdued opening without the usual opening credits. Leno's monologue paid tribute to those who lost their lives and to firefighters, police and rescue workers across the US. Leno had questioned whether a show that regularly poked fun at the government could continue after the attacks, but in his monologue he explained that he also saw the show as a respite from the grim news of the world, akin to a cookie or glass of lemonade handed to a firefighter. He also told a story about himself as a 12-year old Boy Scout, which Leno said he was not a very good one because of his dyslexia. His scoutmaster gave him the task of being the \\"cheermaster\\" of the troop, in which Leno told jokes to the troop to keep their spirits up. Senator John McCain and the musical group Crosby, Stills, and Nash were featured guests. Leno also organized an auction for a Harley- Davidson motorcycle signed by celebrities (he signed his name on-stage), with the proceeds going to 9/11 support organizations. For an extended period after the attack, a short clip of a large American flag waving was shown in between the announcement of the musical guest and Leno's introduction during the opening montage. *On May 12, 2003, Katie Couric hosted The Tonight Show. The guests were Mike Myers and Simon Cowell. Katie gets cut off by a technical error, and then, Leno returns. Leno tells him that they'll be no more guest hosts. *On August 6, 2003, actor Arnold Schwarzenegger appeared on The Tonight Show and confirmed he would be running against California governor Gray Davis for the California recall election. Schwarzenegger won the election on October 7. *On January 24, 2005, Leno had a special episode that paid tribute to Tonight Show predecessor Johnny Carson, who had died the day before. During the opening credits, the guests of that show were simply announced using pictures from when they were on Carson's Tonight Show, and the monologue simply gave condolence to Carson. There were no segments used; however, Leno played clips from The Tonight Show Starring Johnny Carson before commercials. All the guests were people who had worked with Carson, and had been on his show, including Ed McMahon, Drew Carey, Don Rickles, and Bob Newhart. *On July 20, 2006, as Colin Farrell was being interviewed by Leno, Farrell's stalker, Dessarae Bradford, evaded security, walked on stage as cameras were rolling, confronted Farrell, and threw her book on Leno's desk. In front of a silent, stunned audience, Farrell escorted her off the stage himself, told the camera crew to stop filming, and handed her over to security. As Bradford was led out of the studio, she shouted \\"I'll see you in court!\\" Farrell's response was simply, \\"Darling, you're insane!\\" Outside the studio, NBC security handed her to Burbank police, who eventually released her. While waiting to begin filming again, a shocked Leno sarcastically called for \\"a round of applause for NBC security\\" from the audience. After Farrell apologized to the audience, describing Bradford as \\"my first stalker,\\" the show then continued filming and the incident was edited out of the broadcast aired that night. Farrell later requested a restraining order in court against Bradford. *On July 24, 2007, the monologue was animated by Homer Simpson. Simpson gave a short monologue to the audience, and was \\"kicked out\\" by Leno. This sketch was to promote The Simpsons Movie. *On January 2, 2008, The Tonight Show (along with Jimmy Kimmel Live! and Late Night with Conan O'Brien) returned to air without writers, with the WGA still on strike. This was in response to the deal by David Letterman's production company Worldwide Pants and CBS Paramount Television with the WGA to allow Late Show with David Letterman and The Late Late Show with Craig Ferguson to return with writers. Leno's guest that night, Republican Presidential candidate Mike Huckabee, was criticized for crossing the WGA picket line to appear on the show. Huckabee would go on to win the Iowa caucuses the very next day. *On June 13, 2008, Leno delivered the news of Tim Russert's death to his audience during his monologue, and set aside some time in it to remember his old colleague. Leno then stated that he would continue the show as normal afterwards. *On March 19, 2009, Barack Obama appeared on the show. This marked the first time that a sitting President of the United States appeared on a late night talk show. President Obama came under fire for a remark made about the Special Olympics, which he made in reference to Leno's congratulations to Obama's low bowling score. *On March 1, 2010, Leno made his return to The Tonight Show with a re-written version of The Jay Leno Show theme song and a renovated Stage 11. Leno's guests were Jamie Foxx, Olympic Gold medalist Lindsey Vonn, and musical guest Brad Paisley. Leno also did a segment searching for a new desk, an element which was not implemented into his primetime show. * On November 18, 2010, former President George W. Bush made his first appearance on a late night talk show since leaving office. *On November 23, 2010, former bandleader Kevin Eubanks returned to promote his new album Zen Food. *On March 2, 2011, the 4,000th episode aired. *On February 21, 2013, Eubanks made a second guest appearance to promote his new album The Messenger and had a sit-down interview with Leno following the performance. *On December 11, 2013, Eubanks made a third guest appearance as a Meal or No Meal judge. *On February 6, 2014, Leno hosted his final show, which featured several pre-taped well-wishes (and humorous advice) from a variety of celebrities ranging from Steve Carell to President Barack Obama, who offered Leno an ambassadorship to Antarctica (\\"Hope you have a warm coat, funnyman.\\"). Appearing as Leno's final guests were Billy Crystal (Leno's first guest in 1992) and Garth Brooks. Crystal surprised Leno by leading an on-stage sing- along of \\"So Long, Farewell\\" from The Sound of Music, with lyrics for the occasion performed by special guests Jack Black, Kim Kardashian, Chris Paul, Sheryl Crow, Jim Parsons, Carol Burnett, and Oprah Winfrey; Brooks performed his touching song \\"The Dance\\" (at Leno's request) before closing out the show with the rousing \\"Friends in Low Places.\\" In closing \\"the greatest 22 years of my life,\\" Leno turned emotional in his final remarks, calling himself \\"the luckiest guy in the world... I got to meet presidents, astronauts, and movie stars.\\" Leno also thanked the audience as well as his staff, who \\"became my family\\" after the deaths of his parents and his brother early in his Tonight tenure.  Reception  Critical reviews for the show were mixed, with a Metacritic score of 49 out of 100, based on 9 reviews. In a negative review, Robert Bianco of USA Today wrote; \\"Monday's opening monologue, supposedly Leno's strong suit, was tired, lame and unfunny. In other words, typical of the real Leno, rather than the Leno of public-relations imagination.\\" The show was nominated for an Emmy Award in the Outstanding Variety, Music or Comedy Series category ten times between 1993 and 2005. It won the award in 1995.  Ratings  The 10th Anniversary special, broadcast on April 30, 2002, drew in 11.888 million viewers. On September 22, 2006, The Tonight Show led in ratings for the 11th consecutive season, with a nightly average of 5.7 million viewers ‚Äì 31% of the total audience in that time slot ‚Äì compared to 4.2 million viewers for Late Show with David Letterman, 3.4 million for Nightline and 1.6 million for Jimmy Kimmel Live!. Two events helped Leno gain and keep the lead: a new set brought Leno closer to the audience and Hugh Grant kept his July 10, 1995 scheduled appearance, despite having been arrested for seeing a prostitute, where Leno famously asked Grant, \\"What the hell were you thinking?\\"Hirschberg, Lynn. \\"Heeeeere's . . . Conan\\" The New York Times Magazine, May 20, 2009. The final telecast of the first incarnation of The Tonight Show with Jay Leno had the show's highest overnight household rating for a Friday episode in the comedian's 17-year run as host of Tonight, averaging an 8.8 rating in metered-market households. For at least six weeks following his return to The Tonight Show, Leno's program beat Letterman in the overall ratings each night, though with a reduced lead in comparison to his first tenure. By mid-2010, The Tonight Show was receiving its lowest ratings since 1992, an average of 4 million total viewers, though he remained ahead of Letterman, who experienced a coinciding decline in ratings. In September 2010, The Tonight Show posted its lowest numbers on record, with Leno averaging 3.8 million viewers. This was a 12% increase in total viewers over O'Brien at the same time the previous year, but still 23% below O'Brien in the coveted 18‚Äì49 demographic. For the first time in almost 15 years, the show slipped to second place in its time slot being consistently beaten by Nightline. In October 2010, Letterman beat Leno's program in the ratings, for the first time since Leno returned to hosting The Tonight Show. In the May 2011 sweeps period, all of NBCs late night programming had increased viewership. The Tonight Show received a 15% increase in viewership compared with the first 36 weeks of last season. In that process, it outlasted rival late night talk shows Jimmy Kimmel Live! on ABC, as well as Late Show with David Letterman on CBS. Both of Leno's lead-in, Late Night with Jimmy Fallon and Last Call with Carson Daly, also received increased viewership.JAY LENO AND JIMMY FALLON FINISH No. 1 VS.

After Leno returned, they have been showing The Tonight Show with Jay Leno. From Monday April 19, 2010, until the show's conclusion under Leno, CNBC Europe aired the show on weeknights from 12.00 am CET in a one-hour format, with double bill re-runs on Saturdays/Sundays from 9:00pm-9:45 pm & 9:45pm-10:30 pm CET.

Soon after, the show began airing on the Israeli popular cable channel Hot 3 (then simply called \\"Channel 3\\") until 1999. Since 2000, the show is broadcast in the Israeli satellite company yes (which launched in that year) in various channels, the current being yes stars comedy. = Italy = In Italy (with Italian subtitles) from 2003 to 2007 when RaiSat Extra cancelled the program. = Philippines = In the Philippines, channel ETC broadcast The Tonight Show from 2004 until 2007, when the show was turned over to sister channel JackTV and Talk TV. = Portugal = In Portugal, the show was first shown on SIC Comedia until the channel was off the air by the end of 2006. The show was switched to SIC Mulher until Leno moved to prime-time. Sic Radical used to broadcast The Tonight Show with Conan O'Brien following the demand from their target audience to O'Brien's humor, after Jimmy Fallon took over Late Night. The contract that both NBC and SIC had was not expired by the time The Tonight Show with Conan O'Brien got cancelled, so the network received the rights to exhibit The Tonight Show with Jay Leno. = Sweden = In Sweden, Kanal 5 started airing The Tonight Show every night Monday to Friday with a one-week delay in 2000. In 2008, Kanal 5 chose to replace it with Jimmy Kimmel Live!, and moved The Tonight Show to their sister channel Kanal 9, with a rerun aired the next day on Kanal 5. = Turkey = The Tonight Show with Jay Leno was broadcast by CNBC-e and e2 on weekdays at 00:00 with a one-night delay.

The disc is mounted on a pole or line, and lowered slowly down in the water. The depth at which the disk is no longer visible is taken as a measure of the transparency of the water. This measure is known as the Secchi depth and is related to water turbidity. Since its invention, the disk has also been used in a modified, smaller diameter, black and white design to measure freshwater transparency. Similar disks, with a black-and-yellow pattern, are used as fiducial markers on vehicles in crash tests, crash-test dummies, and other kinetic experiments. History The original Secchi disk was a plain white disk and was used in the Mediterranean Sea.On the history of the Secchi disc Today, a plain white, 30 cm diameter Secchi disk remains the standard design used in marine studies. In 1899 George C. Whipple modified the original all- white Secchi disk to \\"...a disc about 8 inches in diameter, divided into quadrants painted alternately black and white like the target of a level- rod...\\".Cialdi, M. and Secchi, P.

Accessed 2012-07-05. Secchi depth Different kinds of Secchi disks. A marine style on the left and the freshwater version on the right The Secchi depth is reached when the reflectance equals the intensity of light backscattered from the water. This depth in metres divided into 1.7 yields an attenuation coefficient (also called an extinction coefficient), for the available light averaged over the Secchi disk depth. While used as a variable, the extinction coefficient is also used as a variable for turbidity. The light attenuation coefficient, k, can then be used in a form of the Beer‚ÄìLambert law, :{I_z \\\\over I_0}= e^{-kz} to estimate Iz, the intensity of light at depth z from I0, the intensity of light at the ocean surface.Idso, Sherwood B. and Gilbert, R. Gene (1974) On the Universality of the Poole and Atkins Secchi Disk: Light Extinction Equation British Ecological Society. The Secchi disk readings do not provide an exact measure of transparency, as there can be errors because of the sun's glare on the water, or one person may see the disk at one depth, but another person with better eyesight may see it at a greater depth. However, it is an inexpensive and straightforward method of measuring water clarity. Because of the potential for variation between users, methods should be standardized as much as possible. A Secchi disk measurement should always be taken off the shady side of a boat or dock between 9:00 and 15:00.Lind, Owen, T. (1979). Handbook of Common Methods in Limnology St. Louis:C.V. Mosby Co. The period for best results is between 10:00 and 14:00. The same observer should take Secchi depth measurements in the same manner every time. One can approach the measurement by lowering the disk beyond a point of disappearance, then raising it and lowering it slightly to set the Secchi depth. Another method is to record the depth at which the disk disappears, lower another few feet, then record the depth at which the disk reappears as it is slowly brought up. The Secchi depth is taken as the average of the two values.Cole, Gerald A. (1994). Textbook of Limnology. 4th ed. Prospect Heights:Waveland Press Inc. Secchi disk measurements have been an integral component of Minnesota's and Wisconsin's lake water quality assessment programs for some time; lake residents make periodic measurements and submit their readings to state and local agencies. The aggregated longitudinal data are used to reveal general trends in water quality. Similarly, the Indiana Clean Lakes Program trains and relies on volunteers to monitor turbidity in over 80 Indiana lakes using secchi disks, and uses data submitted by volunteers to monitor lake quality in the state. In 2013, a team of marine scientists established the global citizen science Secchi Disk programme for seafarers to study the marine phytoplankton.Marine Secchi Disk study This ongoing citizen science Secchi Disk study combines the traditional plain white, 30 cm diameter marine Secchi Disk with mobile technology to upload Secchi depth data collected from the sea to a central database. The study's first scientific results were published in 2017. The Secchi Disk study was begun in response to a controversial scientific report that suggested the phytoplankton that influence water transparency had declined by 40% in the oceans between the years 1950 and 2008. Secchi disk measurements do not indicate how attenuation changes with depth or particular wavelengths of light. Submarine photometers can operate at depths of and can record visible, ultraviolet and infrared parts of the spectrum. Turbidimeters have their own light source and can measure transparency with scientific accuracy.Undersea exploration. (2008). In Encyclop√¶dia Britannica.

The helical path of the tape around the drum can clearly be seen. The same head drum with the rotating portion elevated for clarity The rotating portion of the head drum showing the rotary transformer and three of the six tape heads used in this particular VCR Helical scan is a method of recording high- frequency signals on magnetic tape. It is used in open-reel video tape recorders, video cassette recorders, digital audio tape recorders, and some computer tape drives.  Comparison to linear tape recording  In a fixed tape head recording system, magnetic tape is drawn past the head at a constant speed. The head creates a fluctuating magnetic field in response to the signal to be recorded, and the magnetic particles on the tape are forced to line up with the field at the head. As the tape moves away, the magnetic particles carry an imprint of the signal in their magnetic orientation. If the tape moves too slowly, a high-frequency signal will not be imprinted: the particles' polarity will simply oscillate in the vicinity of the head, to be left in a random position. Thus the bandwidth channel capacity of the recorded signal can be seen to be related to tape speed: the faster the speed, the higher the frequency that can be recorded. Video needs considerably more bandwidth than audio, so much so that tape would have to be drawn past the heads at very high speed to capture this signal. This is impractical, since tapes of immense length would be required: VERA, developed by the BBC between 1952 and 1958, used 52cm (20\\") reels running at a speed of 5.08 m/s (16.7 ft/s), and could only record about 15 minutes of 405-line monochrome programme. The generally adopted solution is to rotate the head against the tape at high speed, so that the relative velocity is high, but the tape itself moves at a slow speed. To accomplish this, the head carrier (usually referred to as the head drum) must be tilted so that at each rotation of the drum, a new area of tape passes the head. Each segment of the signal is recorded as a diagonal stripe across the tape. This is known as a helical scan because the tape wraps around the circular drum at an angle, traveling up like a helix. The difference between the head writing speed and linear tape speed is vast: for example, versus .  History  With the advent of television broadcasting in Japan in the early 1950s, they saw the need for magnetic television signal recording. Dr. Norikazu Sawazaki developed a prototype helical scan recorder in 1953.SMPTE Journal: Publication of the Society of Motion Picture and Television Engineers, Volume 96, Issues 1-6; Volume 96, page 256, Society of Motion Picture and Television Engineers Independently in Germany, Eduard Sch√ºller was also developing a helical scan method of recording. When Ampex developed the quadruplex magnetic tape video recording system in 1956, it had certain limitations, perhaps the most important of which was the lack of pause or still frame capability, because the picture signal was segmented, or broken down into discrete segments to be recorded on the tape individually (only 16 lines of the picture in each segment). Thus, when tape motion was stopped, only a single segment of the picture recording was present at the playback heads. The helical-scan system overcame this limitation. Toshiba introduced helical-scan technology to the television industry in 1959. During the 1960s and 1970s, helical-scan recording machines were introduced by many manufacturers and marketed all over the world. The technology rapidly took over the market for video recording, due to its reduced complexity, greater reliability, lower manufacturing and servicing costs, lighter weight, lower energy consumption, and more versatile features, when compared to the quadruplex system. These factors also made it possible eventually to bring video recording to users at home, in a cassette format.  Practical problems  There were a number of problems to be overcome with this system. The high tape/head speed could lead to rapid wear of both the tape and the head, so both need to be highly polished, and the head made of a hard, wear-resistant material. Most systems operate with an air bearing separating the heads from the surface of the drum. Supplying signals to a rotating head is also problematic: This is usually accomplished by coupling the signal(s) inductively through a rotary transformer. The transport mechanism is also much more complex than a fixed head system, since during loading, the tape must be pulled around a rotating drum containing the head(s). In a VCR for example, the tape must be pulled out of the cassette case and threaded around the drum, and between the capstan and pinch roller. This leads to complex and potentially unreliable mechanics.  Transport systems  Two transport systems evolved in the early video machines, known as the alpha wrap and the omega wrap. In the alpha-wrap machines the tape is wrapped around the head drum for a full 360 degrees (the tape looking like the lowercase Greek letter alpha). There is only one head which writes a complete stripe for every revolution of the head. This system has problems when the head transits from one piece of tape to the next, giving a large signal gap between fields. The machine has to fill this gap with the frame-synchronizing pulses. Such machines are constrained to using guard-band recording (see below). In the omega-wrap machines, the tape is only wrapped around the head for 180 degrees. Two video heads are required, each writing alternate fields. This system has a much smaller signal gap between fields, but the frame-synchronizing pulses are able to be recorded on the tape. Cassette-based systems can only utilize the omega-wrap technique, since it is impractical for an automatic loading system to introduce a loop into the tape. Early omega-wrap systems utilize guard-band recording, but the presence of two heads permits the development of the slant- azimuth technique. Later developments use increasing numbers of heads to record video using smaller drums and for recording HiFi sound as well. A variation of the omega wrap, such as that used by Echo Science Corporation of Mountain View, California in its instrumentation and high resolution video recorders in the late 1970s and 1980s, wraps the 1-inch tape about 190 degrees around the two-headed drum, so there is signal overlap between the two heads. Head switching in video recorders occurs instantaneously in the video models, during an horizontal sync interval. With a standard NTSC video signal a head can cover one sixth of a field each time it passed across the tape. Switching in instrumentation models is gradual, so the signals from both heads overlaps briefly, producing a transient-free output signal where the original signal does not contain convenient dead intervals during which a switching transient can be hidden.  Slant-azimuth recording  Every videotape system attempts to pack as much video as possible onto a given-sized tape, but information from one recording stripe (pass of the video head) must not interfere with information on adjacent stripes. One method to provide isolation between the stripes is the use of guard bands (unrecorded areas between the stripes), but this wastes valuable tape space. All the early open-reel machines and the first cassette formats, the Philips VCR and the Sony U-matic, use this system. Later helically scanning recorders instead usually use a method called slant- azimuth recording, also called symmetric phase recording. The head drum usually contains two heads with the magnetic gap of one head slanted slightly leftwards and the magnetic gap of the other head slanted slightly rightwards. (The slant of a magnetic head is referred to as its azimuth adjustment). Because of the alternating slants, each head will not wrongly read the signal recorded by the other head and the stripes can be recorded immediately next to each other, alternating between left slant on one television field and right slant on the next television field. (In practice, it's not uncommon for the recorded stripes to overlap somewhat). Later machines including the JVC VHS and the Sony Betamax use slant-azimuth recording as well as all later machines and their digital derivatives. Using slant-azimuth recording, the need for guard bands is completely eliminated, allowing more recording to be placed on a given length of tape.  Contrast with quadruplex recording  Helical scanning was a logical progression beyond an earlier system (pioneered by Ampex) known as quadruplex recording, also referred to as transverse recording. In this scheme, the rotating head drum runs essentially perpendicular to a tape, and the slices recorded across the tape are nearly perpendicular to the tape's motion. U.S. quadruplex systems revolve the head drum at 14,400 revolutions per minute (240 revolutions per second) with four heads on the drum so that each television field is broken into 16 stripes on the tape (which requires appropriately complex head-switching logic). By comparison, the longer stripe recorded by a helical-scan recorder usually contains an entire video field and the two-headed drum spins at the frame rate (half the field rate) of the TV system in use. Recording an entire field in a single pass allows these machines to play back a viewable still frame when the tape is stopped, and display a viewable image sequence while shuttling forwards or backwards. This greatly facilitates the editing process. The quadruplex systems are unable to display video from tape except while playing at normal speed, unless they have a separate frame buffer.

In the following years, he kept the party on a centrist track, hoping to attract moderate voters among the opposition Social Democrats alarmed by the gains of the Republicans and the environmentalist Green Party.Ferdinand Protzmann (August 22, 1989), Kohl Replaces Party Official After Losses to the Far Right New York Times. Despite becoming a major figure in the CDU, differing and increasingly left-leaning views eventually strained relations with Kohl.Heiner Geissler, political force who shaped German Cold War relations, dies Deutsche Welle, September 12, 2017. Reports that Gei√üler would be replaced cropped up after the Christian Democrats lost elections in West Berlin and Frankfurt in 1989 and polled only 37.6 percent in the European elections that year, a drop of 8.2 percentage points from the 1984 elections.Ferdinand Protzmann (August 22, 1989), Kohl Replaces Party Official After Losses to the Far Right New York Times. In late 1989, he joined forces with Kurt Biedenkopf, Lothar Sp√§th, Rita S√ºssmuth and others in an unsuccessful effort to oust Kohl as CDU chairman.Harry Luck (January 28, 2010), Biedenkopf: ‚ÄûK√∂nig Kurt‚Äú und Kohls Rivale Focus.

From 1991 until 1998, he served as deputy chairman of the CDU/CSU parliamentary group under the leadership of chairman Wolfgang Sch√§uble. In addition to his parliamentary work, Gei√üler also served as Vice-President of the Christian Democrat and People's Parties International from 1986 until 1993. Gei√üler later became a sought-after arbitrator in wage and other disputes.Heiner Geissler, top aide to Germany's Kohl, dies at 87 Miami Herald, September 12, 2017.

From being a conservative right-winger until the early 1990s, he also became increasingly leftist in his views as far as social policy and globalization are concerned. In 2007, he announced he had become a member of the attac network. This happened weeks before the 2007 G8 summit, which Germany, holding the 2007 G8 presidency, was hosting.

Augustus probably sent his new XXIst legion to Hispania Tarraconensis to fight the campaign against the Cantabrians. XXI Rapax was one of the five legions used by Drusus to suppress the rebellion of the Raetians, in 16‚Äì15 BC. From 15 BC, the legion was stationed in Castra Regina (Regensburg), in the new province of Raetia. After the disaster of the Battle of the Teutoburg Forest, the legion was sent as reinforcements to Germania Inferior, where they shared the base camp of Castra Vetera (Xanten) with V Alaudae. Both Legio V and Legio XXI were involved in a mutiny in AD 14.Tacitus, Annales, 1.45 In 43, they were relocated in Vindonissa, in the province of Germania Superior. The legion occupied Vindonissa from 46 to 69 with two auxiliary cohorts, first the III Hispanorum and VI Raetorum, and later the VII Raetorum equitata and the XXVI voluntariorum civium Romanorum. Along with the rest of the German border army, the XXI Rapax supported its commander, Vitellius, in the Year of the Four Emperors (69) and marched to besiege Rome. Vitellius was, however, defeated by Vespasian before the end of the year. In 70, the legion was part of the army sent to deal with the Batavian rebellion and relieve the four legions imprisoned by Civilis. After that they were sent to Germania Superior, where they shared the castrum (camp) of Moguntiacum (modern day Mainz) with XIV Gemina. In 89, the legions in Moguntiacum supported their commander, Lucius Antonius Saturninus, in his revolt against emperor Domitian. After the end of this unsuccessful insurrection, the legions were separated and XXI Rapax sent to Pannonia. The legion was probably destroyed in 92, while fighting on the Lower Danube against Sarmatians, presumably a reference to the Roxolani.

This is usually done by including embedded synchronization information within the signal, and adding constraints on the coding of the data payload such that false synchronization can easily be detected. Most line codes are designed to be self-clocking. Isochronicity and anisochronicity If a clock signal is embedded in the data transmission, there are two possibilities: the clock signals are sent at the same time as the data (isochronous), or at a different time (anisochronous). =Isochronous self- clocking signals= If the embedded clock signal is isochronous, it gets sent simultaneously with the data. Below is an example signal, in this case using the Manchester code self-clocking signal. The data and clock cycles can be thought of as \\"adding up\\" to a combination, where both the clock cycle and the data can be retrieved from the transmitted signal. Image:Manchester_encoding_both_conventions.svg =Asynchronous self-clocking signals= Asynchronous self-clocking signals do not combine clock cycles and data transfer into one continuous signal. Instead, the transmission of clock cycles and data transmission is modulated. Below is an example signal used in asynchronous serial communication, where it is made clear that the information about the clock speed is transmitted in a different timeframe than the actual data. Image:Puerto serie Rs232.png Implementations Example uses of self- clocking signal protocols include: *Isochronous **Manchester code, where the clock signals occur at the transition points. **Plesiochronous Digital Hierarchy signals **Eight-to-Fourteen Modulation **4B5B **8b/10b encoding **HDLC **Modified Frequency Modulation *Anisochronous **Morse code **Asynchronous start-stop Most of these codes can be seen as a kind of Run Length Limited code. Those constraints on \\"runs\\" of zeros and \\"runs\\" of ones ensure that transitions occur often enough to keep the receiver synchronized. Such self-clocking signals can be decoded correctly into a stream of bits without bit slip. To further decode that stream of bits and decide which bit is the first bit of a byte, often a self-synchronizing code is used.  Analog examples  Amplitude modulation ‚Äì modulating a signal M(t) by changing the amplitude of a carrier wave, as in: :y(t) = M(t) \\\\cdot \\\\cos(\\\\omega_c t), is self-clocking, as the zero crossings serve as a clock pulse. One may consider this clock pulse redundant information, or at least a wasteful use of channel capacity, and duplex the channel by varying the phase, as in polar modulation, or adding another signal that is 90¬∞ out of phase (a sine wave), as in quadrature modulation. The result is to send twice as many signals over the channel, at the cost of losing the clock, and thus suffering signal degradation in case of clock drift (the analog equivalent of bit drift). This demonstrates how encoding clocking or synchronization in a code costs channel capacity, and illustrates the trade-off.

It is credited as having paved the way for the establishment of the Scottish Parliament in 1999.  History  = Campaign for a Scottish Assembly = The Convention has its roots in the Campaign for a Scottish Assembly (CSA), which was formed in the aftermath of the 1979 referendum that failed to establish a devolved Scottish Assembly. Launched in 1980, led by Jack Brand, and later headed by Jim Boyack, the CSA contained individuals committed to some form of Home Rule for Scotland. Most were members of the Labour Party, but many Scottish National Party members also took part. The CSA kept up the pressure for devolution in the early years of the Conservative government of Margaret Thatcher, which was totally opposed to any form of Home Rule. Eventually, the CSA came to the stance that the cause of Scottish devolution would be best served by a convention with more democratic legitimacy invested in it.The Campaign for a Scottish Assembly (1984), The Scottish Constitutional Convention, Discussion Paper The CSA organised the committee, chaired by Professor Sir Robert Grieve, that published the Claim of Right for Scotland. The Claim held that it was the Scottish people's right to choose the form of government that best suited them (a long-established principle, first formally stated in the Declaration of Arbroath, 1320), and which also recommended the establishment of a convention to discuss this. = Scottish Constitutional Convention = The Scottish Constitutional Convention was then established in 1989 after prominent Scottish individuals signed the Claim of Right, and superseded the role of the CSA. The first meeting was held in the Assembly Hall in Edinburgh on 30 March 1989. Canon Kenyon Wright, the convener of the executive committee, opened the meeting. David Steel and Harry Ewing were adopted as co-chairmen. A second meeting on 7 July was held in Inverness. Various organisations participated in the Convention, such as the Labour Party, the Liberal Democrats, the Scottish Green Party, the Communist Party, the Scottish Trades Union Congress, the Scottish Council for Development and Industry, the Small Business Federation and various bodies representing other strands of political opinion as well as civic society in general. Representatives of the two largest churches - the Church of Scotland and the Roman Catholic Church - were involved, as well as smaller church groups, and some non-Christian communities which decided to participate. Initially, the Scottish National Party (SNP) participated, but the then party leader Gordon Wilson, along with Jim Sillars, decided to withdraw the SNP from participation owing to the convention's unwillingness to discuss Scottish independence as a constitutional option. The Conservative government of the day was very hostile to the convention, and challenged the local authorities' right to finance the convention, although the courts found that they were in fact entitled to do so. Under its executive chairman, Canon Kenyon Wright, the convention published its blueprint for devolution, Scotland's Parliament, Scotland's Right, on 30 November 1995, St Andrew's Day. This provided the basis for the structure of the existent Scottish Parliament, established in 1999. In December 2013, John McAllion, who participated in the convention as a Labour MP, claimed that it was \\"self-appointed\\", \\"elitist\\", and \\"ultimately unrepresentative\\" of Scottish society, and should not be a model for a future constitutional convention.

trade union activist, orator, politician and journalist born in Govan, Glasgow. His role as spokesman and one of the leaders in the Upper Clyde Shipbuilders work-in between June 1971 and October 1972 attracted international recognition. He later served as Rector of the University of Glasgow and subsequently became a journalist and broadcaster. Formerly a member of the Communist Party of Great Britain, Reid was later a Labour Party member. After supporting the Scottish Socialist Party in the late 1990s, he joined the Scottish National Party in 2005 and fully supported Scottish independence. He died in 2010 after a long illness.  Early life Reid was born in Govan, Glasgow, then a major British shipbuilding centre. In his youth, Reid joined the Young Communist League and was later a member of the Communist Party of Great Britain. He was involved in organising a major apprentices' strike at the Clyde shipyards in 1951. Union career Reid came to prominence in the early 1970s, when he led the Upper Clyde Shipbuilders work-in to try to stop Edward Heath's Conservative government from closing down the shipyards on the River Clyde. The government had decided that the shipyards should operate without state subsidy, which would have resulted in at least six thousand job losses. An engineer by trade and shop steward of the Amalgamated Union of Engineering Workers, Reid, along with his colleagues Jimmy Airlie, Sammy Gilmore and Sammy Barr, decided that the best way to show the viability of keeping the yards open was by staging a 'work-in' rather than by going on strike. This meant that the workers would continue to complete what orders the shipyard had until the government changed policy. In a famous speech given to the workers, Reid announced the beginning of workers' control of the shipyard and insisted on self-discipline while this was in force: The occupation received support from across the world, with a series of fundraising events and foreign unions, celebrities (such as John Lennon and Billy Connolly) and members of the public providing donations. The campaign was successful in persuading Heath to back down the following year, and the Clyde shipyards received ¬£101 million in public support over the next three years. Political career =CPGB years= He was elected as a Communist councillor in Clydebank, where, prior to the local government reform of the mid-1970s, there were a few Communist councillors. He stood for the Communist Party of Great Britain in East Dunbartonshire in the 1970 general election. Reid also served as Rector of the University of Glasgow, elected in 1971, largely on the back of his union activities. When installed as Rector, he gave a critically acclaimed speech, which became known as \\"the rat-race speech\\". The New York Times printed the speech in full and described it as \\"the greatest speech since President Lincoln's Gettysburg Address\\". In the February 1974 general election, Reid stood for the Communist Party in Central Dunbartonshire, which was dominated by the town of Clydebank, against sitting Labour member Hugh McCartney. He got 14.6% of the vote, the best result for a Communist Party candidate in Britain for some time, but it seemed like a disappointment, as some thought he might win. It was a controversial campaign; the ballot paper described him as \\"Engineering Worker,\\" which some thought was disguising his Communist identity. One Roman Catholic priest gave a sermon advising his parishioners only to vote for candidates whose beliefs were consistent with Christian principles. In his speech at the count, Reid described his opponents as \\"Falangists,\\" in reference to their perceived Catholic nationalism. He stood again in October 1974, when his vote was down to 8.7%. =Leaving the CPGB for Labour and journalism= Around 1975, Reid left the Communist Party. The breakaway Scottish Labour Party considered recruiting him, but its leader Jim Sillars said: \\"If we have that chap in he'll be taking time away from me on the box\\".H.M.Drucker Breakaway: The Scottish Labour Party Edinburgh: EUSPB (1977) About a year after he left the CP, Reid joined the Labour Party. He was their candidate in Dundee East in 1979, but lost to then Scottish National Party (SNP) leader Gordon Wilson. The decision by Dundee East Constituency Labour Party to select him as their candidate was controversial, as he had been a party member for less than the two years normally expected. He is sometimes referred to as \\"the best MP Scotland never had\\". Reid then became a journalist and broadcaster, writing opinion columns for various newspapers, including The Daily Mirror, The Herald, The Sun and The Scotsman. He also presented a chat-show called the Reid Report for Grampian Television. In 1984, he wrote and presented a series of documentaries entitled Reid About the USSR, when his previous status within the Communist Party gave him unprecedented access and resulted in two BAFTA awards. In 2000, he helped establish the Scottish Left Review, a bi-monthly publication. He also wrote an \\"As I Please\\" column in Tribune, emulating George Orwell. During the UK miners' strike (1984‚Äì1985), Reid was highly critical of the strike and its leader Arthur Scargill in his newspaper column. Reid argued that the working miners could not properly be referred to as strikebreakers, as no national ballot was held and no local ballot had passed a resolution to strike. He said on the matter: :A scab is someone who participates in a vote in which the majority are for taking strike action and then refuses to honour the decision. If you are denied the right to vote it is impossible to be a scab. Reid's stance led to his coming under strong criticism from many former supporters in the Labour movement; he was described by Mick McGahey as \\"Broken Reid\\". =Leaving Labour for the SNP= Reid continued to support Labour up until the 1997 General Election, but thereafter became disillusioned with the New Labour phenomenon. In 1998, he urged people to support the Scottish Socialist Party (SSP) in the first elections to the new Scottish parliament. In the 2004 SNP leadership contest, he urged SNP members to support Alex Salmond for leader and Nicola Sturgeon for deputy leader, and he joined the party in the following year. In 2007, a play by the writer Brian McGeachan about Reid's life was performed. Entitled From Govan to Gettysburg, it starred John Cairney and toured as part of Jimmy Reid's 75th birthday celebrations. Later life Reid retired to Rothesay on the Isle of Bute. On 10 August 2010, Reid died at Inverclyde Royal Hospital. He had suffered a brain haemorrhage earlier in the week and had been in poor health for a number of years. After a private service in Rothesay, his hearse was driven into Glasgow for a secular funeral service at the Govan Old Parish Church on 19 August. The cortege passed the BAE Systems Surface Ships yard in Govan, one of the Shipyards saved after the collapse of UCS, where hundreds of workers had gathered outside in tribute. The funeral service at Govan Old was attended by notable figures including Ed Balls, Ed Miliband, Gordon Brown, Alex Salmond, Sir Alex Ferguson and Sir Billy Connolly. He was survived by his wife Joan, three daughters and three granddaughters, one of whom, Joani Reid is a Labour Party Councillor in the London Borough of Lewisham. The left-wing think tank and advocacy group, the Jimmy Reid Foundation, was established in his memory by the Editorial Board of the Scottish Left Review.  Notes  *Jimmy Reid.

He was a political and spiritual leader known for his nonviolent opposition; he was a lifelong pacifist and devout Muslim.An American Witness to India's Partition by Phillips Talbot, (2007), Sage Publications A close friend of Mahatma Gandhi, Bacha Khan was nicknamed Sarhadi Gandhi (\\"Frontier Gandhi\\") in India by his close associate Amir Chand Bombwal.http://www.tribuneindia.com/news/uttarakhand/community/uttarakhand- journalist-gave-frontier-gandhi-title-to-abdul-gaffar-khan-claims- book/174496.html Bacha Khan founded the Khudai Khidmatgar (\\"Servants of God\\") movement in 1929. Its success triggered a harsh crackdown by the British against him and his supporters, and they suffered some of the most severe repression of the Indian independence movement. Bacha Khan strongly opposed the proposal for the partition of India, siding with the Indian National Congress and All India Azad Muslim Conference. When the Indian National Congress reluctantly declared its acceptance of the partition plan without consulting the Khudai Khidmatgar leaders, he felt deeply betrayed and hurt by this, telling the Congress, \\"you have thrown us to the wolves.\\" In June 1947, Khan and other Khudai Khidmatgars declared the Bannu Resolution, demanding that the Pashtuns be given a choice to have an independent state of Pashtunistan, composing all Pashtun territories of India, instead of being made to join Pakistan. However, the British refused to comply with the demand of this resolution. In response, Bacha Khan and his elder brother Chief Minister Dr Khan Sahib boycotted the 1947 North-West Frontier Province referendum on joining Pakistan or India, citing that it did not have the options for the province to become independent or join Afghanistan. After the partition of India, Bacha Khan pledged allegiance to Pakistan, but was frequently arrested by the Pakistani government between 1948 and 1954. In 1956, he was arrested for his opposition to the One Unit program, under which the government announced its plan to merge all provinces of West Pakistan into a single province. Khan was jailed or in exile during much of the 1960s and 1970s. Upon his death in 1988 in Peshawar under house arrest, following his will, he was buried at his house in Jalalabad, Afghanistan. Tens of thousands of mourners attended his funeral, marching through the Khyber Pass from Peshawar to Jalalabad. It was marred by two bomb explosions that killed 15 people. Despite the heavy fighting at the time during the Soviet‚ÄìAfghan War, both sides, namely the communist army and the mujahideen, declared a ceasefire to allow Khan's burial.  Early years  Bacha Khan, allegedly with Indira Gandhihttp://www.thefridaytimes.com/bacha-khan-and-indira/ Bacha Khan was born on 6 February 1890 into a generally peaceful and prosperous Pashtun family from Utmanzai in the Peshawar Valley of British India. His father, Bahram Khan, was a land owner in the area commonly referred to as Hashtnaghar. Bacha Khan was the second son of Bahram to attend the British-run Edward's Mission School, the only fully functioning school in the region run by missionaries. At school the young Bacha Khan did well in his studies, and was inspired by his mentor Reverend Wigram to see the importance of education in service to the community. In his 10th and final year of high school, he was offered a highly prestigious commission in the Corps of Guides, a regiment of the British Indian Army. Bacha Khan refused the commission after realising that even Guides officers were still second-class citizens in their own country. He resumed his intention of university study, and Reverend Wigram offered him the opportunity to follow his brother, Khan Abdul Jabbar Khan, to study in London. An alumnus of Aligarh Muslim University, Bacha Khan eventually received the permission of his father. However, Bacha Khan's mother wasn't willing to let another son go to London, so Bacha Khan began working on his father's lands, attempting to discern what more he might do with his life.The Peacemaker of the Pashtun Past By KARL E. MEYER The New York Times. 7 December 2001. In 1910, at the age of 20, Khan opened a mosque school in his home town of Utmanzai. In 1911, he joined independence movement of the Pashtun independence activist Haji Sahib of Turangzai. However, in 1915, the British authorities banned his mosque school. Having witnessed the repeated failure of revolts against the British Raj, Khan decided that social activism and reform would be more beneficial for the Pashtuns. This led to the formation of Anjuman-e IslƒÅh-e AfghƒÅnia (, \\"Afghan Reform Society\\") in 1921, and the youth movement PaxÃåt≈´n Jirga (, \\"Pashtun Assembly\\") in 1927. After Khan's return from the Hajj pilgrimage to Mecca in May 1928, he founded the Pashto-language monthly political journal PaxÃåt≈´n (, \\"Pashtun\\"). Finally, in November 1929, Khan founded the KhudƒÅyƒ´ KhidmatgƒÅr (, \\"Servants of God\\") movement, whose success triggered a harsh crackdown by the British authorities against him and his supporters. They suffered some of the most severe repression of the Indian independence movement from the British Raj.  Ghaffar \\"Badshah\\" Khan  Bacha Khan with Gandhi at Peshawar Bacha Khan leads a march from Peshawar to Kabul during the Khilafat Movement. Peshawar Street 1920 (Mela Ram & Sons) In response to his inability to continue his own education, Bacha Khan turned to helping others start theirs. Like many such regions of the world, the strategic importance of the newly formed North-West Frontier Province (now Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, Pakistan), as a buffer for the British Raj from Russian influence was of little benefit to its residents. The oppression of the British, the repression of the mullahs, and an ancient culture of violence and vendetta prompted Bacha Khan to want to serve and uplift his fellow men and women by means of education. At 20 years of age, Bacha Khan opened his first school in Utmanzai. It was an instant success and he was soon invited into a larger circle of progressively minded reformers. While he faced much opposition and personal difficulties, Bacha Khan Khan worked tirelessly to organise and raise the consciousness of his fellow Pashtuns. Between 1915 and 1918 he visited 500 villages in all part of the settled districts of Khyber- Pakhtunkhwa. It was in this frenzied activity that he had come to be known as Badshah (Bacha) Khan (King of Chiefs). Being a secular Muslim he did not believe in religious divisions. He married his first wife Meharqanda in 1912; she was a daughter of Yar Mohammad Khan of the Kinankhel clan of the Mohammadzai tribe of Razzar, a village adjacent to Utmanzai. They had a son in 1913, Abdul Ghani Khan, who would become a noted artist and poet. Subsequently, they had another son, Abdul Wali Khan (17 January 1917 ‚Äì unknown), and daughter, Sardaro. Meharqanda died during the 1918 influenza epidemic. In 1920, Bacha Khan remarried; his new wife, Nambata, was a cousin of his first wife and the daughter of Sultan Mohammad Khan of Razzar. She bore him a daughter, Mehar Taj (25 May 1921 ‚Äì 29 April 2012), and a son, Abdul Ali Khan (20 August 1922 ‚Äì 19 February 1997). Tragically, in 1926 Nambata died early as well from a fall down the stairs of the apartment where they were staying in Jerusalem.Kyber Gateway , Retrieved 9 April 2008  Khudai Khidmatgar  Khudai Khidmatgar In time, Bacha Khan's goal came to be the formulation of a united, independent, secular India. To achieve this end, he founded the Khudai Khidmatgar (\\"Servants of God\\"), commonly known as the \\"Red Shirts\\" (Surkh P≈çsh), during the 1920s. The Khudai Khidmatgar was founded on a belief in the power of Gandhi's notion of Satyagraha, a form of active non- violence as captured in an oath. He told its members: > I am going to give you such a weapon that the police and the army will not > be able to stand against it. It is the weapon of the Prophet, but you are > not aware of it. That weapon is patience and righteousness. No power on > earth can stand against it.Nonviolence in the Islamic Context by Mohammed > Abu Nimer 2004 The organisation recruited over 100,000 members and became legendary in opposing (and dying at the hands of) the British-controlled police and army. Through strikes, political organisation and non-violent opposition, the Khudai Khidmatgar were able to achieve some success and came to dominate the politics of Khyber-Pakhtunkhwa. His brother, Dr. Khan Abdul Jabbar Khan (known as Dr. Khan Sahib), led the political wing of the movement, and was the Chief Minister of the province (from 1937 and then until 1947 when his government was dismissed by Mohammad Ali Jinnah of the Muslim League). = Kissa Khwani massacre = On 23 April 1930, Bacha Khan was arrested during protests arising out of the Salt Satyagraha. A crowd of Khudai Khidmatgar gathered in Peshawar's Kissa Khwani (Storytellers) Bazaar. The British ordered troops to open fire with machine guns on the unarmed crowd, killing an estimated 200‚Äì250.Habib, p. 56. The Khudai Khidmatgar members acted in accord with their training in non-violence under Bacha Khan, facing bullets as the troops fired on them.Johansen, p. 62. Two platoons of The Garhwal Rifles regiment under Chandra Singh Garhwali refused to fire on the non-violent crowd. They were later court-martialled with heavy punishment, including life imprisonment.  Bacha Khan and the Indian National Congress  Bacha Khan with Mohandas Gandhi. Bacha Khan forged a close, spiritual, and uninhibited friendship with Gandhi, the pioneer of non-violent mass civil disobedience in India. The two had a deep admiration towards each other and worked together closely till 1947. Khudai Khidmatgar (servants of God) agitated and worked cohesively with the Indian National Congress, the leading national organisation fighting for independence, of which Bacha Khan was a senior and respected member. On several occasions when the Congress seemed to disagree with Gandhi on policy, Bacha Khan remained his staunchest ally. In 1931 the Congress offered him the presidency of the party, but he refused saying, \\"I am a simple soldier and Khudai Khidmatgar, and I only want to serve.\\" He remained a member of the Congress Working Committee for many years, resigning only in 1939 because of his differences with the Party's War Policy. He rejoined the Congress Party when the War Policy was revised. Bacha Khan was a champion of women's rights and non-violence. He became a hero in a society dominated by violence; notwithstanding his liberal views, his unswerving faith and obvious bravery led to immense respect. Throughout his life, he never lost faith in his non- violent methods or in the compatibility of Islam and non-violence. He recognised as a jihad struggle with only the enemy holding swords. He was closely identified with Gandhi because of his non-violence principles and he is known in India as the 'Frontier Gandhi'. One of his Congress associates was Pandit Amir Chand Bombwal of Peshawar. Mahatma Gandhi and Bacha Khan with a leader of the Khaksar Tehrik (founded by Allama Mashriqi).

The New York Times. On 21 June 1947, in Bannu, a loya jirga was held consisting of Bacha Khan, the Khudai Khidmatgars, members of the Provincial Assembly, Mirzali Khan (Faqir of Ipi), and other tribal chiefs, just seven weeks before the partition. The loya jirga declared the Bannu Resolution, which demanded that the Pashtuns be given a choice to have an independent state of Pashtunistan composing all Pashtun territories of British India, instead of being made to join either India or Pakistan. However, the British Raj refused to comply with the demand of this resolution. The congress party refused last-ditch compromises to prevent the partition, like the Cabinet Mission plan and Gandhi's suggestion to offer the position of Prime Minister to Jinnah. As a result, Bacha Khan and his followers felt a sense of betrayal by both Pakistan and India. Bacha Khan's last words to Gandhi and his erstwhile allies in the Congress party were: \\"You have thrown us to the wolves.\\" When the 1947 North-West Frontier Province referendum over accession to Pakistan was held, Bacha Khan, the Khudai Khidmatgars, the then Chief Minister Dr Khan Sahib, and the Indian National Congress Party boycotted the referendum. Some have argued that a segment of the population voted was barred from voting.

Initial overtures led to a successful meeting in Karachi, however a follow-up meeting in the Khudai Khidmatgar headquarters never materialised, allegedly due to the role of Khyber-Pakhtunkhwa Chief Minister, Abdul Qayyum Khan Kashmiri who warned Jinnah that Bacha Khan was plotting his assassination.M.S. Korejo (1993) The Frontier Gandhi, his place in history. Karachi : Oxford University Press. Following this, Bacha Khan formed Pakistan's first National opposition party, on 8 May 1948, the Pakistan Azad Party. The party pledged to play the role of constructive opposition and would be non-communal in its philosophy. However, suspicions of his allegiance persisted and under the new Pakistani government, Bacha Khan was placed under house arrest without charge from 1948 till 1954. Released from prison, he gave a speech again on the floor of the constituent assembly, this time condemning the massacre of his supporters at Babrra.Syed Minhajul Hassan,(1998) Babra Firing Incident: 12 August 1948, Peshawar: University of Peshawar.

Amnesty's statement about him said, \\"His example symbolizes the suffering of upward of a million people all over the world who are prisoners of conscience.\\" In September 1964, the Pakistani authorities allowed him to go to United Kingdom for treatment. During the winter, his doctor advised him to go to United States. He then went into exile to Afghanistan, he returned from exile in December 1972 to popular support, following the establishment of a National Awami Party provincial government in North West Frontier Province and Balochistan. He was arrested by Prime Minister Zulfiqar Ali Bhutto's government at Multan in November 1973 and described Bhuttos government as \\"the worst kind of dictatorship\\".Wolpert, Stanley A. 1993.

Retrieved 21 January 2008 His final major political challenge was against the Kalabagh dam project, fearing that the project would damage the Peshawar valley, his hostility to it would eventually lead to the project being shelved after his death. Bacha Khan died in Peshawar under house arrest in 1988 and was buried in his house at Jalalabad, Afghanistan. Over 200,000 mourners attended his funeral, including the Afghan president Mohammad Najibullah. This was a symbolic move by Bacha Khan, as this would allow his dream of Pashtun unification to live even after his death. Then Indian Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi went to Peshawar, to pay his tributes to Bacha Khan despite the fact that General Zia ul-Haq attempted to stall his attendance citing security reasons. Additionally, the Indian government declared a five-day period of mourning in his honour. Although he had been repeatedly imprisoned and persecuted, tens of thousands of mourners attended his funeral, described by one commentator as a caravan of peace, carrying a message of love from Pashtuns east of the Khyber to those on the west, marching through the historic Khyber Pass from Peshawar to Jalalabad. A cease-fire was announced in the Afghan Civil War to allow the funeral to take place, even though it was marred by bomb explosions killing 15.January 23, 1988 edition of The New York Times Pashtunistan Abdul Ghaffar Khan when took an oath of allegiance to Pakistan in 1948 in legislation assembly and during his speech he was asked by PM Liaquat Ali Khan about Pashtunistan to which he replied that it's just a name to the Pashtun province in Pakistan same like Punjab, Bengal, Sindh and Baluchishtan are the names of provinces of Pakistan as ethno-linguistic names, contrary to what he believed and strived for Pashtunistan an independent state. Later on in 1980 during an interview with an Indian journalist, Haroon Siddiqui, Abdul Ghaffar Khan said that the \\"idea of Pashtunistan never helped Pashtuns. In fact it was never a reality\\". He further said that \\"successive Afghan governments have exploited the idea for their own political ends\\". It was only towards the end of Mohammed Daoud Khan regime that he stopped talking about Pashtunistan. Later on, even Nur Muhammad Taraki also talked about the idea of Pashtunistan and caused trouble for Pakistan. He said that \\"Pashtun people greatly suffered because of all this\\". Abdul Ghaffar Khan gave this interview while he was in Jalalabad, Afghanistan.  Legacy  right His eldest son Ghani Khan was a poet. Ghani Khan was married to Roshan who Parsi by faith. His second son Khan Abdul Wali Khan is the founder and leader of the Awami National Party and was the Leader of the Opposition in the Pakistan National Assembly. His third son Khan Abdul Ali Khan was non-political and a distinguished educator, and served as Vice-Chancellor of University of Peshawar. Ali Khan was also the head of Aitchison College, Lahore and Fazle Haq college, Mardan. His niece Mariam married Jaswant Singh in 1939. Jaswant Singh was a young British Indian airforce officer and was Sikh by faith. Mariam later converted to Christianity. Mohammed Yahya Education Minister of Khyber Pukhtunkhwa, was the only son in law of Bacha Khan. Asfandyar Wali Khan is the grandson of Khan Abdul Gaffar Khan, and leader of the Awami National Party. The party was in power from 2008 to 2013. Zarine Khan Walsh, who lives in Mumbai, is the granddaughter of Khan Abdul Ghaffar Khan and was the second daughter of Khan Abdul Ghaffar Khan's eldest son Abdul Ghani Khan. The All India Pakhtoon Jirga-e-Hind is chaired by Yasmin Nigar Khan, who claims to be the great-granddaughter of Abdul Ghaffar Khan. Awami National Party leader Asfandyar Wali Khan rejected the claim, though a culutral ministry official clarified that Yasmin Nigar Khan was a descendent of Khan Abdul Ghaffar Khan's \\"adopted\\" son. Salma Ataullahjan is the great grand niece of Khan Abdul Gaffar Khan and a member of the Senate of Canada. Bacha Khan's political legacy is renowned amongst Pashtuns and those in modern Republic of India as a leader of a non-violent movement. Within Pakistan, however, the vast majority of society have questioned his stance with the All India Congress over the Muslim League as well as his opposition to the partition of India and Jinnah. In particular, people have questioned where Bacha Khan's patriotism rests.

Humans usually have four parathyroid glands, located on the back of the thyroid gland in variable locations. The parathyroid gland produces and secretes parathyroid hormone in response to a low blood calcium, which plays a key role in regulating the amount of calcium in the blood and within the bones. Parathyroid glands share a similar blood supply, venous drainage, and lymphatic drainage to the thyroid glands. Parathyroid glands are derived from the epithelial lining of the third and fourth pharyngeal pouches, with the superior glands arising from the fourth pouch and the inferior glands arising from the higher third pouch. The relative position of the inferior and superior glands, which are named according to their final location, changes because of the migration of embryological tissues. Hyperparathyroidism and hypoparathyroidism, characterized by alterations in the blood calcium levels and bone metabolism, are states of either surplus or deficient parathyroid function. Structure The parathyroid glands are two pairs of glands usually positioned behind the left and right lobes of the thyroid. Each gland is a yellowish-brown flat ovoid that resembles a lentil seed, usually about 6 mm long and 3 to 4 mm wide, and 1 to 2 mm anteroposteriorly. There are typically four parathyroid glands. The two parathyroid glands on each side which are positioned higher are called the superior parathyroid glands, while the lower two are called the inferior parathyroid glands. Healthy parathyroid glands generally weigh about 30 mg in men and 35 mg in women. These glands are not visible or able to be felt during examination of the neck.Illustrated Anatomy of the Head and Neck, Fehrenbach and Herring, Elsevier, 2012, p. 159 Each parathyroid vein drains into the superior, middle and inferior thyroid veins. The superior and middle thyroid veins drain into the internal jugular vein, and the inferior thyroid vein drains into the brachiocephalic vein. =Lymphatic drainage= Lymphatic vessels from the parathyroid glands drain into deep cervical lymph nodes and paratracheal lymph nodes. =Variation= The parathyroid glands are variable in number: three or more small glands, and can usually be located on the posterior surface of the thyroid gland. Occasionally, some individuals may have six, eight, or even more parathyroid glands. Rarely, the parathyroid glands may be within the thyroid gland itself, the chest, or even the thymus. =Microanatomy= The parathyroid glands are named for their proximity to the thyroid -- and serve a completely different role than the thyroid gland. The parathyroid glands are quite easily recognizable from the thyroid as they have densely packed cells, in contrast with the follicular structure of the thyroid. Two unique types of cells are present in the parathyroid gland: * Chief cells, which synthesize and release parathyroid hormone. These cells are small, and appear dark when loaded with parathyroid hormone, and clear when the hormone has been secreted, or in their resting state. * Oxyphil cells, which are lighter in appearance and increase in number with age, have an unknown function. File:Parathyroid gland intermed mag.jpgIntermediate magnification micrograph. H&E; stain. The white round structures are fat cells. Adipose tissue comprises 25‚Äì40% of normal parathyroid gland tissue. File:Parathyroid oxyphil and chief cells - annotated.jpgHigh magnification micrograph. H&E; stain. The small, dark cells are chief cells, which are responsible for secreting parathyroid hormone. The cells with orange/pink staining cytoplasm are oxyphil cells =Development= In the early development of the human embryo, a series of five pharyngeal arches and four pharyngeal pouches form that give rise to the face, neck, and surrounding structures. The pouches are numbered such that the first pouch is the closest to the top of the embryo's head and the fourth is the furthest from it. The parathyroid glands originate from the interaction of the endoderm of the third and fourth pouch and neural crest mesenchyme. The position of the glands reverses during embryological life. The pair of glands which is ultimately inferior develops from the third pouch with the thymus, whereas the pair of glands which is ultimately superior develops from the fourth pouch. During embryological development, the thymus migrates downwards, dragging the inferior glands with it. The superior pair are not dragged downwards by the fourth pouch to the same degree. The glands are named after their final, not embryological, positions. Since the thymus's ultimate destination is in the mediastinum of the chest, it is occasionally possible to have ectopic parathyroids derived from the third pouch within the chest cavity if they fail to detach in the neck. Parathyroid development is regulated by a number of genes, including those coding for several transcription factors. Function The major function of the parathyroid glands is to maintain the body's calcium and phosphate levels within a very narrow range, so that the nervous and muscular systems can function properly. The parathyroid glands do this by secreting parathyroid hormone (PTH). Parathyroid hormone (also known as parathormone) is a small protein that takes part in the control of calcium and phosphate homeostasis, as well as bone physiology. Parathyroid hormone has effects antagonistic to those of calcitonin. * Calcium. PTH increases blood calcium levels by directly stimulating osteoblasts and thereby indirectly stimulating osteoclasts (through RANK/RANKL mechanism) to break down bone and release calcium. PTH increases gastrointestinal calcium absorption by activating vitamin D, and promotes calcium conservation (reabsorption) by the kidneys. * Phosphate. PTH is the major regulator of serum phosphate concentrations via actions on the kidney. It is an inhibitor of proximal tubular reabsorption of phosphorus. Through activation of vitamin D the absorption (intestinal) of Phosphate is increased. Disorders Parathyroid disease is conventionally divided into states where the parathyroid is overactive (hyperparathyroidism), and states where the parathyroid is under- or hypoactive (hypoparathyroidism). Both states are characterised by their symptoms, which relate to the excess or deficiency of parathyroid hormone in the blood. =Hyperparathyroidism= Primary Hyperparathyroidism is the state in which there is excess parathyroid hormone circulating. This may cause bone pain and tenderness, due to increased bone resorption. Due to increased circulating calcium, there may be other symptoms associated with hypercalcemia, most commonly dehydration. Hyperparathyroidism is most commonly caused by a benign proliferation of chief cells in single gland, and rarely MEN syndrome. This is known as primary hyperparathyroidism, which is generally managed by surgical removal of the abnormal parathyroid gland. Secondary Renal disease may lead to hyperparathyroidism. When too much calcium is lost, there is a compensation by the parathyroid, and parathyroid hormone is released. The glands hypertrophy to synthesise more parathyroid hormone. This is known as secondary hyperparathyroidism. Tertiary If this situation exists for a prolonged period of time, the parathyroid tissue may become unresponsive to the blood calcium levels, and begin to autonomously release parathyroid hormone. This is known as tertiary hyperparathyroidism. =Hypoparathyroidism= The state of decreased parathyroid activity is known as hypoparathyroidism. This is most commonly associated with damage to the glands or their blood supply during thyroid surgery -- it may be associated with rarer genetic syndromes such as DiGeorge syndrome, which is inherited as an autosomal dominant syndrome. Hypoparathyroidism will occur after surgical removal of the parathyroid glands. Occasionally, an individual's tissues are resistant to the effects of parathyroid hormone. This is known as pseudohypoparathyroidism. In this case the parathyroid glands are fully functional, and the hormone itself is not able to function, resulting in a decrease in blood calcium levels. Pseudohypoparathyroidism is often associated with the genetic condition Albright's hereditary osteodystrophy. Pseudopseudohypoparathyroidism, one of the longest words in the English language, is used to describe an individual with Albright's hereditary osteodystrophy; with normal parathyroid hormone and serum calcium levels. Hypoparathyroidism may present with symptoms associated with decreased calcium, and is generally treated with Vitamin D analogues. History The parathyroid glands were first discovered in the Indian Rhinoceros by Richard Owen in 1852. In his description of the neck anatomy, Owen referred to the glands as \\"a small compact yellow glandular body attached to the thyroid at the point where the veins emerged\\". The glands were first discovered in humans by Ivar Viktor Sandstr√∂m (1852‚Äì1889), a Swedish medical student, in 1880 at Uppsala University. Unaware of Owen's description, he described the glands in his monograph \\"On a New Gland in Man and Fellow Animals\\" as the \\"glandulae parathyroidae\\", noting its existence in dogs, cats, rabbits, oxen, horses and humans. For several years, Sandstr√∂m's description received little attention. Physiologist Eugene Gley first documented the putative function of the glands in 1891, noting the connection between their removal and the development of muscular tetany. William G. MacCallum in 1908, investigating tumours of the parathyroid, proposed their role in calcium metabolism. He noted that \\"Tetany occurs spontaneously in many forms and may be produced by the destruction of the parathyroid glands\\". The first successful removal of the parathyroid may have been carried out in 1928 by medical doctor Isaac Y Olch, whose intern had noticed elevated calcium levels in an elderly patient with muscle weakness. Prior to this surgery, patients with removed parathyroid glands typically died from muscular tetany. Parathyroid hormone was isolated in 1923 by Adolph M. Hanson and 1925 by James B. Collip. Studies of parathyroid hormone levels by Roger Guillemin, Andrew Schally and Rosalyn Sussman Yalow led to the development of immunoassays capable of measuring body substances and a Nobel Prize in 1977. Other animals Parathyroid glands are found in all adult tetrapods; they vary in their number and position. Mammals typically have four parathyroid glands, while other types of animals typically have six. The removal of parathyroid glands in animals produces a condition resembling acute poisoning with irregular muscle contractions. Fish do not possess parathyroid glands; several species have been found to express parathyroid hormone. Developmental genes and calcium-sensing receptors in fish gills are similar to those within the parathyroid glands of birds and mammals. It has been suggested that the tetrapod glands may have been evolutionarily derived from these fish gills.

A smart mob is a group whose coordination and communication abilities have been empowered by digital communication technologies. Smart mobs are particularly known for their ability to mobilize quickly. The concept was introduced by Howard Rheingold in his book Smart Mobs: The Next Social Revolution. Rheingold defined the smart mob as follows: \\"Smart mobs consist of people who are able to act in concert even if they don‚Äôt know each other... because they carry devices that possess both communication and computing capabilities\\". In December of that year, the \\"smart mob\\" concept was highlighted in the New York Times \\"Year in Ideas\\". Characteristics These technologies that empower smart mobs include the Internet, computer-mediated communication such as Internet Relay Chat, and wireless devices like mobile phones and personal digital assistants. Methodologies like peer-to-peer networks and ubiquitous computing are also changing the ways in which people organize and share information. Smart mobs sometimes are manipulated by the dispatchers who control the 'mobbing system' (i.e., those who own the contact list and the means to forward instant messages to a group) and are induced to cause distress and aggravation to individuals who have been targeted or singled out for whatever reason. There is a tendency to keep the dynamics of smart mobbing 'covert', and not to discuss such incidents on the internet. Flash mobs are a specific form of smart mob, originally describing a group of people who assemble suddenly in a public place, do something unusual and pointless for a brief period of time, then quickly disperse. The difference between flash and smart mobs is primarily with regards to their duration: flash mobs disappear quickly, but smart mobs can have a more enduring presence. The term flash mob is claimed to have been inspired by \\"smart mob\\".wordspy.com, flash mob Smart mobs have begun to have an impact in current events, as mobile phones and text messages have empowered everyone from revolutionaries in Malaysia to individuals protesting the second Iraq War. Individuals who have divergent worldviews and methods have been able to coordinate short-term. A 2009 entry in the Encyclopedia of Computer Science and Technology noted that the term may be \\"fading from public use\\". Early instances A forerunner to the idea can be found in the work of anarchist thinker Kropotkin, \\"fishermen, hunters, travelling merchants, builders, or settled craftsmen came together for a common pursuit.\\" According to CNN, the first smart mobs were teenage \\"thumb tribes\\" in Tokyo and Helsinki who used text messaging on cell phones to organize impromptu raves or to stalk celebrities. For instance, in Tokyo, crowds of teenage fans would assemble seemingly spontaneously at subway stops where a rock musician was rumored to be headed. However, an even earlier example is the D√Æner en blanc phenomenon, which has taken place annually in Paris, France, since 1988, for one night around the end of June. The invited guests wear only white clothes and gather at a chosen spot, knowledge of which they have only a short time beforehand. They bring along food, drink, chairs and a table and the whole group then gathers to have a meal, after which they disperse. The event has been held each year in different places in the centre of Paris. It is not a normal cultural event because it is not advertised and only those who have received an invite attend‚Äîinformation on the chosen location is transferred by text message or more recently Twitter. The number of people attending has grown, in 2011, to over 10,000.essen-und-trinken.de, Le Diner Blanc: wei√ües Dinner in Paris. [in German] D√Æner en blanc would be considered a smart mob rather than a flash mob, because the event lasts for several hours. The Professional Contractors Group organised the first smart mob in the UK in 2000 when 700 contractors turned up at The House of Commons to lobby their MP following an email sent out a few days before. In the days after the U.S. presidential election of 2000, online activist Zack Exley anonymously created a website that allowed people to suggest locations for gatherings to protest for a full recount of the votes in Florida. On the first Saturday after the election, more than 100 significant protests took place‚Äîmany with thousands of participants‚Äîwithout any traditional organizing effort. Exley wrote in December 2000 that the self-organized protests \\"demonstrated that a fundamental change is taking place in our national political life. It's not the Internet per se, but the emerging potential for any individual to communicate‚Äîfor free and anonymously if necessary‚Äîwith any other individual.\\"\\"Organizing Online\\" Mother Jones, December 2000 In the Philippines in 2001, a group of protesters organized via text messaging gathered at the EDSA Shrine, the site of the 1986 revolution that overthrew Ferdinand Marcos, to protest the corruption of President Joseph Estrada. The protest grew quickly, and Estrada was soon removed from office.\\"Day of the smart mobs\\", CNN The Critical Mass bicycling events, dating back to 1992, are also sometimes compared to smart mobs, due to their self-organizing manner of assembly.\\"Dadaist lunacy or the future of protest?\\", Social Issues Research Center\\"Flash! Mobs in the Age of Mobile Connectivity\\" Fibreculture Journal, issue 6 Examples Essentially, the smart mob is a practical implementation of collective intelligence. According to Rheingold, examples of smart mobs are the street protests organized by the anti-globalization movement. The Free State Project has been described in 'Foreign Policy' as an example of potential \\"smart mob rule\\". Other examples of smart mobs include: *Smart mobs who arrange the meet up over the internet and show up at a retailer at a specific time and use their number to negotiate a discount with the retailer. *eBay a collection of users who are empowered by the internet and eBay to buy and sell and maintain the quality control over all transactions through the rating system. People can leave positive, negative or neutral feedback, depending on how they felt about their transaction with that seller. *Text messages that were sent in the Philippines, which are thought to be partly responsible for the demonstration that ousted former President Joseph Estrada. Examples of such a text message read \\"Wear black to mourn the death of democracy\\", \\"Expect there to be rumbles\\" and \\"Go to EDSA\\". *The 11 March 2004 Madrid attacks (11M), and the reaction from the people against the government in the Spanish elections of 14 March 2004. *The 2005 civil unrest in France exhibited smart mobs‚Äîthe French national police spokesman, Patrick Hamon, was quoted in the Wall Street Journal as saying that youths, mainly those of the Muslim faith, in individual neighborhoods were communicating by cellphone text messages, online blogs, and/or email‚Äîarranging meetings and warning each other about police operations. *The 2006 student protests in Chile and 2007 Chilean government-Microsoft agreement are the example in Latin America about the smart mobs and the use of weblogs, Fotologs, Photoblogs, text messages and digital organization in a few hours. Also due to their online organization has called the attention of the press as a source of news because of the strong activism online. *On July 5, 2005, during U2's performance of the song New Year's Day at a stadium in Chorz√≥w, Poland, the audience of 70,000 waved colored articles of clothing to form a giant Polish flag of white and red: fans on the pitch waved red, those in the bleachers waved white. This behavior was coordinated by fans communicating on the internet. *On November 6, 2008, more than 500 students across Taiwan began a sit-in protest in front of the Executive Yuan. Known as the Wild Strawberry Students Movement ÈáéËçâËéìÂ≠∏ÈÅã, this assembly was mobilised overnight with the help of an on-line Bulletin Board System (BBS). The students were equipped with mobile technology such as HSDPA (high speed download packet access) and web-cameras. They soon set up a live broadcast that aired for 24 hours a day over the internet for more than a week, and they used mobile devices to keep up to date with government reactions on the mass media. One of the main themes of the protest was for amendment of the Assembly and Parade Law that curbed freedom of expression: this demand earned support from various non-government organizations nationwide. *The release of the Baauer song, Harlem Shake is one of 2013's most recent smart mob phenomena. The song reached 700 million views in the month of February on YouTube. The song and dance has influences from a dance originally released in the 1980s. The phenomenon involves large groups of people banding together, utilizing their weak ties, and all filming a video dancing to the Harlem Shake. On February 10, 2013, the upload rate of the \\"Harlem Shake\\" videos was 4,000 per day onto YouTube. The increasing popularity has enabled the video to become used as a political statement, such as in Egypt, where a smart mob formed to perform the dance outside the Egyptian Islamic president's headquarters. According to Rhinegold's characteristics of what makes a smart mob, such as a lack of centralized control and peer to peer influence, the \\"Harlem Shake\\" is the epitome of a smart mob.http://www.demos.co.uk/files/File/networklogic15rheingold.pdf In popular culture The comic book Global Frequency, written by Warren Ellis, describes a covert, non-governmental intelligence organization built around a smart mob of people that are called on to provide individual expertise in solving extraordinary crises. David Brin's speculative science fiction novel, Existence (), similarly posits the use of on-the-fly smart mobs by credible journalists as sources of information and expertise.

It is located at the city's biggest intersection of Cobb Parkway (U.S. 41/Georgia 3) and Roswell Road (Georgia 120) and is a well- known landmark in the area. Constructed in 1956, it was rebuilt following storm damage in 1993 and underwent a $2 million renovation project in 2017. History \\"The Big Chicken\\" in 2016 The Big Chicken in action. The restaurant was built in 1956 at 12 Cobb Parkway, on the newly constructed stretch of Highway 41, the first divided highway in Cobb County. Taking advantage of the prime location on the new and quicker route for travelers on U.S. 41, Johnny Reb's Chick, Chuck and Shake owner S. R. \\"Tubby\\" Davis erected the 56-foot (17-meter) tall structure over his restaurant in 1963 as a method of advertising. The novelty architecture was designed by Hubert Puckett, a Georgia Tech student of architecture, and fabricated by Atlantic Steel in nearby Atlanta (of which Marietta is a suburb). Davis later sold it to his brother, and it became a franchise of KFC. In January 1993, storm winds damaged the structure, and rather than tear it down KFC was forced by public outcry to re-erect the building. Among those who complained about the Big Chicken being torn down were pilots, who used the building as a reference point when approaching Hartsfield‚ÄìJackson Atlanta International Airport and Dobbins Air Reserve Base. The new Big Chicken includes the original design of beak and eyes which move, although this time the vibrations which plagued the first structure (even to the point of breaking windows) have been eliminated. Pieces of the original structure were sold to collectors as souvenirs. In early April 2006, the structure narrowly escaped a small eastward-moving nighttime tornado, which overturned a tractor-trailer at a Kmart across the street, and damaged another building nearby. The Big Chicken is commonly used as a landmark for driving directions. Locals will often include \\"make a [turn] at the Big Chicken\\", or \\"it's about x miles past the Big Chicken\\". This is referenced in music video game Rock Band 3's \\"Road Challenge Mode\\", when the player is told \\"Don't be alarmed if you're asking for directions in the bus and the locals tell you to 'turn left at the Big Chicken'\\". It has also led to a small cottage industry of sorts, selling souvenirs emblazoned with the monument, including one sweatshirt showing Big Ben in London, the Eiffel Tower in Paris, the Colosseum in Rome, and of course, the Big Chicken in Marietta. A board game featuring the Big Chicken and other local landmarks was also produced. There is a barbershop-style singing group called the Big Chicken Chorus, formed in 1986, which gives concerts throughout the year. The Big Chicken was also featured on a promotional card in Sim City: The Card Game. The Big Chicken has also appeared in the comic strip Zippy the Pinhead as a part of artist Bill Griffith's fascination with roadside icons. In early 2017 it was announced that The Big Chicken would undergo a twelve-week, $2 million renovation, incorporating the chain's newest design and a gift shop. The renovations began January 23, 2017. The restaurant reopened with a ribbon- cutting ceremony on May 11, 2017.

A typical \\"mind the gap\\" warning sign found on the Toronto subway A former \\"Please mind the gap\\" sign on a Hong Kong MTR train \\"Mind the gap\\" () is an audible or visual warning phrase issued to rail passengers to take caution while crossing the horizontal, and in some cases vertical, spatial gap between the train door and the station platform. The phrase was first introduced in 1968 on the London Underground in the United Kingdom. It is today popularly associated with the UK among tourists because of the particularly British word choice (this meaning of the verb mind has largely fallen into disuse in the US).  Origin of the phrase  The phrase \\"Mind the gap\\" was coined in around 1968 for a planned automated announcement, after it had become impractical for drivers and station attendants to warn passengers. London Underground chose digital recording using solid state equipment with no moving parts. page 220. As data storage capacity was expensive, the phrase had to be short. A concise warning was also easier to paint onto the platform. The equipment was supplied by AEG Telefunken. According to the Independent on Sunday, sound engineer Peter Lodge, who owned Redan Recorders in Bayswater, working with a Scottish Telefunken engineer, recorded an actor reading \\"Mind the gap\\" and \\"Stand clear of the doors please\\", but the actor insisted on royalties and the phrases had to be re-recorded. Lodge read the phrases to line up the recording equipment for level and those were used. While Lodge's recording is still in use, some lines use other recordings. One was recorded by voice artist Emma Clarke. Others, on the Piccadilly line for example, were by Archers actor Tim Bentinck for 15 years, but are now by Julie Berry. At least 10 stations were supplied with announcers manufactured by PA Communications Ltd. of Milton Keynes. The recorded voice is that of Keith Wilson, their industrial sales manager at the time (May 1990). It can still be heard, at Paddington for example. In March 2013, an old \\"Mind the gap\\" recording by Oswald Laurence was restored to the curved northbound platform at Embankment station on the Northern line's Charing Cross branch so that the actor's widow could hear his voice.  Use in Britain  = London Underground = Because some platforms on the London Underground are curved and the rolling stock that uses them are straight, an unsafe gap is created when a train stops at a curved platform. In the absence of a device to fill the gap, some form of visual and auditory warning is needed to advise passengers of the risk of being caught unaware and sustaining injury by stepping into the gap. The phrase \\"Mind the gap\\" was chosen for this purpose and can be found painted along the edges of curved platforms as well as heard on recorded announcements played when a train arrives at many Underground stations. The recording is also used where platforms are non- standard height. Deep-level tube trains have a floor height around less than sub-surface stock trains. Where trains share platforms, for example some Piccadilly line (deep-tube) and District line (sub-surface) stations, the platform is a compromise. On London's Metropolitan line, a gap has been created between the train and the platform edge at Aldgate and Baker Street stations. This is due to the phasing out of the old \\"A\\" stock trains and their replacement with \\"S\\" stock trains, which have low floors to ease accessibility for disabled people. \\"Mind the gap\\" audible warnings are always played on the Central line platforms at Bank, the Northern line northbound platform at Embankment, and the Bakerloo line platforms at Piccadilly Circus. There are markings on the platform edge which usually line up with the doors on the cars. While the message is sometimes played over the platform's public address system on some lines, but usually it as an arrival message inside the train itself: \\"Please mind the gap between the train and the platform\\".  Use in Ireland  The phrase \\"mind the gap\\" can be heard at each station along Dublin's DART and at all stations in the city centre. In the rest of Ireland, the message can be seen on some train stations as well. On Commuter and InterCity trains, the phrase \\"Please mind the gap\\" is accompanied by the Irish \\"Seachain an Bhearna le do thoil\\" when pulling into stations.  The phrase worldwide  = In trains = Greek and English Metro-North in New York alt=A light-colored sign with Chinese characters and \\"Note that the level of gap\\" written on it in blue \\"Mind the gap\\" and \\"No smoking\\" notice in metal- plate at Hangzhou railway station \\"Mind the gap\\" is used by transit systems worldwide, particularly when there are stations on curves, but most new systems tend to avoid these types of stations.  Europe  * The French version, which is an , \\"\\" (\\"Be careful of the step while getting off the train\\"), is occasionally written on signs on the platforms in the Paris M√©tro and can be heard in RER trains. Some newer M√©tro trains also play this announcement in Italian, English, German, Japanese and Spanish. * In the Athens Metro, the message \\"Mind the gap between the train and the platform\\" is heard in both Greek and English at the station of Monastiraki. * In Stockholm's tunnelbana and on Stockholm commuter rail's stations two versions can be heard: \\"\\", meaning \\"Mind the distance between carriage and platform when you exit\\". It is also displayed as text on electronic displays. * In Oslo, T-bane trains play a recorded Norwegian warning -- \\"V√¶r oppmerksom p√• avstand mellom tog og platform\\" (Be aware of the distance between train and platform.) -- followed up by the English \\"Please mind the gap.\\" * In Helsinki, on some commuter rail stations \\"Mind the gap\\" can be heard in English, Finnish and Swedish. * In Hamburg, passengers at the S-Bahn station Berliner Tor are warned with yellow flashing lights and the announcement \\"\\" (\\"Please mind the gap between train and platform\\"). * On the Berlin U-Bahn, the phrase \\"\\" (\\"Please mind the gap between train and platform edge when alighting\\") is used, followed by the English \\"Mind the gap between platform and train.\\" * On the Madrid Metro, a recorded warning message can be heard inside the trains when approaching a station with curved platforms: \\"\\" (\\"Caution: station on a curve. As you exit, be careful not to place your foot between the train and the platform.\\") No warning messages are heard when arriving at a station with straight platforms. * On the Lisbon Metro at the Marqu√™s de Pombal station on the blue line, the announcement \\"\\" (\\"Pay attention to the gap between the platform and the train\\") can be heard. * On all of the trains of the Milan Metro network, a yellow sticker on every door is clearly visible with the warning in Italian language \\"\\" (meaning literally \\"Pay attention to the gap between the train and the platform\\") and also in English \\"Mind the gap between the train and the platform\\".  Asia and Oceania  * In Jakarta's Commuterline (KRL), the train announce \\"Perhatikan jarak antara peron dengan kereta.\\" is spoken. This translates as: \\"Please mind the gap between the train and the platform.\\" The English announcement spoken after with the words: \\"Please mind the platform gap.\\" * In Singapore's MRT, the phrase 'Please mind the platform gap' and 'Please mind the gap' is used in announcements in English, played in the trains whenever a train approaches an underground station after the station's name has been announced twice. It is also played on underground station platforms just after the train doors open, or sometimes, just as the train approaches the platform. Trains also have stickers pasted on the windows to caution passengers. * The phrase can be heard in New Delhi Metro in two languages (English and Hindi): \\"\\" (\\"Mind the gap\\"). * In Hong Kong's MTR, the phrase \\"Please mind the gap\\" () is announced in three languages, namely, Cantonese, English and Mandarin. In recent years, a more elaborate version of the announcement, heard on some East Rail Line stations with very curved platforms, says \\"Please mind the gap and be aware of the difference in levels between the platform and the train\\" (). * Several mainland Chinese metro systems use the phrase extensively; on the Tianjin Metro, stickers on train doors, platforms and announcements mention the gap (as well as to \\"mind the gap\\") in both English and Chinese. (The Chinese phrase is .) The Beijing Subway uses \\"Mind the Gaps\\" (note the plural). In lines operated by Beijing MTR Corp., Ltd. the Hong Kong/British influence is espeically prominent, with the English announcement in British prounciation \\"Please mind the gap between the train and the platform\\" being played every time a train arrives. Both the Shanghai Metro and the Nanjing Metro use versions with slightly mutilated grammar (\\"Caution, Gap\\" and \\"Care the Gap\\", respectively, although the Chinese is the same). * On the Manila Metro Rail Transit System Line 3, a pre-recorded message is played at certain stations reminding passengers to \\"Watch your step and watch the gap between the train and the platform as you get on and off the train\\". This is simplified in its Filipino translation, which simply reminds passengers to be careful in boarding and alighting the train. * On most Sydney Trains stations and on Waratah series train carriages, there is an automated announcement reminding passengers to mind the gap (\\"Please mind the gap when boarding and alighting from the train\\") as well as posters informing riders about the number of people who fall down the gap each year. * On many trains in Japan, the message \\"\\" is spoken. This translates as: \\"There is a wide space between the train and the platform, so please be careful\\". The phrase \\"\\" is also common, which means \\"Please mind your step\\". Bangkok underground train announcement * In Thailand, the announcement is used a little bit differently from the London one. On Bangkok underground trains and Airport Rail Link trains, it says, \\"Please mind the gap between train and platform\\". Some grammarians argue that as specific and countable nouns, the words \\"train\\" and \\"platform\\" should be preceded by \\"the\\". Also, the Thai language version of the announcement does not refer to a \\"gap\\" but simply translates to \\"Please be careful when stepping out of the train\\". However, in the Bangkok skytrain stations, the Thai announcement mentions the \\"gap\\", and can be translated as: \\"Attention, passengers, while entering and exiting the train, please mind the gap between the platform and the train. Thank you!\\" The English announcement says: \\"Attention, please mind the gap between train and platform. Thank you!\\" * Signs on ferry docks in Shanghai render the phrase in Chinglish as \\"Note that the level of gap\\". * Announcement will be made on Seoul Metro trains when arriving stations with curved platform, e.g. Myeong-dong Station on Line 4 and Singil Station on Line 1, says \\"\\" (translates as: There is a big gap between the station platform and the train, please be careful when getting off) and \\"Please watch your step\\" in Korean and English. * Adelaide Metro trains conclude automated station announcements with the reminder \\"Please mind the gap when alighting from the train\\". * Many Queensland Rail trains announce \\"mind the gap\\" after the station name on arrival at a station.  Americas  * In early 2009 the phrase was also being used on Metro Transit (King County) buses in and around Seattle, Washington. * At the stations of the S√£o Paulo Metro and CPTM in S√£o Paulo, Brazil the sentence that can be heard is \\"Cuidado com o v√£o entre o trem e a plataforma\\" (\\"Watch the gap between the train and the platform\\"). * At almost all stations of SuperVia, Rio de Janeiro suburban trains, the driver announces \\"Observe o espa√ßo entre o trem e a plataforma\\" (\\"Watch the space between the train and the platform\\"), and sometimes \\"Observe o desn√≠vel entre o trem e a plataforma\\" (\\"Watch the level difference between the train and the platform\\"). * In the Rio de Janeiro Metro, the phrase \\"Observe atentamente o espa√ßo entre o trem e a plataforma ‚Äì Mind the gap\\" also can be heard. * During the CPTM trains trips in S√£o Paulo, the announcer says, before reaching a station \\"Ao desembarcar, cuidado com o v√£o entre o trem e a plataforma ‚Äì Before leaving, mind the gap between the train and the platform\\". * The New York City-area Long Island Rail Road, Metro-North, and New Jersey Transit use signs that read \\"Watch the gap\\" on trains and platforms. Because of reports of people falling through the gap, a warning is now played at every station, plus automated announcements on board the trains of all three railroads. ** The Metropolitan Transportation Authority (MTA), which operates LIRR and MNRR, retained New York personalities including Maria Bartiromo and Al Roker to recite the slogan. The newer trains with automated announcements also announce \\"As you leave the train, please watch/step over the gap between the train and platform\\" to warn passengers to use caution. ** It is also used on the MTA- operated New York City Subway and the Staten Island Railway ‚Äì on trains and platforms, and in conductor announcements. Newer trains equipped with automated announcements would say \\"As you exit, please be careful of the gap between the platform and the train\\" where applicable after a station announcement is made. ** New Jersey Transit uses signs on doors on all trains that read \\"Caution: Watch the gap\\" and an announcement plays \\"When leaving the train, please watch the gap\\" where applicable, to warn passengers to remain cautious of the gap. * Plaques on Toronto subway station platforms warn riders to \\"Mind the gap\\". Announcements about the warning on the public announcement system in each station can also be heard intermittently. * In the United States, the standard Amtrak conductor announcement when approaching any station stop concludes with \\"Mind the gap between the train and the platform\\". * On the Buenos Aires Metro, warnings on platform floors and on the door windows in the trains read \\"Cuidado con el espacio entre el tren y el and√©n.\\" (\\"Mind the gap between train and platform\\"). * The MBTA in Boston has added \\"Mind the gap\\" warnings near the platform edges in the 2016 renovated Government Center Station. = Other uses = \\"Mind the gap\\" doormat Despite its origin as a utilitarian safety warning, \\"Mind the gap\\" has become a stock phrase, and is used in many other contexts having little to do with subway safety. The phrase is printed on iconic souvenir T-shirts that Transport for London sells, featuring the warning printed over the network's roundel logo. It has been used as the title of at least two music albums by Scooter and Tristan Psionic, a film, and a novel, as the name of a movie production company, a theatre company, and a board game. At least four non-fiction book titles use \\"Mind the Gap\\" as their primary title ‚Äì the books are about generations, class divides, social science policy and the origins of human universals. The phrase is used in many video and mobile games, including Portal, Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 3, Halo, Where's My Water, Temple Run, Quantum Conundrum, Killing Floor, Amazing Alex, Armadillo Run and BioShock Infinite, and in animated series such as The Clone Wars, usually in an ironic context. A soldier in Captain America: The First Avenger says it, humorously, before they descend via zip-line onto a moving train across snowy mountain peaks. It was a prominent utterance by the subterranean cannibal killer of the 1972 movie Death Line. The phrase is also featured in the soundtrack of the game Timesplitters: Future Perfect in the Subway level. It is also the title of a Noisettes song on their album What's the Time Mr. Wolf?. The phrase is used in the songs \\"Deadwing\\" by Porcupine Tree, \\"Bingo\\" by Madness, \\"Someone in London\\" by Godsmack, Metal Airplanes by Matthew Good and \\"New Frontier\\" by the Counting Crows. Emma Clarke, one of the voices of the London Underground, has released a Mind The Gap single. It features spoof London Underground announcements. The Portuguese hip hop group Mind Da Gap was also inspired in this stock phrase. The phrase was used as the name for a campaign in December 2010 to lobby the UK Government to allow Gap Year students to defer their university place and not pay the higher tuition fees in September 2012. The Karotz wi-fi rabbit occasionally says \\"Mind the gap!\\" at random as part of the \\"mood\\" setting. The phrase has been used to name a combinatorial optimization problem. The message is also the inspiration behind the name of Hans Rosling's \\"Gapminder\\" software. The phrase was the title of a 1999 game show hosted by Paul Ross, made for ITV by Carlton Television. Also used by rival association football club supporters to refer to their positions in the league table. The original Oswald Laurence \\"Mind the gap\\" announcement and the current voice- over announcements are also used in electronic music.

Following the Vistula‚ÄìOder Offensive of January‚ÄìFebruary 1945, the Red Army had temporarily halted on a line east of Berlin. On 9 March, Germany established its defence plan for the city with Operation Clausewitz. The first defensive preparations at the outskirts of Berlin were made on 20 March, under the newly appointed commander of Army Group Vistula, General Gotthard Heinrici. When the Soviet offensive resumed on 16 April, two Soviet fronts (army groups) attacked Berlin from the east and south, while a third overran German forces positioned north of Berlin. Before the main battle in Berlin commenced, the Red Army encircled the city after successful battles of the Seelow Heights and Halbe. On 20 April 1945, Hitler's birthday, the 1st Belorussian Front led by Marshal Georgy Zhukov, advancing from the east and north, started shelling Berlin's city centre, while Marshal Ivan Konev's 1st Ukrainian Front broke through Army Group Centre and advanced towards the southern suburbs of Berlin. On 23 April General Helmuth Weidling assumed command of the forces within Berlin. The garrison consisted of several depleted and disorganised Wehrmacht and Waffen- SS divisions, along with poorly trained Volkssturm and Hitler Youth members. Over the course of the next week, the Red Army gradually took the entire city. On 30 April, Hitler committed suicide (with several of his officials also committing suicide shortly afterwards). The city's garrison surrendered on 2 May but fighting continued to the north-west, west, and south-west of the city until the end of the war in Europe on 8 May (9 May in the Soviet Union) as some German units fought westward so that they could surrender to the Western Allies rather than to the Soviets. Background alt=Red Army attacks alt=Berlin operation On 12 January 1945, the Red Army began the Vistula‚ÄìOder Offensive across the Narew River; and, from Warsaw, a three-day operation on a broad front, which incorporated four army Fronts. On the fourth day, the Red Army broke out and started moving west, up to per day, taking East Prussia, Danzig, and Pozna≈Ñ, drawing up on a line east of Berlin along the Oder River. The newly created Army Group Vistula, under the command of Reichsf√ºhrer-SS Heinrich Himmler, attempted a counter-attack, but this had failed by 24 February. The Red Army then drove on to Pomerania, clearing the right bank of the Oder River, thereby reaching into Silesia. In the south the Siege of Budapest took place. Three German divisions' attempts to relieve the encircled Hungarian capital city failed, and Budapest fell to the Soviets on 13 February. Adolf Hitler insisted on a counter-attack to recapture the Drau- Danube triangle. The goal was to secure the oil region of Nagykanizsa and regain the Danube River for future operations, but the depleted German forces had been given an impossible task. By 16 March, the German Lake Balaton Offensive had failed, and a counter-attack by the Red Army took back in 24 hours everything the Germans had taken ten days to gain. On 30 March, the Soviets entered Austria; and in the Vienna Offensive they captured Vienna on 13 April. Between June and September 1944, the Wehrmacht had lost more than a million men, and it lacked the fuel and armaments needed to operate effectively. On 12 April 1945, Hitler, who had earlier decided to remain in the city against the wishes of his advisers, heard the news that the American President Franklin D. Roosevelt had died. This briefly raised false hopes in the F√ºhrerbunker that there might yet be a falling out among the Allies and that Berlin would be saved at the last moment, as had happened once before when Berlin was threatened (see the Miracle of the House of Brandenburg). No plans were made by the Western Allies to seize the city by a ground operation. The Supreme Commander [Western] Allied Expeditionary Force, General Eisenhower lost interest in the race to Berlin and saw no further need to suffer casualties by attacking a city that would be in the Soviet sphere of influence after the war, envisioning excessive friendly fire if both armies attempted to occupy the city at once. The major Western Allied contribution to the battle was the bombing of Berlin during 1945. During 1945 the United States Army Air Forces launched very large daytime raids on Berlin and for 36 nights in succession, scores of RAF Mosquitos bombed the German capital, ending on the night of 20/21 April 1945 just before the Soviets entered the city. Preparations The Soviet offensive into central Germany, what later became East Germany, had two objectives. Stalin did not believe the Western Allies would hand over territory occupied by them in the post-war Soviet zone, so he began the offensive on a broad front and moved rapidly to meet the Western Allies as far west as possible. But the overriding objective was to capture Berlin. The two goals were complementary because possession of the zone could not be won quickly unless Berlin were taken. Another consideration was that Berlin itself held useful post-war strategic assets, including Adolf Hitler and the German nuclear weapons program. On 6 March, Hitler appointed Lieutenant General Helmuth Reymann commander of the Berlin Defence Area, replacing Lieutenant General Bruno Ritter von Hauenschild. March 1945: Photo of 16-year-old Willi H√ºbner being awarded the Iron Cross II Class medal for his defense of Lauban On 20 March, General Gotthard Heinrici was appointed Commander-in-Chief of Army Group Vistula replacing Himmler. Heinrici was one of the best defensive tacticians in the German army, and he immediately started to lay defensive plans. Heinrici correctly assessed that the main Soviet thrust would be made over the Oder River and along the main east-west Autobahn. He decided not to try to defend the banks of the Oder with anything more than a light skirmishing screen. Instead, Heinrici arranged for engineers to fortify the Seelow Heights, which overlooked the Oder River at the point where the Autobahn crossed them. This was some distance west of the Oder and east of Berlin. Heinrici thinned out the line in other areas to increase the manpower available to defend the heights. German engineers turned the Oder's flood plain, already saturated by the spring thaw, into a swamp by releasing the water from a reservoir upstream. Behind the plain on the plateau, the engineers built three belts of defensive emplacements reaching back towards the outskirts of Berlin (the lines nearer to Berlin were called the Wotan position). These lines consisted of anti-tank ditches, anti-tank gun emplacements, and an extensive network of trenches and bunkers. On 9 April, after a long resistance, K√∂nigsberg in East Prussia fell to the Red Army. This freed up Marshal Rokossovsky's 2nd Belorussian Front to move west to the east bank of the Oder river. Marshal Georgy Zhukov concentrated his 1st Belorussian Front, which had been deployed along the Oder river from Frankfurt (Oder) in the south to the Baltic, into an area in front of the Seelow Heights. The 2nd Belorussian Front moved into the positions being vacated by the 1st Belorussian Front north of the Seelow Heights. While this redeployment was in progress, gaps were left in the lines; and the remnants of General Dietrich von Saucken's German II Army, which had been bottled up in a pocket near Danzig, managed to escape into the Vistula delta. To the south, Marshal Konev shifted the main weight of the 1st Ukrainian Front out of Upper Silesia and north-west to the Neisse River. The three Soviet fronts had altogether 2.5 million men (including 78,556 soldiers of the 1st Polish Army), 6,250 tanks, 7,500 aircraft, 41,600 artillery pieces and mortars, 3,255 truck-mounted Katyusha rocket launchers (nicknamed 'Stalin's Pipe Organs'), and 95,383 motor vehicles, many manufactured in the US.

The Battle of the Seelow Heights, fought over four days from 16 until 19 April, was one of the last pitched battles of World War II: almost one million Red Army soldiers and more than 20,000 tanks and artillery pieces were deployed to break through the \\"Gates to Berlin\\", which were defended by about 100,000 German soldiers and 1,200 tanks and guns. The Soviet forces led by Zhukov broke through the defensive positions, having suffered about 30,000 dead, while 12,000 German personnel were killed. During 19 April, the fourth day, the 1st Belorussian Front broke through the final line of the Seelow Heights; and nothing but broken German formations lay between them and Berlin. The 1st Ukrainian Front, having captured Forst the day before, was fanning out into open country. One powerful thrust by Gordov's 3rd Guards Army and Rybalko's 3rd and Lelyushenko's 4th Guards Tank Armies were heading north-east towards Berlin while other armies headed west towards a section of the United States Army's front line south-west of Berlin on the Elbe. With these advances, the Soviet forces drove a wedge between Army Group Vistula in the north and Army Group Centre in the south. By the end of the day, the German eastern front line north of Frankfurt around Seelow and to the south around Forst had ceased to exist. These breakthroughs allowed the two Soviet Fronts to envelop the German 9th Army in a large pocket west of Frankfurt. Attempts by the 9th Army to break out to the west resulted in the Battle of Halbe. The cost to the Soviet forces had been very high, with over 2,807 tanks lost between 1 and 19 April, including at least 727 at the Seelow Heights. In the meantime, RAF Mosquitos were conducting large tactical air raids against German positions inside Berlin on the nights of 15 April (105 bombers), 17 April (61 bombers), 18 April (57 bombers), 19 April (79 bombers), and 20 April (78 bombers). Encirclement of Berlin On 20 April 1945, Hitler's 56th birthday, Soviet artillery of the 1st Belorussian Front began shelling Berlin and did not stop until the city surrendered. The weight of ordnance delivered by Soviet artillery during the battle was greater than the total tonnage dropped by Western Allied bombers on the city. While the 1st Belorussian Front advanced towards the east and north-east of the city, the 1st Ukrainian Front pushed through the last formations of the northern wing of Army Group Centre and passed north of Juterbog, well over halfway to the American front line on the river Elbe at Magdeburg. To the north between Stettin and Schwedt, the 2nd Belorussian Front attacked the northern flank of Army Group Vistula, held by Hasso von Manteuffel's III Panzer Army. The next day, Bogdanov's 2nd Guards Tank Army advanced nearly north of Berlin and then attacked south-west of Werneuchen. The Soviet plan was to encircle Berlin first and then envelop the IX Army. April 1945: a member of the Volkssturm, the German home defence militia, armed with a Panzerschreck, outside Berlin The command of the German V Corps, trapped with the IX Army north of Forst, passed from the IV Panzer Army to the IX Army. The corps was still holding on to the Berlin-Cottbus highway front line. Field Marshal Ferdinand Sch√∂rner's Army Group Centre launched a counter-offensive aimed at breaking through to Berlin from the south and making a successful initial incursion (the Battle of Bautzen) in the 1st Ukrainian Front region, engaging the 2nd Polish Army and elements of the Red Army's 52nd Army and 5th Guards Army. When the old southern flank of the IV Panzer Army had some local successes counter-attacking north against the 1st Ukrainian Front, Hitler gave orders that showed his grasp of military reality was completely gone. He ordered the IX Army to hold Cottbus and set up a front facing west. Then they were to attack the Soviet columns advancing north. This would supposedly allow them to form a northern pincer that would meet the IV Panzer Army coming from the south and envelop the 1st Ukrainian Front before destroying it. They were to anticipate a southward attack by the III Panzer Army and be ready to be the southern arm of a pincer attack that would envelop 1st Belorussian Front, which would be destroyed by SS-General Felix Steiner's Army Detachment advancing from north of Berlin. Later in the day, when Steiner explained that he did not have the divisions to do this, Heinrici made it clear to Hitler's staff that unless the IX Army retreated immediately, it would be enveloped by the Soviets. He stressed that it was already too late for it to move north-west to Berlin and would have to retreat west. Heinrici went on to say that if Hitler did not allow it to move west, he would ask to be relieved of his command. On 22 April 1945, at his afternoon situation conference, Hitler fell into a tearful rage (famously dramatized in the 2004 German film Downfall) when he realised that his plans, prepared the previous day, could not be achieved. He declared that the war was lost, blaming the generals for the defeat and that he would remain in Berlin until the end and then kill himself. In an attempt to coax Hitler out of his rage, General Alfred Jodl speculated that General Walther Wenck's XII Army, which was facing the Americans, could move to Berlin because the Americans, already on the Elbe River, were unlikely to move further east. This assumption was based on his viewing of the captured Eclipse documents, which organised the partition of Germany among the Allies. Hitler immediately grasped the idea, and within hours Wenck was ordered to disengage from the Americans and move the XII Army north-east to support Berlin. It was then realised that if the IX Army moved west, it could link up with the XII Army. In the evening Heinrici was given permission to make the link-up. Elsewhere, the 2nd Belorussian Front had established a bridgehead deep on the west bank of the Oder and was heavily engaged with the III Panzer Army. The IX Army had lost Cottbus and was being pressed from the east. A Soviet tank spearhead was on the Havel River to the east of Berlin, and another had at one point penetrated the inner defensive ring of Berlin. The capital was now within range of field artillery. A Soviet war correspondent, in the style of World War II Soviet journalism, gave the following account of an important event which took place on 22 April 1945 at 08:30 local time: On 23 April 1945, the Soviet 1st Belorussian Front and 1st Ukrainian Front continued to tighten the encirclement, severing the last link between the German IX Army and the city. Elements of the 1st Ukrainian Front continued to move westward and started to engage the German XII Army moving towards Berlin. On this same day, Hitler appointed General Helmuth Weidling as the commander of the Berlin Defence Area, replacing Lieutenant General Reymann. states the appointment was on 23 April 1945; states \\"officially\\" it was the next morning of 24 April 1945; gives 26 April for Weidling's appointment. Meanwhile, by 24 April 1945 elements of 1st Belorussian Front and 1st Ukrainian Front had completed the encirclement of the city. Within the next day, 25 April 1945, the Soviet investment of Berlin was consolidated, with leading Soviet units probing and penetrating the S-Bahn defensive ring. By the end of the day, it was clear that the German defence of the city could not do anything but temporarily delay the capture of the city by the Soviets, since the decisive stages of the battle had already been fought and lost by the Germans outside the city. By that time, Sch√∂rner's offensive, initially successful, had mostly been thwarted, although he did manage to inflict significant casualties on the opposing Polish and Soviet units, slowing down their progress. Battle in Berlin The forces available to General Weidling for the city's defence included roughly 45,000 soldiers in several severely depleted German Army and Waffen-SS divisions. These divisions were supplemented by the police force, boys in the compulsory Hitler Youth, and the Volkssturm. Many of the 40,000 elderly men of the Volkssturm had been in the army as young men and some were veterans of World War I. Hitler appointed SS Brigadef√ºhrer Wilhelm Mohnke the Battle Commander for the central government district that included the Reich Chancellery and F√ºhrerbunker. He had over 2,000 men under his command. Weidling organised the defences into eight sectors designated 'A' through to 'H' each one commanded by a colonel or a general, but most had no combat experience. To the west of the city was the 20th Infantry Division. To the north of the city was the 9th Parachute Division. To the north-east of the city was the Panzer Division M√ºncheberg. To the south-east of the city and to the east of Tempelhof Airport was the 11th SS Panzergrenadier Division Nordland. The reserve, 18th Panzergrenadier Division, was in Berlin's central district. On 23 April, Berzarin's 5th Shock Army and Katukov's 1st Guards Tank Army assaulted Berlin from the south-east and, after overcoming a counter-attack by the German LVI Panzer Corps, reached the Berlin S-Bahn ring railway on the north side of the Teltow Canal by the evening of 24 April. During the same period, of all the German forces ordered to reinforce the inner defences of the city by Hitler, only a small contingent of French SS volunteers under the command of SS Brigadef√ºhrer Gustav Krukenberg arrived in Berlin. During 25 April, Krukenberg was appointed as the commander of Defence Sector C, the sector under the most pressure from the Soviet assault on the city. On 26 April, Chuikov's 8th Guards Army and the 1st Guards Tank Army fought their way through the southern suburbs and attacked Tempelhof Airport, just inside the S-Bahn defensive ring, where they met stiff resistance from the M√ºncheberg Division. But by 27 April, the two understrength divisions (M√ºncheberg and Nordland) that were defending the south-east, now facing five Soviet armies‚Äîfrom east to west, the 5th Shock Army, the 8th Guards Army, the 1st Guards Tank Army and Rybalko's 3rd Guards Tank Army (part of the 1st Ukrainian Front)‚Äîwere forced back towards the centre, taking up new defensive positions around Hermannplatz. Krukenberg informed General Hans Krebs, Chief of the General Staff of (OKH) that within 24 hours the Nordland would have to fall back to the centre sector Z (for Zentrum)., states the centre sector was known as Z for Zentrum; , and , quoting General Mohnke directly refers to the smaller centre government quarter/district in this area and under his command as Z-Zitadelle. The Soviet advance to the city centre was along these main axes: from the south-east, along the Frankfurter Allee (ending and stopped at the Alexanderplatz); from the south along Sonnenallee ending north of the Belle-Alliance-Platz, from the south ending near the Potsdamer Platz and from the north ending near the Reichstag. The Reichstag, the Moltke bridge, Alexanderplatz, and the Havel bridges at Spandau saw the heaviest fighting, with house-to-house and hand-to- hand combat. The foreign contingents of the SS fought particularly hard, because they were ideologically motivated and they believed that they would not live if captured. =Battle for the Reichstag= Battle for the Reichstag In the early hours of 29 April the Soviet 3rd Shock Army crossed the Moltke bridge and started to fan out into the surrounding streets and buildings. The initial assaults on buildings, including the Ministry of the Interior, were hampered by the lack of supporting artillery. It was not until the damaged bridges were repaired that artillery could be moved up in support. At 04:00 hours, in the F√ºhrerbunker, Hitler signed his last will and testament and, shortly afterwards, married Eva Braun. At dawn the Soviets pressed on with their assault in the south-east. After very heavy fighting they managed to capture Gestapo headquarters on Prinz-Albrechtstrasse, but a Waffen-SS counter-attack forced the Soviets to withdraw from the building. To the south- west the 8th Guards Army attacked north across the Landwehr canal into the Tiergarten. By the next day, 30 April, the Soviets had solved their bridging problems and with artillery support at 06:00 they launched an attack on the Reichstag, but because of German entrenchments and support from 12.8 cm guns away on the roof of the Zoo flak tower, close by Berlin Zoo, it was not until that evening that the Soviets were able to enter the building. The Reichstag had not been in use since it had burned in February 1933 and its interior resembled a rubble heap more than a government building. The German troops inside made excellent use of this and were heavily entrenched. Fierce room-to- room fighting ensued. At that point there was still a large contingent of German soldiers in the basement who launched counter-attacks against the Red Army. On 2 May 1945 the Red Army controlled the building entirely. The famous photo of the two soldiers planting the flag on the roof of the building is a re-enactment photo taken the day after the building was taken. To the Soviets the event as represented by the photo became symbolic of their victory demonstrating that the Battle of Berlin, as well as the Eastern Front hostilities as a whole, ended with the total Soviet victory. As the 756th Regiment's commander Zinchenko had stated in his order to Battalion Commander Neustroev \\"... the Supreme High Command ... and the entire Soviet People order you to erect the victory banner on the roof above Berlin\\". =Battle for the centre= Front lines 1 May (pink = Allied occupied territory; red = area of fighting) During the early hours of 30 April, Weidling informed Hitler in person that the defenders would probably exhaust their ammunition during the night. Hitler granted him permission to attempt a breakout through the encircling Red Army lines. That afternoon, Hitler and Braun committed suicide and their bodies were cremated not far from the bunker. In accordance with Hitler's last will and testament, Admiral Karl D√∂nitz became the \\"President of the Reich\\" (Reichspr√§sident) and Joseph Goebbels became the new Chancellor of the Reich (Reichskanzler). As the perimeter shrank and the surviving defenders fell back, they became concentrated into a small area in the city centre. By now there were about 10,000 German soldiers in the city centre, which was being assaulted from all sides. One of the other main thrusts was along Wilhelmstrasse on which the Air Ministry, built of reinforced concrete, was pounded by large concentrations of Soviet artillery. The remaining German Tiger tanks of the Hermann von Salza battalion took up positions in the east of the Tiergarten to defend the centre against Kuznetsov's 3rd Shock Army (which although heavily engaged around the Reichstag was also flanking the area by advancing through the northern Tiergarten) and the 8th Guards Army advancing through the south of the Tiergarten. These Soviet forces had effectively cut the sausage-shaped area held by the Germans in half and made any escape attempt to the west for German troops in the centre much more difficult. During the early hours of 1 May, Krebs talked to General Chuikov, commander of the Soviet 8th Guards Army,, states 3 am, and , 4 am, for Krebs' meeting with Chuikov informing him of Hitler's death and a willingness to negotiate a citywide surrender. They could not agree on terms because of Soviet insistence on unconditional surrender and Krebs' claim that he lacked authorisation to agree to that. Goebbels was against surrender. In the afternoon, Goebbels and his wife killed their children and then themselves. Goebbels's death removed the last impediment which prevented Weidling from accepting the terms of unconditional surrender of his garrison, but he chose to delay the surrender until the next morning to allow the planned breakout to take place under the cover of darkness. =Breakout and surrender= On the night of 1/2 May, most of the remnants of the Berlin garrison attempted to break out of the city centre in three different directions. Only those that went west through the Tiergarten and crossed the Charlottenbr√ºcke (a bridge over the Havel) into Spandau succeeded in breaching Soviet lines. Only a handful of those who survived the initial breakout made it to the lines of the Western Allies‚Äîmost were either killed or captured by the Red Army's outer encirclement forces west of the city. Early in the morning of 2 May, the Soviets captured the Reich Chancellery. General Weidling surrendered with his staff at 06:00 hours. He was taken to see General Vasily Chuikov at 08:23, where Weidling ordered the city's defenders to surrender to the Soviets. The 350-strong garrison of the Zoo flak tower left the building. There was sporadic fighting in a few isolated buildings where some SS troops still refused to surrender, but the Soviets reduced such buildings to rubble. Battle outside Berlin At some point on 28 April or 29 April, General Heinrici, Commander-in-Chief of Army Group Vistula, was relieved of his command after disobeying Hitler's direct orders to hold Berlin at all costs and never order a retreat, and was replaced by General Kurt Student. General Kurt von Tippelskirch was named as Heinrici's interim replacement until Student could arrive and assume control. There remains some confusion as to who was in command, as some references say that Student was captured by the British and never arrived. Regardless of whether von Tippelskirch or Student was in command of Army Group Vistula, the rapidly deteriorating situation that the Germans faced meant that Army Group Vistula's coordination of the armies under its nominal command during the last few days of the war was of little significance. On the evening of 29 April, Krebs contacted General Alfred Jodl (Supreme Army Command) by radio: In the early morning of 30 April, Jodl replied to Krebs: =North= While the 1st Belorussian Front and the 1st Ukrainian Front encircled Berlin, and started the battle for the city itself, Rokossovsky's 2nd Belorussian Front started his offensive to the north of Berlin. On 20 April between Stettin and Schwedt, Rokossovsky's 2nd Belorussian Front attacked the northern flank of Army Group Vistula, held by the III Panzer Army. By 22 April, the 2nd Belorussian Front had established a bridgehead on the east bank of the Oder that was over deep and was heavily engaged with the III Panzer Army. On 25 April, the 2nd Belorussian Front broke through III Panzer Army's line around the bridgehead south of Stettin, crossed the Randowbruch Swamp, and were now free to move west towards Montgomery's British 21st Army Group and north towards the Baltic port of Stralsund. The German III Panzer Army and the German XXI Army situated to the north of Berlin retreated westwards under relentless pressure from Rokossovsky's 2nd Belorussian Front, and was eventually pushed into a pocket wide that stretched from the Elbe to the coast. To their west was the British 21st Army Group (which on 1 May broke out of its Elbe bridgehead and had raced to the coast capturing Wismar and L√ºbeck), to their east Rokossovsky's 2nd Belorussian Front and to the south was the United States Ninth Army which had penetrated as far east as Ludwigslust and Schwerin. =South= 2nd Lt. William Robertson, US Army and Lt. Alexander Sylvashko, Red Army, shown in front of sign East Meets West symbolizing the historic meeting of the Soviet and American Armies, near Torgau, Germany. The successes of the 1st Ukrainian Front during the first nine days of the battle meant that by 25 April, they were occupying large swathes of the area south and south-west of Berlin. Their spearheads had met elements of the 1st Belorussian Front west of Berlin, completing the investment of the city. Meanwhile, the 58th Guards Rifle Division of the 5th Guards Army in 1st Ukrainian Front made contact with the 69th Infantry Division (United States) of the United States First Army near Torgau, on the Elbe River. These manoeuvres had broken the German forces south of Berlin into three parts. The German IX Army was surrounded in the Halbe pocket. Wenck's XII Army, obeying Hitler's command of 22 April, was attempting to force its way into Berlin from the south-west but met stiff resistance from 1st Ukrainian Front around Potsdam. Sch√∂rner's Army Group Centre was forced to withdraw from the Battle of Berlin, along its lines of communications towards Czechoslovakia. Between 24 April and 1 May, the IX Army fought a desperate action to break out of the pocket in an attempt to link up with the XII Army. Hitler assumed that after a successful breakout from the pocket, the IX Army could combine forces with the XII Army and would be able to relieve Berlin. There is no evidence to suggest that Generals Heinrici, Busse, or Wenck thought that this was even remotely strategically feasible, but Hitler's agreement to allow the IX Army to break through Soviet lines allowed many German soldiers to escape to the west and surrender to the United States Army. At dawn on 28 April, the youth divisions Clausewitz, Scharnhorst, and Theodor K√∂rner attacked from the south-west toward the direction of Berlin. They were part of Wenck's XX Corps and were made up of men from the officer training schools, making them some of the best units the Germans had in reserve. They covered a distance of about , before being halted at the tip of Lake Schwielow, south-west of Potsdam and still from Berlin. During the night, General Wenck reported to the German Supreme Army Command in Fuerstenberg that his XII Army had been forced back along the entire front. According to Wenck, no attack on Berlin was possible. At that point, support from the IX Army could no longer be expected. In the meantime, about 25,000 German soldiers of the IX Army, along with several thousand civilians, succeeded in reaching the lines of the XII Army after breaking out of the Halbe pocket. The casualties on both sides were very high. Nearly 30,000 Germans were buried after the battle in the cemetery at Halbe. About 20,000 soldiers of the Red Army also died trying to stop the breakout; most are buried at a cemetery next to the Baruth-Zossen road. These are the known dead, but the remains of more who died in the battle are found every year, so the total of those who died will never be known. Nobody knows how many civilians died but it could have been as high as 10,000. Having failed to break through to Berlin, Wenck's XII Army made a fighting retreat back towards the Elbe and American lines after providing the IX Army survivors with surplus transport. By 6 May many German Army units and individuals had crossed the Elbe and surrendered to the US Ninth Army. Meanwhile, the XII Army's bridgehead, with its headquarters in the park of Sch√∂nhausen, came under heavy Soviet artillery bombardment and was compressed into an area eight by two kilometres (five by one and a quarter miles). Raising a Flag over the Reichstag, a photograph taken during the Battle of Berlin on 2 May 1945 =Surrender= On the night of 2‚Äì3 May, General von Manteuffel, commander of the III Panzer Army along with General von Tippelskirch, commander of the XXI Army, surrendered to the US Army. Von Saucken's II Army, that had been fighting north-east of Berlin in the Vistula Delta, surrendered to the Soviets on 9 May. On the morning of 7 May, the perimeter of the XII Army's bridgehead began to collapse. Wenck crossed the Elbe under small arms fire that afternoon and surrendered to the American Ninth Army. Aftermath A devastated street in the city centre just off the Unter den Linden, 3 July 1945 According to Grigoriy Krivosheev's work based on declassified archival data, Soviet forces sustained 81,116 dead for the entire operation, which included the battles of Seelow Heights and the Halbe; another 280,251 were reported wounded or sick during the operational period. The operation also cost the Soviets about 1,997 tanks and SPGs. Krivosheev noted: \\"All losses of arms and equipment are counted as irrecoverable losses, i.e. beyond economic repair or no longer serviceable\\". Soviet estimates based on kill claims placed German losses at 458,080 killed and 479,298 captured, but German research puts the number of dead at approximately 92,000 ‚Äì 100,000. The number of civilian casualties is unknown, but 125,000 are estimated to have perished during the entire operation. German scout car stands beside them, 3 July 1945. In those areas that the Red Army had captured and before the fighting in the centre of the city had stopped, the Soviet authorities took measures to start restoring essential services. Almost all transport in and out of the city had been rendered inoperative, and bombed-out sewers had contaminated the city's water supplies. The Soviet authorities appointed local Germans to head each city block, and organised the cleaning-up. The Red Army made a major effort to feed the residents of the city. Most Germans, both soldiers and civilians, were grateful to receive food issued at Red Army soup kitchens, which began on Colonel-General Berzarin's orders. After the capitulation the Soviets went house to house, arresting and imprisoning anyone in a uniform including firemen and railwaymen. During and immediately following the assault, in many areas of the city, vengeful Soviet troops (often rear echelon units) engaged in mass rape, pillage and murder. Oleg Budnitskii, historian at the Higher School of Economics in Moscow, told a BBC Radio programme that Red Army soldiers were astounded when they reached Germany. \\"For the first time in their lives, eight million Soviet people came abroad, the Soviet Union was a closed country. All they knew about foreign countries was there was unemployment, starvation and exploitation. And when they came to Europe they saw something very different from Stalinist Russia ... especially Germany. They were really furious, they could not understand why being so rich, Germans came to Russia\\". Despite Soviet efforts to supply food and rebuild the city, starvation remained a problem. In June 1945, one month after the surrender, the average Berliner was getting only 64 percent of a daily ration of . Across the city over a million people were without homes. Commemoration Victory Banner raised on the roof of the Reichstag on 1 May 1945Polish flag raised on the top of Berlin Victory Column on 2 May 1945 All told, 402 Red Army personnel were bestowed the USSR's highest degree of distinction, the title Hero of the Soviet Union (HSU), for their valor in Berlin's immediate suburbs and in the city itself. Marshals of the Soviet Union Zhukov and Konev received their third and second HSU awards respectively, for their roles in the battle's outcome. Combat medic Guards Senior Sergeant Lyudmila S. Kravets, was the Battle of Berlin's only female HSU recipient for her valorous actions while serving in 1st Rifle Battalion, 63rd Guards Rifle Regiment, 23rd Guards Rifle Division (subordinate to 3rd Shock Army). Additionally, 280 Red Army enlisted personnel would earn the Soviet Order of Glory First Class and attain status as Full Cavaliers of the Order of Glory for their heroism during the Battle of Berlin. In Soviet society, Full Cavaliers of the Order of Glory were accorded the same rights and privileges as those accorded to Heroes of the Soviet Union. 1,100,000 Soviet personnel who took part in the capture of Berlin from 22 April to 2 May 1945 were awarded the Medal \\"For the Capture of Berlin\\". The design of the Victory Banner to be used for celebrations of the Soviet Victory Day was defined by a federal law of Russia on 7 May 2007. Poland's official Flag Day is held each year on 2 May, the last day of the battle in Berlin, when the Polish Army hoisted its flag on the Berlin Victory Column.

It was founded in 41 or 40 BC by Octavian, the future emperor Augustus. It was destroyed in 9 AD in the Battle of the Teutoburg Forest. The emblem of the XIXth legion is unknown but was probably the Capricorn like other legions levied by Augustus. Their first assignment was in Sicily where Sextus Pompey, son of Pompey, was leading a revolt. This revolt put Rome's grain supply in peril and it needed a harsh response. In 30 BC, veterans of the XIX legion were settled near Pisa, and after that, the rest of the legion was allocated in the Rhine frontier with base camp at Cologne. The XIX legion participated in the German campaigns of Drusus (13‚Äì9 BC) and Tiberius (8‚Äì5 BC). By the year 5 BC Germania was a Roman province and Publius Quinctilius Varus was assigned as governor. In September 9, Arminius, leader of the Cherusci and a Roman ally, set a trap. He had reported a major revolt of one of the western tribes and suggested the return of both governor and his legions to the Rhine. Varus accepted the suggestion and went with the XVII, XVIII and XIX legions. The army was trapped near Osnabr√ºck and was completely destroyed in the Battle of the Teutoburg Forest. Between 16 and 18, Germanicus, the leader of the Rhine armies, looked for the remains of the legions.

Belonging to the superfamily Papilionoidea, they are usually medium-sized to large butterflies. Most species have a reduced pair of forelegs and many hold their colourful wings flat when resting. They are also called brush-footed butterflies or four- footed butterflies, because they are known to stand on only four legs while the other two are curled up; in some species, these forelegs have a brush-like set of hairs, which gives this family its other common name. Many species are brightly coloured and include popular species such as the emperors, monarch butterfly, admirals, tortoiseshells, and fritillaries. However, the under wings are, in contrast, often dull and in some species look remarkably like dead leaves, or are much paler, producing a cryptic effect that helps the butterflies blend into their surroundings.  Nomenclature  RafinesqueRafinesque, C.S. (1815). Analyse de la Nature, ou Tableau de l'Univers et des Corps Organis√©s. Jean Barravecceia: Palermo. 224 pages, p 127. introduced the name Nymphalia as a subfamily name in diurnal Lepidoptera. Rafinesque did not include Nymphalis among the listed genera, but Nymphalis was unequivocally implied in the formation of the name (Code Article 11.7.1.1). The attribution of the Nymphalidae to Rafinesque has now been widely adopted.Vane-Wright & de Jong, 2003: 167; Pelham, 2008; Wahlberg, 2010  Classification  For terms see External morphology of Lepidoptera. In the adult butterflies, the first pair of legs is small or reduced, giving the family the other names of four-footed or brush-footed butterflies. The caterpillars are hairy or spiky with projections on the head, and the chrysalids have shiny spots. The forewings have the submedial vein (vein 1) unbranched and in one subfamily forked near the base; the medial vein has three branches, veins 2, 3, and 4; veins 5 and 6 arise from the points of junction of the discocellulars; the subcostal vein and its continuation beyond the apex of cell, vein 7, has never more than four branches, veins 8‚Äì11; 8 and 9 always arise from vein 7, 10, and 11 sometimes from vein 7 but more often free, i.e., given off by the subcostal vein before apex of the cell. The hindwings have internal (1a) and precostal veins. The cell in both wings is closed or open, often closed in the fore, open in the hindwing. The dorsal margin of the hindwing is channelled to receive the abdomen in many of the forms. Andromeda satyr (Cithaerias andromeda). The antennae always have two grooves on the underside; the club is variable in shape. Throughout the family, the front pair of legs in the male, and with three exceptions (Libythea, Pseudergolis, and Calinaga) in the female also, is reduced in size and functionally impotent; in some, the atrophy of the forelegs is considerable, e.g., the Danainae and Satyrinae. In many of the forms of these subfamilies, the forelegs are kept pressed against the underside of the thorax, and are in the male often very inconspicuous. = Systematics and phylogeny = The phylogeny of the Nymphalidae is complex. Several taxa are of unclear position, reflecting the fact that some subfamilies were formerly well-recognized as distinct families due to insufficient study. The five main clades within the family are: The libytheine clade (basal) * Libytheinae (snout butterflies, earlier treated as the distinct family Libytheidae) The danaine clade (basal) * Danainae (milkweed butterflies, earlier treated as the distinct family Danaidae) : Host plant families include Apocynaceae, Asclepiadoideae (subfamily of Apocynaceae), and Moraceae. :* Ithomiini (about 300 Neotropical species, sometimes considered a subfamily Ithomiinae) :: Most species have long wings, and some have transparent wings. Host plants are in the families Apocynaceae, Gesneriaceae, and Solanaceae. :* Tellervini (about 6‚Äì10 species in Australasia, sometimes considered a subfamily Tellervinae) :: Caterpillars resemble those of the Danainae and feed on Apocynaceae. The satyrine clade * Calinaginae (about six species, restricted to the Himalayas) : Mimics of the Danainae, they are restricted to host plants in the family Moraceae. * Charaxinae : Tropical canopy butterflies, the caterpillars often have head spines or projections. Mostly edible species, have some Batesian mimics. Host plants are in the families Annonaceae, Celastraceae, Convolvulaceae, Euphorbiaceae, Fabaceae, Flacourtiaceae, Lauraceae, Myrtaceae, Piperaceae, Poaceae, Rhamnaceae, Rutaceae, Santalaceae, and Sapindaceae. * Morphinae (including Amathusiini, sometimes considered a subfamily Amathusiinae) : Include the spectacular neotropical Morpho, its food plants include the Arecaceae, Bignoniaceae, Fabaceae, Menispermaceae, Poaceae, and Sapindaceae. :* Brassolini (owls, neotropical with 70‚Äì80 species, mostly crepuscular, sometimes considered a subfamily Brassolinae) :: Host plants in the families Arecaceae, Bromeliaceae, Heliconiaceae, Musaceae, and Poaceae. * Satyrinae (satyrs and browns, earlier treated as distinct family Satyridae) : Host plants are in the families Arecaceae, Araceae, Cyperaceae, Heliconiaceae, Poaceae, and Selaginellaceae. The heliconiine clade (sister group of the nymphaline clade, excludes former tribes Biblidini and Cyrestini, and tribes Pseudergolini and Coeini) * Heliconiinae (earlier treated as distinct family Heliconiidae) : Colourful tropical butterflies, they are noted for M√ºllerian mimicry. All species use host plants in the family Passifloraceae. :* Acraeini (mostly African, but some species in Asia, sometimes considered a family Acraeinae) :: Host plants are in the families Asteraceae, Passifloraceae, Sterculiaceae, Tiliaceae, and Urticaceae. * Limenitidinae The nymphaline clade (sister group of the heliconiine clade, also includes tribes Coeini and Pseudergolini) * Apaturinae (mostly tropical) : Host plants are in the family Ulmaceae. Caterpillars are smooth with bifid tails and horns on the head. * Biblidinae (formerly in Limenitidinae) * Cyrestinae (formerly in Limenitidinae) * Nymphalinae (a large subfamily that sometimes includes the Limenitidinae and Biblidinae) : Some species migrate. Caterpillars are sometimes covered in spines. Host plants include Acanthaceae, Caprifoliaceae, Convolvulaceae, Euphorbiaceae, Fagaceae, Flacourtiaceae, Lamiaceae, Loranthaceae, Moraceae, Plantaginaceae, Poaceae, Rubiaceae, Rutaceae, Salicaceae, Sapindaceae, Scrophulariaceae, Urticaceae, and Verbenaceae. = Example species from this family = * Archdukes, genus Lexias * California tortoiseshell, Nymphalis californica * Comma, Polygonia c-album * Common buckeye, Junonia coenia * Common snout butterfly, Libytheana carinenta * Cracker butterflies, genus Hamadryas * Crimson patch, Chlosyne janais * Edith's checkerspot, Euphydryas editha * Grayling (butterfly), Hipparchia semele * Hackberry emperor, Asterocampa celtis * Lorquin's admiral, Limenitis lorquini * Marsh fritillary, Euphydryas aurinia * Meadow brown, Maniola jurtina * Mourning cloak, Nymphalis antiopa * Monarch butterfly, Danaus plexippus * Blue morpho, Morpho menelaus * Painted lady, Vanessa cardui * Peacock, Aglais io * Plain tiger, Danaus chrysippus * Question mark, Polygonia interrogationis * Red admiral, Vanessa atalanta * Small heath, Coenonympha pamphilus * Small tortoiseshell, Nymphalis urticae * Gatekeeper, Pyronia tithonus * Small pearl-bordered fritillary, \\"Boloria Selene\\" * Andromeda satyr, Cithaerias andromeda Morphology The trait for which these butterflies are most known is the use of only four legs; the reason their forelegs have become vestigial is not yet completely clear. Some suggest the forelegs are used to amplify the sense of smell, because some species possess a brush-like set of soft hair called setae, which has led researchers to believe the forelegs are used to improve signaling and communication between the species, while standing in the other four. This ability proves useful in terms of reproduction and the overall health of the species, and it is the leading theory so far.

Pythagoreanism originated in the 6th century BC, based on the teachings and beliefs held by Pythagoras and his followers, the Pythagoreans. Pythagoras established the first Pythagorean community in Crotone, Italy. Early Pythagorean communities spread throughout Magna Graecia. Pythagoras‚Äô death and disputes about his teachings led to the development of two philosophical traditions within Pythagoreanism. The akousmatikoi were superseded in the 4th century BC as a significant mendicant school of philosophy by the Cynics. The mathƒìmatikoi philosophers were absorbed into the Platonic school in the 4th century BC. Following the political instability in the Magna Graecia, some Pythagorean philosophers fled to mainland Greece while others regrouped in Rhegium. By about 400 BC the majority of Pythagorean philosophers had left Italy. Pythagorean ideas exercised a marked influence on Plato and through him, on all of Western philosophy. Many of the surviving sources on Pythagoras originate with Aristotle and the philosophers of the Peripatetic school. As a philosophic tradition, Pythagoreanism was revived in the 1st century BC, giving rise to Neopythagoreanism. The worship of Pythagoras continued in Italy and as a religious community Pythagoreans appear to have survived as part of, or deeply influenced, the Bacchic cults and Orphism. History Plimpton 322 tablet records Pythagorean triples from Babylonian times. Animation demonstrating the simplest Pythagorean triple, 32 + 42 = 52. Bust of Pythagoras, Musei Capitolini, Rome. Pythagoras was already in ancient times well known for the mathematical achievement of the Pythagorean theorem. Pythagoras had been credited with discovering that in a right-angled triangle the square of the hypotenuse is equal to the sum of the squares of the other two sides. In ancient times Pythagoras was also noted for his discovery that music had mathematical foundations. Antique sources that credit Pythagoras as the philosopher who first discovered music intervals also credit him as the inventor of the monochord, a straight rod on which a string and a movable bridge could be used to demonstrate the relationship of musical intervals. Much of the surviving sources on Pythagoras originate with Aristotle and the philosophers of the Peripatetic school, which founded histographical academic traditions such as biography, doxography and the history of science. The surviving 5th century BC sources on Pythagoras and early Pythagoreanism are void of supernatural elements. While surviving 4th century BC sources on Pythagoreas' teachings introduced legend and fable. Philosophers who discussed Pythagoreanism, such as Anaximander, Andron of Ephesus, Heraclides and Neanthes had access to historical written sources as well as the oral tradition about Pythagoreanism, which by the 4th century BC was in decline. Neopythagorean philosophers, who authored many of the surviving sources on Pythagoreanism, continued the tradition of legend and fantasy. The earliest surviving ancient source on Pythagoras and his followers is a satire by Xenophanes, on the Pythagorean beliefs on the transmigration of souls. Xenophanes wrote of Pythagoras that: In a surviving fragment from Heraclitus, Pythagoras and his followers are described as follows: Two other surviving fragments of ancient sources on Pythagoras are by Ion of Chios and Empedocles. Both were born in the 490s, after Pythagoras' death. By that time he was known as a sage and his fame had spread throughout Greece. According to Ion, Pythagoras was: Empedocles described Pythagoras as \\"a man of surpassing knowledge, master especially of all kinds of wise works, who had acquired the upmost wealth of understanding.\\" In the 4th century BC the Sophist Alcidamas wrote that Pythagoras was widely honored by Italians. Today scholars typically distinguish two periods of Pythagoreanism: early-Pythagoreanism, from the 6th till the 5th century BC, and late-Pythagoreanism, from the 4th till the 3rd century BC. The Spartan colony of Taranto in Italy became the home for many practitioners of Pythagoreanism and later for Neopythagorean philosophers. Pythagoras had also lived in Crotone and Metaponto, both were Achaean colonies. Early-Pythagorean sects lived in Croton and throughout Magna Graecia. They espoused to a rigorous life of the intellect and strict rules on diet, clothing and behavior. Their burial rites were tied to their belief in the immortality of the soul. Early-Pythagorean sects were closed societies and new Pythagoreans were chosen based on merit and discipline. Ancient sources record that early-Pythagoreans underwent a five year initiation period of listening to the teachings (akousmata) in silence. Initiates could through a test become members of the inner circle. However, Pythagoreans could also leave the community if they wished. Iamblichus listed 235 Pythagoreans by name, among them 17 women whom he described as the \\"most famous\\" women practitioners of Pythagoreanism. It was customary that family members became Pythagoreans, as Pythagoreanism developed into a philosophic traditions that entailed rules for everyday life and Pythagoreans were bound by secrets. The home of Pythagoras was known as the site of mysteries. Pythagoras had been born on the island of Samos at around 570 BC and left his homeland at around 530 BC in opposition to the policies of Polycrates. Before settling in Croton, Pythagoras had traveled throughout Egypt and Babylonia. In Croton, Pythagoras established the first Pythagorean community, described as a secret society, and attained political influence. In the early 5th century BC Croton acquired great military and economic importance. Pythagoras emphasized moderation, piety, respect for elders and of the state, and advocated a monogamous family structure. The Croton Council appointed him to official positions. Among others Pythagoras was in charge of education in the city. His influence as political reformer reputably extended to other Greek colonies in southern Italy and in Sicily. Pythagoras died shortly after an arson attack on the Pythagorean meeting place in Croton. The anti-Pythagorean attacks in c. 508 BC were headed by Cylon of Croton. Pythagoras escaped to Metapontium. After these initial attacks and the death of Pythagoras, Pythagorean communities in Croton and elsewhere continued to flourish. At around 450 BC attacks on Pythagorean communities were carried out across Magna Graecia. In Croton, a house where Pythagoreans gathered was set on fire and all but two of the Pythagorean philosophers burned alive. Pythagorean meeting places in other cities were also attacked and philosophic leaders killed. These attacks occurred in the context of widespread violence and destruction in Magna Graecia. Following the political instability in the region, some Pythagorean philosophers fled to mainland Greece while others regrouped in Rhegium. By about 400 BC the majority of Pythagorean philosophers had left Italy. Archytas remained in Italy and ancient sources record that he was visited there by young Plato in the early 4th century BC. The Pythagorean schools and societies died out from the 4th century BC. Pythagorean philosophers continued to practice, albeit no organized communities were established. According to surviving sources by the Neopythagorean philosopher Nicomachus, Philolaus was the successor of Pythagoras. According to Cicero (de Orat. III 34.139), Philolaus was teacher of Archytas. According to the Neoplatonist philosopher Iamblichus, Archytas in turn became the head of the Pythagorean school about a century after the Pythagoras' death. Philolaus, Eurytus and Xenophilus are identified by Aristoxenus as the teachers of the last generation of Pythagoreans.  Philosophic traditions  Following Pythagoras‚Äô death, disputes about his teachings led to the development of two philosophical traditions within Pythagoreanism in Italy: akousmatikoi and mathƒìmatikoi. The practitioners of mathƒìmatikoi recognized practitioners of akousmatikoi as fellow Pythagoreans, but because the mathƒìmatikoi allegedly followed the teachings of Hippasus, the akousmatikoi philosophers did not recognise them. Despite this, both groups were regarded by their contemporaries as practitioners of Pythagoreanism. The akousmatikoi were superseded in the 4th century BC as significant mendicant school of philosophy by the Cynics. Philosophers of the mathƒìmatikoi were in the 4th century BC absorbed into the Platonic school of Speusippus, Xenocrates and Polemon. As a philosophic tradition, Pythagoreanism was revived in the 1st century BC, giving rise to Neopythagoreanism. The worship of Pythagoras continued in Italy in the two intervening centuries. As a religious community Pythagoreans appear to have survived as part of, or deeply influenced, the Bacchic cults and Orphism. = The akousmatikoi = Pythagoreans celebrate sunrise, 1869 painting by Fyodor Bronnikov. The practitioners of akousmatikoi believed that humans had to act in appropriate ways. Akousmata (translated as \\"oral saying\\") preserved all sayings of Pythagoras as divine dogma. The akousmatikoi tradition resisted any reinterpretation or philosophic evolution of Pythagoras' teachings. Individuals who by their actions attained the most akousmata were regarded as wise. The akousmatikoi philosophers refused to recognize that the continuous development of mathematical and scientific research conducted by the mathƒìmatikoi practitioners was in line with Pythagoras's intention. Until the demise of Pythagoreanism in the 4th century BC, the akousmatikoi continued to engage in a pious life by practicing silence, dressing simply and avoiding meat, for the purpose of attaining a privileged afterlife. The akousmatikoi engaged deeply in questions of Pythagoras' moral teachings, concerning matters such as harmony, justice, ritual purity and moral behavior. = The mathƒìmatikoi = The Archytas curve The practitioners of ' acknowledged the religious underpinning of Pythagoreanism and engaged in mathƒìma (translated as \\"learning\\" or \\"studying\\") as part of their practice. While their scientific pursuits were largely mathematical, they also promoted other fields of scientific study in which Pythagoras had engaged during his lifetime. A sectarianism developed between the dogmatic akousmatikoi and the mathƒìmatikoi, who in their intellectual activism became regarded as increasingly progressive. This tension persisted until the 4th century BC, when the philosopher Archytas engaged in advanced mathematics as part of his devotion to Pythagoras' teachings. Today, Pythagoras is mostly remembered for his mathematical ideas, and by association with the work early Pythagoreans did in advancing mathematical concepts and theories on harmonic musical intervals, the definition of numbers, proportion and mathematical methods such as arithmetic and geometry. The mathƒìmatikoi philosophers claimed that numbers were at the heart of everything and constructed a new view of the cosmos. In the mathƒìmatikoi tradition of Pythagoreanism the Earth was removed from the center of the universe. The mathƒìmatikoi believed that the Earth, along with other celestial bodies, orbited around a central fire. This, they believed, resembled a celestial harmony. =Rituals= Pythagoreanism was a philosophic tradition as well as a religious practice. As a religious community they relied on oral teachings and worshiped the Pythian Apollo, the oracular god of Delphic Oracle. Pythagoreans preached an austere life. They believed that the soul was buried in the body, which acted as a tomb for the soul in this life. The highest reward a human could attain was for the soul to join in the life of the gods and thus escaped the cycle of reincarnation in another human body. Like the practitioners of Orphism, a religious tradition that developed in parallel to Pythagorean religious practice, Pythagoreanism believed that the soul was buried in the body as a punishment for a committed offense and that the soul could be purified. Aside from conducting their daily lives according to strict rules Pythagorean also engaged in rituals to attain purity. The 4th century Greek historian and sceptic philosopher Hecataeus of Abdera asserted that Pythagoras had been inspired by ancient Egyptian philosophy in his use of ritual regulations and his belief in reincarnation. Philosophy Early Pythagoreanism was based on research and the accumulation of knowledge from the books written by other philosophers. Pythagoras' philosophic teachings made direct reference to the philosophy of Anaximander, Anaximenes of Miletus and Pherecydes of Syros. Of the Pythagorean philosophers, Hippasus, Alcmaeon, Hippon, Archytas and Theodorus, written sources have survived. =Arithmetic and numbers= The first six triangular numbers Pythagoras in his teachings cultivated mathematics and numbers, engaging in a combination of philosophic theorizing and deductive provable methodology. Numbers were in the Greek world of Pythagoras' days natural numbers ‚Äì that is positive integers. But unlike their Greek contemporaries, the Pythagorean philosophers represented numbers graphically, not symbolically through letters. Pythagoreans used dots, also known as psiphi (pebbles), to represent numbers in triangles, squares, rectangles and pentagons. This enabled a visual comprehension of mathematics and allowed for a geometrical exploration of numerical relationships. Pythagorean philosophers investigated the relationship of numbers exhaustively. They defined perfect numbers as those that were equal to the sum of all their divisors. For example: 28 = 1 + 2 + 4 + 7 + 14. The theory of odd and even numbers was central to Pythagorean arithmetic. This distinction was for the Pythagorean philosophers direct and visual, as they arranged triangular dots so that the even and odd numbers successively alternate: 2, 4, 6, ... 3, 5, 7, ... Early-Pythagorean philosophers such as Philolaus and Archytas held the conviction that mathematics could help in addressing important philosophical problems. In Pythagoreanism numbers became related to intangible concepts. The one was related to the intellect and being, the two to thought, the number four was related to justice because 2 * 2 = 4 and equally even. A dominant symbolism was awarded to the number three, Pythagoreans believed that the whole world and all things in it are summed up in this number, because end, middle and beginning give the number of the whole. The triad had for Pythagoreans an ethical dimension, as the goodness of each person was believed to be threefold: prudence, drive and good fortune. =Geometry= The Pythagoreans engaged with geometry as a liberal philosophy which served to establish principles and allowed theorems to be explored abstractly and mentally. Pythagorean philosophers believed that there was a close relationship between numbers and geometrical forms. Early-Pythagorean philosophers proved simple geometrical theorems, including \\"the sum of the angles of a triangle equals two right angles\\". Pythagoreans also came up with three of the five regular polyhedra: the tetrahedron, the cube and the dodecahedron. The sides of a regular dodecahedron are regular pentagons, which for Pythagoreans symbolized health. They also revered the pentagram, as each diagonal divides the two others at the golden ratio. When linear geometrical figures replaced the dots, the combination of Babylonian algebra and Pythagorean arithmetic provided the basis for Greek geometric algebra. By attempting to establish a system of concrete and permanent rules, Pythagoreans helped to establish strict axiomatic procedures of solving mathematical problems. =Music= Medieval woodcut by Franchino Gaffurio, depicting Pythagoras and Philolaus conducting musical investigations. Pythagoras pioneered the mathematical and experimental study of music. He objectively measured physical quantities, such as the length of a string, and discovered quantitative mathematical relationships of music through arithmetic ratios. Pythagoras attempted to explain subjective psychological and aesthetic feelings, such as the enjoyment of musical harmony. Pythagoras and his students experimented systematically with strings of varying length and tension, with wind instruments, with brass discs of the same diameter but different thickness, and with identical vases filled with different levels of water. Early Pythagoreans established quantitative ratios between the length of a string or pipe and the pitch of notes and the frequency of string vibration. Pythagoras is credited with discovering that the most harmonious musical intervals are created by the simple numerical ratio of the first four natural numbers which derive respectively from the relations of string length: the octave (1/2), the fifth (2/3) and the fourth (3/4). The sum of those numbers 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 = 10 was for Pythagoreans the perfect number, because it contained in itself \\"the whole essential nature of numbers\\". Werner Heisenberg has called this formulation of musical arithmetic as \\"among the most powerful advances of human science\\" because it enables the measurement of sound in space. Pythagorean tuning is a system of musical tuning in which the frequency ratios of all intervals are based on the ratio 3:2.Bruce Benward and Marilyn Nadine Saker (2003). Music: In Theory and Practice, seventh edition, 2 vols. (Boston: McGraw-Hill). Vol. I: p. 56. . This ratio, also known as the \\"pure\\" perfect fifth, is chosen because it is one of the most consonant and easiest to tune by ear and because of importance attributed to the integer 3. As Novalis put it, \\"The musical proportions seem to me to be particularly correct natural proportions.\\"Kenneth Sylvan Guthrie, David R. Fideler (1987). The Pythagorean Sourcebook and Library: An Anthology of Ancient Writings which Relate to Pythagoras and Pythagorean Philosophy, p.24. Red Wheel/Weiser. . The fact that mathematics could explain the human sentimental world had a profound impact on the Pythagorean philosophy. Pythagoreanism became the quest for establishing the fundamental essences of reality. Pythagorean philosophers advanced the unshakable belief that the essence of all thing are numbers and that the universe was sustained by harmony. According to ancient sources music was central to the lives of those practicing Pythagoreanism. They used medicines for the purification (katharsis) of the body and, according to Aristoxenus, music for the purification of the soul. Pythagoreans used different types of music to arouse or calm their souls. =Harmony= For Pythagoreans harmony signified the \\"unification of a multifarious composition and the agreement of unlike spirits\\". In Pythagoreanism numeric harmony was applied in mathematical, medical, psychological, aesthetic, metaphysical and cosmological problems. For Pythagorean philosophers the basic property of numbers was expressed in the harmonious interplay of opposite pairs. Harmony assured the balance of opposite forces. Pythagoras had in his teachings named numbers and the symmetries of them as the first principle, and called these numeric symmetries harmony. This numeric harmony could be discovered in rules throughout nature. Numbers governed the properties and conditions of all beings and were regarded the causes of being in everything else. Pythagorean philosophers believed that numbers were the elements of all beings and the universe as a whole was composed of harmony and numbers. =Cosmology= According to a collection of ancient philosophical texts by Stobaeus in the 5th century AD, Philolaus believed there was a \\"Counter-Earth\\" (Antichthon) orbiting a \\"central fire\\" but not visible from Earth.Dante and the Early Astronomers by M. A. Orr, 1913 The philosopher Philolaus, one of the most prominent figures in Pythagoreanism,Philolaus, Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy. was the precursor of Copernicus in moving the earth from the center of the cosmos and making it a planet. According to Aristotle's student Eudemus of Cyprus, the first philosopher to determine quantitatively the size of the known planets and the distance between them was Anaximander, a teacher to Pythagoras, in the 6th century BC. Historic sources credit the Pythagorean philosophers with being the first to attempt a clarification of the planet sequence. The early-Pythagorean philosopher Philolaus believed that limited and unlimited things were the components of the cosmos and these had existed ever since. The center of the universe, according to Philolaus, was the number one (hƒìn), which equated to the unity of Monism. Philolaus called the number one an \\"even-odd\\" because it was able to generate both even and odd numbers. When one was added to an odd number it produced an even number, and when added to an even number it produced an odd number. Philolaus further reasoned that the fitting together of the earth and the universe corresponded to the construction of the number one out of the even and the odd. Pythagorean philosophers believed that the even was unlimited and the odd was limited. Aristotle recorded in the 4th century BC on the Pythagorean astronomical system: :It remains to speak of the earth, of its position, of the question whether it is at rest or in motion, and of its shape. As to its position, there is some difference of opinion. Most people‚Äìall, in fact, who regard the whole heaven as finite‚Äìsay it lies at the center. But the Italian philosophers known as Pythagoreans take the contrary view. At the centre, they say, is fire, and the earth is one of the stars, creating night and day by its circular motion about the center. They further construct another earth in opposition to ours to which they give the name counterearth. It is not known whether Philolaus believed Earth to be round or flat,Burch 1954: 272‚Äì273, quoted in Philolaus, Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy. but he did not believe the earth rotated, so that the Counter-Earth and the Central Fire were both not visible from Earth's surface, or at least not from the hemisphere where Greece was located. But the conclusion of Pythagorean philosophers that the universe is not geocentric was not based on empirical observation. Instead, as Aristotle noted, the Pythagorean view of the astronomical system was grounded in a fundamental reflection on the value of individual things and the hierarchical order of the universe. Pythagoreans believed in a musica universalis. They reasoned that stars must produce a sound because they were large swiftly moving bodies. Pythagoreans also determined that stars revolved at distances and speeds that were proportional to each other. They reasoned that because of this numerical proportion the revolution of the stars produced a harmonic sound. The early-Pythagorean philosopher Philolaus argued that the structure of the cosmos was determined by the musical numerical proportions of the diatonic octave, which contained the fifth and fourth harmonic intervals. =Justice= Pythagoreans equated justice with geometrical proportion, because proportion ensured that each part receives what it is due. Early- Pythagoreans believed that after the death of the body, the soul would be punished or rewarded. Humans could accomplish, through their conduct, that their soul was admitted to another world. The reincarnation in this world equated to a punishment. In Pythagoreanism life in this world is social and in the realm of society justice existed when each part of society received its due. The Pythagorean tradition of universal justice was later referenced by Plato. For Pythagorean philosophers the soul was the source of justice and through the harmony of the soul, divinity could be achieved. Injustice inverted the natural order. According to the 4th century BC philosopher Heraclides Ponticus, Pythagoras taught that \\"happiness consists in knowledge of the perfection of the numbers of the soul. A surviving fragment from the 3rd century BC by the late-Pythagorean philosopher Aesara reasoned that: =Body and soul= Pythagoreans believed that body and soul functioned together, and a healthy body required a healthy psyche. Early Pythagoreans conceived of the soul as the seat of sensation and emotion. They regarded the soul as distinct from the intellect. However, only fragments of the early Pythagorean texts have survived and it is not certain whether they believed the soul was immortal. The surviving texts of the Pythagorean philosopher Philolaus indicate that while early Pythagoreans did not believe that the soul contained all psychological faculties, the soul was life and a harmony of physical elements. As such the soul passed away when certain arrangements of these elements ceased to exist. However, the teaching most securely identified with Pythagoras is metempsychosis, or the \\"transmigration of souls\\", which holds that every soul is immortal and, upon death, enters into a new body. =Vegetarianism= faba beans, French, 1512/1514. Pythagoreans refused to eat beans. Already in antique times there was much speculation about the reason for this custom. Some Medieval authors refer to a \\"Pythagorean diet\\", entailing the abstention from eating meat, beans or fish.See for instance the popular treatise by Antonio Cocchi, Del vitto pitagorico per uso della medicina, Firenze 1743, which initiated a debate on the \\"Pythagorean diet\\". Pythagoreans believed that a vegetarian diet fostered a healthy body and enhanced the search for Arete. The purpose of vegetarianism in Pythagoreanism was not self-denial; instead, it was regarded as conductive to the best in a human being. Pythagoreans advanced a grounded theory on the treatment of animals. They believed that any being that experienced pain or suffering should not have pain inflicted on it unnecessarily. Because it was not necessary to inflict pain on animals for humans to enjoy a healthy diet, they believed that animals should not be killed for the purpose of eating them. The Pythagoreans advanced the argument that unless an animal posed a threat to a human, it was not justifiable to kill an animal and that doing so would diminish the moral status of a human. By failing to show justice to the animal, humans diminish themselves. Pythagoreans believed that human beings were animals, but with an advanced intellect and therefore humans had to purify themselves through training. Through purification humans could join the psychic force that pervaded the cosmos. Pythagoreans reasoned that the logic of this argument could not be avoided by killing an animal painlessly. The Pythagoreans also thought that animals were sentient and minimally rational. The arguments advanced by Pythagoreans convinced numerous of their philosopher contemporaries to adopt a vegetarian diet. The Pythagorean sense of kinship with non-humans positioned them as a counterculture in the dominant meat- eating culture. The philosopher Empedocles is said to have refused the customary blood sacrifice by offering a substitute sacrifice after his victory in a horse race in Olympia. Late-Pythagorean philosophers were absorbed into the Platonic school of philosophy and in the 4th century AD the head of the Platonic Academy Polemon included vegetarianism in his concept of living according to nature. In the 1st century AD Ovid identified Pythagoras as the first opponent to meat-eating. But the fuller argument Pythagoreans advanced against the maltreatment of animals did not sustain. Pythagoreans had argued that certain types of food arouse the passions and hindered spiritual ascent. Thus Porphyry would rely on the teachings of the Pythagoreans when arguing that abstinence from eating meat for the purpose of spiritual purification should be practiced only by philosophers, whose aim was to reach a divine state. Women philosophers The biographical tradition on Pythagoras holds that his mother, wife and daughters were part of his inner circle. Women were given equal opportunity to study as Pythagoreans and learned practical domestic skills in addition to philosophy.Glenn, Cheryl, Rhetoric Retold: Regendering the Tradition from Antiquity Through the Renaissance. Southern Illinois University, 1997. 30‚Äì31. Illustration from 1913 showing Pythagoras teaching a class of women. Many of the surviving texts of women Pythagorean philosophers are part of a collection, known as pseudoepigrapha Pythagorica, which was compiled by Neopythagoreans in the 1st or 2nd century. Some surviving fragments of this collection are by early-Pythagorean women philosophers, while the bulk of surviving writings are from late-Pythagorean women philosophers who wrote in the 4th and 3rd century BC. Female Pythagoreans are some of the first female philosophers from which texts have survived. Theano of Croton, the wife of Pythagoras, is considered a major figure in early-Pythagoreanism. She was noted as distinguished philosopher and in the lore that surrounds her, is said to have taken over the leadership of the school after his death. Text fragments have also survived from women philosophers of the late-Pythagorean period. These include Perictione I, Perictione II, Aesara of Lucania and Phintys of Sparta. Scholars believe that Perictione I was an Athenian and contemporary of Plato, because in On the Harmony of Woman she wrote in Ionic and used the same terms of virtues as Plato had done in his Republic: andreia, sophrosyne, dikaiosyne and sophia. In On the Harmony of Woman Perictione I outlines the condition that enable women to nurture wisdom and self-control. These virtues will, according to Perictione I, bring \\"worthwhile things\\" for a woman, her husband, her children, the household and even the city \\"if, at any rate, such a woman should govern cities and tribes\\". Her assertion that a wife should remain devoted to her husband, regardless of his behavior, has been interpreted by scholars as a pragmatic response to the legal rights of women in Athens. The woman Pythagorean philosopher Phyntis was Spartan and is believed to have been the daughter of a Spartan admiral killed in the battle of Arginusae in 406 BC. Phyntis authored the treatise Moderation of Women, in which she assigned the virtue of moderation to women, but asserted that \\"courage and justice and wisdom are common to both\\" men and women. Phyntis defended the right of women to philosophize. Influence on Plato and Aristotle  Pythagoras' teachings and Pythagoreanism influenced Plato's writings on physical cosmology, psychology, ethics and political philosophy in the 5th century BC. However, Plato adhered to the dominant Greek philosophy, and the Platonic philosophy suppressed the combination of experimental method and mathematics which was an inherent part of Pythagoreanism. The influence of Pythagoreanism extended throughout and beyond antiquity because the Pythagorean doctrine of reincarnation was recounted in Plato's Gorgias, Phaedo, and Republic, while the Pythagorean cosmology was discussed in Plato's Timaeus. The possible influence of Pythagoreanism on Plato's concept of harmony and the Platonic solids has been discussed extensively. Plato's dialogues have become an important surviving source of Pythagorean philosophic arguments. Plato referenced Philolaus in Phaedo and wrote a Platonic adaptation of Philolaus' metaphysical system of limiters and unlimiteds. Plato also quoted from one of the surviving Archytas fragments in the Republic. However, Plato's views that the primary role of mathematics was to turn the soul towards the world of forms, as expressed in Timaeus, is regarded as Platonic philosophy, rather than Pythagorean. Aristotle in the 4th century BC rejected mathematics as a tool for investigation and understanding of the world. He believed that numbers constituted simply a quantitative determinant and had no ontological value. Aristotle's discussion of Pythagorean philosophy is difficult to interpret, because he had little patience for Pythagorean philosophic arguments, and Pythagoreanism does not fit with his philosophic doctrine. In On the Heavens, Aristotle refuted the Pythagorean doctrine on the harmony of the spheres. Nevertheless, he wrote a treatise on the Pythagoreans of which only fragments survive, in which he treats Pythagoras as a wonder-working religious teacher. Neopythagoreanism The Neopythagoreans were a school and a religious community. The revival of Pythagoreanism has been attributed to Publius Nigidius Figulus, Eudorus and Arius Didymus. In the 1st century AD Moderatus of Gades and Nicomachus of Gerasa emerged as leading teachers of Neopythagoreanism. The most significant Neopythagorean teacher was Apollonius of Tyana in the 1st century AD, who was regarded as a sage and lived as ascet. The last Neopythagorean philosopher was Numenius of Apamea in the 2nd century. Neopythagoreanism remained an elite movement which in the 3rd century merged into Neoplatonism. Neopythagoreans combined Pythagorean teachings with Platonic, Peripatetic, Aristotelian and Stoic philosophic traditions. Two tendencies within Neopythagorean philosophy emerged, one that owed much to Stoic monism and another that relied on Platonic dualism. Neopythagoreans refined the idea of God and located him beyond the finite so that God could not come into contact with anything corporeal. Neopythagoreans insisted on a spiritual worship of God and that life had to be purified through abstinence. Neopythagoreans manifested a strong interest in numerology and the superstitious aspects of Pythagoreanism. They combined this with the teachings of Plato's philosophic successors. Neopythagorean philosophers engaged in the common ancient practice of ascribing their doctrines to the designated founder of their philosophy and by crediting their doctrines to Pythagoras himself, they hoped to gain authority for their views. Later influence =On early Christianity= De Sphaera of Sacrobosco. Christianity in the 1st century was influenced by a Christianized form of Platonism, which had been set out in the four books of the Corpus Areopagiticum or Corpus Dionysiacum: The Celestrial Hierarchy, The Ecclesiastical Hierarchy, On Divine Names and The Mystical Theology. Having been attributed to Pseudo-Dionysius the Areopagite, the books explained the relationship among celestrial beings, humans, God and the universe. At the heart of the explanation were numbers. According to The Celestrial Hierarchy, the universe consisted of a threefold division: heaven, earth and hell. Sunlight lit up the universe and was proof of God's presence. In the Middle Ages this numerological division of the universe was credited to the Pythagoreans, while in the 1st century it was regarded as an authoritative source of Christian doctrine by Photius and John of Sacrobosco. The Corpus Areopagiticum or Corpus Dionysiacum was to be referenced in the late Middle Ages by Dante and in the Renaissance a new translation of it was produced by Marsilio Ficino. Early Christian theologians, such as Clement of Alexandria, adopted the ascetic doctrines of the neopythagoreans. The moral and ethical teachings of Pythagorean influenced early Christianity and assimilated into early Christian texts. The Sextou gnomai (Sentences of Sextus), a Hellenistic Pythagorean text modified to reflect a Christian viewpoint, existed from at least the 2nd century and remained popular among Christians well into the Middle Ages. The Sentences of Sextus consisted of 451 sayings or principles, such as injunctions to love the truth, to avoid the pollution of the body with pleasure, to shun flatterers and to let one's tongue be harnessed by one's mind. The contents of the Sentences of Sextus was attributed by Iamblichus, the 1st century biographer of Pythagoras, to Sextus Pythagoricus. The assertion was repeated subsequently by Saint Jerome. In the 2nd century many of the Sentences of Sextus were cited by Plutarch as Pythagorean aphorisms. The Sentences of Sextus were translated into Syriac, Latin and Arabic, then the written language of both Muslims and Jews, but only in the Latin world did they become a guide to daily life that was widely circulated. =On numerology= Pythagoras is credited with having devised the tetractys, an important sacred symbol in later Pythagoreanism. In the 1st century treatises of Philo and Nicomachus popularised the mystical and cosmological symbolism Pythagoreans attributed to numbers. This interest in Pythagorean views on the importance of numbers was sustained by mathematicians such as Theon of Smyrna, Anatolius and Iamblichus. These mathematicians relied on Plato's Timaeus as source for Pythagorean philosophy. In the Middle Ages studies and adaptations of Timaeus solidified the view that there was a numerical explanation for proportion and harmony among learned men. Pythagoreanism, as mediated in Plato's Timaeus, spurned increasingly detailed studies of symmetry and harmony. Intellectuals pondered how knowledge of the geometry in which God had arranged the universe could be applied to life. By the 12th century Pythagorean numerological concepts had become a universal language in Medieval Europe and were no longer recognized as Pythagorean. Writers such as Thierry of Chartres, William of Conches and Alexander Neckham referenced classical writers that had discussed Pythagoreanism, including Cicero, Ovid and Pliny, leading them to believe that mathematics was the key to understanding astronomy and nature. Another important text on Pythagorean numerology was Boethius's De arithmetica, which was widely reproduced in the West. Boethius had relied on Nicomachus's writings as a source of Pythagoreanism. In the Byzantine world the influential professor of philosophy Michael Psellus in the 11th century popularised Pythagorean numerology in his treatise on theology, arguing that Plato was the inheritor of the Pythagorean secret. Psellus also attributed arithmetical inventions by Diophantus to Pythagoras. Psellus thought to reconstruct Iamblichus‚Äô 10 book encyclopedia on Pythagoreanism from surviving fragments, leading to the popularisation of Iamblichus' description of Pythagorean physics, ethics and theology at the Byzantine court. Psellus was reputably in the possession of the Hermetica, a set of texts thought to be genuinely antique and which would be prolifically reproduced in the late Middle Ages. Manuel Bryennios introduced Pythagorean numerology to Byzantine music with his treatise Harmonics. He argued that the octave was essential in attaining perfect harmony. In the Jewish communities the development of the Kabbalah as esoteric doctrine became associated with numerology. It was only in the 1st century that Philo of Alexandria, developed a Jewish Pythagoreanism. In the 3rd century Hermippus popularised the belief that Pythagoras had been the basis for establishing key dates in Judaism. In the 4th century this assertion was further developed by Aristobulus. The Jewish Pythagorean numerology developed by Philo held that God as the unique One was the creator of all numbers, of which seven was the most divine and ten the most perfect. The medieval edition of the Kabbalah focused largely on a cosmological scheme of creation, in reference to early Pythagorean philosophers Philolaus and Empedocles, and helped to disseminate Jewish Pythagorean numerology. =On mathematics= A page of Fibonacci's Liber Abaci from the Biblioteca Nazionale di Firenze showing (in box on right) the Fibonacci sequence with the position in the sequence labeled in Roman numerals and the value in Eastern Arabic numerals. Nicomachus' treatises were well known in Greek, Latin and the Arabic worlds. In the 1st century an Arabic translation of Nicomachus‚Äô Introduction to Arithmetic was published. The Arabic translations of Nicomachus' treatises were in turn translated into Latin by Gerard of Cremona, making them part of the Latin tradition of numerology. The Pythagorean theorem was referenced in Arabic manuscripts. Scholars in the Arabic world displayed a strong interest in Pythagorean concepts. In the 1st century Abu al-Wafa' Buzjani discussed multiplication and division in a treatise on arithmetic for business administrators in reference to Nicomachus. However, the primary interest of Islamic arithmeticians was in solving practical problems, such as taxation, measurement, the estimation of agricultural values and business applications for the buying and selling of goods. There was little interest for the Pythagorean numerology that developed in the Latin world. The primary arithmetical system used by Islamic mathematicians was based on Hindu arithmetic, which rejected the notion that the relations between numbers and geometrical forms were symbolic. Besides the enthusiasm that developed in the Latin and Byzantine worlds in the Middle Ages for Pythagorean numerology, the Pythagorean tradition of perfect numbers inspired profound scholarship in mathematics. In the 13th century Leonardo of Pisa, better known as Fibonacci, published the Libre quadratorum (The Book of Squares). Fibonacci had studied scripts from Egypt, Syria, Greece and Sicily, and was learned in Hindu, Arabic and Greek methodologies. Using the Hindu- Arabic numeral system instead of the Roman numerals, he explored numerology as it had been set forth by Nicomachus. Fibonacci observed that square numbers always arise through the addition of consecutive odd numbers starting with unity. Fibonacci put forward a method of generating sets of three square numbers that satisfied the relationship first attributed to Pythagoras by Vitruvius, that . This equation is now known as the Pythagorean triple. =In the Middle Ages= In the Middle Ages, from the 5th till the 15th century, Pythagorean texts remained popular. Late antique writers had produced adaptions of the Sentences of Sextus as The golden verses of Pythagoras. The Golden Verses gained popularity and Christian adaptations of it appeared. These Christian adaptations were adopted by monastic orders, such as Saint Benedict, as authoritative Christian doctrine. In the Latin medieval western world, the Golden Verses became a widely reproduced text. Pythagoras appears in a relief sculpture on one of the archivolts over the right door of the west portal at Chartres Cathedral. Although the concept of the quadrivium originated with Archytas in the 4th century BC and was a familiar concept among academics in the antiquity, it was attributed as Pythagorean in the 5th century by Proclus. According to Proclus, Pythagoreanism divided all mathematical sciences into four categories: arithmetic, music, geometry and astronomy. Boethius developed this theory further, arguing that a fourfold path led to the attainment of knowledge. Arithmetic, music, geometry and astronomy went on to become the essential parts of curriculums in medieval schools and universities. In the 12th century Pythagoras was credited by Hugh of Saint Victor with having written a book on quadrivium. The role of harmony had its roots in the triadic thinking of Plato and Aristotle and included the trivium of grammar, rhetoric and dialectic. From the 9th century onwards, both the quadrivium and the trivium were commonly taught in schools and the newly emerging universities. They came to be known as the Seven liberal arts. In the early 6th century the Roman philosopher Boethius popularized Pythagorean and Platonic conceptions of the universe and expounded the supreme importance of numerical ratios. The 7th century Bishop Isidore of Seville expressed his preference for the Pythagorean vision of a universe governed by the mystical properties of certain numbers, over the newly emerging Euclidean notion that knowledge could be built through deductive proofs. Isidore relied on the arithmetic of Nicomachus, who had fashioned himself as heir of Pythagoras, and took things further by studying the etymology of the name of each number. The 12th century theologian Hugh of Saint Victor found Pythagorean numerology so alluring that he set out to explain the human body entirely in numbers. In the 13th century the fashion for numerology dwindled. The Christian scholar Albertus Magnus rebuked the preoccupation with Pythagorean numerology, arguing that nature could not only be explained in terms of numbers. Plato's Timaeus became a popular source on the mystical and cosmological symbolism Pythagoreans attributed to numbers. The preoccupation for finding a numerical explanation for proportion and harmony culminated in the French cathedrals of the 11th, 12th and 13th century. Medieval manuscript of Calcidius's Latin translation of Plato's Timaeus, a Platonic dialogue with overt Pythagorean influences. Arabic translations of the Golden Verses were produced in the 11th and 12th centuries. In the Medieval Islamic world a Pythagorean tradition took hold, whereby spheres or stars produced music. This doctrine was further developed by Ikhwan al-Safa and al-Kindi, who pointed to the similarity between the harmony of music and the harmony of the soul. But Islamic philosophers such as al-Farabi and Ibn Sina vehemently rejected this Pythagorean doctrine. in Kitab al-Musiqa al-Kabir Al-Farabi rejected the notion of celestial harmony on the grounds that it was \\"plainly wrong\\" and that it was not possible for the heavens, orbs and stars to emit sounds through their motions. The four books of the Corpus Areopagiticum or Corpus Dionysiacum (The Celestrial Hierarchy, The Ecclesiastical Hierarchy, On Divine Names and The Mystical Theology) by Pseudo-Dionysius the Areopagite became enormously popular during the Middle Ages in the Byzantine world, were they had first been published in the 1st century, but also the Latin world when they were translated in the 9th century. The division of the universe into heaven, earth and hell, and the 12 orders of heaven were credited as Pythagoras‚Äô teachings by an anonymous biographer, who was quoted in the treatise of the 9th century Byzantine patriarch Photius. The 13th century astronomer and mathematician John of Sacrobosco in turn credited Pseudo- Dionysius when discussing the twelve signs of the zodiac. In the Middle Ages various classical texts that discussed Pythagorean ideas were reproduced and translated. Plato's Timaeus was translated and republished with commentary in the Arab and Jewish worlds. In the 12th century the study of Plato gave rise to a vast body of literature explicating the glory of God as it reflected in the orderliness of the universe. Writers such as Thierry of Chartres, William of Conches and Alexander Neckham referenced not only Plato but also other classical authors that had discussed Pythagoreanism, including Cicero, Ovid and Pliny. William of Conches argued that Plato was an important Pythagorean. In this medieval Pythagorean understanding of Plato, God was a craftsman when he designed the universe. =On Western science= 1619 first edition of Harmonices Mundi, full title Ioannis Keppleri Harmonices mundi libri V (The Harmony of the World), by Johannes Kepler. In the 16th century Vincenzo Galilei challenged the prevailing Pythagorean wisdom about the relationship between pitches and weights attached to strings. Vincenzo Galilei, the father of Galileo Galilei, engaged in an extended public exchange with his former teacher Zarlino. Zarlino supported the theory that if two weights in the ratio of 2 to 1 were attached to two strings, the pitches generated by the two strings would produce the octave. Vincenzo Galilei proclaimed that he had been a committed Pythagorean, until he \\"ascertained the truth by means of experiment, the teacher of all things.\\" He devised an experiment which showed that the weights attached to the two strings needed to increase as the square of the string length. This public challenge to prevailing numerology in musical theory triggered an experimental and physical approach to acoustics in the 17th century. Acoustics emerged as a mathematical field of music theory and later an independent branch of physics. In the experimental investigation of sound phenomena, numbers had no symbolic meaning and were merely used to measure physical phenomena and relationships such as frequency and vibration of a string. Many of the most eminent 17th century natural philosophers in Europe, including Francis Bacon, Descartes, Beeckman, Kepler, Mersenne, Stevin and Galileo, had a keen interest in music and acoustics. By the late 17th century it was accepted that sound travels like a wave in the air at a finite speed and experiments to establish the speed of sound were carried out by philosophers attached to the French Academy of Sciences, the Accademia del Cimento and the Royal Society. At the height of the Scientific Revolution, as Aristotelianism declined in Europe, the ideas of early-Pythagoreanism were revived. Mathematics regained importance and influenced philosophy as well as science. Mathematics was used by Kepler, Galileo, Descartes, Huygens and Newton to advance physical laws that reflected the inherent order of the universe. Twenty-one centuries after Pythagoreas had taught his disciples in Italy, Galileo announced to the world that \\"the great book of nature\\" could only be read by those who understood the language of mathematics. He set out to measure whatever is measurable, and to render everything measurable that is not. The Pythagorean concept of cosmic harmony deeply influenced western science. It served as the basis for Kepler's harmonices mundi and Leibniz's pre-established harmony. Albert Einstein believed that through this pre- established harmony, the productive unison between the spiritual and material world was possible. The Pythagorean belief that all bodies are composed of numbers and that all properties and causes could be expressed in numbers, served as the basis for a mathematization of science. This mathematization of the physical reality climaxed in the 20th century. The pioneer of physics Werner Heisenberg argued that \\"this mode of observing nature, which led in part to a true dominion over natural forces and thus contributes decisively to the development of humanity, in an unforeseen manner vindicated the Pythagorean faith\\".

Alexander Ramsay in February 1919. His mother was the youngest child of Prince Arthur, Duke of Connaught, the third son of Queen Victoria and Prince Albert. His father was the third son of John Ramsay, 13th Earl of Dalhousie. Biography Ramsay was born Alexander Arthur Alfonso David Maule Ramsay on 21 December 1919 in his mother's bathroom at Clarence House, then the London residence of his maternal grandfather, the Duke of Connaught. His baptism was held on 23 February 1920 at the Chapel Royal at St James's Palace and attended by King George V and Queens Mary and Alexandra, Princess Louise, Duchess of Argyll, and Princess Victoria. His godparents were Prince of Wales, King Alfonso XIII of Spain, the Princess Royal, Princess Christian, Princess Helena Victoria, and Commander Bolton Eyres-Monsell. He, along with his cousin Viscount Lascelles, acted as a page of honour during the coronation of King George VI and Queen Elizabeth. After leaving Eton College the same year, he received commission in the Grenadier Guards. Ramsay saw active service in North Africa during the Second World War. He lost his right leg during a tank battle at Tunisia in 1943. In 1944, he joined the staff of his cousin, the Duke of Gloucester, who was then Governor-General of Australia. Upon returning to Britain in 1947, he was informed that he would inherit Mar Lodge and its estates from his aunt, Princess Arthur of Connaught. In preparation for this role, he read agriculture at Trinity College, Oxford. After graduating in 1952, he worked for three years as assistant factor on the Linlithgow estates at South Queensferry. Ramsay inherited the Mar estate, becoming the new Laird of Mar, in 1959. At that point, Lord Lyon King of Arms allowed him to add the designation \\"of Mar\\" to his name. Part of the estate had to be sold to pay inheritance tax and became Mar Lodge Estate. In 1956, Ramsay married Flora Fraser (born 18 October 1930), the only daughter of Alexander Fraser, 20th Lord Saltoun, and chief of the Name of Fraser. His wife succeeded her father as the 21st Lady Saltoun and chief of the Name of Fraser in 1979. Thereafter, they resided at wife's family seat, Cairnbulg Castle at Fraserburgh, in Aberdeenshire. In 1971, he became the deputy lord lieutenant for Aberdeenshire. Although the Ramsays of Mar had no royal titles and carried out no public duties, they attended most major royal events. Alexander Ramsay of Mar died at his estate after a short illness, on the eve of his 81st birthday. Family Captain Alexander Ramsay of Mar and Lady Saltoun had three daughters: * Hon.

The objective of the campaign was to gain military control of the British Province of Quebec (part of modern-day Canada), and convince French-speaking Canadiens to join the revolution on the side of the Thirteen Colonies. One expedition left Fort Ticonderoga under Richard Montgomery, besieged and captured Fort St. Johns, and very nearly captured British General Guy Carleton when taking Montreal. The other expedition left Cambridge, Massachusetts, under Benedict Arnold, and traveled with great difficulty through the wilderness of Maine to Quebec City. The two forces joined there, but they were defeated at the Battle of Quebec in December 1775. Montgomery's expedition set out from Fort Ticonderoga in late August, and in mid-September began besieging Fort St. Johns, the main defensive point south of Montreal. After the fort was captured in November, Carleton abandoned Montreal, fleeing to Quebec City, and Montgomery took control of Montreal before heading for Quebec with an army much reduced in size by expiring enlistments. There he joined Arnold, who had left Cambridge in early September on an arduous trek through the wilderness that left his surviving troops starving and lacking in many supplies and equipment. These forces joined before Quebec City in December, and they assaulted the city in a snowstorm on the last day of the year. The battle was a disastrous defeat for the Continental Army; Montgomery was killed and Arnold wounded, while the city's defenders suffered few casualties. Arnold then conducted an ineffectual siege on the city, during which successful propaganda campaigns boosted Loyalist sentiments, and General David Wooster's blunt administration of Montreal served to annoy both supporters and detractors of the Americans. The British sent several thousand troops, including General John Burgoyne and Hessian allies, to reinforce those in the province in May 1776. General Carleton then launched a counter-offensive, ultimately driving the smallpox-weakened and disorganized Continental forces back to Fort Ticonderoga. The Continental Army, under Arnold's command, were able to hinder the British advance sufficiently that an attack could not be mounted on Fort Ticonderoga in 1776. The end of the campaign set the stage for Burgoyne's campaign of 1777 to gain control of the Hudson River valley. Naming Province of Quebec in 1775 The objective of the American military campaign, control of the British province of Quebec, was frequently referred to as \\"Canada\\" in 1775. For example, the authorization by the Second Continental Congress to General Philip Schuyler for the campaign included language that, if it was \\"not disagreeable to the Canadians\\", to \\"immediately take possession of St. John's, Montreal, and any other parts of the Country\\", and to \\"pursue any other measures in Canada\\" that might \\"promote peace and security\\" of the colonies.Smith (1907), vol 1, p. 242 Even relatively modern history books covering the campaign in detail refer to it as Canada in their titles (see references). The territory that Britain called Quebec was in large part the French province of Canada until 1763, when France ceded it to Britain in the 1763 Treaty of Paris, which formally ended the French and Indian War. (French leaders had surrendered the province to the British military in 1760.)Kingsford (vol 5), pp. 1‚Äì10 The name \\"Quebec\\" is used in this article, except in quotations that specifically mention \\"Canada\\", to avoid confusion between this historic usage, and usage with respect to the modern nation of Canada. Background In the spring of 1775, the American Revolutionary War began with the Battle of Lexington and Concord. The conflict was then at a standstill, with the British Army surrounded by colonial militia in the siege of Boston. In May 1775, aware of the light defenses and presence of heavy weapons at the British Fort Ticonderoga, Benedict Arnold and Ethan Allen led a force of colonial militia that captured Fort Ticonderoga and Fort Crown Point, and raided Fort St. Johns, all of which were only lightly defended at the time.Kingsford (vol 5), p. 391 Ticonderoga and Crown Point were garrisoned by 1,000 Connecticut militia under the command of Benjamin Hinman in June.Smith (1907), vol 1, pp. 182‚Äì183 =Congressional authorization= General Philip Schuyler The First Continental Congress, meeting in 1774, had previously invited the French-Canadians to join in a second meeting of the Congress to be held in May 1775, in a public letter dated October 26, 1774. The Second Continental Congress sent a second such letter in May 1775, but there was no substantive response to either one.Alden, pp. 195‚Äì198 Following the capture of Ticonderoga, Arnold and Allen noted that it was necessary to hold Ticonderoga as a defense against attempts by the British to militarily divide the colonies, and also noted that Quebec was poorly defended. They each separately proposed expeditions against Quebec, suggesting that a force as small as 1200‚Äì1500 men would be sufficient to drive the British military from the province. Congress at first ordered the forts to be abandoned,Smith (1907), vol 1, p. 178 prompting New York and Connecticut to provide troops and material for purposes that were essentially defensive in nature. Public outcries from across New England and New York challenged the Congress to change its position. When it became clear that Guy Carleton, the governor of Quebec, was fortifying Fort St. Johns, and was also attempting to involve the Iroquois in upstate New York in the conflict, Congress decided that a more active position was needed. On June 27, 1775, Congress authorized General Philip Schuyler to investigate, and, if it seemed appropriate, begin an invasion.Smith (1907), vol 1, pp. 179‚Äì242 Benedict Arnold, passed over for its command, went to Boston and convinced General George Washington to send a supporting force to Quebec City under his command.Alden, p. 202 =Defensive preparations= Following the raid on Fort St. Johns, General Carleton was keenly aware of the danger of invasion from the south, and requested, without immediate relief, reinforcements from General Thomas Gage in Boston. He set about raising local militias to aid in the defense of Montreal and Quebec City, which met with only limited success.Coffin, pp. 496‚Äì497 In response to the capture of Ticonderoga and the raid on Fort St. Johns, he sent 700 troops to hold that fort on the Richelieu River south of Montreal, ordered construction of vessels for use on Lake Champlain,Alden, p. 199 and recruited about one hundred Mohawk to assist in its defense. He himself oversaw the defense of Montreal, leading only 150 regulars, since he relied on Fort St. Johns for the main defense. The defense of Quebec City he left under the command of Lieutenant-Governor Cramah√©.Lanctot, p. 53 =Negotiations for Indigenous peoples support= This painting by Benjamin West is usually identified as a portrait of Guy Johnson, although a recent biography of Sir William Johnson claims that it actually depicts Sir William, Guy's uncle.O'Toole, 240, 374n2. Guy Johnson, a Loyalist and British Indian agent living in the Mohawk Valley in New York, was on quite friendly terms with the Iroquois of New York, and was concerned for the safety of himself and his family after it became clear that Patriot sentiment had taken hold in New York. Apparently convinced that he could no longer safely conduct Crown business, he left his estate in New York with about 200 Loyalist and Mohawk supporters. He first went to Fort Ontario, where, on June 17, he extracted from indigenous tribal leaders (mostly Iroquois and Huron) promises to assist in keeping supply and communication lines open in the area, and to support the British in \\"the annoyance of the enemy\\".Smith (1907), vol 1, p. 293 From there he went to Montreal, where, in a meeting with General Carleton and more than 1,500 indigenous peoples, negotiated similar agreements, and delivered war belts \\"to be held ready for service\\". However, most of those involved in these agreements were Mohawks; the other tribes in the Iroquois Confederacy largely avoided these conferences, seeking to stay neutral. Many of the Mohawks remained in the Montreal area after the conference; however, when it seemed uncertain whether the Americans would actually launch an invasion in 1775, most of them had returned home by the middle of August.Smith (1907), vol 1, pp. 295‚Äì296 The Continental Congress sought to keep the Six Nations out of the war. In July 1775, Samuel Kirkland, a missionary who was influential with the Oneidas, brought to them a statement from Congress: \\"we desire you to remain at home, and not join either side, but to keep the hatchet buried deep.\\"Glatthaar (2006), p. 91 While the Oneidas and Tuscaroras remained formally neutral, many individual Oneidas expressed sympathy with the rebels. News of Johnson's Montreal meeting prompted General Schuyler, who also had influence with the Oneidas, to call for a conference in Albany, to be held in mid-August. Attended by about 400 indigenous (primarily Oneidas and Tuscaroras, and only a few Mohawk), Schuyler and other Indian commissioners explained the issues dividing the colonies from Britain, emphasizing that the colonists were at war to preserve their rights, and were not attempting conquest.Glatthaar (2006), pp. 91‚Äì93 The assembled chiefs agreed to remain neutral, with one Mohawk chief saying, \\"It is a family affair\\" and that they would \\"sit still and see you fight ... out\\".Glatthaar (2006), p. 93 They did, however, extract concessions from the Americans, including promises to address ongoing grievances like the encroachment of white settlers on their lands.Glatthaar (2006), p. 94 Montgomery's expedition Brigadier General Richard Montgomery The primary thrust of the invasion was to be led by General Schuyler, going up Lake Champlain to assault Montreal and then Quebec City. The expedition was to be composed of forces from New York, Connecticut, and New Hampshire, as well as the Green Mountain Boys under Seth Warner, with provisions supplied by New York.Lossing, pp. 227‚Äì228 However, Schuyler was overcautious, and by mid-August the colonists were receiving reports that General Carleton was fortifying defensive positions outside Montreal,Smith (1907), vol 1, pp. 309‚Äì310 and that some Native tribes had joined with the British.Smith (1907), vol 1, pp. 291‚Äì292 =Approach to St. Johns= On August 25, while Schuyler was at the indigenous peoples conference, Montgomery received word that ships under construction at Fort St. Johns were nearing completion. Montgomery, taking advantage of Schuyler's absence (and in the absence of orders authorizing movement), led 1,200 troops that had mustered at Ticonderoga up to a forward position at √éle aux Noix in the Richelieu River, arriving September 4.Smith (1907), vol 1, pp. 317‚Äì324. Schuyler, who was falling ill, caught up with the troops en route. He dispatched a letter to James Livingston, a Canadian prepared to raise local militia forces in support of the American effort, to circulate in the area south of Montreal. The next day, the forces went down the river to Fort St. Johns, where, after seeing the defenses and a brief skirmish in which both sides suffered casualties, they withdrew to √éle aux Noix. The skirmish, which involved mostly indigenous people on the British side, was not supported from the fort, prompting the Indians to withdraw from the conflict.Smith (1907), vol 1, p. 357 Any additional indigenous support for the British was further halted by the timely arrival of Oneidas in the area, who intercepted a Mohawk war party on the move from Caughnawaga toward St. John's. The Oneidas convinced the party to return to their village, where Guy Johnson, Daniel Claus, and Joseph Brant had arrived in an attempt to gain the Mohawks' assistance. Refusing to meet directly with Johnson and Claus, the Oneidas explained to Brant and the Mohawks the terms of the Albany agreement.Glatthaar (2006), p. 97 Brant and the British agents left without any promises of support. (In a more formal snub of the British, the war belt that Guy Johnson gave to the Iroquois in July was turned over to the American Indian commissioners in December 1775.)Glatthaar (2006), p. 98 Artist's depiction of Ethan Allen after his capture Following this first skirmish, General Schuyler became too ill to continue, so he turned command over to Montgomery. Schuyler left for Fort Ticonderoga several days later.Smith (1907), vol 1, p. 335 After another false start, and the arrival of another 800‚Äì1000 men from Connecticut, New Hampshire, and New York, as well as some of the Green Mountain Boys,Smith (1907), vol 1, pp. 361‚Äì365 Montgomery finally began besieging Fort St. Johns on September 17, cutting off its communications with Montreal and capturing supplies intended for the fort. Ethan Allen was captured the following week in the Battle of Longue-Pointe, when, overstepping instructions to merely raise local militia, he attempted to take Montreal with a small force of men.Smith (1907), vol 1, p. 384 This event resulted in a brief upturn in militia support for the British; but the effects were relatively short-lived, with many deserting again in the following days.Smith (1907), vol 1, pp. 388, 410 After an attempt by General Carleton to relieve the siege failed on October 30, the fort finally surrendered on November 3.Lossing, p. 229 Occupation of Montreal begins Montgomery then led his troops north and occupied Saint Paul's Island in the Saint Lawrence River on November 8, crossing to Pointe- Saint-Charles on the following day, where he was greeted as a liberator.Smith (1907), vol 1, p. 474 Montreal fell without any significant fighting on November 13, as Carleton, deciding that the city was indefensible (and having suffered significant militia desertion upon the news of the fall of St. Johns), withdrew. He barely escaped capture, as some Americans had crossed the river downstream of the city, and winds prevented his fleet from departing right away. When his fleet neared Sorel, it was approached by a boat carrying a truce flag. The boat carried a demand for surrender, claiming that gun batteries downstream would otherwise destroy the convoy. Based on uncertain knowledge of how real these batteries were, Carleton elected to sneak off the ship, after ordering the dumping of powder and ammunition if surrender was deemed necessary. (There were batteries in place, but not nearly as powerful as those claimed.)Stanley, pp. 67‚Äì70 On November 19, the British fleet surrendered; Carleton, disguised as a common man,Smith (1907), vol 1, pp. 487‚Äì490 made his way to Quebec City. The captured ships included prisoners that the British had taken; among these was Moses Hazen, a Massachusetts-born expatriate with property near Fort St. Johns whose poor treatment by the British turned him against them. Hazen, who had combat experience in the French and Indian War and went on to lead the 2nd Canadian Regiment throughout the war, joined Montgomery's army.Everest, pp. 31‚Äì33 Before departing Montreal for Quebec City, Montgomery published messages to the inhabitants that the Congress wanted Quebec to join them, and entered into discussions with American sympathizers with the aim of holding a provincial convention for the purpose of electing delegates to Congress. He also wrote to General Schuyler, requesting that a Congressional delegation be sent to take up diplomatic activities.Gabriel, p. 141 American attack on Quebec: routes of the Arnold and Montgomery expeditions Much of Montgomery's army departed due to expiring enlistments after the fall of Montreal. He then used some of the captured boats to move towards Quebec City with about 300 troops on November 28, leaving about 200 in Montreal under the command of General David Wooster.Shelton, pp. 122‚Äì127 Along the way, he picked up James Livingston's newly created 1st Canadian Regiment of about 200 men.Smith (1907), vol 2, p. 86 Arnold's expedition Benedict Arnold, who had been rejected for leadership of the Champlain Valley expedition, returned to Cambridge, Massachusetts, and approached George Washington with the idea of a supporting eastern invasion force aimed at Quebec City.Smith (1907), vol 1, pp. 398‚Äì399 Washington approved the idea, and gave Arnold 1,100 men, including Daniel Morgan's riflemen, for the effort.Smith (1907), vol 1, p. 515 Arnold's force sailed from Newburyport, Massachusetts to the mouth of the Kennebec River and then upriver to Fort Western (present day Augusta, Maine). Arnold's expedition was a success in that he was able to bring a body of troops to the gates of Quebec City. However, the expedition was beset by troubles as soon as it left the last significant outposts of civilization in present-day Maine. There were numerous difficult portages as the troops moved up the Kennebec River, and the boats they were using frequently leaked, spoiling gunpowder and food supplies. The height of land between the Kennebec and the Chaudi√®re River was a swampy tangle of lakes and streams, where the traversal was complicated by bad weather, resulting in one quarter of the troops turning back. The descent down the Chaudi√®re resulted in the destruction of more boats and supplies as the inexperienced troops were unable to control the boats in the fast-moving waters.Arnold's expedition is described in detail in e.g. Smith (1903) and Desjardins (2006). By the time Arnold reached the outskirts of civilization along the Saint Lawrence River in November, his force was reduced to 600 starving men. They had traveled almost 400 miles through untracked wilderness. When Arnold and his troops finally reached the Plains of Abraham on November 14, Arnold sent a negotiator with a white flag to demand their surrender, but to no avail. The Americans, with no cannons, and barely fit for action, faced a fortified city. Arnold, after hearing of a planned sortie from the city, decided on November 19 to withdraw to Pointe-aux-Trembles to wait for Montgomery, who had recently captured Montreal.Simeon, p. xiv As he headed upriver, Carleton returned to Quebec by river following his defeat at Montreal.Kingsford (vol 5), p. 463 On December 2, Montgomery finally came down the river from Montreal with 500 troops, bringing captured British supplies and winter clothing. The two forces united, and plans were made for an attack on the city.Alden, p. 206 Three days later the Continental Army again stood on the Plains of Abraham and began to besiege the city of Quebec.Smith (1907), vol 2, p. 98 Battle and siege of Quebec Benedict Arnold was injured in the battle of Quebec. While planning the attack on the city, Christophe P√©lissier, a Frenchman living near Trois-Rivi√®res, came to meet with Montgomery. P√©lissier, who was politically supportive of the American cause, operated an ironworks at Saint-Maurice. Montgomery discussed the idea of holding the provincial convention with him. P√©lissier recommended against holding a convention until after Quebec City had been taken, as the habitants would not feel free to act in that way until their security was better assured.Gabriel, pp. 185‚Äì186 The two did agree to have P√©lissier's ironworks provide munitions for the siege, which he did until the Americans retreated in May 1776 (at which time P√©lissier also fled, eventually returning to France).Proc. RSC 1886, pp. 85‚Äì86 Montgomery joined Arnold and James Livingston in an assault on Quebec City during a snowstorm on December 31, 1775. Outnumbered and lacking any sort of tactical advantage, the Americans were soundly defeated by Carleton. Montgomery was killed, Arnold was wounded, and many men were taken prisoner, including Daniel Morgan.Smith (1907), vol 2, pp. 111‚Äì147 Following the battle, Arnold sent Moses Hazen and Edward Antill, another expatriate American, to report the defeat and request support to Wooster in Montreal, and also to the Congress in Philadelphia.Everest, p. 35 Defending Quebec from an American attack, December 1775 Carleton chose not to pursue the Americans, opting instead to stay within the fortifications of the city, and await reinforcements that might be expected to arrive when the river thawed in the spring. Arnold maintained a somewhat ineffectual siege over the city, until March 1776, when he was ordered to Montreal and replaced by General Wooster. During these months, the besieging army suffered from difficult winter conditions, and smallpox began to travel more significantly through the camp. These losses were offset by the arrival each month of small companies of reinforcements.Lanctot, p. 126 On March 14, Jean-Baptiste Chasseur, a miller living downstream from the city, entered Quebec and informed Carleton that there were 200 men on the south side of the river ready to act against the Americans.Lanctot, p. 130 These men and more were mobilized, but an advance force was defeated in the Battle of Saint-Pierre by a detachment of pro- American local militia that were stationed on the south side of the river.Lanctot, pp. 131‚Äì132 Congress, even before it learned of the defeat at Quebec, had authorized as many as 6,500 additional troops for service there.Nelson, p. 167 Throughout the winter, troops trickled into Montreal and the camp outside Quebec City. By the end of March, the besieging army had grown to almost 3,000, although almost one quarter of these were unfit for service, mainly due to smallpox. Furthermore, James Livingston and Moses Hazen, commanding the 500 Canadians in the army, were pessimistic about the loyalty of their men and the cooperation of the population due to persistent Loyalist propaganda.Lanctot, p. 133 Congress was conflicted about requests that Arnold made for a more experienced general officer to lead the siege effort. They first chose Charles Lee a major general with experience in the British Army, to lead the troops in Quebec in January. One week later, they retracted the step, and instead sent Lee into the southern states to direct efforts against an anticipated British attack there.Nelson, p. 173 (The British attempt was thwarted in the June 1776 Battle of Sullivan's Island.)Winsor, pp. 168‚Äì172 They finally settled in March 1776 on Major General John Thomas, who had served in the army besieging Boston. Discontent in Montreal A map of Montreal in 1744 When General Montgomery left Montreal for Quebec City, he left the administration of the city in the hands of Connecticut's Brigadier General David Wooster. While Wooster at first had decent relations with the community, he took a number of steps that caused the local population to come to dislike the American military presence. After promising American ideals to the population, he began arresting Loyalists and threatening arrest and punishment of anyone opposed to the American cause.Stanley, p. 110 He also disarmed several communities, and attempted to force local militia members to surrender their Crown commissions. Those who refused were arrested and imprisoned at Fort Chambly.Stanley, p. 111 These and similar acts, combined with the fact that the Americans were paying for supplies and services with paper money rather than coin, served to disillusion the local population about the entire American enterprise. On March 20, Wooster left to take command of the forces at Quebec City, leaving Moses Hazen, who had raised the 2nd Canadian Regiment, in command of Montreal until Arnold arrived on April 19.Stanley, pp. 112‚Äì113 On April 29, a delegation consisting of three members of the Continental Congress, along with an American Jesuit priest, John Carroll (later the first Catholic bishop in the United States) and a French printer from Philadelphia, arrived in Montreal. The Continental Congress had assigned this delegation the tasks of assessing the situation in Quebec and attempting to sway public opinion to their cause. This delegation, which included Benjamin Franklin, was largely unsuccessful in its efforts, as relations were already significantly damaged. The delegation had not brought any hard currency to alleviate debts to the population that were accumulating. Efforts to turn the Catholic clergy to their cause failed, as the local priests pointed out that the Quebec Act passed by the British Parliament had given them what they wanted. Fleury Mesplet, the printer, while he had set up his press, did not have time to produce anything before events began to overtake the delegation.Stanley, p. 115 Franklin and Carroll left Montreal on May 11, following news that the American forces at Quebec City were in panicked retreat,Lanctot, p. 141 to return to Philadelphia. Samuel Chase and Charles Carroll, the other two delegates, analyzed the military situation in the area south and east of Montreal, finding it a good place to set up a defense. On May 27, they wrote a report to Congress on the situation, and left for the south.Stanley, p. 116 Cornplanter, a Seneca chief, supported the British side, and may have fought in this campaign. =The Cedars= Upriver from Montreal were a series of small British garrisons that the Americans had not concerned themselves with during the occupation. As spring approached, bands of Cayuga, Seneca, and Mississauga warriors began to gather at Oswegatchie, one of these garrisons, giving the commander there, Captain George Forster, a force with which to cause trouble for the Americans.Stanley, p. 117 Forster had recruited them on the recommendation of a Loyalist who had escaped from Montreal. Furthermore, while General Wooster, much to the annoyance of both Patriot and Loyalist merchants, had refused to permit trade with the Indians upriver out of fear that supplies sent in that direction would be used by the British forces there, the congressional delegation reversed his decision and supplies began flowing out of the city up the river.Stanley, p. 118 To prevent the flow of supplies to the British forces upriver, and in response to rumours of indigenous peoples gathering, Moses Hazen detached Colonel Timothy Bedel and 390 men to a position upriver at Les C√®dres (English: The Cedars), where they built a stockaded defense works. Colonel Forster was made aware of these movements by Indian spies and Loyalists, and on May 15 began to move downriver with a mixed force of about 250 Natives, militia, and regulars. In an odd series of encounters known as the Battle of the Cedars, Bedel's lieutenant Isaac Butterfield surrendered this entire force without a fight on the 18th, and another 100 men brought as reinforcements also surrendered after a brief skirmish on the 19th.Stanley, pp. 119‚Äì121 =Quinze-Ch√™nes= On receiving news of Butterfield's capture, Arnold immediately began assembling a force to recover them, which he entrenched in a position at Lachine, just upriver from Montreal. Forster, who had left the captives in the stockade at Les C√®dres, moved closer to Montreal with a force now numbering around 500, until May 24 when he received intelligence of Arnold's location, and that Arnold was expecting additional forces which would significantly outnumber his. Since his force was dwindling in size, he negotiated an agreement with his captives to exchange them for British prisoners taken during the siege of Fort St. Johns. After a brief exchange of cannon fire at Quinze-Ch√™nes, Arnold also agreed to the exchange, which took place between May 27 and 30.Stanley, pp. 121‚Äì123 Reinforcements arrive at Quebec City General John Burgoyne arrived with the reinforcements =American troops= General John Thomas was unable to move north until late April, due to the icy conditions on Lake Champlain.Nelson, p. 184 Concerned about reports of troop readiness and sickness, he made requests to Washington for additional men to follow him while he waited for conditions to improve. Upon his arrival in Montreal, he learned that many men had promised to stay only until April 15, and most of these were insistent on returning home. This was compounded by relatively low enrollments in regiments actually raised for service in Quebec. One regiment with an authorized strength of 750, sailed north with but 75 men.Nelson, pp. 187‚Äì188 These deficiencies prompted Congress to order Washington to send more troops north. In late April, Washington ordered ten regiments, led by Generals William Thompson and John Sullivan, to go north from New York. This significantly reduced Washington's forces that were preparing for a British attack there.Nelson, p. 188 This also exposed transport problems: there were insufficient sailing hands on Lakes George and Champlain to easily move all of these men. Furthermore, there was also a shortage of supplies in Quebec, and much of the shipping was needed to move provisions instead of men.Nelson, p. 189 As a result, Sullivan's men were held up at Ticonderoga, and Sullivan did not reach Sorel until the beginning of June.Nelson, p. 210 General Wooster arrived in the American camp outside Quebec City in early April with reinforcements. Reinforcements continued to arrive from the south in modest numbers, until General Thomas arrived at the end of April and assumed command of a force that was nominally over 2,000 strong, but in reality was significantly diminished by the effects of smallpox and the hardships of the Canadian winter. Rumors began circulating on May 2 that British ships were coming up the river. Thomas decided on May 5 to evacuate the sick to Trois-Rivi√®res, with the rest of the forces to withdraw as soon as practical. Late on that day he received intelligence that 15 ships were 40 leagues below the city, awaiting favorable conditions to come up the river. The pace of camp evacuation took on a sense of urgency early the next day when ship's masts were spotted; the wind had changed, and 3 ships of the fleet had reached the city.Smith (1907), vol 2, pp. 294‚Äì295 =British troops= After news of Lexington and Concord reached London, the government of Lord North, realizing it would require the support of foreign troops to combat the rebellion, began negotiating with European allies for the use of their troops in North America. Requests to Catherine the Great for Russian troops were refused, but a number of German principalities were prepared to offer theirs. Of the 50,000 troops that Britain raised in 1776, nearly one third came from a handful of these principalities; the number of troops from Hesse-Cassel and Hesse-Hanau caused them to be widely referred to as Hessians.Nickerson, p. 46 Of these 50,000, about 11,000 were destined for service in Quebec.Nickerson, p. 92 Troops from Hesse-Hanau and Brunswick- L√ºneburg sailed in February 1776 for Cork, where they joined a convoy carrying British troops that sailed in early April.Ketchum, pp. 89‚Äì96 Carleton, having been informed of pace of activity in the American camp, rapidly unloaded reinforcements from the arrived ships, and around noon marched with a force of about 900 troops to test the Americans. The American response was essentially panic; a disorganized retreat began that might have ended even more disastrously for the Americans had Carleton pressed his advantage. Hoping to win over the rebels with a lenient attitude,Lanctot, p. 139 he was content to send ships up the river to harass the Americans, and to possibly cut them off. He also captured a number of Americans, mostly sick and wounded, but also a detachment of troops that had been abandoned on the south side of the St. Lawrence. The Americans, in their hurry to get away, left numerous valuable military effects, including cannon and gunpowder, in their wake. They regrouped on the 7th at Deschambault, about 40 miles upriver from Quebec City. Thomas held a war council there, in which most of the leadership favored retreat. Thomas opted to retain 500 men at Deschambault while sending the rest to Sorel, and also sent word to Montreal for assistance, since many of the troops had little more than the clothes on their backs and a few days rations.Smith (1907), volume 2, pp. 345‚Äì346 The Congressional delegation in Montreal, upon hearing this news, determined that holding the Saint Lawrence would no longer be possible, and dispatched only a small number of troops toward Deschambault. Thomas, after waiting for six days for word from Montreal and hearing none, began to withdraw toward Trois-Rivi√®res, but not before having to fight off skirmishers from forces landed from British ships on the river. They reached Trois-Rivi√®res on May 15, where they left the sick, and a detachment of New Jersey troops to defend them. By the 18th, the remaining troops joined reinforcements under General Thompson at Sorel, where on the 21st, a council was held with the Congressional delegates. Thomas contracted smallpox that same day, and died on June 2. He was replaced by Thompson.Stanley, pp. 126‚Äì127 Carleton's counteroffensive Guy Carleton =Trois-Rivi√®res= On May 6, 1776, a small squadron of British ships under Captain Charles Douglas had arrived to relieve Quebec with supplies and 3,000 troops, precipitating the Americans' retreat to Sorel. However, General Carleton did not take significant offensive measures until May 22, when he sailed to Trois-Rivi√®res with the 47th and 29th regiments. While hearing news of Forster's success at Les C√®dres, instead of pushing ahead he returned to Quebec City, leaving Allen Maclean in command at Trois-Rivi√®res. There he met Lieutenant General John Burgoyne, who had arrived on June 1 with a large force of mostly Irish recruits, Hessian allies, and a war chest of money. The Americans at Sorel, on receiving word that a force of \\"only 300 men\\" was at Trois-Rivi√®res, thought that they should be able to send a force from Sorel to take Trois-Rivi√®res back. Unaware that major British reinforcements had arrived, and ignorant of the geography around the town, General Thompson led 2,000 men first into a swamp, and then into the teeth of a reinforced, entrenched British army. This disaster included the capture of Thompson and many of his senior officers, as well as 200 men and most of the ships used for the expedition, and forecast the end of the American occupation of Quebec. The American forces at Sorel, now under the command of General Sullivan, retreated.Stanley, pp. 127‚Äì128 Carleton once again did not press his advantage, even going so far as to eventually return the captives to New York, in great comfort, in August.Stanley, p. 128 =Retreat to Crown Point= Early on June 14, Carleton finally sailed his army up the river to Sorel. Arriving late in the day, they discovered that the Americans had abandoned Sorel just that morning, and were retreating up the Richelieu River valley toward Chambly and St. Johns. Unlike the departure from Quebec City, the Americans left in a somewhat orderly manner, although some units were separated from the main force by the arrival of Carleton's fleet, and were forced to march to Montreal to join Arnold's forces.Stanley, p. 129 Carleton directed General Burgoyne and 4,000 troops to move up the Richelieu after the retreating Americans, while Carleton continued sailing toward Montreal.Stanley, p. 130 In Montreal, Arnold was ignorant of the events taking place downriver, having recently finished dealing with Forster. A messenger he sent downriver toward Sorel on June 15 for news from General Sullivan spotted Carleton's fleet, escaped to shore, and returned with the news to Montreal on a stolen horse. Within four hours, Arnold and the American forces garrisoned around Montreal had abandoned the city (but not before trying to burn it down), leaving it in the hands of the local militia. Carleton's fleet arrived in Montreal on June 17.Stanley, p. 131 USS Philadelphia saw action at the Battle of Valcour Island. Arnold's troops caught up with the main army near St. Johns on the 17th. Sullivan's army was in no condition to fight, and after a brief council, the decision was made to retreat to Crown Point. The army reportedly got away from St. Johns almost literally moments before the vanguard of Burgoyne's army arrived on the scene.Stanley, p. 132 The remains of the American army arrived at Crown Point in early July, ending a campaign that was described as \\"a heterogeneal concatenation of the most peculiar and unparalleled rebuffs and sufferings that are perhaps to be found in the annals of any nation\\", by Isaac Senter, a doctor who experienced much of the campaign.Stanley, pp. 132‚Äì133 Unfortunately for the Americans, the campaign was not quite ended, since the British were still on the move. =Shipbuilding and politics= The Americans had been careful at every step of the retreat up the Richelieu and across Lake Champlain to deny the British of any significant shipping, burning or sinking any boats they did not take with them. This forced the British to spend several months building ships. Carleton reported to London on September 28 that \\"I expect our Fleet will soon sail with hopes of success should they come to action\\".Stanley, p. 134 General Arnold, when he and Ethan Allen captured Fort Ticonderoga, had established a small navy that was still patrolling Lake Champlain. While the British assembled a navy to counteract Arnold's, Carleton dealt with matters in Montreal. Even before the Americans retreated from Quebec City, he formed committees to look into the roles played by local Patriot sympathizers, sending them out into the countryside to arrest active participants in the American action, including those who had detained Loyalists.Stanley, p. 124 When he arrived in Montreal, similar commissions were set up. A map detail showing the formations at the Battle of Valcour Island =Valcour Island= General Horatio Gates was given command of the Continental Army's northern forces in early July. He promptly moved the bulk of the army to Ticonderoga, leaving a force of about 300 at Crown Point. The army was busied improving the defenses at Ticonderoga, while Arnold was given the task of building up the American fleet at Crown Point. Throughout the summer, reinforcements poured into Ticonderoga, until the army was estimated to be 10,000 strong.Stanley, p. 136 A smaller army of shipwrights labored at Skenesborough (present-day Whitehall) to build the ships needed to defend the lake.Nelson, p. 228 Carleton began to move on October 7. By the 9th, the British fleet was on Lake Champlain. In a naval action between Valcour Island and the western shore, beginning on October 11, the British inflicted heavy damage to Arnold's fleet, forcing him to withdraw to Crown Point. Feeling that Crown Point would be inadequate protection against a sustained British attack, he then withdrew to Ticonderoga. British forces occupied Crown Point on October 17.Stanley, pp. 137‚Äì143 Carleton's troops remained at Crown Point for two weeks, with some troops advancing to within three miles of Ticonderoga, apparently in an attempt to draw Gates' army out. On November 2, they pulled out of Crown Point and withdrew to winter quarters in Quebec.Stanley, p. 144 Aftermath The invasion of Quebec ended as a disaster for the Americans, but Arnold's actions on the retreat from Quebec and his improvised navy on Lake Champlain were widely credited with delaying a full-scale British counter thrust until 1777.Morrissey, p. 87 Carleton was heavily criticized by Burgoyne for not pursuing the American retreat from Quebec more aggressively.Nickerson, p. 71 Due to these criticisms and the fact that Carleton was disliked by Lord George Germain, the British Secretary of State for the Colonies and the official in King George's government responsible for directing the war, command of the 1777 offensive was given to General Burgoyne instead (an action that prompted Carleton to tender his resignation as Governor of Quebec).Nickerson, p. 102 A significant portion of the Continental forces at Fort Ticonderoga were sent south with Generals Gates and Arnold in November to bolster Washington's faltering defense of New Jersey. (He had already lost New York City, and by early December had crossed the Delaware River into Pennsylvania, leaving the British free to operate in New Jersey.)Winsor, pp. 367‚Äì373 Conquering Quebec and other British colonies remained an objective of Congress throughout the war. However, George Washington, who had supported this invasion, considered any further expeditions a low priority that would divert too many men and resources away from the main war in the Thirteen Colonies, so further attempts at expeditions to Quebec were never fully realized.Smith (1907), volume 2, pp. 459‚Äì552 Several hundred men of British and French descent continued to serve in the ranks of the Continental Army following the retreat of 1776. Under Livingston and Hazen, they served in various theaters of the war, including the siege of Yorktown. Being unable to recover the property they lost in the Province of Quebec, many remained in the army out of necessity and continually pushed American political and military authorities to live up to their financial pledges. At war's end, Canadiens reunited with women and children who had survived on rations in Albany and Fishkill, New York; some accepted the opportunity to settle a northern New York tract designated for \\"refugees\\" from Canada and Nova Scotia. During the Paris peace talks, the American negotiators unsuccessfully demanded all of Quebec as part of the war spoils. Benjamin Franklin, primarily interested in the Ohio Country, which had been made part of Quebec by the Quebec Act of 1774, suggested in the peace talks that Quebec should be surrendered to America but only the Ohio Country was ceded. In the War of 1812 the Americans launched another invasion of British North America, and again expected the local populace to support them. That failed invasion is now regarded as a significant event in Canadian history; it has even been claimed as the birth of modern Canadian identity.Dale, p. 8 See also * List of American Revolutionary War battles * Heritage Minutes * History of Canada * History of the United States * Military history of Canada * Military history of the United States * Notes References     * This book includes a reprint of Arnold's diary of his march.

Military career Bingham, the son of Lord Clanmorris, entered the Royal Navy in 1895 as an acting sub-lieutenant. He was confirmed as a sub-lieutenant 15 March 1901. At the beginning of the First World War, he was appointed Commander (Executive Officer) of , which saw action at the Battle of the Falkland Islands in December 1914. On 31 May 1916, during the Battle of Jutland off Denmark, Commander Bingham was in command of a destroyer division. He led his division in their attack, first on enemy destroyers and then on the battle cruisers of the German High Seas Fleet. Once the enemy was sighted Bingham ordered his own destroyer, , and the one remaining destroyer of his division, , to close to within 2,750 meters of the opposing battle fleet so that he could bring his torpedoes to bear. While making this attack Nestor and Nicator were under concentrated fire of the secondary batteries of the German fleet and Nestor was subsequently sunk. For his actions, Bingham earned the Victoria Cross, one of relatively few awarded for naval bravery during World War I. Bingham was picked up by the Germans at Jutland, and remained a prisoner of war (latterly at Holzminden) until the Armistice. After the war, he remained with the Royal Navy and retired as a Rear Admiral in 1932. He was made an Officer of the Order of the British Empire. Bingham died in 1939 and is buried in the Golders Green cemetery in northwest London. Victoria cross medal Bingham's Victoria Cross was auctioned by Sotheby's in 1983 and was purchased by the North Down Borough Council, County Down, who outbid a Canadian millionaire.

Distribution This species is distributed from Fennoscandia to eastern Siberia; in addition there are isolated mountain populations in the Alps, Scotland, the Baltics, northeastern Poland and Hokkaid≈ç. In Ireland, the \\"Irish\\" hare (Lepus timidus hibernicus) does not grow a white winter coat, is smaller in size, and lives on lowland pastures, coastal grasslands and salt marshes, not just in the mountains. The mountain hare has also been introduced to Iceland, Shetland, Orkney, the Isle of Man, the Peak District, Svalbard, Kerguelen Islands, Crozet Islands, and the Faroe Islands.Long, John L. (2003). Introduced Mammals of the World: Their History, Distribution and Influence. Cabi Publishing () In the Alps, the mountain hare lives at elevations from 700 to 3800 m, depending on biographic region and season.Rehnus, M.: Der Schneehase in den Alpen. Ein √úberlebensk√ºnstler mit ungewisser Zukunft, Haupt Verlag, Bern 2013, , p. 21 Description European hare (above) compared with a mountain hare Stuffed mountain hare, showing the winter pelage The mountain hare is a large species, though it is slightly smaller than the European hare. It grows to a length of , with a tail of , and a mass of , females being slightly heavier than males. They can live for up to 12 years. In summer, for all populations of mountain hares, the coat is various shades of brown. In preparation for winter most populations moult into a white (or largely white) pelage. The tail remains completely white all year round, distinguishing the mountain hare from the European hare (Lepus europaeus), which has a black upper side to the tail. The subspecies Lepus timidus hibernicus (the Irish mountain hare) stays brown all year and individuals rarely develop a white coat. The Irish hare may also have a \\"golden\\" variation, particularly those found on Rathlin Island. In the Faroe Islands, mountain hares turn grey in the winter instead of white. The winter-grey color may be caused by downregulation of the agouti hair cycle isoform in the autumn molt.  Behaviour  \\"Mountain, Irish Hare\\" illustration from \\"British Mammals\\" by A. Thorburn, 1920 Skeleton Studies have shown that the diet of the mountain hare varies from region to region. It seems to be somewhat dependent on the particular habitat that the population under study lives in. For example, in northern Scandinavia where snow may blanket the ground for many months, the hares may graze on twigs and bark. In areas where snowfall is rare, such as Ireland, grass may form the bulk of the diet. Given a choice, mountain hares in Scotland and Ireland seem to prefer feeding on grasses. One study looking at mountain hares on a coastal grassland environment in Ireland found that grasses constituted over 90% of the diet. This was higher than the percentage of grass in the diet of the European rabbit (Oryctolagus cuniculus) that inhabited the same environment. The mountain hare is regionally the favourite prey of the golden eagle and may additionally be preyed on by Eurasian eagle- owls and red foxes. Stoats may prey on young hares. In northern parts of Finland, Norway and Sweden, the mountain hare and the European hare compete for habitat. The European hare, being larger, is usually able to drive away the mountain hare but is less adapted for living in snowy regions: its feet are smaller and its winter fur is a mixture of white and brown. While this winter fur is actually a very good camouflage in the coastal regions of Finland where the snow covers the shrubs but for a short time, the mountain hare is better adapted for the snowier conditions of the inland areas. The two may occasionally cross. The Arctic hare (Lepus arcticus) was once considered a subspecies of the mountain hare, but it is now regarded as a separate species. Similarly, some scientists believe that the Irish hare should be regarded as a separate species. Fifteen subspecies are currently recognised.  Human impact  In the European Alps the mountain hare lives at elevations from 700 to 3800 m, depending on biographic region and season. The development of alpine winter tourism has increased rapidly since the last few decades of the 20th century, resulting in expansion of ski resorts, growing visitor numbers, and a huge increase in all forms of snow sport activities. A 2013 study looking at stress events and the response of mountain hares to disturbance concluded that those hares living in areas of high winter recreational activities showed changes in physiology and behaviour that demanded additional energy input at a time when access to food resources is restricted by snow. It recommended ensuring that forests inhabited by mountain hares were kept free of tourist development, and that new skiing areas should be avoided in mountain hare habitat, and that existing sites should not be expanded.Rehnus, M., Wehrle, M., Palme, R. (2013). \\"Mountain hares Lepus timidus and tourism: stress events and reactions.\\" Journal of Applied Ecology 50(1):6-12. http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/1365-2664.12174/abstract In August 2016, the Scottish animal welfare charity OneKind launched a campaign on behalf of the mountain hare, as a way of raising awareness of mountain hare culls taking place across the country and in garnering public support for the issue. Mountain hares are routinely shot in the Scottish Highlands both as part of paid hunting \\"tours\\" and by gamekeepers managing red grouse populations (who believe that mountain hares can be vectors of diseases which affect the birds). Much of this activity is secretive https://theferret.scot/outrage-mass-killing-mountain-hares/ Outrage over mass killing of mountain hares, The Ferret, Rob Edwards, 14 March 2016 but investigations have revealed that tens of thousands of hares are being culled every year.https://theferret.scot/38000-mountain-hares-killed/ Nearly 38,000 mountain hares killed in one season, new data reveals, The Ferret, Billy Briggs, 18 May 2018 The campaign, which urges people to proclaim that \\"We Care For The Mountain Hare\\", will culminate with the charity urging the Scottish government to legislate against commercial hunting and culling of the iconic Scottish species. The campaign has revealed widespread public support for a ban on hare hunting in Scotland. On May 17 2020, MSPs voted to ban the unlicensed culling of mountain hares and grant them protected species status within Scotland after a petition started by Green MSP Alison Johnstone gathered over 22,000 signatures.

The game was invented by Robert Abbott in 1956, and was first published by Martin Gardner in his Mathematical Games column in Scientific American magazine in June 1959. A revised version appeared in Gardner's July 1977 column. Eleusis is sometimes considered an analogy to the problems of scientific method. It can be compared with the card game Mao, which also has secret rules that can be learned inductively. The games of Penultima and Zendo also feature players attempting to discover inductively a secret rule or rules thought of by a \\"Master\\" or \\"Spectators\\" who declare plays legal or illegal on the basis of the rules. The formalization of Eleusis+Nobel inspired new modes of communication by exchange of logical notes.Jean Sallantin, Christophe Douy, Abdelkader Gouaich, Juan Carlos Martinez, Denis Pierre, Antoine Seilles, Jean-Baptiste Soufron, Jean- Philippe Cointet. A Logical Framework to Annotate Documents in a VirtualAgora, Square of Opposition 07 Rules The game is played by creating a row of cards in sequence. At the start of the game the dealer (known as \\"God\\") invents a secret constraint for how these cards must progress: for example, \\"each card played must be higher than the last, unless the last card was a face cards in which case any numeral card may be played\\". Two decks of cards are shuffled and 14 cards dealt to each player except the dealer. One card is dealt face-up to start the row and a random player chosen to start. On a player's turn they must add one or more cards from their hand to the row, in sequence. The dealer judges this play: if the entire play fits the dealer's rule, the cards are left in place as part of the row. If they are invalid, they are removed from the row and \\"sidelined\\" below the card that they attempted to follow, and the player is dealt a number of penalty cards equal to twice the number of cards they attempted to play that turn. If multiple cards were played this turn and only some were incorrect, the entire play is declared invalid, without the dealer specifying the invalid cards. One player may be the \\"prophet\\". A player who believes they have worked out the rule may become the \\"prophet\\" at the end of their turn, if there is not already a prophet among the players, by placing a black marker on the card they just played. The prophet puts down their hand and skips their turns during their time as prophet. The prophet takes on the role of judging valid and invalid moves: if the dealer catches them making a mistake, the prophet is overthrown and receives five penalty cards (with the player who made the play receiving no penalty cards for that turn, if the play was invalid). An overthrown prophet takes their hand back up, takes all black markers off the row, and becomes a regular player again. If at any time a player thinks they cannot play a legitimate card, they may declare a \\"no play\\", and show their hand to everybody. If the dealer confirms that no cards in that hand can be played, the player discards the hand and draws a new hand four cards smaller. If the player's call was incorrect, the dealer plays the correct card for them and gives the player five penalty cards. A white marker is placed on each tenth card played, and a black marker on each tenth card after a prophet's marker. After the fourth black or white marker is placed, any invalid plays result in that player being eliminated from the game. The game ends when a player empties their hand, or when all players (excluding the prophet, if any) have been eliminated. Players score 1 point for each card in the hand of the player with most cards, minus the number of cards in their own hand. If a player has an empty hand they gain a further 4 points. If there is a prophet at the end of the game, they receive an additional 1 point for each card in the row following their first black marker, and 2 points for each sidelined card following that marker. Eleusis Express In 2006, John Golden developed a streamlined version of the game, intended to assist elementary school teachers in explaining the scientific method to students. It has the following differences: * The game starts with 12 cards in each player's hand, not 14. * The game has no prophet, instead allowing players to openly guess the rule whenever they make a valid play. * A \\"no play\\" hand results in a 1 card penalty if incorrect, or a redrawing of a hand one card smaller if correct. * The game is played until a player empties their hand or makes a correct guess: at that point, each player scores 12 minus the number of cards left in their hand, with a 6-point bonus for correctly guessing the rule and a 3-point bonus for emptying one's hand. The dealer scores the same as the highest-scoring player. Abbott himself considers the variant a \\"great game\\", and refers to it as \\"Eleusis Express\\".

Writing Page's career can be divided into two periods: the first being the 1940s and 1950s, and the second starting with her return to Canada in the 1960s. Her early poems \\"were inward-looking, imaginary biographies,\\" which \\"rely heavily on suggestive imagery and the detailed depiction of concrete situations to express social concerns and transcendental themes ... such poems as 'The Stenographers' and 'The Landlady' focus on isolated individuals who futilely search for meaning and a sense of belonging.

The Arctic hare survives with shortened ears and limbs, a small nose, fat that makes up close to 20% of its body, and a thick coat of fur. It usually digs holes in the ground or under snow to keep warm and to sleep. Arctic hares look like rabbits but have shorter ears, are taller when standing and, unlike rabbits, can thrive in extreme cold. They can travel together with many other hares, sometimes huddling with dozens or more, but are usually found alone, sometimes taking more than one partner. The Arctic hare can run up to . Taxonomy Arctic explorer John Ross described the Arctic hare in 1819. Description The Arctic hare is one of the largest living lagomorphs. Typically, this species measures from long, not counting a tail length of . The body mass of this species is typically between , though large individuals can weigh up to .Burnie D and Wilson DE (Eds.), Animal: The Definitive Visual Guide to the World's Wildlife. DK Adult (2005), Distribution and habitat The Arctic hare is distributed over the northernmost regions of Greenland, the Canadian Arctic islands and Northern Canada, including Ellesmere Island, and farther south in Labrador and Newfoundland. The Arctic hare is well adapted to conditions found in the tundras, plateaus and treeless coasts of this region, including cold weather and frozen precipitation. The Arctic hare may be found at elevations from sea level to 900 m.Small, R., L. Keith, R. Barta. (1991). Dispersion of introduced Arctic hares (Lepus arcticus) on islands off Newfoundland's south coast. Canadian Journal of Zoology 69(10):2618-2623. In Newfoundland and southern Labrador, the Arctic hare changes its coat color, moulting and growing new fur, from brown or grey in the summer to white in the winter, like some other Arctic animals including ermine and ptarmigan, enabling it to remain camouflaged as the environment changes. However, the Arctic hares in the far north of Canada, where summer is very short, remain white all year round. Feeding The Arctic hare is a herbivore, specifically a folivore. Arctic hares feed primarily on woody plants, and willow constitutes 95 percent of their diet year-round. Arctic hares predominantly consume saxifrage, crowberry, and dwarf willow, but can also eat a variety of other foods, including lichens and mosses, blooms, other species' leaves, twigs and roots, mountain sorrel and macroalgae (seaweed). Arctic hare diets are more diverse in summer, but still primarily willow, dryas and grasses. Arctic hares have been reported to occasionally eat meat, including fish and the stomach contents of eviscerated caribou. They eat snow to get water. Reproduction and lifespan Summer coat Hares can have up to eight babies, called leverets. The leverets stay within the mother's home range until they can survive on their own. There is little information on the lifespan of Arctic hares. Some anecdotal evidence suggests they live three to five years in the wild. Arctic hares do not fare well in captivity, living only a year and a half at most. Predators Known predators of the Arctic hare are the Arctic fox (Vulpes lagopus), Red fox (Vulpes vulpes), Wolf (Canis lupus), Mountain lion (Puma concolor), Lynx (Lynx canadensis), Ermine (Mustela erminea), Snowy owl (Bubo scandiacus), Gyrfalcon (Falco rusticolus), Rough- legged hawk (Buteo lagopus) and occasionally humans.Lepus arcticus (Arctic hare), Animal Diversity Web, University of Michigan Museum of Zoology. The Arctic wolf is probably the most successful predator of the Arctic hare, and even young wolves in their first autumn can catch adult hares. Arctic foxes and ermines, which are smaller, typically prey on young hares. Gyrfalcon carry hares to their nests, cutting them in half first; gyrfalcons use hare bones and feet in the structure of their nests on Ellesmere Island, Nunavut. Peregrine falcons (Falco peregrinus) also prey on Arctic hares in the southern end of the hares' range. The Snowy owls mainly targets young hare; the French common name of the species derives from Anglo-Saxon harfang (\\"hare- catcher\\").Ukaliq: the Arctic Hare, Eat and Be Eaten , Canadian Museum of Nature. Four groups of parasites have been known to use Arctic hares as a host: protozoans (Eimeria exigua, E. magna, E. perforans, and E. sculpta); nematodes (including Filaria and Oxyuris ambigua); lice (including Haemodipsus lyriocephalus and H. setoni) and fleas (including Hoplopsyllus glacialis, Euhoplopsyllus glacialis, and Megabothris groenlandicus. Fleas are more common than parasitic worms. Arctic hare footprints on snow.

Little is known about her, and her actions and roles are poorly documented in the historical record, in contrast to those of Akhenaten's first (and chief) royal wife, Nefertiti. Her unusual name suggests that she may originally have been a Mitanni princess.Reeves, C. Nicholas. New Light on Kiya from Texts in the British Museum, p.100 The Journal of Egyptian Archaeology, Vol. 74 (1988) Surviving evidence demonstrates that Kiya was an important figure at Akhenaten's court during the middle years of his reign, when she bore him a daughter.William J. Murnane. Texts from the Amarna Period in Egypt. Edited by E.S. Meltzer. Atlanta: Society of Biblical Literature, 1995. () Page 9, pp 90‚Äì93, pp 210‚Äì211.Aidan Dodson. Amarna Sunset: Nefertiti, Tutankhamun, Ay, Horemheb, and the Egyptian Counter Reformation. The American University in Cairo Press, 2009. () Page 17. She disappears from history a few years before her royal husband's death. In previous years, she was thought to be mother of Tutankhamun, but recent DNA evidence suggests this is unlikely.  Name and titles  The name Kiya itself is cause for debate. It has been suggested that it is a \\"pet\\" form, rather than a full name, and as such could be a contraction of a foreign name, such as the Mitanni name \\"Tadukhipa,\\" referring to the daughter of King Tushratta. Tadukhipa married Amenhotep III at the very end of his reign, and the Amarna Letters indicate that she was of marriageable age at that time.The Amarna Letters. Edited and translated by William L. Moran. Baltimore: The Johns Hopkins University Press, 1992. () Two Mitanni princesses, Gilukhipa and Tadukhipa, are referenced in a series of letters, EA 19-29. In particular, Amarna Letters 27 through 29 confirm that Tadukhipa became one of Akhenaten's wives. Thus some Egyptologists have proposed that Tadukhipa and Kiya might be the same person. However, there is no confirming evidence that Kiya was anything but a native Egyptian.Jacobus Van Dijk, \\"The Noble Lady of Mitanni and Other Royal Favourites of the Eighteenth Dynasty\\" in Essays on Ancient Egypt in Honour of Herman te Velde, Groningen, 1997, pp. 35‚Äì37. In fact, Cyril Aldred proposed that her unusual name is actually a variant of the Ancient Egyptian word for \\"monkey,\\" making it unnecessary to assume a foreign origin for her.Cyril Aldred. Akhenaten, King of Egypt. Thames & Hudson, 1991. () Page 286. In inscriptions, Kiya is given the titles of \\"The Favorite\\" and \\"The Greatly Beloved,\\" but never of \\"Heiress\\" or \\"Great Royal Wife\\", which suggests that she was not of royal Egyptian blood. Her full titles read, \\"The wife and greatly beloved of the King of Upper and Lower Egypt, Living in Truth, Lord of the Two Lands, Neferkheperure Waenre, the Goodly Child of the Living Aten, who shall be living for ever and ever, Kiya.\\" All artifacts relating to Kiya derive from Amarna, Akhenaten's short-lived capital city, or from Tomb KV55 in the Valley of the Kings. She is not attested during the reign of any other pharaoh.  Life  Kiya's existence was unknown until 1959, when her name and titles were noted on a small cosmetic container in the collection of the Metropolitan Museum of Art. It had been bought almost thirty years previously, without provenance, from Egyptologist Howard Carter.Dennis Forbes, \\"The Lady Wearing Large Earrings: Royal Wife Kiya, Nefertiti's Rival\\", KMT. volume 17, number 3 (Fall 2006), p. 28. The British Egyptologists Aidan Dodson and Dyan Hilton wrote: :Kiya is named and depicted on various blocks originating at Amarna, on vases in London and New York, four fragmentary kohl-tubes in Berlin and London, and a wine-jar docket. She may also be depicted by three uninscribed sculptor's studies. Her coffin and canopic jars were taken over for the burial of a king (probably Smenkhkare), which was ultimately discovered in tomb KV55 in the Valley of the Kings. Almost all of Kiya's monuments were usurped for daughters of Akhenaten, making it fairly certain that she was disgraced some time after Year 11 [of Akhenaten].Aidan Dodson & Dyan Hilton, The Complete Royal Families of Ancient Egypt, Thames & Hudson, 2004, p. 155. Akhenaten and his family were based in Thebes for the first four years of his reign, establishing the new capital city at Amarna in Year 5. Kiya is not attested during this early period. Only after the move to Amarna does she emerge through inscriptional evidence as one of Akhenaten's wives. Kiya's name appeared prominently in the temple installation known as the Maru-Aten, at the southern edge of the city, according to epigraphic studies. The inscriptions in the Maru-Aten were eventually recarved to replace the name and titles of Kiya with those of Akhenaten's eldest daughter, Meritaten. One or more \\"sunshades\\" or side- chapels in the city's largest temple to the Aten, the Per-Aten, also originally bore the name of Kiya. These sunshades were later reinscribed for Meritaten and Ankhesenpaaten, the third daughter of Akhenaten. Some of the recarved inscriptions indicate that Kiya had a daughter, whose name is not preserved. Marc Gabolde proposes that Kiya's daughter was Beketaten, who is more often identified as a daughter of Amenhotep III and Tiye.Marc Gabolde. The End of the Amarna Period. Last updated 2009-11-05. (http://www.bbc.co.uk/history/ancient/egyptians/amarna_01.shtml) The most spectacular of Kiya's monuments is a gilded wooden coffin of costly and intricate workmanship that was discovered in Tomb KV55 in the Valley of the Kings. The coffin's footboard contains an Atenist prayer that was originally intended for a woman, but was later revised to a refer to a man ‚Äì with enough grammatical errors to betray the gender of the original speaker.William J. Murnane. Texts from the Amarna Period in Egypt. Edited by E.S. Meltzer. Atlanta: Society of Biblical Literature, 1995. () Page 243. The style of the coffin and the language of its surviving inscriptions place its manufacture in the reign of Akhenaten. Scholarly opinion now makes Kiya its original owner.Cyril Aldred. Akhenaten, King of Egypt. Thames & Hudson, 1991. () Page 205. The richness of this coffin, which is comparable in style to the middle coffin of Tutankhamun,Bell, M.R. \\"An Armchair Excavation of KV 55.\\" JARCE 27 (1990) Pages 98‚Äì99. provides further evidence of Kiya's exalted status at Amarna. Many Egyptologists have tried to produce an explanation for her prominence. Numerous scholarly discussions of Tutankhamun's parentage during the late twentieth century, and the early years of the twenty-first, have mentioned the hypothesis that Kiya was Tutankhamun's mother. If she had indeed borne a male heir to Akhenaten, this distinction might well merit unique honors. However, genetic studies of the Egyptian royal mummies, led by Zahi Hawass and Carsten Pusch, have now established that Tutankhamun's biological mother was KV35YL, the \\"Younger Lady\\" discovered in the mummy cache in the tomb of Amenhotep II.  Disgrace or death?  Kiya disappears from history during the last third of Akhenaten's reign. Her name and images were erased from monuments and replaced by those of Akhenaten's daughters. The exact year of her disappearance is unknown, with recent authorities suggesting dates that range from Year 11 or 12Nicholas Reeves. Akhenaten, Egypt's False Prophet. Thames & Hudson, 2001. (ISBN) Pages 159‚Äì160. to Year 16 of Akhenaten. One of the last datable instances of her name is a wine docket from Amarna that mentions Akhenaten's Year 11, indicating that Kiya's estate produced a vintage in that year. Whether she died, was exiled, or suffered some other misfortune, Egyptologists have often interpreted the erasure of her name as a sign of disgrace. Various scenarios have been advanced to explain Kiya's disappearance. Having suggested that Kiya was the mother of Tutankhamun, Nicholas Reeves writes that \\"it is not beyond the realm of possibility that she fell from grace in a coup engineered by the jealous Nefertiti herself.\\" Nicholas Reeves. \\"The Royal Family.\\" In Pharaohs of the Sun, ed. RE Freed, YJ Markowitz, SH D'Auria. Museum of Fine Arts Boston, 1999. () Pages 91‚Äì92. Having argued that Kiya was Tadukhipa, daughter of the King of Mitanni, Marc Gabolde suggests that she \\"paid the price\\" for a deterioration in the alliance between Egypt and Mitanni and was sent back home. It is uncertain whether Kiya ever used the rich funerary equipment that was prepared against her death. If her disappearance resulted from disgrace or exile, the answer would be no. On the other hand, if she died in good standing with Akhenaten, she probably would have received a lavish burial appropriate to her station. In the latter case, a likely site for her interment would be the Amarna Royal Tomb, which includes a suite of three chambers evidently used to house female members of Akhenaten's family.Aidan Dodson. Amarna Sunset: Nefertiti, Tutankhamun, Ay, Horemheb, and the Egyptian Counter Reformation. The American University in Cairo Press, 2009. () Pages 18‚Äì24. At least two and possibly as many as three different individuals were interred in this suite, including Akhenaten's daughter Meketaten, the only one whose name survives. Two of the chambers originally included painted plaster reliefs depicting Akhenaten, Nefertiti, certain of their daughters, and other mourners lamenting the deceased. Some Egyptologists have suggested that one of these scenes of mourning refers to Kiya, although no specific evidence supports this claim.Nicholas Reeves. The Complete Tutankhamun. Thames & Hudson, 2000. () Page 24. Further, the conventional interpretation of the mourning scenes is that they represent the death in childbirth of the deceasedCyril Aldred. Akhenaten, King of Egypt. Thames & Hudson, 1991. () Page 30-32 (although this view has recently been challenged).Jacobus van Dijk. \\"The Death of Meketaten,\\" in Causing His Name To Live. Studies in Egyptian Epigraphy and History in Memory of William J. Murnane. Edited by Peter J. Brand and Louise Cooper. - Culture & History of the Ancient Near East, Vol. 37 (Leiden/Boston, Brill, 2009), 83‚Äì88. The conventional interpretation has encouraged speculation that Kiya died bearing Akhenaten a child, but again, no clear-cut evidence is available.  The KV35 \\"Younger Lady\\" mummy  Some have speculated that the mummy known as The Younger Lady, discovered in KV35, might be that of Kiya. According to Joann Fletcher (who controversially identified the mummy as Nefertiti) a Nubian- style wig was found near the mummy. This style was also associated with Kiya.Rob Goldberg, \\"Nefertiti and the Lost Dynasty,\\" National Geographic Channel, 2007. DNA test results published in February 2010 have shown conclusively that the Younger Lady mummy was the mother of Tutankhamun, and by extension a wife of Akhenaten. The results also show that she was a full sister to her husband, and that they were both the children of Amenhotep III and Queen Tiye. This family relationship rules out the possibility that the Younger Lady was Kiya, because no known artifact accords Kiya the title or attribute \\"god's daughter.\\" For similar reasons Nefertiti is also ruled out. The report concludes that either Nebetah or Beketaten, younger daughters of Amenhotep III who are not known to have married their father, are the most likely candidates for the identity of the Younger Lady mummy.

Many different war plans were routinely prepared by mid-level officers primarily as training exercises in how to calculate the logistical and manpower requirements of fighting a war, and War Plan Red outlined those steps necessary to defend against any attempted invasion of the United States from British forces. It further discussed fighting a two-front war with both Japan and the United Kingdom simultaneously (as envisioned in War Plan Red-Orange). War Plan Red was developed by the War Department after the 1927 Geneva Naval Conference and approved in May 1930 by Secretary of War Patrick J. Hurley and Secretary of the Navy Charles Francis Adams III and updated in 1934‚Äì35. It was a routine hypothetical exercise and did not require presidential or congressional approval. Only the Congress has the power to declare war.John Major, \\"War Plan Red: The American Plan for War with Britain,\\" Historian (1998) 58#1 pp 12‚Äì15. In 1939, on the outbreak of World War II, a decision was taken that no further planning was required but for the plan to be retained.June 15, 1939: Declassified Letter \\"Joint board to Secretary of Navy\\" War Plan Red was not declassified until 1974. The war plan outlined actions that would be necessary if, for any reason, the US and Britain went to war with each other. The plan assumed that the British would initially have the upper hand by virtue of the strength of the Royal Navy. The plan further assumed that Britain would probably use its base in Canada as a springboard from which to initiate an invasion of the contiguous United States. The assumption was taken that at first, the US would fight a defensive battle against invading British forces, but the US would eventually defeat the British by blockading Canada‚Äôs ports and cutting off its food supplies. It is debated whether this would have been successful however and if the plan would have ultimately resulted in a stalemate. That was the strategy employed by Britain against the US in the War of 1812. Outline The Maritimes, in eastern Canada, were the primary areas of strategic importance for the plan. War Plan Red first set out a description of Canada's geography, military resources, and transportation and went on to evaluate a series of possible pre-emptive American campaigns to invade Canada in several areas and occupy key ports and railways before British troops could provide reinforcement to the Canadians‚Äîthe assumption being that Britain would use Canada as a staging point. The idea was that US attacks on Canada would prevent Britain from using Canadian resources, ports, or airbases. A key move was a joint US Army-Navy attack to capture the port city of Halifax, cutting off the Canadians from their British allies. Their next objective was to \\"seize Canadian Power Plants near Niagara Falls.\\" This was to be followed by a full-scale invasion on three fronts: from Vermont to take Montreal and Quebec, from North Dakota to take over the railhead at Winnipeg, and from the Midwest to capture the strategic nickel mines of Ontario. In parallel, the US Navy was to seize the Great Lakes and blockade Canada's Atlantic and Pacific ports. =Zones of operation= The main zones of operation discussed in the plan are: * Nova Scotia and New Brunswick: ** Occupying Halifax would deny the Royal Navy a major base and cut links between Britain and Canada. ** The plan considers several land and sea options for the attack and concludes that a landing at St. Margarets Bay, then an undeveloped bay near Halifax, would be superior to a direct assault via the longer overland route. ** Failing to take Halifax, the US could occupy New Brunswick by land to cut Nova Scotia off from the rest of Canada at the key railway junction in Moncton. * Quebec and the valley of the Saint Lawrence River: ** Occupying Montreal and Quebec City would cut the remainder of Canada off from the Eastern seaboard, preventing the movement of troops and resources in both directions. ** The routes from northern New York to Montreal and from Vermont to Quebec are both found satisfactory for an offensive, with Quebec being the more critical target. * Ontario and the Great Lakes area: ** Occupying this region gains control of Toronto and most of Canada's industry and prevent Britain and Canada from using it for air or land attacks against the US industrial heartland in the Midwest. ** The plan proposes simultaneous offensives from Buffalo across the Niagara River, from Detroit across the Detroit River into Windsor, and from Sault Ste. Marie across the St. Mary's River into Sudbury. Controlling the Great Lakes for US transport is considered logistically necessary for a continued invasion. * Winnipeg ** Winnipeg is a central nexus of the Canadian rail system for connecting the country. ** The plan saw no major obstacles to an offensive from Grand Forks, North Dakota, to Winnipeg. * Vancouver and Victoria: ** Although Vancouver's distance from Europe reduces its importance, occupying it would deny Britain a naval base and cut Canada off from the Pacific Ocean. ** Vancouver could be easily attacked overland from Bellingham, Washington, and Vancouver Island could be attacked by sea from Port Angeles, Washington. ** The British Columbia port Prince Rupert has a rail connection to the rest of Canada, but a naval blockade is viewed as easy if Vancouver was taken. =No attacks outside Western Hemisphere= Unlike the Rainbow Five plan, War Plan Red did not envision striking outside the Western Hemisphere. Its authors saw conquering Canada as the best way to attack the British Empire and believed that doing so would cause Britain to negotiate for peace. A problem with the plan was that it did not discuss how to attack the Empire if Canada declared its neutrality, which the authors believed was likely (the plan advised against accepting such a declaration without permission to occupy Canadian ports and some land until the war ended). The U.S. decided it should focus on the North American and Atlantic theater of operations first while leaving its Pacific outposts of the Philippines, Guam, and American Samoa alone to fend off any British, Australian, and New Zealand attacks during the early stages of the conflict. Based on extensive war games conducted at the Naval War College, the plan rejected attacking British shipping or attempting to destroy the British fleet. The main American fleet would instead stay in the western North Atlantic to block British‚ÄìCanadian traffic. The Navy would wait for a good opportunity to engage the British fleet and, if successful, would then attack British trade and colonies in the Western Hemisphere. In 1935, War Plan Red was updated and specified which roads to use in the invasion. \\"The best practicable route to Vancouver is via Route 99.\\" American war planners had no thoughts of returning captured British territory: \\"The policy will be to prepare the provinces and territories of CRIMSON and RED to become states and territories of the BLUE union upon the declaration of peace.\\" The planners feared that should they lose the war with Britain, America would be forced to relinquish its territories to the victors, such as losing Alaska to Canada as part of the peace treaty: \\"It is probable that, in case RED should be successful in the war, CRIMSON will demand that Alaska be awarded to her.\\"Steven T. Ross, American War Plans, 1890-1939, 78, 145-152, 178, 180-181. British Empire strategy for war against the United States The British military never prepared a formal plan for war with the United States during the first half of the 20th century. For instance, the government of David Lloyd George in 1919 restricted the Royal Navy from building more ships to compete with American naval growth and thereby preventing the plan's development. Like their American counterparts, most British military officers viewed cooperation with the United States as the best way to maintain world peace due to the shared culture, language, and goals, although they feared that attempts to regulate trade during a war with another nation might force a war with America. The British military generally believed that if war did occur, they could transport troops to Canada if asked, but nonetheless saw it as impossible to defend Canada against the much larger United States, so did not plan to render aid, as Canada's loss would not be fatal to Britain. A full invasion of the United States was unrealistic and a naval blockade would be too slow. The Royal Navy could not use a defensive strategy of waiting for the American fleet to cross the Atlantic because Imperial trade would be left too vulnerable. Royal Navy officers believed that Britain was vulnerable to a supply blockade and that if a larger American fleet appeared near the British Isles, the Isles may quickly surrender. The officers planned to, instead, attack the American fleet from a Western Hemisphere base, likely Bermuda, while other ships based in Canada and the West Indies would attack American shipping and protect Imperial trade. The British would also bombard coastal bases and make small amphibious assaults. India and Australia would help capture Manila to prevent American attacks on British trade in Asia and perhaps a conquest of Hong Kong. The officers hoped that such acts would result in a stalemate making continued war unpopular in the United States, followed by a negotiated peace. Canadian military officer Lieutenant Colonel James \\"Buster\\" Sutherland Brown developed an earlier counterpart to War Plan Red, Defence Scheme No. 1, on April 12, 1921. Maintaining that the best defense was a good offense, \\"Buster\\" Brown planned for rapid deployment of flying columns to occupy Seattle, Great Falls, Minneapolis, and Albany. With little hope of holding the objectives, the actual idea was to divert American troops to the flanks and away from Canada, hopefully long enough for British and Commonwealth allies to arrive with reinforcements. Defense Scheme No. 1 was terminated by Chief of the General Staff Andrew McNaughton in 1928, two years before the approval of War Plan Red.

The objective of the game is to mount profitable expeditions to one or more of the five lost cities (the Himalayas, the Brazilian Rain Forest, the Desert Sands, the Ancient Volcanos and Neptune's Realm). The game was originally intended as a 2-player game, but rule variants have been contributed by fans to allow 1 or 2 further players, causing Reiner Knizia himself to later provide semi-official 4-player rules.  Summary  Lost Cities is a fast-moving game, with players playing or discarding, and then replacing, a single card each turn. Cards represent progress on one of the five color-coded expeditions. Players must decide, during the course of the game, how many of these expeditions to actually embark upon. Card-play rules are quite straightforward, but because players can only move forward on an expedition (by playing cards which are higher- numbered than those already played), making the right choice in a given game situation can be quite difficult. An expedition that has been started will earn points according to how much progress has been made when the game ends, and after three rounds, the player with the highest total score wins the game. Each expedition that is started but not thoroughly charted incurs a negative point penalty (investment costs). A game of Lost Cities Interaction between players is indirect, in that one cannot directly impact another player's expeditions. However, since players can draw from the common discard piles, they are free to make use of opposing discards. Additionally, since the available cards for a given expedition are finite, progress made by an opponent in a given color can lead to difficulty making progress in that same color. The game's board, while designed to supplement the theme, is optional and consists only of simple marked areas where players place discards. If Lost Cities had four expeditions instead of five, it could be played with a standard deck of playing cards. When doing so, the face cards would represent investment cards, with numbered cards two through ten serving as the expedition progress cards. =Expedition 6: The Lost Expedition= At GenCon 2016, The Lost Cities: Sixth Expedition promo pack was given away. It contains a set of grey cards that are added to the base game as an additional expedition. The sixth expedition has the same rules as the other five. In 2018, some newer international versions of Lost Cities are expected to also include Expedition 6 as well as two-sided boards. One side with five expeditions, the other side with six.  Awards  * Won the 2000 International Gamers Award.  Lost Cities: The Board Game  The 2008 game Keltis was re-themed and published in the USA as Lost Cities: The Board Game. The game supports up to four players and is a more complex version of the original card game.  Xbox Live Arcade  Lost Cities was published by Sierra Online for the Xbox Live Arcade platform on April 23, 2008. The title supports both online play against other humans and solo play against computer- controlled opponents. It was delisted on 20 February 2009 after a merger between Activision and Vivendi. It is currently not available for purchase.

Professional Career Pekka Himanen studied philosophy (and computer science as a minor) at the University of Helsinki, under professor Esa Saarinen. In 1994, with his thesis on the philosophy of religion, The challenge of Bertrand Russell, he received his Ph.D. in philosophy from the same university, breaking the record as the youngest person to obtain a PhD in Finland, following other record-breaking young PhDs supervised by Saarinen. He has done research work in Finland (University of Helsinki), the United Kingdom, and the United States (Stanford University, University of California, Berkeley). At UC Berkeley, Himanen directed the Berkeley Center for the Information Society, a research group under Berkeley's International Computer Science Institute. The Center was active from September 2002 until 2005 . Himanen has been a counselor to the president of Finland, Finnish government (including the Ministry of Education) and Finnish parliament, in the field of information society. He was a Visiting Professor at the Oxford Internet Institute (based at Oxford University) from September 2005 to July 2006. Himanen had multiple appointments as a fixed-term part-time professor at Helsinki School of Art and Design (now part of Aalto University as Aalto University School of Arts, Design and Architecture) from 2008 until 2014. Writings In his book HimEros written as a dialogue, Socrates‚Äô wife Xanthippe relates to the Helsinkian what happened to Socrates in Hades, how Socrates decided to escape from Hades and go to study philosophy at the University of Helsinki, and how he was arrested, sentenced to death and executed as a result of a three-day conversation with the philosophers of the University. Xanthippe also transmits Socrates‚Äô dialogue with the university teachers of philosophy Cyborg (Stephen Hawking), Pope (John Paul II), Unabomber (Theodore Kaczynski) and Madonna (Madonna Ciccone). In The Hacker Ethic and the Spirit of the Information Age, Himanen is trying to understand the core of informationalism, the post-industrialist paradigm, extending the ideas of Manuel Castells' Information Age. As an alternative to the industrial-capitalist protestant work ethic he proposes a hacker ethic as something like a cyber communitarianism. The structure of the information society is a web, which in contemporary business world manifests itself, for instance, in dynamic outsourcing and even cooperation with one's competitors. The \\"knots\\" of such a web get activated according to the needs and opportunities. Global Dignity In 2006, he established Global Dignity with Haakon, Crown Prince of Norway and John Hope Bryant. Global Dignity is an independent, non-political organization that promotes the universal right of every human being to lead a dignified life. Criticism and negative publicity Two Finnish journalists, Anu Silfverberg and Johanna Vehkoo, published a critical investigation of Himanen's research funding from public sources, the outcomes of his research, as well as his use of the title of \\"professor\\" without holding a professorship. The investigation followed the critical reception of Himanen's recent research reports on information society done under contract with the Finnish government, and reports of disorderly conduct in public places while intoxicated.

His radio program is aired each weekday across the United States and Canada on Sirius XM Radio and globally online. Signorile was editor-at-large for HuffPost from 2011 until 2019. Signorile is a political liberal, and covers a wide variety of political and cultural issues. Signorile is noted for his various books and articles on gay and lesbian politics, and is an outspoken supporter of gay rights. Signorile's seminal 1993 book Queer in America: Sex, The Media, and the Closets of Power explored the negative effects of the LGBT closet, and provided one of the first intellectual justifications for the practice of outing public officials, influencing the debate and treatment of the issue among journalists from that point on. In 1992 Newsweek listed him as one of America's \\"100 Cultural Elite,\\"Alter, Jonathan. 1992. \\"The Cultural Elite.\\" Newsweek, October 5: 30‚Äì34 and he is included as #100 in the 2002 book, The Gay 100: A Ranking of the Most Influential Gay Men and Lesbians, Past and Present. In August 2011, Signorile was inducted into the National Lesbian and Gay Journalists Association LGBT Journalist Hall of Fame.\\"Journalists Honored for Work in Media, Activism,\\" The Advocate, August 1, 2011 In November 2012, Signorile was included in the Out magazine annual Out 100.Out 100 2012, \\"Out 100: Michelangelo Signorile,\\" Out, December 2012. In April 2015, Signorile's fifth book, It's Not Over: Getting Beyond Tolerance, Defeating Homophobia and Winning True Equality, was published.http://www.itsnotoverthebook.com  Early years  Signorile was born in Brooklyn, New York and spent his early childhood in the 1960s and 1970s in Brooklyn and Staten Island. He attended the S. I. Newhouse School of Public Communications at Syracuse University, where he majored in journalism. It was in those years that he came to realize his own homosexuality, but remained closeted to many friends and to family. In the mid 1980s, shortly after graduating from college, Signorile moved to Manhattan. Among his first jobs, he worked for an entertainment public relations firm that specialized in \\"column-planting\\", a term for getting clients into New York City's gossip columns, such as Page Six in the New York Post and Liz Smith, then at the New York Daily News. This required collecting and trading in gossip, often about celebrities' private lives. Later, he became a gossip columnist himself. It was in that world, as Signorile describes in his book Queer in America, where he saw a double standard regarding how the media glamorized heterosexuality among celebrities while covering up homosexuality. But Signorile was not political at the time. He was somewhat open about his own homosexuality by that time, but he had not looked at it in the broader context of politics and culture in America. His political awakening came as the AIDS epidemic expanded in the late 1980s and more friends were getting sick and dying.  Activism  Proposition 8 protest he co-organized in New York City in November 2008.NYC Protest and Civil Rights March Opposing Proposition 8, Andy Towle, Towelroad.com, November 13, 2008; accessed November 14, 2008. In his book Queer in America and in numerous articles and interviews, Signorile has discussed how he began to see that many in the media, among his circles as well, were either sensationalizing AIDS in the 1980s or running away from it. He also began to believe the government was negligent in the face of the epidemic. Signorile became a gay activist in 1988, after attending a meeting of the controversial grass roots protest group, ACT UP, in New York. Within days of the meeting he was arrested at a protest at St. Peter's Evangelical Lutheran Church at the Citigroup Center, where the Vatican's envoy and the author of much of the Vatican's recent positions against homosexuality, gay rights and the use of condoms to prevent the spread of HIV, Cardinal Joseph Ratzinger, was to give a major speech. (Ratzinger would go on to become Pope Benedict XVI, succeeding Pope John Paul II upon his death in April 2005.) Signorile has explained that he went to the event solely to watch the protesters who were planning on standing up among the attendees and letting their voices be heard. But he became filled with rage while hearing Ratzinger speak, thinking about the homophobia he'd experienced as a child and the Catholic Church's decrees. (He was raised as a Roman Catholic.) \\"Suddenly,\\" Signorile wrote in Queer in America about the protest, \\"I jumped up on one of the marble platforms, and looking down, I addressed the entire congregation in the loudest voice I could. My voice rang out as if it were amplified. I pointed at Ratzinger and shouted, 'He is no man of God!' The shocked faces of the assembled Catholics turned to the back of the room to look at me as I continued: 'He is no man of God. He is the devil!'\\" Signorile was pulled down, handcuffed, and carted off by the police. Signorile soon became the chair of the media committee of ACT UP, organizing publicity for major, theatrical AIDS activist protests of the time, and taking on the Food and Drug Administration, the National Institutes of Health, New York's City Hall and other government agencies in the media, criticizing them for what AIDS activists saw as their foot-dragging while people were dying. Though controversial, ACT UP and its tactics have been credited with bringing more attention to AIDS among politicians and the media, and speeding the development and approval of HIV drugs in the 1990s. Signorile also was a co-founding member, along with three other ACT UP members, of the in-your-face activist group Queer Nation. In May 2017, Signorile was criticized for an article that appeared on the Huffington Post. In the piece, he attacked Donald Trump and the Republican legislators supporting his agenda, stating that no Republican congressman \\"should be able to sit down for a nice, quiet lunch or dinner in a Washington, DC eatery or even in their own homes\\", and \\"should be hounded by protestors everywhere, especially in public ‚Äï in restaurants, in shopping centers, in their districts, and yes, on the public property outside their homes and apartments\\".http://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/protesting-donald-trump- comey_us_591313d1e4b050bdca61270c The outing controversy Signorile has been considered a pioneer of outing (though he believes the discussion has often been distorted by the media, and he opposes using a violent, active verb to define the phenomenon).Signorile, Michelangelo Queer in America, 1993. Chapter 5, \\"Outing, Part I,\\" pg. 70 Signorile has argued in favor of outing from a journalistic perspective, calling for the \\"equalization\\" of reporting on gay and straight public figures. He has argued that the homosexuality of public figures‚Äîand only public figures‚Äîshould be reported on when relevant., Chapter 5, \\"Outing Part I,\\" pg. 69 Signorile was a co-founding editor of the gay magazine OutWeek, which launched in June 1989, and which was quickly at the center of heated debates inside and outside the gay community, including controversies over outing. Signorile became the features editor at OutWeek, and eventually stopped working within ACT UP and Queer Nation; though, like most of the staff of OutWeek, maintained deep ties to both groups. Signorile saw his role at OutWeek as one of taking on the media and the entertainment industry. From the start of the magazine he wrote a weekly column called \\"Gossip Watch,\\" which was just that‚Äîa watch of the gossip columns. He began writing about the media's double standard in reporting on gay and straight public figures, and how he believed it made gays invisible in the midst of the health crisis. Among those whom Signorile outed at that time included Hollywood producer David Geffen (who has long since acknowledged that he is gay). Geffen, as a record producer, was promoting Guns N' Roses, a rock group which had been attacked for antigay lyrics (\\"...faggots...spread some fuckin' disease\\"Lyrics from Gus-N-Roses One in a Million) and other performers, such as comedian Andrew Dice Clay, whose comedy routines in the late 1980s were seen by many as homophobic and misogynistic.Queer in America, pg. 304 and Peter Cunningham bio of Clay. Clay had said in a 1984 stand-up act that in Hollywood they have \\"herpes, AIDS and fag-itis.\\" Clay has also mocked pleas for AIDS funding (\\"get a job, buttfucka\\"), and used antigay slurs; \\"they don't know if they want to be called gays, homosexuals, fairies,\\" he has said. \\"I call them cocksuckers.\\" Signorile saw it as relevant to discuss Geffen's closeted homosexuality in that context. Signorile also outed the gossip columnist Liz Smith (who also eventually acknowledged her bisexuality), whom he maintained helped celebrities and others to present themselves as heterosexual when they were in fact gay. The media and celebrity culture that Signorile vilified took notice of his work. The chic fashion industry bible, W magazine, put OutWeek on the \\"In\\" list, calling it a \\"must-read\\" because of its mix of \\"culture, politics and vicious gossip\\" (Queer in America, p. 73), and Signorile would eventually be profiled in New York Magazine and in The New York Times. Signorile was both praised and attacked for his column. He was called \\"one of the greater contemporary gay heroes,\\" while his work was also called \\"revolting, infantile, cheap name-calling\\" (Johansson & Percy, p. 183). New York Post columnist Amy Pagnozzi compared him to the right-wing, anti- communist 1950s senator, Joseph McCarthy, in a column headlined \\"Magazine Drags Gays Out of the Closet\\" (Queer in America, p. 73). It was Time that coined the term \\"outing\\" at that time, something Signorile has always contended was a biased term. He saw what he was doing as simply \\"reporting.\\"Queer in America, Chapter 5, \\"Outing Part 1,\\" pg. 71 The outing controversy became much larger in March 1990, when Signorile wrote a cover story for OutWeek revealing the homosexuality of the publishing tycoon Malcolm Forbes within weeks of his death, headlined \\"The Other Side of Malcolm Forbes.\\"Signorile, Michelangelo (March 18, 1990), \\"The Other Side of Malcolm Forbes\\", Outweek (38): 40‚Äì45. In a subsequent article in The Village Voice, Signorile charged a media cover-up of his Forbes story, claiming that various news outlets were going to report on it, but later decided against it. Eventually, over a period of months, the story was reported in several news outlets, including the Los Angeles Times, but The New York Times still refused to name Forbes, only referring to him as \\"a recently deceased businessman\\" who was outed. (It wasn't until five years later, during coverage of Forbes' son Steve's run for the Republican nomination for president in 1996, that the Times reported on Malcolm Forbes' gay life.)Bumiller, Elisabeth 1996, The New York Times: In Political Quest, Forbes Runs in Shadow of Father. \\"Mr.Forbes had to contend at the same time with the first published reports in the gay press of his father's homosexuality. His parents were divorced in 1985, and friends say Mr. Forbes did not discuss his father's life with them. But certainly in the last five years of his life, Malcolm Forbes became increasingly indiscreet...\\" OutWeek folded in June 1991. Signorile joined The Advocate with a cover story several months later that put him at the center of a firestorm over gays in the military as well as outing: he outed Assistant Secretary of Defense for Public Affairs Pete WilliamsMiller, Stephen, FAIR, 1991. Outings and Innings: Media and the Closet. (Williams has since gone on to become a television journalist for NBC News). The outing caused Secretary of Defense Dick Cheney to call the gay ban \\"an old chestnut\\" during an interview with Sam Donaldson on ABC, while then presidential candidate Bill Clinton, citing the outing, promised at a gay fundraiser to overturn the ban if he were elected president.Queer in America, Chapter 8, \\"Outing, Part II,\\" pg. 161 and also noted in March 2010 Advocate column  Gay culture debates  Signorile wrote columns and feature stories for The Advocate for several years, including the groundbreaking two-part cover story \\"Out at The New York Times\\"‚Äîin which the paper's gay and lesbian staffers, its top editors and its then-new publisher, Arthur Ochs Sulzberger, Jr., spoke for the first time, to Signorile, about years of homophobia at the paper of record and how they were charting a new course.Gross, Larry & Woods, James (1999) \\"The Columbia Reader on Lesbians & Gay Men in Media, Society, and Politics\\" Full article reprinted, Pg. 376 In 1994, Signorile left the Advocate for the then new glossy, Out magazine, which was founded by his friend and OutWeek colleague Michael Goff and former OutWeek editor Sarah Pettit.Sarah Pettit, 36, NY Times Obituary 2003 In 1995 Signorile published his second book, Outing Yourself, a 14-step program for coming out as gay or lesbian. Signorile and Linda Simpson at Michael Musto's Village Voice 25th-anniversary party. At that time, as an Out magazine columnist and editor-at-large, Signorile soon was at the center of often-heated debates among gay activists, sexual liberationists and HIV prevention experts about gay male sexual culture and the prevalence of unsafe sex and HIV transmission. Signorile wrote a column for Out that sparked much discussion, titled \\"Unsafe Like Me,\\" in which he addressed the issue by admitting to have slipped up himself, having had an incident of unprotected sex, and discussed what may have led someone like him‚Äîa prominent AIDS activist, immersed in the issues of prevention‚Äîto have such a lapse. The column was adapted to the op-ed page of The New York Times and inspired a CBS \\"60 Minutes\\" treatment of the issue in which Signorile was profiled. Signorile followed up that column with several others that focused on what he saw as some unhealthy aspects of gay culture that contributed to low self-esteem and risk-taking. This eventually grew into his 1997 bestseller Life Outside: The Signorile Report on Gay Men: Sex, Drugs, Muscles and the Passages of Life, which was a finalist for the New York Public Library Book Award for Excellence in Journalism. The columns and the book created controversy among some activists; Signorile was criticized by the group Sex Panic! which believed that he and other writers had inspired government crack-downs on gay sex through their writings. Many other commentators and activists disagreed with Signorile's critics, and fierce debates broke out in both gay and mainstream media.Crain, Caleb. Lingua Franca 1997: Pleasure Principles: Queer Theorists and Gay Journalists Wrestle Over the Politics of Sex Signorile also inspired much discussion and debate with pieces in Out on pro-life gays, animals rights vs. medical research, gay marriage and high-profile antigay hate crimes. In August 1998, Signorile left Out magazine abruptly in a disagreement with the new editor James Collard. Former Out editor and co-founder, the late Sarah Pettit, a long-time colleague of Signorile's who was also an editor at OutWeek, had been ousted from Out that year in a shake up (Michael Goff had been pushed out earlier) in which she had charged sex discrimination. The new editor, from the UK, had been a promoter of the \\"post-gay\\" sensibility, which seemed to eschew activism. According to Signorile, speaking to gay journalist Rex Wockner, Collard wanted him to tone down his writing. \\"We had a heated discussion and he insulted my sensibilities and it made me so angry I threw water in his face,\\" Signorile told Wockner. \\"They did not want me to write biting commentary and opinion. They wanted me to do more feature-driven work and I refused to do that because my column in Out has always been a space where I could do commentary, political analysis, features, whatever I wanted. I think it's important to have commentary and solidly researched journalism in the same forum.\\"  The radio years  Several months after leaving Out, Signorile joined The Advocate once again, in December 1998, as a columnist and editor-at-large; his first article was a cover piece taking on the notion of a \\"post-gay' society as espoused by Out editor Collard.Lehman, Susan, Salon, Dec. 24, 1998: \\"Out's Liquid Lunch\\" & Signorile, Michelangelo, The Advocate, Jan 19, 1999: \\"What Happened to Gay?\\" (Within a year after Collard took the post and six months after Signorile left Out, Collard left Out amid reports of a drop in circulation and negative response of a focus group to the magazine.)Swanson, Carl, New York Observer, February 14, 1999. In 2000, Signorile left The Advocate again, and became a columnist for global Internet site Gay.com, which had just merged with the pioneering LGBT site PlanetOut.com. Signorile traveled around the U.S. and around the world, writing online columns. He covered the controversy surrounding the Millennium March on Washington for LGBT Rights, which divided many in the community regarding its time and purpose and at which a theft occurred at the festival. Signorile reported from Australia and New Zealand, where his partner had taken a position as a professor, and reported on World Pride in Rome in 2000, where activists butted heads with the Vatican, which tried to get the event canceled. During that time Signorile also pioneered Internet radio, webcasting a weekly show on GAYBC.com beginning in 2000, covering the global LGBT community. In an interview, he has described a machine called a \\"vector\\" that he would plug into a phone outlet and which allowed him to webcast live via Gaybc's studios in Seattle.(Media Bistro Q & A with Signorile 2002) In April 2003, Signorile began hosting a radio program, The Michelangelo Signorile Show, on Sirius XM Radio's OutQ each weekday 2 to 6 p.m. Eastern Time. OutQ, as the only 24/7 LGBT radio channel, broke new ground and Signorile's interviews and monologues often made news. After a little over 10 years, on July 23, 2013, he moved to the newly launched SiriusXM Progress (channel 127) from 3 to 6 p.m. Eastern Time. The show airs on satellite radio across North America and is streamed worldwide on the Internet and to the Android, BlackBerry, and iOS (iPad, iPhone, iPod Touch) handheld devices to over 25 million Sirius XM subscribers.Sirius XM Radio Surpasses 25 Million Subscribers, Raises Full-Year Target Hollywood Reporter, July 9, 2013 Signorile interviews politicians, activists, journalists, authors and other public figures, analyzes news and cultural events, and takes calls from listeners from coast-to-coast. Signorile's show is one of the highest rated programs on the Sirius XM network with an average daily listenership of more than 8.5 million households. Often, Signorile brings on those who are on America's right-wing or are opponents of gay rights, with whom he engages in energetic debates. He is also editor-at-large for The Huffington Post Queer Voices where he blogs opinion pieces and interviews public figures. Signorile has been an editor-at-large and columnist for The Advocate, and an editor-at- large and a columnist for Out magazine. He has written for many newspapers and magazines, including The New York Times, USA Today, and Los Angeles Times, and has appeared on many American television news programs, including Larry King Live, Today and Good Morning America.

In particular, Signorile has advocated that gay Americans come out, and has talked about the deleterious effects of the closet both on the closeted individual and on society as a whole. Signorile has been a long-time champion of the right to same-sex marriage. Signorile and much of his work over the years were featured prominently in the film Outrage, directed by acclaimed documentary filmmaker Kirby Dick and which focused on closeted antigay politicians, making a case for why media should report on their sexual orientation.

Following the Mahavamsa, places Buddhaghosa's arrival as coming during the reign of King Mahanama, between 412 and 434 CE. He worked in the Great Monastery (MahƒÅvihƒÅra) at AnurƒÅdhapura, Sri Lanka and saw himself as being part of the VibhajjavƒÅda school and in the lineage of the Sinhalese MahƒÅvihƒÅra.Gethin, Rupert, Was Buddhaghosa a TheravƒÅdin? Buddhist Identity in the Pali Commentariesand Chronicles, 2012. His best-known work is the Visuddhimagga (\\"Path of Purification\\"), a comprehensive summary of older Sinhala commentaries on Theravada teachings and practices. According to Sarah Shaw, in Theravada this systematic work is \\"the principal text on the subject of meditation.\\" The interpretations provided by Buddhaghosa have generally constituted the orthodox understanding of Theravada scriptures since at least the 12th century CE. He is generally recognized by both Western scholars and Theravadins as the most important philosopher and commentator of the Theravada, but is also criticised for his departures from the canonical texts.  Name  The name Buddhaghosa means \\"Voice of the Buddha\\" (Buddha+ghosa) in Pali,Rhys Davids & Stede, 1921-25, Pali-English Dictionary, Pali Text Society. the language in which Buddhaghosa composed. In Sanskrit, the name would be spelled Buddhagho·π£a (Devanagari ‡§¨‡•Å‡§¶‡•ç‡§ß‡§ò‡•ã‡§∑), but there is no retroflex ·π£ sound in Pali, and the name is not found in Sanskrit works. Biography Limited reliable information is available about the life of Buddhaghosa. Three primary sources of information exist: short prologues and epilogues attached to Buddhaghosa's works; details of his life recorded in the Mahavamsa, a Sri Lankan chronicle; and a later biographical work called the Buddhaghosuppatti. A few other sources discuss the life of Buddhaghosa, but do not appear to add any reliable material. The biographical excerpts attached to works attributed to Buddhaghosa reveal relatively few details of his life, but were presumably added at the time of his actual composition. Largely identical in form, these short excerpts describe Buddhaghosa as having come to Sri Lanka from India and settled in Anuradhapura. Besides this information, they provide only short lists of teachers, supporters, and associates of Buddhaghosa, whose names are not generally to be found elsewhere for comparison. The Mahavamsa records that Buddhaghosa was born into a Brahmin family in the kingdom of Magadha. He is said to have been born near Bodh Gaya, and to have been a master of the Vedas, traveling through India engaging in philosophical debates. Only upon encountering a Buddhist monk named Revata was Buddhaghosa bested in debate, first being defeated in a dispute over the meaning of a Vedic doctrine and then being confounded by the presentation of a teaching from the Abhidhamma. Impressed, Buddhaghosa became a bhikkhu (Buddhist monk) and undertook the study of the Tipi·π≠aka and its commentaries. On finding a text for which the commentary had been lost in India, Buddhaghosa determined to travel to Sri Lanka to study a Sinhala commentary that was believed to have been preserved. In Sri Lanka, Buddhaghosa began to study what was apparently a very large volume of Sinhala commentarial texts that had been assembled and preserved by the monks of the Anuradhapura Maha Viharaya. Buddhaghosa sought permission to synthesize the assembled Sinhala-language commentaries into a comprehensive single commentary composed in Pali. Traditional accounts hold that the elder monks sought to first test Buddhaghosa's knowledge by assigning him the task of elaborating the doctrine regarding two verses of the suttas; Buddhaghosa replied by composing the Visuddhimagga. His abilities were further tested when deities intervened and hid the text of his book, twice forcing him to recreate it from scratch. When the three texts were found to completely summarize all of the Tipi·π≠aka and match in every respect, the monks acceded to his request and provided Buddhaghosa with the full body of their commentaries. Buddhaghosa went on to write commentaries on most of the other major books of the Pali Canon, with his works becoming the definitive Theravadin interpretation of the scriptures. Having synthesized or translated the whole of the Sinhala commentary preserved at the Anuradhapura Maha Viharaya, Buddhaghosa reportedly returned to India, making a pilgrimage to Bodh Gaya to pay his respects to the Bodhi Tree. The details of the Mahavamsa account cannot readily be verified; while it is generally regarded by Western scholars as having been embellished with legendary events (such as the hiding of Buddhaghosa's text by the gods), in the absence of contradictory evidence it is assumed to be generally accurate. While the Mahavamsa claims that Buddhaghosa was born in northern India near Bodh Gaya, the epilogues to his commentaries make reference to only one location in India as being a place of at least temporary residence: Kanci in southern India. Some scholars thus conclude (among them Oskar von Hin√ºber and Polwatte Buddhadatta Thera) that Buddhaghosa was actually born in South India and was relocated in later biographies to give him closer ties to the region of the Buddha. The Buddhaghosuppatti, a later biographical text, is generally regarded by Western scholars as being legend rather than history. It adds to the Mahavamsa tale certain details, such as the identity of Buddhaghosa's parents and his village, as well as several dramatic episodes, such as the conversion of Buddhaghosa's father and Buddhaghosa's role in deciding a legal case. It also explains the eventual loss of the Sinhala originals that Buddhaghosa worked from in creating his Pali commentaries by claiming that Buddhaghosa collected and burnt the original manuscripts once his work was completed. Commentarial style Buddhaghosa was reputedly responsible for an extensive project of synthesizing and translating a large body of ancient Sinhala commentaries on the PƒÅli Canon. His Visuddhimagga (PƒÅli: Path of Purification) is a comprehensive manual of Theravada Buddhism that is still read and studied today. Maria Heim notes that, while Buddhaghosa worked by using older Sinhala commentarial tradition, he is also \\"the crafter of a new version of it that rendered the original version obsolete, for his work supplanted the Sinhala versions that are now lost to us\\". =Writing style= √ëƒÅ·πáamoli Bhikkhu writes that Buddhaghosa's work is \\"characterized by relentless accuracy, consistency, and fluency of erudition, and much dominated by formalism.\\"√ëƒÅ·πáamoli, 1999, Introduction p. xxxvii According to Richard Shankman, the Visuddhimagga is \\"meticulous and specific,\\" in contrast to the Pali suttas, which \\"can be vague at times, without a lot of explanatory detail and open to various interpretations.\\" =Method= According to Maria Heim, Buddhaghosa is explicitly clear and systematic regarding his hermeneutical principles and exegetical strategies in his commentaries. He writes and theorizes on texts, genre, registers of discourse, reader response, Buddhist knowledge and pedagogy. Buddhaghosa considers each Pitaka of the Buddhist canon a kind of method (naya) that requires different skills to interpret. One of his most important ideas about exegesis of the buddha's words (buddhavacana) is that these words are immeasurable, that is to say, there are innumerable ways and modes to teach and explain the Dhamma and likewise there are innumerable ways in which to receive these teachings. According to Heim, Buddhaghosa considered the dhamma to be \\"well-spoken [...] visible here and now, timeless,\\" visible meaning that the fruits of the path can be seen in the behavior of the noble ones, and that comprehending the dhamma is a transformative way of seeing, which has immediate impact. According to Heim, this idea of the transformative and immediate impact of the scriptures is \\"vital to Buddhaghosa's interpretative practice,\\" concerned as he is with the immediate and transformative impact of the Buddha's words on his audiences, as attested in the suttas Regarding his systematic thought, Maria Heim and Chakravarthi Ram-Prasad see Buddhaghosa's use of Abhidhamma as part of a phenomenological \\"contemplative structuring\\" which is expressed in his writings on Buddhist praxis.Heim, Ram-Prasad, In a Double Way: NƒÅma-r≈´pa in Buddhaghosa‚Äôs Phenomenology, Philosophy East and West, University of Hawai'i Press. They argue that \\"Buddhaghosa‚Äôs use of nƒÅma-r≈´pa should be seen as the analytic by which he understands how experience is undergone, and not his account of how some reality is structured.\\" =Yogacara influences= Some scholars have argued that Buddhaghosa's writing evinces a strong but unacknowledged YogƒÅcƒÅra Buddhist influence, which subsequently came to characterize Theravada thought in the wake of his profound influence on the Theravada tradition.Buddhist Phenomenology: A Philosophical Investigation of YogƒÅcƒÅra Buddhism by Dan Lusthaus. RoutledgeCurzom: 2002 pg 106 n 30 According to Kalupahana, Buddhaghosa was influenced by Mahayana-thought, which were subtly mixed with Theravada orthodoxy to introduce new ideas. According to Kalupahana, this eventually led to the flowering of metaphysical tendencies, in contrast to the original stress on anattƒÅ in early Buddhism. According to Jonardon Ganeri, though Buddhaghosa may have been influenced by Yogacara Vij√±ƒÅnavƒÅda, \\"the influence consists not in endorsement but in creative engagement and refutation.\\"Ganeri, 2018, 32. =Theory of consciousness= The philosopher Jonardon Ganeri has called attention to Buddhaghosa's theory of the nature of consciousness and attention. Ganeri calls Buddhaghosa's approach a kind of \\"attentionalism\\", which places primacy on the faculty of attention in explaining activities of thought and mind and is against representationalism.Ganeri, 2018, 31. Ganeri also states that Buddhaghosa's treatment of cognition \\"anticipates the concept of working memory, the idea of mind as a global workplace, subliminal orienting, and the thesis that visual processing occurs at three levels.\\" Ganeri also states: Ganeri sees Buddhaghosa's work as being free from a mediational picture of the mind and also free of the Myth of the Given, two views he sees as having been introduced by the Indian philosopher DignƒÅga.Ganeri, 2018, 34. =Meditation= The Visuddhimagga's doctrine reflects Theravada Abhidhamma scholasticism, which includes several innovations and interpretations not found in the earliest discourses (suttas) of the Buddha.Kalupahana, David J. (1994), A history of Buddhist philosophy, Delhi: Motilal Banarsidass Publishers Private Limited Buddhaghosa's Visuddhimagga includes non-canonical instructions on Theravada meditation, such as \\"ways of guarding the mental image (nimitta),\\" which point to later developments in Theravada meditation. According to Thanissaro Bhikkhu, \\"the Visuddhimagga uses a very different paradigm for concentration from what you find in the Canon.\\" Bhante Henepola Gunaratana also notes that what \\"the suttas say is not the same as what the Visuddhimagga says [...] they are actually different,\\" leading to a divergence between a [traditional] scholarly understanding and a practical understanding based on meditative experience. Gunaratana further notes that Buddhaghosa invented several key meditation terms which are not to be found in the suttas, such as \\"parikamma samadhi (preparatory concentration), upacara samadhi (access concentration), appanasamadhi (absorption concentration).\\" Gunaratana also notes that the Buddhaghosa's emphasis on kasina-meditation is not to be found in the suttas, where dhyana is always combined with mindfulness. Bhikkhu Sujato has argued that certain views regarding Buddhist meditation expounded in the Visuddhimagga are a \\"distortion of the Suttas\\" since it denies the necessity of jhana. The Australian monk Shravasti Dhammika is also critical of contemporary practice based on this work. He concludes that Buddhaghosa did not believe that following the practice set forth in the Visuddhimagga will really lead him to Nirvana, basing himself on the postscript to the Visuddhimagga: According to Sarah Shaw, \\"it is unlikely that the meditative tradition could have survived in such a healthy way, if at all, without his detailed lists and exhaustive guidance.\\" Yet, according to Buswell, by the 10th century vipassana was no longer practiced in the Theravada tradition, due to the belief that Buddhism had degenerated, and that liberation was no longer attainable until the coming of Maitreya. It was re-introduced in Myanmar (Burma) in the 18th century by Medawi (1728‚Äì1816), leading to the rise of the Vipassana movement in the 20th century, re-inventing vipassana-meditation and developing simplified meditation techniques, based on the Satipatthana sutta, the Visuddhimagga, and other texts, emphasizing satipatthana and bare insight.  Attributed works  The Mahavamsa ascribes a great many books to Buddhaghosa, some of which are believed not to have been his work, but composed later and attributed to him.

In spite of the 'Buddhaghosa colophon' added to both commentaries ... no immediate relation to Buddhaghosa can be recognized.... Both Ja [Jataka-atthavannana] and Dhp-a [Dhammapada-atthakatha] are traditionally ascribed to Buddhaghosa, an assumption which has been rightly questioned by modern research.... Meanwhile, Maria Heim holds that Buddhaghosa is the author of the commentaries on the first four Nikayas, the Samantapasadika, the Paramatthajotika, the Visuddhimagga and the three commentaries on the books of the Abhidhamma. Maria Heim also notes that some scholars hold that Buddaghosa was the head of a team of scholars and translators, and that this is not an unlikely scenario. Influence and legacy In the 12th century, the Sri Lankan (Sinhalese) monk SƒÅriputta Thera became the leading scholar of the Theravada following the reunification of the Sri Lankan (Sinhala) monastic community by King Parakramabahu I. Sariputta incorporated many of the works of Buddhaghosa into his own interpretations. In subsequent years, many monks from Theravada traditions in Southeast Asia sought ordination or re-ordination in Sri Lanka because of the reputation of the Sri Lankan (Sinhala) Mahavihara lineage for doctrinal purity and scholarship. The result was the spread of the teachings of the Mahavihara tradition ‚Äî and thus Buddhaghosa ‚Äî throughout the Theravada world. Buddhaghosa's commentaries thereby became the standard method by which the Theravada scriptures were understood, establishing Buddhaghosa as the definitive interpreter of Theravada doctrine. In later years, Buddhaghosa's fame and influence inspired various accolades. His life story was recorded, in an expanded and likely exaggerated form, in a Pali chronicle known as the Buddhaghosuppatti, or \\"The Development of the Career of Buddhaghosa\\". Despite the general belief that he was Indian by birth, he later may have been claimed by the Mon people of Burma as an attempt to assert primacy over Sri Lanka in the development of Theravada tradition. Other scholars believe that the Mon records refer to another figure, but whose name and personal history are much in the mold of the Indian Buddhaghosa. Finally, Buddhaghosa's works likely played a significant role in the revival and preservation of the Pali language as the scriptural language of the Theravada, and as a lingua franca in the exchange of ideas, texts, and scholars between Sri Lanka and the Theravada countries of mainland Southeast Asia. The development of new analyses of Theravada doctrine, both in Pali and Sinhala, seems to have dried up prior to Buddhaghosa's emergence in Sri Lanka. In India, new schools of Buddhist philosophy (such as the Mahayana) were emerging, many of them making use of classical Sanskrit both as a scriptural language and as a language of philosophical discourse. The monks of the Mahavihara may have attempted to counter the growth of such schools by re- emphasizing the study and composition in Pali, along with the study of previously disused secondary sources that may have vanished in India, as evidenced by the Mahavamsa. Early indications of this resurgence in the use of Pali as a literary language may be visible in the composition of the Dipavamsa and the Vimuttimagga, both dating to shortly before Buddhaghosa's arrival in Sri Lanka. The addition of Buddhaghosa's works ‚Äî which combined the pedigree of the oldest Sinhala commentaries with the use of Pali, a language shared by all of the Theravada learning centers of the time ‚Äî provided a significant boost to the revitalization of the Pali language and the Theravada intellectual tradition, possibly aiding the Theravada school in surviving the challenge to its position posed by emerging Buddhist schools of mainland India. According to Maria Heim, he is \\"one of the greatest minds in the history of Buddhism\\" and British philosopher Jonardon Ganeri considers Buddhaghosa \\"a true innovator, a pioneer, and a creative thinker.\\"Ganeri, 2018, p. 30. Yet, according to Buddhadasa, Buddhaghosa was influenced by Hindu thought, and the uncritical respect for the Visuddhimagga has even hindered the practice of authentic Buddhism.S.

The Reich became understood as deriving its authority and sovereignty entirely from a continuing unitary German \\"national people\\", with that authority and sovereignty being exercised at any one time over a unitary German \\"state territory\\" with variable boundaries and extent. Although commonly translated as \\"German Empire\\", the word Reich here better translates as \\"realm\\" or territorial \\"reach,\\" in that the term does not in itself have monarchical connotations. The word Kaiserreich is applied to denote an empire with an emperor; hence the German Empire of 1871‚Äì1918 is termed Deutsches Kaiserreich in standard works of reference.Harper's magazine, Volume 63. Pp. 593. Nevertheless the official name of the German Empire remained as Deutsches Reich because the constitutional position of the head of state was officially a \\"presidency\\" of a confederation of German states led by the King of Prussia who would assume \\"the title of German Emperor\\" as referring to the German people, but was not emperor of Germany as in an emperor of a state. From 1943 to 1945, the official name of Germany became ‚Äì but was not formally proclaimed ‚Äì Gro√üdeutsches Reich (\\"Greater German Reich\\") on account of the additional German peoples and associated territories annexed into the state's administration before and during the Second World War. To refer to the entire period 1871‚Äì1945, the partially translated \\"German Reich\\" () is applied by historians in formal contexts, although in common English usage this state was and is known simply as Germany, the English term \\"German Empire\\" being reserved to denote the German state between 1871 and 1918. The history of the nation-state known as the German Reich is commonly divided into three periods: * German Empire (1871‚Äì1918) * Weimar Republic (1918‚Äì1933) * Nazi Germany (1933‚Äì1945) The Nazi regime has often been called the \\"Third Reich\\", counting the Holy Roman Empire as the first and the 1871 German Empire as the second, and ignoring the Weimar Republic; this usage was sometimes contemporaneous, but mostly retrospective. The Federal Republic of Germany asserted, following its establishment in 1949, that within its boundaries it was the sole legal continuation of the German Reich; and consequently not a successor state. Nevertheless, the Federal Republic did not maintain the specific title 'German Reich'; and so consistently replaced the prefix \\"Reichs\\" in all official titles and designations with \\"Bundes\\". Hence, the Reichskanzler became the Bundeskanzler. Following German reunification in 1990, the expanded Federal Republic describes itself as 'United Germany'; emphasising that Germany does not now recognise any territories outside its united boundaries, but ever included in the former German Reich, as having a valid claim to be a part of Germany as a whole. Term The name Deutsches Reich was occasionally applied in contemporary maps to the Holy Roman Empire (911‚Äì1806), also called \\"Holy Roman Empire of the German Nation\\" from the 16th century onwards, though it constituted a supranational entity extending beyond the frontiers of the German language area (Sprachraum). The first attempt to establish a \\"German Empire\\" during the 1848 March Revolution by the Frankfurt Constitution ultimately failed: it was aborted by the monarchs of the German Confederation, especially by the King of Prussia, fighting German nationalism, which then was tied to the idea of popular sovereignty. Following the Anschluss annexation of Austria in 1938, Nazi Germany informally named itself the Greater German Reich (). This name was made the official state name only during the last two years (1943‚Äì45) of Nazi rule under Adolf Hitler,Decree RK 7669 E of the Reichsminister and head of the Reich chancellery Hans Lammers, 26 June 1943. although the change was never proclaimed. After World War II, the denotation \\"German Reich\\" quickly fell into disuse in Allied-occupied Germany, however, and the state's continued existence remained a matter of debate; the post-war Bonn Republic maintained the continued existence of the German Reich as an 'overall state\\", but dormant while East and West Germany continued to be divided. Nevertheless, when Germany was reunited in 1990 the term \\"German Reich\\" was not revived as a title for the Berlin Republic. The difference between \\"Reich\\" and \\"Empire\\" Deutsches Reich, 1893 map The German word Reich translates to the English word \\"empire\\" (it also translates to such words as \\"realm\\" or \\"domain\\"). However, this translation was not used throughout the full existence of the German Reich. Historically, only Germany from 1871 to 1918 ‚Äî when Germany was under the rule of an emperor (Kaiser) ‚Äî is known in English as the \\"German Empire\\" (Deutsches Kaiserreich in German historiography), while the term \\"German Reich\\" describes Germany from 1871 to 1945.\\"Germany\\" in the Encyclop√¶dia Britannica. As the literal translation \\"German Empire\\" denotes a monarchy, the term is used only in reference to Germany before the fall of the monarchy at the end of World War I in 1918. After the Unification of Germany, under the reign of the Prussian king Wilhelm I and his Chancellor Otto von Bismarck, the historic German states (e.g. Bavaria and Saxony) were united with Prussia under imperial rule, by the Hohenzollern dynasty. On 18 January 1871, Wilhelm I was proclaimed \\"German Emperor\\" at the Hall of Mirrors in Versailles, the German Reich was officially declared Deutsches Reich, or \\"German Empire\\", ‚Äî an example of a legal document in which Germany is officially referred to as \\"the German Empire\\" explicitly referring back to the extinct Holy Roman Empire. The title \\"German Emperor\\" was a compromise; Wilhelm I had wanted the title of \\"Emperor of Germany\\", but Bismarck refused this, so as to avoid implying a claim to extended monarchical authority over non-Prussian German kingdoms. On 14 April 1871, the Reichstag parliament passed the Constitution of the German Empire (Verfassung des Deutschen Reiches), which was published two days later. However, originating from the North German Confederation, the Empire never comprised all \\"German\\" lands; as it excluded Luxembourg, and those Cisleithanian crown lands of Austria-Hungary which had been part of the former German Confederation until 1865. Moreover, it included the whole of the Kingdom of Prussia, the eastern parts of which had never been included in historic German lands. The unification under Prussian leadership manifested Bismarck's \\"Lesser German\\" solution of the German question after the Austro-Prussian War of 1866, realised with the support of his national liberal allies. On the other hand, the German Reich of 1871 comprised extended Prussian territories with large non-German sections of the population, like Posen, West Prussia or Schleswig, and also territories with predominantly German populations which had never been constitutionally \\"German\\", such as East Prussia. Bismarck was otherwise unable, however, to avoid the term German Reich acquiring connotations from the English term \\"empire\\" or the Dutch term \\"rijk\\"; especially in emulation of late 19th century Imperialism, as exemplified by the British Empire, the Dutch Empire and the French colonial empire. Although a latecomer (and against Bismarck's pleading), the German Empire established colonies in modern Togo, Cameroon, Namibia, Tanzania and Polynesia; with an extensive naval capability to support these. At the same time strong Pan-Germanic political forces emerged, pressing for the borders of the Reich to be extended into a German- led central European multi-ethnic empire, emulating and rivalling Imperial Russia to the east. Before and during the events of World War I, the German state was called an \\"empire\\" in English and Wilhelm II was titled \\"His Imperial and Royal Majesty the German Emperor.\\" After the War and the abolition of the monarchy during the German Revolution of 1918‚Äì19, however, when Wilhelm was forced to abdicate, the official English name for Germany was the \\"German Reich\\": Reich was left untranslated and no longer referred to an \\"empire\\" but, instead, took on the connotation of \\"Realm\\" or \\"State\\". \\"German Reich\\" was used in legal documents and English-language international treaties ‚Äî for example, the Kellogg‚ÄìBriand Pact and the Geneva Conventions. Apart from official documents, post-World War I Germany was referred to as the \\"German Reich\\" ‚Äî never as the \\"German Empire\\" ‚Äî for example, by British politicians‚Äîand the word \\"Reich\\" was used untranslated by Allied prosecutors throughout the Nuremberg Trials, with \\"German Empire\\" only used to describe Germany before it became a federal republic in 1918. Reich as \\"national people\\" versus Reich as \\"state territory\\" At the 1871 Unification of Germany (aside from Austria), the Reich was established constitutionally as a federation of monarchies, each having entered the federation with a defined territory; and consequently the unitary nationalism of the 'German Reich' was initially specified (at Article 1 of the 1871 constitution) in territorial terms, as the lands within the former boundaries of this particular subset of German monarchies. This geographical understanding of the Reich became steadily superseded in the period up to the first World War by an understanding of the German Reich as a unitary nation state identified with the German national people according to the principle of jus sanguinis, and drawing on the rhetoric of \\"the sovereignty of the nation\\" in the Frankfurt Constitution‚Äîalbeit that many ethnic \\"Germans\\" (as with the German-speaking peoples of Austria) remained outside the national people constituting the German Empire of 1871 and also that the Empire of 1871 included extensive territories (such as Posen) with predominantly non-German populations. This transition became formalised in the constitution of the Weimar Republic, where Article 1 identifies the Reich as deriving its authority from the German national people, while Article 2 identifies the state territory under the Reich as the lands which, at the time of the constitution's adoption, were within the authority of the German state. The identity of Reich and people ran both ways‚Äînot only did the institutions of the German state derive their legitimacy from the German people, so, too, the German people derived their inherent identity and patriotic duties from their being collectively constituted as an organ and institution of the German Reich. Subsequently the term \\"German Reich\\" continued to be applied both as identifying with the national people, and also with the state territory; but increasingly, the application of the term to the German national people came to be seen as primary. Following the Second World War, the term \\"German Reich\\" fell out of use in constitutional formulations, being replaced by the term \\"nation as a whole\\", as applied to denote the state as a totality of the German national people; and the term \\"Germany as a whole\\", as applied to denote the state as a totality of German national territory. Nazi perspective on the Weimar Republic The 1918‚Äì1933 republic, which was also called German Reich, was ignored and denounced by the Nazis as a historical aberration. The name \\"Weimar Republic\\" was first used in 1929 after Hitler referred to the period as the \\"Republik von Weimar\\" (Republic of Weimar) at a rally in Munich with the term later becoming mainstream during the 1930s both within and outside Germany. The Nazis also contemptuously referred to it as \\"the System\\".Cornelia Schmitz-Berning: Vokabular des Nationalsozialismus. 2. durchges. u. √ºberarb, Aufl. Berlin 2007, , pp. 597-598. A 1923 book entitled Das Dritte Reich by Arthur Moeller van den Bruck counted the medieval Holy Roman Empire as the first and the 1871‚Äì1918 monarchy as the second, which was then to be followed by a \\"reinvigorated\\" third one. End of World War II On 8 May 1945, with the capitulation of the German armed forces, the supreme command of the Wehrmacht was handed over to the Allies. The Allies refused to recognise Karl D√∂nitz as Reichspr√§sident or to recognise the legitimacy of his Flensburg Government (so-called because it was based at Flensburg and controlled only a small area around the town) and, on 5 June 1945, the four powers signed the Berlin Declaration and assumed de jure supreme authority with respect to Germany.Declaration Regarding the Defeat of Germany and the Assumption of Supreme Authority by Allied Powers , 5 June 1945 The declaration asserted the complete legal extinction of the Third Reich following death of Adolf Hitler on 30 April 1945, but the continued subsequent existence of a German people and a German national territory; although subject to the four signatory powers also asserting their authority to determine the future boundaries of Germany. At the Potsdam Conference, Allied-occupied Germany was defined as comprising \\"Germany as a whole\\"; and was divided into British, French, American and Soviet occupation zones; while the Allied Powers exercised the state authority assumed by the Berlin Declaration in transferring the former eastern territories of the German Reich east of the Oder‚ÄìNeisse line to the Republic of Poland and the Soviet Union. Divided Germany In 1973, in a review of the previous year's Basic Treaty between East and West Germany, the German Federal Constitutional Court (Bundesverfassungsgericht) ruled that according to the Basic Law of the Federal Republic of Germany the German Reich had outlasted the collapse in 1945, and hence had continued to exist as an ‚Äúoverall state‚Äù, albeit one not itself capable of action. The court ruled that since 1949 the Federal Republic (FRG) had been partially identical with the German Reich and not merely its successor.BVerfGE 36, 1: Verdict of the Federal Constitutional Court (Bundesverfassungsgericht) regarding the East‚ÄìWest Basic Treaty ‚Äî in German and in English, 31 July 1973 The court further elaborated that the 'partial identity' of the FRG was limited to apply only within its current de facto territory; and hence the Federal Republic could not claim an exclusive mandate for the territory of the Reich then under the de facto government of the German Democratic Republic; \\"identity does not require exclusivity\\". This was explained as being because the German Democratic Republic was beyond FRG authority and because the Allied powers still had jurisdiction where \\"Germany as a whole\\" was concerned. Nevertheless, the Court insisted that within the territory of the Federal Republic, the GDR could only be considered as one de jure German state amongst others, on the analogy of the pre-existing de jure German states that in 1949 had come together as the Federal Republic; and hence, like them, could never be accorded by the organs of the Federal Republic full recognition as a state in international law; even though the Federal Constitutional Court recognised that, within international law, the GDR was indeed an independent sovereign state. The constitutional status of the GDR under the Basic Law still differed from that of the L√§nder of the Federal Republic, in that the GDR had not declared its accession to the Basic Law; but the Constitutional Court maintained that the Basic Treaty was consistent with the GDR declaring its accession at some time in the future in accordance with its own constitution; and hence the Court determined that in recognising the GDR as a de jure German State, the Basic Treaty could be interpreted as facilitating the reunification of the German Reich (as indeed it eventually did). So long as any de jure German state remained separated from the rest, the German Reich could continue to exist only in suspension; but should the GDR be reunited with the Federal Republic, the Reich would once more be fully capable of action as a sovereign state. :\\"In Article 6 the Contracting Parties agree that they shall base themselves on the principle that the sovereign power of each of the two States be confined to its State territory and that they will respect the independence and autonomy of each of the two States in domestic and foreign affairs. This agreement too is compatible with the Basic Law only if interpreted to the effect that for the Federal Republic of Germany the basis of this Treaty is the continued existence of Germany, which has according to the Basic Law to be recognized as a State (albeit not organized and therefore not capable of action), and that accordingly the mutual restriction of sovereign power to the territory of the State and respect for the independence and autonomy of each of the two States in domestic and foreign affairs has its reference to the special situation in which both States find themselves vis-√†-vis each other as sub-States of Germany as a whole.\\" After 1973, however, the claimed identity of the Federal Republic with the German Reich was not recognised by most other countries of the world. The Soviet Union, the three Western allies, and most other Western countries regarded the German Reich as still being one nation ‚Äî not synonymous with either the West or East German state but rather the two states in collective. Other countries tended to regard the German Reich as having been divided into two distinct states in international law, and accordingly accorded both states full diplomatic recognition. As of 1974, East Germany's official stance was that the GDR was a new state that is German in nature, a successor of the German Empire,Donald M. McRae, Canadian Yearbook of International Law 2005, Vol. 43, University of British Columbia, Vancouver 2006, p. 431. and that there were then two German states that were different nations. Reunified Germany When the Treaty on the Final Settlement with Respect to Germany between Germany and the wartime Allies was signed on 12 September 1990, there was no mention of the term Deutsches Reich, however the Allies paraphrased the international legal personality of Germany as \\"Germany as a whole\\" in the English version of the text. Instead the states of the Federal Republic of Germany (West Germany, FRG) and the German Democratic Republic (East Germany, GDR) agreed to be bound by certain conditions which they had to ratify, one of which was the recognising the reunification of East Germany, West Germany and Berlin as constituting the full achievement of a united Germany. On meeting these conditions under Article 7.2 \\"The United Germany [has] accordingly full sovereignty over its internal and external affairs.\\"Treaty on the Final Settlement with Respect to Germany, U.S. Diplomatic Mission to Germany. Updated: November 2003 Under Article 1 of the Treaty on Final Settlement, the new united Germany committed itself to renouncing any further territorial claims beyond the boundaries of East Germany, West Germany and Berlin; \\"The united Germany has no territorial claims whatsoever against other states and shall not assert any in the future.\\" Furthermore the Basic Law of the Federal Republic was required to be amended to state explicitly that full German unification had now been achieved, such that the new German state comprised the entirety of Germany, and that all constitutional mechanisms should be removed by which any territories outside those boundaries could otherwise subsequently be admitted; these amendments being bound by treaty not to be revoked. Article 23 of the Basic Law was repealed, closing off the possibility for any further states to apply for membership of the Federal Republic; while Article 146 was amended to state explicitly that the territory of the newly unified republic comprised the entirety of the German people; \\"This Basic Law, which since the achievement of the unity and freedom of Germany applies to the entire German people, shall cease to apply on the day on which a constitution freely adopted by the German people takes effect\\". This was confirmed in the 1990 rewording of the preamble; \\"Germans..have achieved the unity and freedom of Germany in free self-determination. This Basic Law thus applies to the entire German people.\\" In place of the former Article 23 under which the former GDR had declared its accession to the Federal Republic, a new Article 23 embedded the accession of the Federal Republic to the European Union within the Basic Law; hence with the subsequent accession of Poland to the EU, the constitutional bar on pursuing any claim to territories beyond the Oder‚ÄìNeisse line was reinforced. In so far as the German Reich may be claimed to continue in existence as 'Germany as a whole', the former eastern territories of Germany in Poland or Russia, and the western territories, such as the eastern cantons or Elsass-Lothringen, are now definitively and permanently excluded from ever again being united within this Reich under the Basic Law. Hence, although the GDR had by the Volkskammer's declaration of accession to the Federal Republic, initiated the process of reunification; the act of reunification itself (with its many specific terms and conditions; including the fundamental amendments to the Basic Law required by the Treaty of Final Settlement) was achieved constitutionally by the subsequent Unification Treaty of 31 August 1990; that is through a binding agreement between the former GDR and the Federal Republic now recognising each another as separate sovereign states in international law. This treaty was then voted into effect by both the Volkskammer and the Bundestag by the constitutionally required two-thirds majorities; effecting on the one hand, the extinction of the GDR, and on the other, the agreed amendments to the Basic Law of the Federal Republic. Hence, although the GDR had nominally declared its accession the Federal Republic under Article 23 of the Basic Law, this did not imply its acceptance of the Basic Law as it then stood; but rather of the Basic Law as subsequently amended in line with the Unification Treaty and the Treaty of Final Settlement. These amendments had the effect of removing all those clauses by which the Federal Constitutional Court had formerly maintained the identity of the Federal Republic with the historic 'German Reich', specifically including the very Article 23 that had provided the basis for the Volkskammer's declaration of accession.

The 2011 Census recorded the parish's population 2,093. Geography Stanford is a village with a clustered centre just north of the nascent River Ock, which is a tributary of the River Thames and flows from west to east through the parish. The parish is about wide north ‚Äì south but extends for more than east ‚Äì west along the course of the Ock and its tributaries. One tributary, Stutfield Brook, forms the southeast boundary of the parish. Another, Frogmore Brook, forms part of the northern boundary. The western boundary follows the edges of present and former fields. Stanford village is built on soil-clad Corallian Limestone, which in patches comes close to the surface through erosion. The village is on the A417 road that links Faringdon and Wantage. All outlying parts of the parish are used for farming, interspersed with woodland and other land- intensive industries, with the exception of Bow, a hamlet just north of the village and almost contiguous with the village's core. Archaeology On Bowling Green Farm at the western end of the parish, about east of Faringdon, are remains of what was probably a Roman estate. Along a ridge of Corallian Limestone was a village street more than long. Below it in the valley there may have been a large Roman villa and bath-house. Evidence exists of Roman fields and scattered outbuildings surrounding the village and villa. In the east end of the parish, about east of Stanford Park Farm, is a rectangular moated enclosure beside Stutfield Brook at a place called Stanford Park Island. Exploratory excavations in the early 1960s revealed no evidence of habitation. Toponym The toponym \\"Stanford\\" is derived from the Old English for a \\"stone ford\\" across the Ock. Manor In the reign of Edward the Confessor in the middle of the 11th century, one Siward Barn held the manor of Stanford. The Domesday Book of 1086 records that after the Norman Conquest of England, the Norman nobleman Henry de Ferrers held it. It was made part of the Honour of Tutbury, and remained with the de Ferrers family until the 1260s, when Robert de Ferrers, 6th Earl of Derby was defeated in the Second Barons' War and forfeited his estates in 1266. The Dictum of Kenilworth issued that October allowed him to reclaim his lands by paying a premium, which he did in 1269. However, by 1276 Stanford had been granted to Gilbert de Clare, 7th Earl of Gloucester. When his successor Gilbert de Clare, 8th Earl of Gloucester was killed at the Battle of Bannockburn in 1314, Stanford passed to Eleanor de Clare, wife of Hugh Despenser the Younger. As a result of the rebellions and executions of Hugh and his father Hugh le Despenser, 1st Earl of Winchester in 1326, and their descendant Thomas le Despenser, 1st Earl of Gloucester in 1400, all Despenser lands were twice forfeited to the Crown. But after each forfeiture, Stanford was among the estates restored to the rebel's widow. In the early 15th century Stanford was among the manors that passed by the marriage of Isabel le Despenser, Countess of Worcester to Richard de Beauchamp, 13th Earl of Warwick. In 1474 Anne Beauchamp, 16th Countess of Warwick conferred all her estates on her two daughters. Stanford was among those that she passed to Anne Neville, Queen Consort of King Richard III. But in 1485 Richard was defeated and killed at the Battle of Bosworth Field and her estates were forfeit. In 1489 the all Countess's estates, including Stanford, were restored to her, but she conveyed them to the victorious King Henry VII. In the 16th century the manor of Stanford passed through notable local landholding families including those of Fettiplace and Knollys. When Francis Knollys died in 1596, the manor of Stanford was divided between his granddaughters Elizabeth and Lettice. Around the turn of the 17th century Elizabeth Knollys became married to Henry Willoughby of Risley, Derbyshire, who in 1611 was created 1st Baronet. Their daughter Anne was married to Sir Thomas Aston, 1st Baronet, and their half of Stanford remained in their family until Sir Thomas Aston, 4th Baronet died in 1744. Meanwhile, Lettice Knollys was married to William Paget, 4th Baron Paget, and her half of the manor of Stanford remained with his heirs until 1715, when Henry Paget, 1st Earl of Uxbridge conveyed it to Peter Walter and John Morse. By the end of the 18th century an Edward Loveden Loveden bought and reunited the two halves of the manor. The present manor house was built in the 16th century and remodelled in a Georgian style in the 18th. It is a Grade II* listed building. Churches and chapel =Church of England= Parish war memorial in St Denys' churchyard The oldest parts of the Church of England parish church of Saint Denys are its late 12th-century south and north doorways. The west tower was built late in the 13th century, but its height was increased later. The chancel is Decorated Gothic. Later are the 14th-century north and south aisles, Perpendicular Gothic clerestory and south and north porches. Remnants of 14th-century stained glass survive in the east and south windows of the chancel. The pulpit and baptismal font are Jacobean. The pulpit is wooden; the font is stone encased with wooden panels and cover. The church is a Grade I listed building The tower has a ring of eight bells. Abraham I Rudhall of Gloucester cast the third, fifth, seventh and tenor bells in 1700. Abel Rudhall cast the fourth bell in 1753. Mears and Stainbank of the Whitechapel Bell Foundry cast the treble and second bells in 1891. St Denys' parish is part of the Benefice of Stanford in the Vale with Goosey and Hatford. Primitive Methodist chapel =United Reformed= There is a United Reformed Church in Chapel Lane. It was formerly a Congregational chapel. It is no longer in use. =Methodist= Stanford had a Primitive Methodist chapel. It is now a private house. Economic and social history Thatched cottages in Stanford in the Vale before the August 2005 fire In 1230 King Henry III granted William de Ferrers, 4th Earl of Derby and the men of Stanford the rights to hold a weekly market in the village and an annual three-day fair on the eve, feast and morrow of St Denis, which is 8‚Äì10 October. Stanford's market and fair faced competition with those of other villages in the area including Baulking, East Hendred, Hinton Waldrist, Kingston Lisle and Shrivenham. In the English Civil War there were clashes a few miles to the north, at Faringdon and Radcot (a strategic crossing of the Thames), 1644 and 1645. According to oral history, Parliamentarian cavalry was billeted in the village. On 21 August 2005 a fire badly damaged a row of five 16th-, 17th- and 18th-century thatched cottages beside Church Green. The fire was seen at 1:30 a.m. by an off-duty soldier from Dalton Barracks, who rescued nine people from the cottages. All five cottages have since been restored. Economy and amenities The Horse and Jockey pub Stanford's former post office and newsagent Stanford has a primary school,Stanford in the Vale Primary School a pre-school, two village greens, a post office, other shops and businesses, and a number of clubs and societies. The village has one public house, the Horse and Jockey.The Horse and Jockey It had two other pubs, the Red Lion and the Anchor, each of which has been converted into a private house. The 2011 Census found that the largest category of occupation in Stanford in the Vale is that of professions (151 of 1041 workers). In the more subdivided categorization of workers into industries, the largest was that of motor-related industries, including trade of motor vehicles (151 of 1041 workers). This was followed, in order, by human health and social work, professional, scientific and technical activities and by education as the other occupations. With between 88 and 95 workers, construction and manufacturing were industries in which other villagers at the date of that census tended to work. In the parish various grades of sand and gravel are quarried. However, only two people were employed in mining and quarrying: 0.2% of the working population. The gravel pit in the near northwest of the parish is dormant. Transport A Thames Travel bus from Faringdon to Wantage in Chapel Road, Stanford in the Vale Bus routes 67 and 67C link Stanford with Faringdon and Wantage six days a week. There is no service on Sundays or bank holidays. They are both operated by Thames Travel. Notable people The poet Pam Ayres was born in Stanford in 1947. The English biographer Winifred G√©rin lived in Stanford in the 1970s. Christopher Wordsworth, youngest brother of the poet William Wordsworth was Vicar of Stanford from 1850-1869. President and Life Member of the Berks & Bucks Football Association and North Berks Football League, W.J. Gosling, died in the village on 7 June 2020, having lived in the village for over sixty years.

It is the opposite of confined water (diving) (usually a swimming pool) where diver training takes place. Open water also means the diver has direct vertical access to the surface of the water in contact with the Earth's atmosphere. Open water diving implies that if a problem arises, the diver can directly ascend vertically to the atmosphere to breathe air. Penetration diving‚Äîinvolving entering caves or wrecks, or diving under ice‚Äîis therefore not \\"open water diving\\". In some contexts the lack of a decompression obligation is considered a necessary condition for classification of a dive as an open water dive, but this does not affect the classification of the venue as open water. Swim-throughs ‚Äì the recreational diving term for arches and short, clear, tunnels where the light can be seen at the far end, are technically an overhead environment, but this is often overlooked by divers as there is no risk of getting lost inside, and the risk of entrapment is generally low. Divers progress from learning diving skills in \\"confined water\\" such as a swimming pool to practicing skills in \\"open water\\" in which the environment is not restricted to a small, controlled locality and depth, with conditions typical of a natural body of water which might be used by divers.PADI Instructor Manual Version 2010 (Rev. 1/10), General Standards and Procedures Guide, Page 17. and the range of hazards and associated risk is significantly expanded.Class IV Training Standard Revision 5, October 2007. South African Department of Labour In this context confined water is a special case of open water, as it complies with the more general condition of unobstructed access to the surface. Some recreational diver certification agencies use a variation on this term in the title of their entry level certification. Open Water Diver certification implies that the diver is competent to dive in unrestricted water, with various constraints regarding the conditions, and particularly that their competence is limited to diving in open water of with free access to the surface.  Open ocean diving  The extreme case of open water is the deep open ocean, where the bottom is at a depth which is irrelevant to the diver as there would be no chance of surviving long enough to reach it. Open oceanic water is often remarkably clear, but this is not always the case. There is no natural visual reference for depth in the open ocean, and depth monitoring is critically important to diver safety. = Blue-water diving = Blue-water diving is done in mid-water where the bottom is out of sight of the diver and there may be no fixed visual reference.It is used by scientific divers for direct observation and sampling of pelagic organisms and particulate matter, particularly the gelatinous zoo- plankton that are fragile and transparent, making them relatively inaccessible by other methods,and by recreational divers for observation and photography of a range of organisms not easily seen in inshore waters. The techniques of blue-water diving have been developed over the years to suit the conditions and address the hazards of an environment which is functionally bottomless, and has no fixed visible positional references. The diver who is focused on small organisms or instruments at close range is likely to have diminished awareness of depth, buoyancy, current, surge, other divers, large organisms, and even the direction to the surface. An accepted procedure for scientific blue-water collection dive with several working divers, is to tether the working divers to a central hub connected to a surface platform, and to have an in-water safety diver attend the hub. The tethers pass through fairleads at the hub and are tensioned by a weight at the end, which keeps slack out of the line and thereby reduces the risk of entanglement, and prevents the end of the line from passing through the fairlead. The tether serves to limit the distance a diver can move away from the hub, which is typically fastened to a substantial downline supported by a large buoy at the surface, and kept vertical by a weight. The float at the surface allows the divers to move freely in the water column within the constraint of the tether, and drift with the current. The tethers also allow rope signals between the safety diver and the working divers. The surface platform, generally a small boat, may be tethered to the buoy, and if there is sufficient wind to make this a problem a parachute sea anchor can be deployed to minimise drift. Windage will generally position the buoy and boat downwind of the parachute. The other end of the tether is clipped to the diver's harness or buoyancy compensator by some form of quick-release shackle. These procedures and equipment can also be used at night. If a sea anchor is deployed to limit drift, it must be kept clear of the divers to minimise the risk of entanglement, and it should be buoyed to prevent sinking in a calm. The sea anchor cable should be buoyant line for the same reason. Blue-water diving operations are constrained by water and weather conditions, including wind, sea state, current strength, visibility, and the presence of aggressive predators. =Black-water diving = Black-water diving is mid-water diving at night, particularly on a moonless night. The term may also be used to refer to diving in zero visibility, or in sewage. Christopher Newbert, author of Within a Rainbow Sea, (1984) is credited as an early black- water diver. In his book, he describes solo offshore night dives to depths of up to . Black-water diving is often done as a photographic opportunity for recreational divers, as there can be a wide range of plankton that would not often be seen by day or closer inshore. Weighted downlines are commonly used to provide a stable vertical reference. These may be tied to the boat or supported by a buoy. Each diver may be attached to a downline using a shorter tether to ensure that divers do not go too far from the boat or too deep. The downline may be marked with lights to indicate depth and to attract mobile organisms. A wide range of animal life may be seen, including many species that spend the daylight hours at depths below those accessible to ambient pressure divers, and migrate vertically through the water column on a diurnal cycle. Many of these are bioluminescent or translucent or both. The boat moves differently from the divers and the divers move differently from the plankton, making it necessary to work to get a position from which there will be enough time to frame and take photos of the drifting subjects. The boat will drift under the influence of current and wind, while the divers and plankton will drift with the current. If there is wind the boat will drag the downlines, and if tethered to the buoy, it will drag the buoy and divers attached. If divers swim ahead of the towing action, they will have a short time to drift with the plankton and take photos until the slack in the line has been taken up, at which point the plankton will be left behind. This drift problem can be reduced by setting a parachute anchor, which will reduce wind drift to a negligible amount. The divers should stay clear of the entanglement hazard of the suspension lines.

Geography  The peak, the 7th highest mountain in the Graian Alps, with an elevation of 4,061 m, is close to Mont Blanc on the nearby border with France. In the SOIUSA (International Standardized Mountain Subdivision of the Alps) the mountain belongs to an alpine subsection called \\"North-Eastern Graian Alps\\" (It:Alpi del Gran Paradiso; Fr:Alpes du Grand-Paradis) and also gives its name to the gruppo del Gran Paradiso. While the Mont Blanc massif straddles the border between France and Italy, the Gran Paradiso is the only mountain whose summit reaches over 4,000 metres that is entirely within Italian territory.  Routes  Climbs normally start from either the Refuge Fr√©d√©ric Chabod or the Refuge Victor-Emmanuel II. The latter is named after Victor Emmanuel II of Italy who created the Gran Paradiso royal reserve in 1856, presently the site of the Gran Paradiso National Park. It is widely accepted that Gran Paradiso is one of the easiest four-thousanders to get. This is not fully true, however, because while almost the entire route to the ridge is valued at F+, the last several dozen meters to the Virgin Mary summit (, ou - 4058 m) is rock climbing in large exposure with difficulties I UIAA, while access to the main summit (4061 m) requires 15 minutes of climbing about the difficulties of II UIAA. 99% of those who climb to this peak are, however, amateurs without the right skills, and often even without equipment, who end up climbing the Madonna summit or do not reach any summit. Nature conservation Gran Paradiso is located in the Gran Paradiso National Park, an Italian national park named after the mountain. On the French side of the border, the park is continued by the Vanoise National Park.

Career Block was the youngest of three boys born in Chicago to a Catholic mother, Theresa Lupe Block, and a father of Jewish descent, David Julian Block, a chemist and electrical engineer. (His brother Rich became president of an industrial laundry and his brother Bill was a newspaper reporter for the Chicago Tribune and later for the Chicago Sun.) He began taking classes at the Art Institute of Chicago when he was eleven, and adopted the \\"Herblock\\" signature in high school. After graduating in 1927, he attended Lake Forest College for almost two years. Late in his second year there he was hiredafter submitting some cartoons he had done in high school and college for the Evanston News-Indexto replace the Chicago Daily News departing editorial cartoonist. He never returned to school. Block moved to Cleveland in 1933 to become the staff cartoonist for Newspaper Enterprise Association, which distributed his cartoons nationally. He won his first Pulitzer Prize in 1942, then spent two years in the Army doing cartoons and press releases. Upon discharge Block became chief editorial cartoonist for The Washington Post, where he worked until his death 55 years later. Block's cartoons were syndicated to newspapers around the world by Creators Syndicate from 1987 until his death in 2001. He never married, and, in the Post's employee index, his address was listed as simply \\"The Washington Post \\". Cartoons His first cartoon for the Chicago Daily News (April24, 1929) advocated conservation of America's forests. Herblock said that his family was conservative and that his father voted for Herbert Hoover in 1928. But with the onset of the Great Depression, he became a supporter of President Franklin D. Roosevelt and the New Deal. He pointed out the dangers of Soviet aggression, the growing Nazi menace, and opposed American isolationists. While he criticized Stalin and other Communist figures, he also believed that the United States was overreacting to the danger of communism. Herblock coined the term \\"McCarthyism\\" in this March29, 1950 cartoon. In the early 1950s, Senator Joseph McCarthy was a recurring target of Herblock's cartoons, one of which introduced the term McCarthyism. He won a second Pulitzer Prize in 1954. The Washington Post officially endorsed Eisenhower in the 1952 presidential election. Because Herblock supported Adlai Stevenson, the Post pulled his cartoons, but restored them after a week. He always insisted on total editorial independence, regardless of whether or not his cartoons agreed with the Post's stance on political issues. He focused most of his attacks on those public figures in power, often on Republican figures, but Democrats who displeased him were not immune from criticism. As an example--despite being an ardent admirer of Franklin Roosevelt--he found it necessary to attack the president's 1937 court-packing scheme. During the 1950s, Herblock criticized Eisenhower mainly for insufficient action on civil rights and for not curbing the abuses of Senator McCarthy. In the following decade, he attacked the US war effort in Vietnam, causing President Johnson to drop his plans of awarding the cartoonist with a Presidential Medal of Freedom. The cartoonist would eventually be awarded this honor by Bill Clinton in 1994. gun ownership by Herblock Some of Herblock's finest cartoons were those attacking the Nixon Administration during the Watergate Scandal, winning him his third Pulitzer Prize in 1979. Nixon canceled his subscription to the Post after Herblock drew him crawling out of an open sewer in 1954. He had once used the same motif for Senator McCarthy. He also ended up on the president's infamous enemies list. In the 1980s and 1990s, he satirized and criticized Presidents Reagan, George H.W. Bush, and Clinton in addition to taking on the issues of the day: Gun control; abortion; the influence of fundamentalist Christian groups on public policy; and the Dot Com bubble. The tobacco industry was a favorite target of Herblock, who had smoked at one time. He gave it up and had criticized cigarette companies even before that. Stating that he never got tired of his work, Herblock continued as the 21st century began by lampooning newly elected president George W. Bush. He died on October7, 2001, after a protracted bout of pneumonia six days short of what would have been his 92nd birthday. His final cartoon appeared in The Washington Post on August26. Honors Herblock won three Pulitzer Prizes for editorial cartooning (1942, 1954, 1979), shared a fourth Pulitzer Prize in 1973 for Public Service on Watergate, the Presidential Medal of Freedom (1994), the National Cartoonist Society Editorial Cartoon Award in 1957 and 1960, the Reuben Award in 1956, and the Gold Key Award (the National Cartoonists Society Hall of Fame) in 1979. In 1986 he received the Elijah Parish Lovejoy Award as well as an honorary Doctor of Laws degree from Colby College, and in 1999 an honorary Doctor of Arts degree from Harvard University. In 1961, he was chosen as one of 50 outstanding Americans of meritorious performance in the fields of endeavor, to be honored as a Guest of Honor to the first annual Banquet of the Golden Plate in Monterey, California. Honor was awarded by vote of the National Panel of Distinguished Americans of the Academy of Achievement. In 1966, he was selected to design the U.S. postage stamp commemorating the 175th anniversary of the Bill of Rights. In 1987 he received the Four Freedoms Award for the Freedom of Speech. In 2008 Herblock's work was the subject of exhibitions entitled Herblock's Presidents at the Smithsonian Institution's National Portrait Gallery (United States),Herblock's Presidents exhibition at the Smithsonian Institution's National Portrait Gallery (United States) and Herblock's History at the Library of Congress. In late 2009 and early 2010, the Library of Congress showcased a new exhibition called Herblock!.Library of Congress online exhibition - Herblock! Retrieved November 10, 2015 This exhibition included cartoons that represented Block's ability to wield his pen effectively and artfully. He used it to condemn corruption and expose injustice, inequality, and immorality. His topics included the Great Depression; the rise of fascism and World War II; communism and the Cold War; Senator Joseph McCarthy; race relations; Richard Nixon; the Reagan era; the 2000 election and more. When Herb Block died in October 2001, he left $50 million with instructions to create a foundation to support charitable and educational programs that help promote and sustain the causes he championed during his 72 years of cartooning. The Herb Block Foundation awarded its first grants and the annual Herblock Prize in editorial cartooning in 2004. According to its website, the Herb Block Foundation \\"is committed to defending the basic freedoms guaranteed all Americans, combating all forms of discrimination and prejudice and improving the conditions of the poor and underprivileged through the creation or support of charitable and educational programs with the same goals. The Foundation is also committed to improving educational opportunities to deserving students through post-secondary education scholarships and to promoting editorial cartooning through continuing research.\\" On January 27, 2014, HBO premiered a documentary, Herblock: The Black & The White, which was executive produced by George Stevens Jr., produced and directed by his son, Michael Stevens, who also co- wrote with Sara Lukinson. The documentary interviews Jon Stewart, Lewis Black, Tom Brokaw, Bob Woodward, Carl Bernstein, Jules Feiffer, Ted Koppel and Ben Bradlee as witnesses to Block's life, work and indelible contribution to American satire.

As with many other professions, the professional status and the actual practice of professional engineering is legally defined and protected by law in some jurisdictions. Additionally, some jurisdictions permit only licensed engineers (sometimes called registered engineers) to \\"practice engineering,\\" which requires careful definition in order to resolve potential overlap or ambiguity with respect to certain other professions which may or may not be themselves regulated (e.g. \\"scientists,\\" or \\"architects\\"). Relatedly, jurisdictions that license according to particular engineering discipline need to define those boundaries carefully as well so that practitioners understand what they are permitted to do. In many cases, only a state or provincial licensed/registered engineer has the authority to take legal responsibility for engineering work or projects (typically via a seal or stamp on the relevant design documentation). Regulations may require that only a licensed or registered engineer can sign, seal or stamp technical documentation such as reports, plans, engineering drawings and calculations for study estimate or valuation or carry out design analysis, repair, servicing, maintenance or supervision of engineering work, process or project. In cases where public safety, property or welfare is concerned, it may be required that an engineer be licensed or registered ‚Äì though some jurisdictions have an \\"industrial exemption\\" that permits engineers to work internally for an organization without licensure so long as they are not making final decisions to release product to the public or offering engineering services directly to the public (e.g. consultant). Expert witness or opinion in courts or before government committees or commissions can be provided by experts in the respective field, which is sometimes given by a registered or licensed engineer in some jurisdictions. Registration and regulation Becoming an engineer is a process that varies widely around the world. In some regions, use of the term \\"engineer\\" is regulated, in others it is not. Where engineering is a regulated profession, there are specific procedures and requirements for obtaining a registration, charter or license to practice engineering. These are obtained from the government or a charter- granting authority acting on its behalf and engineers are subject to regulation by these bodies. (pp. 6‚Äì7) In addition to licensure, there are voluntary certification programs for various disciplines which involve examinations accredited by the Council of Engineering and Scientific Specialty Boards. Due to occupational closure, licensed engineers enjoy significant influence over their regulation. They are often the authors of the pertinent codes of ethics used by some of these organizations. Engineers in private practice most often find themselves in traditional professional-client relationships in their practice. Engineers employed in government service and government-run industry are on the other side of that relationship. Despite the different focus, engineers in industry and private practice face similar ethical issues and reach similar conclusions. One American engineering society, the National Society of Professional Engineers, has sought to extend a single professional license and code of ethics for all engineers, regardless of practice area or employment sector.Layton (1986). pp. 238‚Äì239. =United States= In the United States, registration or licensure of professional engineers and engineering practice is governed by the individual states. Each registration or license is valid only in the state where it is granted. Some licensed engineers maintain licenses in more than one state. Comity, also known as reciprocity, between states allows engineers who are licensed or registered in one state to obtain a license in another state without meeting the ordinary rigorous proof of qualification by testing. This is accomplished by the second state recognizing the validity of the first state's licensing or registration process. History Licensure in the United States began in the State of Wyoming when lawyers, notaries and others without engineering training were making poor quality submissions to the state for permission to use state water for irrigation. Clarence Johnson, the Wyoming state engineer, presented a bill in 1907 to the state legislature that required registration for anyone presenting themselves as an engineer or land surveyor and created a board of examiners. Charles Bellamy, a 52-year-old engineer and mineral surveyor then became the first licensed professional engineer in the United States. After enactment, Johnson would wryly write about the effect of the law, saying, \\"A most astonishing change took place within a few months in the character of maps and plans filed with the applications for permits.\\" Louisiana, followed by Florida and Illinois, would become the next states to require licensure. Montana became the last state to legislate the licensing in 1947. Requirements Requirements for licensing vary, but generally are as follows: # Graduate from an Accreditation Board for Engineering and Technology (ABET)-accredited four-year college or university program with a degree in engineering (e.g., Bachelor of Engineering, Bachelor of Science in Engineering, Master of Science in Engineering, Master of Engineering) or in some states, graduate from an ABET-accredited four-year college or university program with a degree in engineering technology. # Complete a standard Fundamentals of Engineering (FE) written examination, which tests applicants on breadth of understanding of basic engineering principles and, optionally, some elements of an engineering speciality. Completion of the first two steps typically qualifies applicants for certification in the United States as an engineer in training (EIT), sometimes also called an engineer intern (EI).59 Okla. Stat. Sec. 475.12. Retrieved 16 August 2006 from Oklahoma state board of licensure for professional engineers and land surveyors . # Accumulate a certain amount of engineering experience: in most states the requirement is four years, but it is lower in some. For engineering technology graduates, the required number of years may be higher. # Complete a written Principles and Practice in Engineering (PE) examination, which tests the applicant's knowledge and skills in their chosen engineering discipline (civil, electrical, industrial, mechanical, etc.), as well as engineering ethics. For standardization, FE and PE exams are written and graded by a central organization, the National Council of Examiners for Engineering and Surveying (NCEES). However, each state's board of professional engineers individually sets the requirements to take the exams, as well as the passing score. For example, applicants in some states must provide professional references from several PEs before they can take the PE exam. There is a fairly large range in exam pass rates for FE and PE exams, but the pass rate for repeat test takers is significantly lower. All 50 states and the District of Columbia have engineering boards that are represented on the NCEES, which administers both the FE and PE examinations. Degree requirements in the United States are evolving. Effective January 1, 2020, the NCEES model will require additional credits beyond a Bachelor of Science in Engineering degree. NCEES is developing the types of creditable activities that will satisfy the additional educational requirement. This has received some support from civil engineers.American Society of Civil Engineers (ASCE) (2001) Academic Prerequisites for Licensure and Professional Practice. Policy Statement 465 .American Council of Engineering Companies (ACEC) (2007) White Paper on Implementation of Additional Engineering Education Requirements as a Prerequisite for Licensure, As of 2013, it is still possible for an individual to bypass Steps No. 2 and 4. In Texas, for example, both FE and PE exam waivers are still available to individuals with several years of creditable experience.http://sections.asme.org/nwhss/TBPE/May04-Licensing.pdf In a few states, it is still possible for an individual to bypass Step No. 1 and apply to take the registration examinations‚Äîas long as a PE sponsors the applicant‚Äîbecause work experience can be substituted for academic experience. The requirement for years of experience may also vary. For example, in California it is possible to take a PE examination with only two years of experience after a Bachelor of Science in Engineering degree or one year of experience after a Master of Engineering. In other states candidates may take one of the PE exams directly through NCEES, in some cases immediately after graduation, but they still must wait until obtaining the required experience before obtaining a license. Some states also have state-specific examinations. California requires two additional exams in land surveying and earthquake engineering for civil engineering candidates and many states have exams based on their individual laws and ethics requirements. Some states issue generic professional engineering licenses. Others, known as \\"discipline states\\", issue licenses for specific disciplines of engineering, such as civil engineering, mechanical engineering, nuclear engineering, electrical engineering and chemical engineering. However, in all cases engineers are ethically required to limit their practice to their area of competency, which is usually a small portion of a discipline. While licensing boards do not often enforce this limitation, it can be a factor in negligence lawsuits. In a few states, licensed civil engineers may also perform land survey work. In addition to the person's license, most states require that firms providing engineering services are authorized to do so. For instance, the state of Florida requires businesses offering engineering services to be registered with the state and have a Florida licensed professional engineer qualify the business. Civil engineers account for a large portion of licensed professional engineers. In Texas, for example, about 37 percent of licenses are for civil engineers, with civil engineering exams making up more than half of the exams taken. Many of the remainder are mechanical, electrical and structural engineers. However, some engineers in other fields obtain licenses for the ability to serve as professional witnesses in courts, before government committees or just for prestige‚Äîeven though they may never actually sign and seal design documents. Since regulation of the practice of engineering is performed by the individual states in the United States, areas of engineering involved in interstate commerce are essentially unregulated. These areas include much of mechanical, aerospace and chemical engineering and may be specifically exempted from regulation under an \\"industrial exemption\\". An industrial exemption covers engineers who design products such as automobiles that are sold (or have the potential to be sold) outside the state where they are produced, as well as the equipment used to produce the product. Structures subject to building codes are not covered by an industrial exemption, though small residential buildings often do not require an engineer's seal. In some jurisdictions, the role of architects and structural engineers overlap. In general, the primary professional responsible for designing habitable buildings is an architect. The architect signs and seals design plans for buildings and other structures that humans may occupy. A structural engineer is contracted to provide technical structural design ensuring the stability and safety of the overall structure, however, no states currently allow engineers the ability to perform professional architecture without also being licensed as an architect. Many private companies employ non-degree workers in technical positions with engineering titles such as \\"test engineer\\" or \\"field engineer\\". At the company's discretion, as long as the company does not offer engineering services directly to the public or other businesses, such positions may not require an engineering license. However, it is important to make a distinction between a \\"graduate engineer\\" and a \\"professional engineer\\". A \\"graduate engineer\\" is anyone holding a degree in engineering from an accredited four- year university program, but is not licensed to practice or offer services to the public. Unlicensed engineers usually work as employees for a company or as professors in engineering colleges, where they are governed under the industrial exemption clause. =Canada= The practice of engineering in Canada is highly regulated under a system of licensing administered by a self regulated engineering association in each province. In Canada the designation \\"professional engineer\\" can only be used by licensed engineers and the practice of engineering is protected in law and strictly enforced in all provinces. The regulation and licensing of engineers is done through each province's own engineering association which was created by acts passed by that province's legislature. There is also Engineers Canada which regulates undergraduate programs for engineering. The process for registration is generally as follows: #Graduate with a degree from an accredited program in engineering or applied science, accredited by the Canadian Engineering Accreditation Board (CEAB). #Complete an engineer-in-training (EIT) or engineering internship program under the direction of a professional engineer. With the exception of Quebec, this is a minimum four-year program. #Review of work experience by the association. #Pass a professional practice exam, the content and format of which differs by province. Professional engineers are not licensed in a specific discipline but are bound by their respective provincial code of ethics (e.g. in Ontario: Professional Engineers Act R.R.O. 1990, Regulation 941) from practicing beyond their training and experience. Breaches of the code are often sufficient grounds for enforcement measures, which may include the suspension or loss of license and financial penalties. It could also result in serving time jail, should negligence be shown to have played a part in any incident that causes loss of human life. Engineers are not tested on technical knowledge during the licensing process if their education was accredited by the CEAB. Accreditation of schools and their accredited degree granting status are monitored and controlled. This accreditation process is governed by Engineers Canada through their active group CEAB. The accreditation process is continuous and enforced through regular accreditation reviews of each school. These reviews typically include the review of the school's curriculum (including marked final exams and assignments), interviews of current students, extracurricular activities and teaching staff as well additional areas the visiting board may feel need addressing. The specific areas considered are curriculum content, program environment and general criteria. The associations are granted both an exclusive right to title and an exclusive right to practice. There are only a few exceptions specifically noted in the acts‚Äîwhich do not include any \\"industrial exemptions\\". Therefore, a professional engineer is legally required to be registered. The level of enforcement varies depending on the specific industry. And, in some provinces, there is no requirement of having graduated from an accredited Canadian university in order to be a professional engineer. The professional engineer's license is only valid in the province of delivery. There are, however, agreements between the associations to ease mobility. In 2009, professional engineers Ontario led an initiative to develop a national engineering licensing framework. The term \\"engineer\\" is often used loosely in some Canadian industry sectors to describe people working in the field of engineering technology‚Äînot professional engineering‚Äîas engineering technologists or engineering technicians and trades names such as stationary engineer. For example, the Canadian Coast Guard and the Canadian Navy often calls its technicians \\"marine engineers,\\" \\"power engineers\\" and \\"military engineers\\" internally, but not in the public domain. The term \\"locomotive engineer\\" has been an integral part of the Canadian railroad since its inception. \\"Stationary engineering\\" is a trade whose technicians operate heavy machinery and equipment that provide heat, light, climate control and power. =United Kingdom= \\"In general there is no restriction on the right to practise as an engineer in the UK. However there are a small number of areas of work, generally safety related, which are reserved by statute, regulations or industry standards to licensed or otherwise approved persons.\\"Engineering Council European Directive on Recognition of Professional Qualifications. The title \\"engineer\\" is not regulated, but certain engineering titles are. There is no system for licensing, but registers are held of qualified persons. The Engineering Council is the UK regulatory body for its engineering profession. It holds the national registers of 235,000 engineers registered as EngTech (engineering technicians), ICTTech (information and communications technology technicians), IEng (incorporated engineers) and CEng (chartered engineers). These titles are fully protected under law by means of the Engineering Council's Royal Charter and By-Laws. In order to protect these titles, action is taken through the courts against their unauthorized use. To receive designation as a CEng, it is required to have approved education (typically to Master's level) and also demonstrate significant technical and commercial leadership and management competencies.Engineering Council Chartered Engineer (CEng) A chartered engineer is entitled to register through the European Federation of National Engineering Associations (FEANI) as a European Engineer and use the pre-nominal designation: Eur Ing. =India= In India, engineers with a bachelor's or master's degree in engineering or technology from a university are allowed to practice as consulting engineers‚ÄîThey must be licensed or registered with municipalities in order to submit public plans, designs or drawings for approval and record. The Institution of Engineers (India) was granted British Royal Charter in 1935 and admits engineers holding the above degrees as a corporate member (AMIE) or chartered engineer [India]: CEng [India]. IE(India) also offers registration as a professional engineer (PE [India]) and international professional engineer (PE [Int'l]) to member- engineers having seven years of active practical engineering experience after achieving their degrees. IE(India) is a member of IPEA (International Professional Engineers Agreement) with bilateral agreements with many national, foreign and international engineering institutions. Many municipalities exempt chartered engineers (PE[India] or PE [Int'l]) from their licenser or registration, by reciprocity (comity). All such consulting engineers must be licensed, registered or chartered regardless of their discipline or area of practice. =Iran= In Iran, registration or licensure of professional engineers and engineering practice is governed by Ministry of Science, Research and Technology (Iran). For standardization, FE and PE exams are written and graded by a central organization, the National Organization for Examination and Training (NOET) which is known as Sanjesh in Persian. Requirements for licensing are as follows: Graduate from accredited four-year college or university program with a degree in engineering (e.g., Bachelor of Engineering, Bachelor of Science in Engineering. Complete a standard Fundamentals of Engineering (FE) written examination, which tests applicants on breadth of understanding of basic engineering principles and, optionally, some elements of an engineering speciality. Accumulate a certain amount of engineering experience requirement is at least four years. Complete a written Principles and Practice in Engineering (PE) examination, which tests the applicant's knowledge and skills in their chosen engineering discipline (civil, electrical, industrial, mechanical, computer, etc.), as well as engineering ethics. =Pakistan= In Pakistan, engineering education and profession is regulated by the Pakistan Engineering Council (PEC) via PEC Act 1976. PEC is a federal government organization. Any person with an engineering degree (BE/BS/BSc Engineering) from PEC accredited universities/institutes is legally allowed to register with the Pakistan Engineering Council (PEC) with two categories. Registered engineer (RE) and professional engineer (PE). Previously, every engineering graduate registered with the PEC and at least five years of relevant work experience was eligible for the title of professional engineer (PE) without any exam. To improve the quality of engineering profession, a two-tier system has been introduced via PEC CPD Bye- Laws 2008. This system was realistically implemented starting 10 July 2010. Graduate engineers now enroll and practice as registered engineer (RE) in their general discipline of work. After at least five years of relevant work experience and accumulation of at least 17 CPD (Continued Professional Development) points, they may attempt the Engineering Practice Examination (EPE) conducted by the PEC. EPE is held by PEC biennially in major cities across the country. Those who pass the EPE are given the prestigious title of professional engineer (PE) in their specialized discipline of work. PEC unilaterally honors the Engineers Mobility Forum (EMF)/International Professional Engineers Agreement (IPEA). An engineer already registered as a professional engineer with EMF/IPEA will be exempt from EPE & CPD points requirement and will be awarded professional engineer (PE) title on submission of application. This has been made possible through clause 13 (h) of PEC CPD Bye-Laws 2008. To improve the quality of engineering services, engineers with professional engineer (PE) status are also required to engage in CPD activities in order to be able to retain their PE license. CPD points are awarded for various developmental activities such as formal education (e.g. Postgraduate diploma, master or PhD), on-job experience, participating in conferences/workshops as audience, speaker or organizer, publications in technical journals, part-time teaching activities, serving as guest lecturer (other than full-time teaching) and serving as external examiner for master/PhD thesis. For CPD points system, upper limit of points has also been implemented to prevent abuse of the system and encourage balanced participation in various CPD activities. In case of on-job work experience which is the primary engagement of engineering profession, one CPD point is awarded for 400 hours of work. Upper limit of 2 credit points per year has been established for on-job work experience. Rewarding only 800 hours (~4 months full-time) of work per year has many benefits including inherent tolerance for bouts of unemployment, in-built allowance for sickness/disease/injury, discouraging workaholism, enabling full-time engineering teachers to gain relevant field experience with reduced time commitment (e.g. part-time consulting engagement) and encouraging participation in other CPD activities which further the engineering profession (e.g. guest lectures, publishing research, authoring a book and social work for engineers under recognized engineers' associations). To avoid confusion, PEC CPD Bye-Laws 2008 introduced the legal term \\"registered person\\". Registered person is a term distinct from registered engineer (RE). It is a blanket term used for all persons enrolled with PEC in any capacity ‚Äì whether as registered engineers (RE) or professional engineers (PE). =Sri Lanka= In Sri Lanka, the title \\"engineer\\" is not regulated. However, as per the Engineering Council Act No 4 of 2017, all engineering practitioners in Sri Lanka needs to be registered with the engineering council to practice. Failing to do so would result in an offence and can be convicted by a summary trial before a Magistrate with imprisonment period not exceeding one year and/or a fine not exceeding one hundred thousand rupees. =Europe= The European Engineer (Eur Ing, EUR ING) is an international professional qualification for engineers used in many European countries. The title is granted after successful application to a national member of the European Federation of National Engineering Associations (FEANI), which includes representation from many European countries, including much of the European Union. It allows a person who has an engineering degree and usually an engineering professional qualification in one of the member countries to use the qualification in others, but this depends on local legislation. The title Eur Ing is \\"pre- nominal,\\" i.e., it is placed before rather than after the name as in the case of a post-nominal title such as those for academic degrees (however, in some EU countries, academic degrees are also pre-nominal). Names are also placed on the FEANI Register maintained by FEANI in addition to national member registers. Another association in Europe is the EurEta. The professional title \\"Ing. EurEta\\" is used as a pre-nominal (similar to Dr. or Prof). An engineer registered with EurEta \\"European Higher Engineering and Technical Professionals Association\\" is called an \\"EurEta Registered Engineer,\\" and has the right to use this title in Europe. Germany In Germany academic title Dipl.-Ing. (Diplom-Ingenieur, diploma engineer) is awarded by the educational ministries of the federal states (Bundesl√§nder) after having completed an academic engineering education according to the German engineer's law (Ingenieurgesetz); however, it is not a license to practice engineering, rather an academic title. The degrees Ing. grad. (graduierter Ingenieur, graduate engineer) and Obering. (Oberingenieur, supervisor engineer) are no longer awarded. The designation \\"Dipl.-Ing\\". is recognized by FEANI as a precursor for registration as \\"Eur Ing\\". \\"Dipl.-Ing.\\" does not confer licensing by the government and therefore is not equivalent to the steps of licensing (e.g., mandatory references, minimum work experience and a second theoretical and practical exam) conducted in other countries such as the UK, Canada or the United States. \\"State-certified engineer\\" (German: staatlich gepr√ºfter Techniker) is a European Union qualification for a professional engineer of technology or professional engineering technologist (not to be confused with an engineering technician or \\"Dipl.-Ing\\"). It is granted to engineering technologists upon successful completion of a technical college and it is also granted by an international organization with headquarters in Germany, the \\"BVT\\", Federal Association of Higher Professions for Technology, Economy and Design (Bundesverband h√∂herer Berufe der Technik, Wirtschaft und Gestaltung e.V.). EU Directive 2005L0036-EN 01.01.2007 ANNEX III List of regulated education and training referred to in the third subparagraph of Article 13(2) A member of the BVT is entitled to use the initials \\"BVT\\" after his name. To achieve this qualification, it is required to complete a 42-month apprenticeship program, a minimum 2,400 hour college diploma in engineering or technology, two years of relevant experience and pass the state examination. The academic requirement to be a state-certified engineer is a degree equivalent to level 6 on EQF = bachelor on the European Qualification Framework. A bachelor's (honours) degree in engineering or engineering technology from an accredited university is also equated to level 6 on EQF. A state-certified engineer is not required to complete a university degree. Before Jan. 31, 2012, a state-certified engineer certificate usually qualified the holder to proceed to bachelor's level education at a university of applied science. In the past, this led to wide and controversial discussions between bachelor's and master's degrees engineers and state-certified engineers. Today, this is on the same level as a bachelor's degree. One can continue to study to a master's degree with the SCE qualification. The academic requirements for qualification are similar to incorporated engineer qualification/registration by EC UK. State-certified engineers now assist engineers with only a diploma or master's degree. They are also holding full engineering positions as systems engineers, integration engineers, test engineers, QA engineers, etc. State-certified engineer, business manager and designer levels are now a level 6‚ÄìBachelor on DQF and EQF, as of Jan. 31, 2012. The following top representatives and agents institutions were involved: federal government (Federal Ministry for Education and Research, Federal Ministry of Economics and Technology), standing conference and economic ministerial meeting of countries, the Confederation of German Employers' Associations, German Chambers of Industry and Commerce, German Trade Union Federation and the Federal Institute for Vocational Application. They agreed on a common position on the implementation of the EQF, as a German qualifications framework (DQR). Designations Letters after or before a person's name (post-nominal or pre-nominal letters) are commonly used to denote the holder of an engineering license in various jurisdictions: =Africa= * Ing. in Ghana (for engineers holding a BSc or higher with relevant engineering experience) and a registered member of the Ghana Institute of Engineers (GhIE) * Pr Eng. or Pr Ing is used as a post-nominal in South Africa (for engineers holding a BEng, BSc.Eng. or B.Ing. with relevant experience). \\"Pr.Cert.Eng\\" standing for professional certificated engineer is used as a post-nominal for engineers who have registered with Engineering Council of South Africa after passing the Engineers Certificate of Competence Examinations. * R.Eng standing for registered engineer in Kenya (Holders of five years of post-secondary engineering education and four years of work experience). * Eng. is used for engineers holding the Bachelor of Science, Bachelor of Engineering (or higher) with relevant engineering experience in Egypt and must be a member in the Egyptian Syndicate of Engineers. * Engr is used as a pre-nominal in Nigeria (for holders of bachelor or higher degree in engineering with relevant experience and having successfully passed the Nigerian Society of Engineers (NSE) Professional Exams and fulfill other NSE and Council for Regulation of Engineering in Nigeria (COREN) requirements)\\" * R.Eng or CEng is used as post-nominal for registered engineers in Nigeria after fulfilling both NSE and COREN requirements. * Eng is used as a pre- nominal in Uganda for registered engineers. In Uganda, a registered engineer must as a prerequisite be a member of the Uganda Institution of professional engineers (UIPE) and must have a Bachelor of Science (or higher) in engineering together with relevant engineering experience that must be documented, supported by two registered engineers and defended by the applicant in an interview with the Engineers' Registration Board (ERB), which has the power to confirm designation as a registered engineer. Annual fees must be paid to the ERB by all registered engineers. =Australia and New Zealand= * RPEng, is used as a post-nominal in Australia for Registered Professional Engineers only and subject to a rigorous competence based assessment and ongoing CPD requirements to maintain status. RPEng is administered by Professionals Australia. * NER, administered by Engineers Australia, is used as a post-nominal in Australia for technologists, associates and professional engineers registered on the National Engineering Register and is subject to CPD requirements to maintain status. Registration is performed by Engineers Australia. * RPEQ is used as a post-nominal in Queensland for registered professional engineers of Queensland and is subject to CPD requirements to maintain status. Registration and monitoring is performed by the Board of Professional Engineers of Queensland. The assessment entities for the Board can be found here. . * MIEAust is used as a post- nominal to designate a member of Engineers Australia. This indicates at least three years' experience beyond graduation, but does not imply chartered membership by itself. * CPEng is used as a post-nominal in Australia and New Zealand for chartered professional engineers and subject to a rigorous competence based assessment and ongoing CPD requirements to maintain status. * FIEAust is used to designate a fellow (highest membership category) of Engineers Australia. * Graduate Engineer is an official designation under Australian Legislation (Professional Employees Award 2010) that covers graduated engineering students of a suitable engineering course.Australian Government Award,\\"Professional Employees Award 2010\\", Office of the Fair Work Ombudsman, July 29, 2017. Retrieved 2018/06/05. * Professional Engineer and Experienced Engineer are official designations under Australian Legislation (Professional Employees Award 2010) for engineers that carry out professional engineering duties and; are a member of Engineers Australia; or are a graduate engineer with 4 years experience with professional engineering duties; or are who have not graduated from a university course, but are an engineer with five years experience carrying out professional engineering duties as would be the case for autodidactic and industry-trained engineers. =Asia= * Mohandess Payeh 1 and Mohandess Payeh 2 are titles used respectively for professional engineer and engineer-in-training in Iran. * Ir is used as a pre-nominal in Hong Kong, Malaysia and Indonesia. * Er is used as a pre-nominal in Singapore and P.E./P.Eng. ( professional engineer ) are used as post-nominal designations. * P.E.Jp as a pre-nominal in Japan. * Engr. or engineer is allowed before your name only if you have membership in IEB, in Bangladesh. * R.E. and P.E. are used as post-nominal designations for engineers in Pakistan registered with the Pakistan Engineering Council (PEC) after completing a four years Bachelor of Engineering/Bachelor of Science in Engineering degree. R.E. ( registered engineer ) and P.E. ( professional engineer ) * Mohandes is used as a pre-nominal in Arab countries like Iraq, Syria and Lebanon. * Eng. or .ŸÖ as a pre-nominal in Jordan (for engineers holding a university degree in engineering after five years of studies). * Engr. or engineer is used as a pre-nominal in the Philippines for individuals passing the government regulated professional licensure examination, which is only given for certain fields of engineering. * CEng (Sri Lanka) is used in Sri Lanka as a post- nominal abbreviation by corporate members of the Institution of Engineers, Sri Lanka (IESL). * IEng. The term incorporated engineers is offered by the Institution of Incorporated Engineers, Sri Lanka. * CEng (India) is used as post-nominal abbreviation in India by those who are registered as a chartered engineer with Institution of Engineers (India). * Er is used before their name by chartered engineers who hold the IE [India] designation, in India. * ◊ê◊ô◊†◊í' is used in Israel mostly by master's degree civil engineers. =Europe= * Eur Ing (European engineer) in Europe, used as a pre-nominal (similar to Dr. or Prof.) after being suitably registered in their own country and then accepted by FEANI. * Ing.P.Eur (European professional engineer) in Europe, used as a pre-nominal. * Ing. (ingeniero) in Spain, used as a pre-nominal, for the engineers who have the equivalent to a master's degree as they studied five or six courses in an engineering superior school. There also exists an ingeniero t√©cnico (I.T.), who is a professional that holds a degree and a minimum formation of three courses in an engineering official college. Both types of engineers have full competency in their respective professional field of engineering, being the difference that the three-year engineers have competence only in their specialty (mechanical, electrical, chemical, etc.) and the \\"engineering superior school\\" engineers have wider competences. The Bologna process changes this structure. The degree will require four courses and the superior engineering school engineers will equal the ones that hold a master's in engineering. * Eng. (Engenheiro) in Portugal, used as a pre- nominal. An engenheiro is a full chartered professional in engineering who was awarded a master's degree (2nd study cycle according to the Bologna process system) by an accredited engineering school. In Portugal there is also the engenheiro t√©cnico who is a professional with a bachelor's degree (first study cycle) in engineering or engineering sciences. Accredited master's degrees in engineering are regulated and certified by the Ordem dos Engenheiros (Order of Engineers) and every professional full chartered engineer is registered at the Ordem. * In Finland, regulation affects only academic degrees. In academic education, the degree of diplomi-insin√∂√∂ri (dipl. ins. or DI), officially translated \\"Master of Science (Technology)\\", is awarded by universities and universities of technology and is preceded by an intermediate bachelor's degree (tekniikan kandidaatti) or equivalent studies. In vocational education, the degrees insin√∂√∂ri and ylempi insin√∂√∂ri (amk) are awarded by polytechnics. * In Germany the Dipl.-Ing. (Diplom-Ingenieur, diploma engineer) is awarded by the educational ministries of the federal states (Bundesl√§nder) after having completing an academic engineering education according to the German engineer's law (Ingenieurgesetz). The degrees Ing. grad. (graduierter Ingenieur, graduate engineer) and Obering. (Oberingenieur, supervisor engineer) are no longer awarded. (pre-nominal letters) * Ing. EurEta is used as a pre-nominal (similar to Dr. or Prof). An engineer registered with EurEta \\"European Higher Engineering and Technical Professionals Association\\" is called an \\"EurEta Registered Engineer\\" and has the right to use this title in Europe. * State-certified Engineer BVT. These titles are the respective translations (authorized by the German Federal Government) of staatlich gepr√ºfter Techniker in Europe. * Ir. in the Netherlands (for engineers holding a master's degree from a university) or Ing. (for engineers holding a bachelor's degree from a professional school). (pre-nominal letters) * Ir. in Belgium (for \\"civil\\" engineers holding a master's degree in engineering/bio- engineering sciences from a university) or Ing. (for \\"industrial\\" engineers holding a master's degree in applied engineering, formerly from university colleges, from 2013 these formations are integrated in the universities). (pre-nominal letters) * Ing. in Italy used as a pre-nominal (for engineers holding a master's degree ) or Ing.jr (for engineers holding a bachelor's degree). A state exam is required. (pre-nominal letters) Registration is with the Consiglio Nazionale degli Ingegneri. * Siv. Ing. (sivilingeni√∏r, Master of Science) and ing. (h√∏yskoleingeni√∏r, Bachelor of Science) in Norway. The title is used by persons holding degrees from accredited engineering colleges and universities. * CEng (chartered engineer) and IEng (incorporated engineer) in the UK and Ireland. UK and Irish engineers may also carry post-nominal letters specific to their specialist engineering institute, such as MIET (professional engineers and graduate professionals registered with the Institution of Engineering and Technology). In the UK these are recognized as regulated qualifications and titles.Regulated Professions in the UK . (UK) Department for children, schools and families. Retrieved 2 November 2007. * Civ.

(magister in≈ºynier, literally: master engineer). The mgr degree can be obtained in two years post-graduate education or formerly (until full adaptation of the Bologna process by university) through an integrated five-year Bachelor of Science/Master of Science program. Some (particularly in the U.S.) mistakenly believe that \\"mgr in≈º.\\" is some kind of separate degree, while in fact these are two degrees, regardless of how they were obtained. The degree in general includes license to practice, although some regulation may require additional registration to perform specific tasks (see pre-nominal letters). * –º–∞–≥. –∏–Ω–∂. (Mag.

Registration by CONFEA/CREA in the federation states of Par√°, Maranh√£o, Tocantins, S√£o Paulo and others but to work in more than one state is possible only with \\"visto\\". * \\"R.Eng.\\" registered engineer in Trinidad and Tobago, as accredited by the Board of Engineering of Trinidad and Tobago. =North America= * PE or P.E. is used in the United States. Individual states grant PE registration, which can sometimes be endorsed by other states. * P.Eng. is used in Canada, including the province of Quebec. This is granted to specified technical educational degree holders residing in Canada, upon application and approval. * Eng. () is used in Quebec (professional engineers in Quebec may use either Eng., P.Eng. or ing., which are all equivalent). Title usage In many countries, laws exist that limit the use of job titles containing the word \\"engineer\\". =Canada= In Canada it is illegal to practice engineering or use the title \\"professional engineer\\" or \\"engineer\\", without a license. There are two exceptions‚Äîstationary engineer and power engineer. Engineering in Canada is regulated in the public interest by self-governing professional licensing bodies. These bodies were established by Canada's 13 provincial and territorial governments through legislation. The provincial and territorial governments have delegated their constitutional authority to regulate engineers and engineering in Canada to professional licensing bodies that are maintained and governed by the profession, creating a system of self-regulation. The first law related to professional engineering in Ontario was created in 1922 and allowed for the creation of a voluntary association to oversee registration of engineers. The Act of 1922 was \\"open\\", meaning that membership in the association was not mandatory for practising engineers. In Ontario, regulation of engineering practice dates to 1937, when the Professional Engineers Act was amended and the engineering profession was \\"closed\\" to non-qualified individuals; that is, licensure was made mandatory for anyone practising professional engineering. The provincial government determined that it would be in the public interest to restrict the practice of engineering to those who were qualified and the right to practice was \\"closed\\" to non-engineers as a result of the failures of bridges and buildings, which had been designed by unskilled individuals. Canadian provinces legally allow engineers to self-regulate their profession. The licensing bodies fulfil this mandate by ensuring standards of engineering practice and education in Canada, by setting standards for admission into the profession, by disciplining engineers who fail to uphold the profession's practice and ethical standards and by preventing the misuse of the title professional engineer by individuals who are not licensed members of the profession. They also take appropriate action to prevent the illegal practice of engineering by unlicensed individuals. Each licensing body's mandate and obligation to undertake this role is laid out in the act that created it. Although each act is slightly different, most also define a scope of practice for engineers and specifically restrict the use of the title professional engineer to individuals who have been licensed by the engineering licensing body in the province or territory where the act applies. The use of the term engineer was an issue between professional bodies, the IT industry and the security industry, where companies or associations may issue certifications or titles with the word engineer as part of that title (such as security engineer or Microsoft Certified Systems Engineer). Microsoft has since changed the title to \\"Microsoft Certified IT Professional\\". Several licensing bodies for professional engineering contend that only licensed professional engineers are legally allowed to use the title engineer. The IT industry, on the other hand, counters that: # These title holders never presented themselves as professional engineers # Provincial laws, other than in Quebec and Ontario, regulate only the use of term professional engineer and not any title with the word engineer; in Quebec and Ontario, the term engineer is protected by both the Engineers Act and by Section 32 of the Professional Code # The IT industry has used the term engineer since the dawn of the computing industry in the 60s.Andronache, Tatiana, The Importance of \\"Being Engineer\\" . Court rulings regarding the usage of the term engineer have been mixed. For example, after complaints were lodged by the Canadian Council of Professional Engineers, a court in Quebec fined Microsoft Canada $1,000 for misusing the \\"engineer\\" title by referring to MCSE graduates as engineers. Conversely an Alberta court dismissed the lawsuit filed by The Association of Professional Engineers, Geologists and Geophysicists of Alberta (APEGGA) against Raymond Merhej for using the title \\"system engineer,\\" claiming that, 'The respondent's situation is such that it cannot be contended that the public is likely to be deceived, confused or jeopardized by his use of the term...'\\"APEGGA website APEGGA also lost the appeal to this decision.ASET Technology Alberta, p. 2 The Canadian Information Processing Society, and in particular CIPS Ontario, have attempted to strike a balance between the professional engineering licensing bodies and the IT industry over the use of the term engineer in the software industry, but so far no major agreements or decisions have been announced. Additional confusion has taken place over similarly-named occupations. One such example is power engineers or stationary engineers. Graduates of a two-year college level power engineering technology program in Nova Scotia may use the title power engineer or stationary engineer. This conflicts with the title often used in the electrical industry for professional engineers who design related equipment and can cause confusion. =United States= In the United States, the practice of professional engineering is highly regulated and the title \\"professional engineer\\" is legally protected, meaning that it is unlawful to use it to offer engineering services to the public unless permission, certification or other official endorsement is specifically granted by that state through a professional engineering license. Also, many states prohibit unlicensed persons from calling themselves an \\"engineer\\" or indicating branches or specialties not covered by the licensing acts.https://engineers.texas.gov/downloads/lawrules.pdfhttps://fbpe.org/wp- content/uploads/2015/10/Chapter-471-04.13.15.pdfhttp://sos.ga.gov/plb/acrobat/Laws/09_Professional_Engineers_and_Land_Surveyors.pdf Employees of state or federal agencies may also call themselves engineers if that term appears in their official job title. The IEEE's formal position on this is as follows: \\"The title, engineer and its derivatives should be reserved for those individuals whose education and experience qualify them to practice in a manner that protects public safety. Strict use of the title serves the interest of both the IEEE-USA and the public by providing a recognized designation by which those qualified to practice engineering may be identified.\\" Every state regulates the practice of engineering to ensure public safety by granting only Professional Engineers (PEs) the authority to sign and seal engineering plans and offer their services to the public. There are additional requirements to include at least one professional engineer within the firm for these type of companies to include the word engineering in the title of the business, although these requirements are not universal. In the United States an \\"industrial exemption\\" allows businesses to employ employees and call them an \\"engineer\\", as long as such individuals are under the direct supervision and control of the business entity and function internally related to manufacturing (manufactured parts) related to the business entity or work internally within an exempt organization. Such person does not have the final authority to approve or the ultimate responsibility for, engineering designs, plans or specifications that are to be: (A) incorporated into fixed works, systems or facilities on the property of others; or (B) made available to the public. These individuals are prohibited from representing an ability or willingness to perform engineering services or make an engineering judgment requiring a licensed professional engineer, engage in practice of engineering, offer engineering services directly to the public and/or other businesses; unless the business entity is registered with the state's board of engineering and the practice is carried on/supervised directly only by engineers licensed to engage in the practice of engineering. Examples are sanitation engineer, production engineer, test engineer, network engineer, project engineer, systems engineer and sales engineer. These are often seen in engineering job advertisements online and in news papers. Most of the advertisements and employers don't require licensing because these positions do not pose a direct threat to public health or pose a liability danger. The US model has generally been only to require the practicing engineers offering engineering services that impact the public welfare, safety or safeguarding of life, health or property to be licensed, while engineers working in private industry without a direct offering of engineering services to the public or other businesses, education and government need not be licensed. In the United States, use of the title professional engineer is restricted to those holding a professional engineer's license. These people have the right to add the letters PE after their names on resumes, business cards and other communication. However, each state has its own licensing procedure and the license is valid only in the state that granted it. Therefore, many professional engineers maintain licenses in more than one state. Comity, also known as reciprocity, between states allows engineers who are licensed or registered in one state to obtain a license in another state without meeting the ordinary rigorous proof of qualification by testing. This is accomplished by the second state recognizing the validity of the first state's licensing or registration process. Other uses of the term engineer are legally controlled and protected to varying degrees, dependent on the state and the enforcement of its engineering certification board. The term is frequently applied to fields where practitioners may have no engineering background or the work has no basis in the physical engineering disciplines; for example sanitation engineer. With regard to the term \\"software engineer\\", many states, such as Texas and Florida, have introduced license requirements for such a title that are in line with the requirements for more traditional engineering fields. =United Kingdom= There is no restriction on anyone describing themselves as an engineer or working as an engineer in the UK. The word engineer has a broad sense and can refer to multiple different jobs associated with engineering. Specific titles, however, are protected. In addition to professional engineering titles, these include Registered Gas Engineer and Chief Engineer Class 1 [or 2] Fishing Vessel. The Engineering Council grants the titles Chartered Engineer, Incorporated Engineer, Engineering Technician and Information and Communications Technology Technician under its royal charter. These titles are protected under civil law. The Engineering Council is also the UK member of the International Professional Engineers Agreement and awards the title of International Professional Engineer (UK). Various engineering institutions grant their own professional titles in addition to those granted by the Engineering Council. These include Chartered Chemical Engineer (Institution of Chemical Engineers), Chartered Civil Engineer (Institution of Civil Engineers), Chartered Energy Engineer and Chartered Petroleum Engineer (Energy Institute), Chartered Gas Engineer (Institution of Gas Engineers and Managers), Chartered Marine Engineer (Institute of Marine Engineering, Science and Technology), Chartered Structural Engineer and Member of the Institution of Mechanical Engineers (Institution of Structural Engineers), and Member of the Institution of Engineering and Technology (Institution of Engineering and Technology). =Europe and Latin America= * Regulation and titling of engineers in Europe are handled differently by various countries. * In Germany and some other European and Latin American countries, the term diploma engineer implies that the person has completed typically one year of academic work beyond the basic Bachelor of Engineering degree and completed a major academic project, similar to a master's thesis. Therefore, a diploma engineer is a university degree and not a professional registration or license. However, in Germany and most other countries where the diploma engineer degree exist, there is no professional registration or license in engineering (with a very limited number of exceptions, such as civil engineering in Germany). For this reason, graduates holding these degrees are generally allowed to use the legally protected title of \\"engineer\\" within these countries. In Germany the usage of the term engineer (Ingenieur) as such, not just the Diplom-Ingenieur, is protected by various L√§nder (states of Germany) laws‚Äîbecause education matters are governed by the legislation of the L√§nder, not the federal government. Although the details of the laws vary, they all properly restrict the usage of the term. Examples of such laws are listed in the endnotes.Gesetz zum Schutze der Berufsbezeichnung \\"Ingenieur\\" und \\"Ingenieurin\\" ‚Äì Ingenieurgesetz ‚Äì IngG ‚Äì (BayRS 702-2-W), zuletzt ge√§ndert durch ¬ß 1 des Gesetzes vom 24.

M√§rz 2010 (GVBl.I/10, [Nr. 15]) * In France, the title engineer is used liberally and is often attributed based on professional position rather than initial qualification. However, the title ing√©nieur diplom√© (diploma engineer) is reserved for people having followed one of the trainings listed by the Commission des Titres d'Ing√©nieur (Commission for Engineer Titles). It corresponds to a highly selective master's degree level. * In Turkey title is limited by law for the people with an engineering degree from accredited engineering universities. Usage of the title by others (even those with much more work experience) is illegal and punishable by law. * In Chile, the ingeniero (engineer) title is regulated by law, which distinguishes at least three different kinds of professional engineering titles. First, the igenier√≠a de ejecuci√≥n, which only requires a degree in applied science and a technical degree from a university or a technical institute (usually four years total). Second, ingenier√≠a, which requires a major degree in basic sciences plus a technical degree, both from a university (usually five years total). Third, ingenier√≠a civil, which requires an academic major degree in basic sciences, a minor degree in applied sciences and a technical degree, all from a university (usually six or six and a half years total). In all cases, the term refers to a professional degree conceded by an educational institution, yet it can only be given by certain institutions when all legal requirements are met. * In Brazil, the title of engenheiro (engineer)‚Äîand in Argentina, the title of ingeniero‚Äîcan only be legally used by someone with a five- or six-year engineering degree. In Argentina most universities have a five- or six-year engineering degree (Around 3,500‚Äì4,000 hours of classes or approx. 240‚Äì250 credits, where one credit equals 16 contact hours). Both countries concede the degree most commonly through universities and sometimes through certain institutions. * In Puerto Rico, use of the title ingeniero (engineer) is restricted to those holding an engineer's license registered by the Puerto Rico Professional College of Engineers and Land Surveyors. These people have the right to add the letters Ing. before their names on resumes, business cards and other communication. =International professional bodies= The AACE, a professional body for cost engineers, explains why a technical engineering background is not required for their profession with the following statement: See also *American Society of Civil Engineers *Civil Engineering Body of Knowledge *Chartered Physicist *FIDIC *Hong Kong Institution of Engineers *Institution of Electronics and Telecommunication Engineers *Institution of Engineers (disambiguation) *Institution of Mechanical Engineers *Engineering New Zealand *Engineers Australia *Society of Operations Engineers *Washington Accord References External links *Professional Engineers in Europe *Occupational Outlook Handbook, 2010‚Äì11 Edition ‚Äì Engineers, Bureau of Labor Statistics of the U.S. Department of Labor *Going Global: The case for enhancing global trade in professional services ‚Äì Institution of Engineers, Australia 2003 Professional certification in engineering ","title":"Regulation and licensure in engineering"},{"id":"291253","title":"Super Bowl Most Valuable Player Award"},{"id":"291254","text":"Surface marker buoy to track a group of divers Drift diving is a type of scuba diving where the diver is transported by the water movement caused by the tide, an ocean current or in a river. The choice whether to drift dive depends on the purpose of the dive, and whether there is an option. At some sites there is almost always a current running, and at others the strength and direction of water movement may vary with the tide, or other driving forces, like wind or recent rainfall. At some sites there may be considerable variation in visibility and marine life activity based on the speed and direction of flow. The current gives the diver the impression of flying and allows the diver to cover long distances underwater, possibly seeing more habitats and formations than usual. Often drift diving is performed more for the experience of underwater \\"flight\\" and less for interactions with underwater life, which, given the speed at which most divers move, are reduced. Procedures Drift dives can be done from the shore, but this requires some form of transport to pick up the divers where they come ashore, which is usually not accurately predictable, so it is more commonly done from a boat, which will follow the group and pick up divers as they surface. It may be possible to follow the divers by watching the bubbles, but a more reliable method is for the dive leader to tow a surface marker buoy, and for all the divers of the group to follow the leader. If a diver or buddy pair finds it necessary to surface before the leader they will ascend up the float line if possible, as this will surface them where the boat crew expects and is watching. Divers that are separated from the group are generally advised to deploy a decompression buoy and ascend on their own line, as the buoy will alert the surface crew to a separate group, and will also help other boat traffic to notice and avoid running the divers down as they reach the surface. Skills Drift diving skills are not generally included in basic entry level recreational scuba training, but may be included in entry level professional diver training. Some diver training agencies offer drift diving training as a specialty part of their Advanced Open Water Diver training. Equipment Most of the equipment is identical to that for a recreational dive in similar environment in the absence of a current. The exceptions are the use of a surface marker buoy by the dive leader, and delayed surface marker buoys carried by divers for deployment if they become separated from the dive leader. Planning Drift diving requires more rigorous planning than a dive in still water to be executed safely. Drift diving is generally not planned to coincide with slack water, but this can vary depending on the strength of the stream. It is important to consider the direction of tidal streams as well as their strength to avoid divers being swept into dangerous areas such as shipping lanes or areas known to have entanglement hazards. It is also important to plan for the possibility of separation, either underwater or at the surface. Precautions A common precaution for drift diving is to have a supporting boat follow the divers and for the dive leader to use a surface marker buoy. It is also generally necessary for all divers intending to drift dive as a group to enter the water at the same time, so there is less chance of being separated by the flow. It is quite common for current speeds to vary with depth, so a low drag buoy and line will reduce the workload on the diver carrying the reel. Mitigation equipment for separation may include signaling devices and a compass, and a personal DSMB and reel or spool. Legislation There may be local rules pertaining to the use of surface marker buoys. In some parts of the world, surface marker buoys alone are not legally sufficient signaling devices, and one of the international diver down flags (in an appropriate size), might be required while drift diving.

Wreck diving is recreational diving where the wreckage of ships, aircraft and other artificial structures are explored. Although most wreck dive sites are at shipwrecks, there is an increasing trend to scuttle retired ships to create artificial reef sites. Diving to crashed aircraft can also be considered wreck diving. The recreation of wreck diving makes no distinction as to how the vessel ended up on the bottom. Some wreck diving involves penetration of the wreckage, making a direct ascent to the surface impossible for a part of the dive.  Reasons for diving wrecks  A shipwreck may be attractive to divers for several reasons: * it serves as an artificial reef, which creates a habitat for many types of marine life * it often is a large structure with many interesting parts and machinery, which is not normally closely observable on working, floating vessels * it often has an interesting history * it presents new skill challenges for scuba divers to manage the risks associated with wreck penetration. * it is part of the underwater cultural heritage and may be an important archaeological resource * it provides a first-hand insight into context for the loss, such as causal connections, geographical associations, trade patterns and many other areas, providing a microcosm of our maritime heritage and maritime history * it sometimes contains artifacts of historical, artistic and/or monetary value, which can be sought for profit (treasure hunting) or collection purposes (ranging from rare collector's items to souvenirs, memorabilia or other \\"trophies\\", such as crew members' or passengers' personal belongings, nautical instruments, brass portholes or silverware, cutlery, intact china or other tableware).  Types of wreck diving  Wreck diving in Estonia for archaeological research. In The Advanced Wreck Diving Handbook, Gary Gentile sub-divides wreck diving into three categories: * Non-penetration diving (i.e. swimming outside the wreck) * Limited penetration diving, within the \\"light zone\\" * Full penetration diving, beyond the \\"light zone\\" Each subsequent level involves additional hazards and greater risk, and therefore will normally require additional training and experience to develop the required competence, and may also require additional equipment and the competence to use it effectively. Non-penetration wreck diving is the least hazardous form of wreck diving, although divers still need to be aware of the entanglement risks presented by fishing nets and fishing lines which may be snagged to the wreck (wrecks are often popular fishing sites), and the underlying terrain may present greater risk of sharp edges. Penetration within the light zone presents greater hazards due to overhead and greater proximity of the wreck's structure, but because of the proximity of a visible exit point, and some amount of external light, those hazards are more manageable. However, there is clearly a much greater risk of entanglement and silt out inside of the structure, as well as the requirement to move laterally to a defined exit point before one can surface in the event of an emergency. Full penetration involves the greatest level of risks, including the risk of getting lost within the structure, the risk of complete darkness in the event of multiple light failures, and the inability to escape unassisted in the event of a complete disruption to breathing gas supply. These categorisations broadly coincide with the traditional division between \\"recreational\\" wreck diving (taught as a specialty course by recreational diver training agencies and normally limited to the \\"light zone\\" and/or 100-130 cumulative feet of depth plus penetration) and \\"technical\\" wreck diving (taught as a stand-alone course by technical diver training agencies).  Procedures and safety  Wrecks may present a variety of site-specific hazards to divers. Wrecks are often fouled by fishing lines or nets and the structure may be fragile and break without notice. Penetration diving, where the diver enters a shipwreck is an activity exposing the diver to hazards of getting lost, entrapment and consequently running out of breathing gas. Management of these risks requires special skills and equipment. Many attractive or well preserved wrecks are in deeper water requiring deep diving precautions. Training agencies recommend that at least one cutting device be carried in case the diver is entangled with fishing lines, nets or ropes and to have a spare light source in case the primary light fails. If penetrating a wreck, a guideline tied off before entering a wreck and run out inside the wreck is advisable. A guideline can help a diver to find the way out more easily in case of low visibility. For penetration diving, a reserve of breathing gas sufficient to allow the diver to exit the wreck and make a safe ascent in the event of any reasonably foreseeable single failure of equipment is required by training agencies' protocols and scientific codes of practice. Most wreck divers use a minimum of the rule-of-thirds for gas management. This allows for 1/3 of the gas down and into the wreck, 1/3 for exit and ascent and 1/3 reserve. In addition, because of the potential fragility of the wreck, the likelihood of disturbing sediments or disturbing the many marine animals that take advantage of the artificial habitat offered by the wreck, extra care is required when moving and finning. Many divers are taught to use alternative finning methods such as frog kick or modified flutter kick which direct the thrust of the fins away from the bottom where most of the silt is likely to deposit. Good buoyancy control is necessary for safe and non-destructive diving in the environment of a wreck. Wreck Alley =Connecting to the wreck= There are several methods for getting the divers to the wreck. The preferred method will depend on local conditions. In low visibility hooking onto the wreck is a reliable way of ensuring the divers will find it, but this procedure requires a wreck that is structurally suitable for snagging with a grapnel or anchor. A shotline which can be dropped off the wreckage is less likely to damage the wreck or become snagged and difficult to retrieve, but this requires appropriate visibility for the divers to be sure of finding the wreckage. When it is important to get back to the shotline for ascent, it may be tied to the wreckage by the first divers on site using a guide-line, which is retrieved by the last divers to leave. When there is a strong current, it may be necessary to drop in from up- current, a technique sometimes known as \\"parachuting in\\" or \\"free drop\\". The wreck may be first marked with a shotline, if this is considered useful or necessary. Divers may surface on the shotline, anchorline or personal DSMB depending on the conditions. When using the anchor line to control ascents and descents, a \\"tag line\\" may be used between the anchor line and the stern of the vessel, to allow secure transfer between these points in a current. When there are alternative methods for descent, including free drop and descent on the shotline. =Penetration diving= In technical penetration diving, there are broadly two approaches. The conventional approach involves the use of continuous guidelines laid from a wreck reel, tied just outside the entrance point, just inside the entrance point, and at regular intervals inside (to mitigate the risk of a cut line, or a \\"line trap\\"). In deeper penetrations, two reels are used, so that in the event of a total loss of visibility where the diver loses contact with the primary line or the primary line gets cut, the secondary line can be anchored and then used as a reference point to sweep for the primary line. An alternative approach, popularised by deep wreck divers in the American Northeast, is referred to as \\"progressive penetration\\". Progressive penetration eschews the use of reels, but the diver makes several successive penetrations, each successively deeper than the last, memorising the layout for both the inward and outward journeys. The method is vulnerable to complete loss of visibility in a silt-out, and any disorientation in an unfamiliar area. As a diving technique, progressive penetration is not taught by any of the mainstream diver training agencies. Divers engaging in penetration diving are conventionally taught to carry three lights - a primary light and two backup lights - thereby virtually eliminating the risk of completely losing light inside the wreck. Nonetheless, total loss of visibility due to a silt-out remains a risk. =Deep wreck diving= Diver returning from a wreck dive Wrecks in shallower waters tend to deteriorate faster than wrecks in deeper water due to higher biological activity. Accordingly, many of the older and larger shipwrecks that tend to offer full penetration dives tend to be deeper dives. This can present additional complications; if a wreck dive is intended to be a decompression dive, then the diver will normally carry decompression gases in side-mounted cylinders. However, it is difficult to penetrate many wrecks with both back-mounted and side-mounted cylinders, requiring divers to either use a different configuration, or leave their decompression gases outside the wreck prior to penetration. This creates the possibility of a diver being unable to relocate their decompression gases if they exit the wreck at a different point from which they enter it. =Training= Because of the increasing popularity and higher risk of wreck diving, many diver training organizations such as Scuba Diving International and the Professional Association of Diving Instructors provide specialist wreck diver training courses, which divers are advised to take before wreck diving. Such courses typically teach skills such as air management and the proper use of guidelines and reels. Most recreational diving organizations teach divers only to penetrate to at most the limit of the \\"light zone\\" or a maximum aggregate surface distance (depth and penetration) of 100 feet. Other technical diving organizations, such as IANTD, TDI and ANDI teach advanced wreck courses that emphasize a higher level of training, experience and equipment and prepare divers for deeper levels of wreck penetration. The Nautical Archaeology Society in the UK, teaches awareness of underwater cultural heritage issues as well as practical diver and archaeological skills. In this context some research projects are investigating the potentialities offered by ditigal technologies to adopt virtual replicas of the underwater wrecksite for training purposes. Other organizations, such as the Artificial Reef Society of British Columbia (ARSBC) deliberately create artificial reefs to provide features for divers to explore, as well as substrates for marine life to thrive upon. Impact of recreational scuba diving on wrecks The impact of recreational scuba diving on recreational dive values and the cultural heritage of shipwrecks has been found to comprise four basic types: *The removal of artifacts and associated disturbance to wreck sites, *Direct contact with wrecks and the benthic biota living on them by divers and their equipment, *Exhaled air bubbles trapped inside the wreckage, *Impact damage by anchors of dive boats, considered by some researchers to be the most damaging form of impact associated with recreational wreck diving.  Protection of wrecks  In many countries, wrecks are legally protected from unauthorized salvage or desecration. In the United Kingdom, three Acts protect wrecks: * Protection of Wrecks Act 1973 : certain designated, charted, historic or dangerous sites may not be dived without a license * Protection of Military Remains Act 1986 : all military aircraft and 16 designated ships are considered war graves that can only be dived with a license. Other non-designated ships may be dived providing the divers do not enter, disturb or remove artifacts * Merchant Shipping Act 1995 : all wrecks and cargoes are owned: each artifact removed must be reported to the Receiver of Wreck Wrecks that are protected are denoted as such on nautical charts (such as admiralty charts); any diving restrictions should be adhered to. Historic wrecks (often but not always defined as being more than 50 years of age) are often protected from pillaging and looting through national laws protecting cultural heritage. Internationally they may be protected by a State ratifying the Unesco Convention on the Protection of the Underwater Cultural Heritage. In this case pillaging is not allowed. One such example is the Queen Anne's Revenge which is undergoing archaeological recovery by the North Carolina Department of Natural and Cultural Resources (NC DNCR) near Beaufort Inlet, NC. In 2003 the Greek Ministry of Culture, issued a Ministerial Order classifying \\"any wreck of ship or aeroplane, sunk for longer than 50 years from the present\\" as Cultural Assets / Monuments, with a protection zone of 300 meters around them. Terms and conditions for visiting any monument in Greece are set by the Ministry of Culture. In South African waters, the wrecks of ships or aircraft, and any associated cargo, debris or artifact more than 60 years old and are protected by the National Heritage Resources Act number 25 of 1999 (NHRA). The law of salvage and finds does not apply to historical shipwrecks, which are considered by the NHRA to be archaeological material, and as such are the property of the state, administered by SAHRA in trust for the nation, and may not be disturbed in any way except under the terms of a permit issued by the South African Heritage Resources Agency (SAHRA). There are severe penalties for contravening the Act, including heavy fines and jail terms. All members of the South African Police Services, and Customs and Excise officers may act as Heritage Inspectors in terms of the Act, with powers of search, confiscation and arrest. Historical wrecks may be visited provided that the sites are not disturbed or interfered with and no artifacts are removed or damaged. Wreck diving sites Divers at the wreck of the SS Carnatic There are thousands of popular wreck diving sites throughout the world. Some of these are artificial wrecks or sunk deliberately to attract divers (such as and in Florida, in Grenada, and the wrecks of Recife in Pernambuco/Brazil which include artificial and disaster wrecks). Diver trails also called wreck trails can be used to allow scuba-divers to visit and understand archaeological sites that are suitable for scuba-diving. One excellent example is the Florida Public Archaeology Network's (FPAN) \\"Florida Panhandle Shipwreck Trail.\\" Along the Outer Banks, navigational challenges posed by the Diamond Shoals area off Cape Hatteras, caused the loss of thousands of ships and an unknown number of human lives. More than 5000 ships have sunk in these waters since record keeping began in 1526. Among the better known shipwrecks was , a participant in the Battle of Hampton Roads during the American Civil War. Monitor foundered on 31 December 1862 off Cape Hatteras. During World War II German U-boats would sit offshore and silhouette passing freighters and tankers against the lights onshore. Dozens of ships along the North Carolina coast were torpedoed in this fashion by German submarines in what became known as Torpedo Alley. Popular wrecks include the , USS Monitor, (), , , , and . Others are wrecks of vessels lost in disasters (such as in the British Virgin Islands, in Cyprus and the many shipwrecks off the Isles of Scilly in England). In the Marlborough Sounds, New Zealand, the wreck of , a cruise liner which was lost in 1986, is a popular dive site. Lying at underwater, this wreck is an excellent base for recreational and technical divers. More unusual wrecks are of structures, such as the wreck of the old cruise ship pier in Saint Croix, U.S. Virgin Islands, destroyed by Hurricane Hugo in 1989. As part of the recovery and replacement of the Frederiksted Pier, the old pier was to be removed and sunk far out at sea in deep waters. Much of the old pier was used to create an artificial reef. Several barges carried the wreckage down the beach, and dumped the wreckage of steel girders, vehicles, concrete tubes, pylons, and pavement into deep waters to create a dive site now known as Armageddon. A number of wreck diving sites relate to ships lost to wartime hostilities, such as in the Red Sea, the wrecks of Subic Bay and Coron, in the Philippines, in Vanuatu and the \\"ghost fleet\\" of Truk Lagoon. In the Andaman Islands, the Inket Wreck, where a Japanese ship sank during World War II is a dive site near Duncan Island. Some regions are particularly noted for the number and quality of wreck dive sites, such as Truk Lagoon in Micronesia, Scapa Flow in Orkney Islands, Scotland, the Outer Banks of North Carolina, known as the \\"Graveyard of the Atlantic\\", and the Great Lakes. For technical divers there are a few wrecks that have attracted widespread popularity. For years SS Andrea Doria was regarded as the pinnacle of challenges to the wreck diver, but, since the popularisation of trimix as a breathing gas, technical divers now dive deeper and more challenging wrecks, and Andrea Doria is now considered by some to be a good training wreck for trimix divers.

It is usually done while scuba diving, but can be done while diving on surface supply, snorkeling, swimming, from a submersible or remotely operated underwater vehicle, or from automated cameras lowered from the surface. Underwater photography can also be categorised as an art form and a method for recording data. Successful underwater imaging is usually done with specialized equipment and techniques. However, it offers exciting and rare photographic opportunities. Animals such as fish and marine mammals are common subjects, but photographers also pursue shipwrecks, submerged cave systems, underwater \\"landscapes\\", invertebrates, seaweeds, geological features, and portraits of fellow divers. Lighting Graph of light absorption coefficient of pure water The primary obstacle faced by underwater photographers is the loss of color and contrast when submerged to any significant depth. The longer wavelengths of sunlight (such as red or orange) are absorbed quickly by the surrounding water, so even to the naked eye everything appears blue-green. The loss of color increases not only vertically through the water column, but also horizontally, so subjects farther away from the camera also appear colorless and indistinct. This effect occurs in apparently clear water, such as that found around tropical coral reefs.Deep-six.com Color underwater Underwater photographers solve this problem by combining two techniques. The first is to get the camera as close to the photographic subject as possible, minimizing the horizontal loss of color. Many serious underwater photographers consider any more than about one yard or meter unacceptable. The second technique is the use of a flash to restore colour lost to depth. Fill flash, used effectively, \\"paints\\" in missing colors by providing full-spectrum visible light to the overall exposure.Scott Gietler Underwater Photography Guide Lighting with Strobes Another environmental effect is range of visibility. The water is seldom optimally clear, and the dissolved and suspended matter can reduce visibility by both absorption and scattering of light. Equipment Some cameras are made for use underwater, including modern waterproof digital cameras. The first amphibious camera was the Calypso, reintroduced as the Nikonos in 1963. The Nikonos range was designed specifically for use underwater. Nikon ended the Nikonos series in 2001'NIKONOS-V camera body to be discontinued', September 18, 2001, , retrieved 03/09/2012. and its use has declined, as has that of other 35mm film systems.

Canon WP- DC600 for IXUS v2 A waterproof camera and waterproof light source setup for professional underwater photography Seaview SVII Camera using three dome ports for all round view Cameras made for dry work can also work underwater, protected by add-on housings, which are made for point and shoot cameras, compact cameras with full exposure controls, and single lens reflex cameras (SLRs). Most such housings are specific to the camera. Materials range from relatively inexpensive plastic to high-priced aluminum. Housings allow many options: users can choose housings specific to their everyday \\"land\\" cameras and use any lens. Underwater photographers generally use wide-angle lenses or macro lenses, both of which allow close focus and therefore a shorter distance to the subject, which reduces the loss of clarity to scattering. Digital media can hold many more shots than standard film (which rarely has more than 36 frames per roll). This gives digital cameras an advantage, since it is impractical to change film underwater. Other comparisons between digital and film photography also apply, and the use of film under water has declined, as it has on land. Underwater housings have control knobs and buttons that reach the camera inside, allowing use of most of its normal functions. These housings may also have connectors to attach external flash units. Some basic housings allow the use of the flash on the camera, but the on-board flash may not be powerful enough or properly placed for underwater use. More-advanced housings either redirect the on-board strobe to fire a slave strobe via a fiber-optic cable, or physically prevent the use of the on-board strobe. Housings are made waterproof by silicone or other elastomer O-rings at the crucial joints and where control spindles and pushbuttons pass through the housing. High-end housings may use double O-rings on many of the critical pushbuttons and spindles to reduce the risk of leaks, which can destroy the electronics in cameras. Some cameras are inherently waterproof, or submersible to shallow depths; when these are in submersible housings, the consequences of a small leak are generally not serious. There are optical problems with using cameras inside a watertight housing. Because of refraction, the image coming through the glass port will be distorted, especially with wide-angle lenses. A dome-shaped or fish-eye port corrects this distortion. Most manufacturers make these dome ports for their housings, often designing them to be used with specific lenses to maximize their effectiveness. The Nikonos series allowed the use of water-contact optics‚Äîlenses designed to be used submerged, without the ability to focus correctly when used in air. There is also a problem with some digital cameras, which do not have sufficiently wide lenses built in; to solve this, there are housings made with supplementary optics in addition to the dome port, making the apparent angle of view wider. Some housings work with wet-coupled lenses, which are screwed on to the outside of the lens port and increase the field of view; these lenses may be added or removed under water, allowing both macro and wide-angle photography on the same dive. With macro lenses, the distortion caused by refraction is not a problem, so normally a simple flat glass port is used. Refraction increases the magnification of a macro lens; this is considered a benefit to photographers who are trying to capture very small subjects. Underwater flash Wide-angle image of French angelfish with proper balance between flash and sunlight The use of a flash or strobe is often regarded as the most difficult aspect of underwater photography. Some misconceptions exist about the proper use of flash underwater, especially as it relates to wide-angle photography. Generally, the flash should be used to supplement the overall exposure and to restore lost color, not as the primary light source. In situations such as the interior of caves or shipwrecks, wide-angle images can be 100% strobe light, but such situations are fairly rare. Usually, the photographer tries to create an aesthetic balance between the available sunlight and the strobe. Deep, dark or low visibility environments can make this balance more difficult, but the concept remains the same. Many modern cameras have simplified this process through various automatic exposure modes and the use of through-the-lens (TTL) metering. The increasing use of digital cameras has reduced the learning curve of underwater flash significantly, since the user can instantly review photos and make adjustments. Color is absorbed as it travels through water, so that the deeper you are, the less reds, oranges and yellow colors remain. The strobe replaces that color. It also helps to provide shadow and texture, and is a valuable tool for creativity. Underwater photograph using internal flash illustrating backscatter An added complication is the phenomenon of backscatter, where the flash reflects off particles or plankton in the water. Even seemingly clear water contains enormous amounts of this particulate, even if it is not readily seen by the naked eye. The best technique for avoiding backscatter is positioning the strobe away from the axis of the camera lens. Ideally, this means the flash will not light up the water directly in front of the lens, but will still strike the subject. Various systems of jointed arms and attachments are used to make off-camera strobes easier to manipulate. Strobes positioned to reduce backscatter When using macro lenses, photographers are much more likely to use 100% strobe light for the exposure. The subject is normally very close to the lens, and the available sunlight is usually not sufficient. There have been some attempts to avoid the use of flash entirely, but these have mostly failed. In shallow water, the use of custom white-balance provides excellent color without the use of strobe. In theory one could use color filters to overcome the blue-green shift, but this can be problematic. The amount of shift would vary with depth and turbidity, and there would still be a significant loss of contrast. Many digital cameras have settings that will provide color balance, but this can cause other problems. For example, an image shifted toward the \\"warm\\" part of the spectrum can create background water which appears gray, purple or pink, and looks unnatural. There have been some successful experiments using filters combined with the raw image format function on some high-end digital cameras, allowing more detailed manipulation in the digital darkroom. This approach will probably always be restricted to shallower depths, where the loss of color is less extreme. In spite of that, it can be effective for large subjects such as shipwrecks which could not be lit effectively with strobes. Macro image of a Whitemouth Moray Eel using 100% flash for the exposure Natural light photography underwater can be beautiful when done properly with subjects such as upward silhouettes, light beams, and large subjects such as whales and dolphins. Although digital cameras have revolutionized many aspects of underwater imaging, it is unlikely that flash will ever be eliminated completely. From an aesthetic standpoint, the flash emphasizes the subject and helps separate it from the blue background, especially in deeper water. Ultimately the loss of color and contrast is a pervasive optical problem that cannot always be adjusted in software such as Photoshop. Split images Another format considered part of underwater photography is the over/under or split image, a composition that includes roughly half above the surface and half underwater, with both in focus. One of the pioneers of the traditional technique was National Geographic photographer David Doubilet, who used it to capture scenes above and below the surface simultaneously. Split images are popular in recreational scuba magazines, often showing divers swimming beneath a boat, or shallow coral reefs with the shoreline seen in the background. Over/under shots present some technical challenges beyond the scope of most underwater camera systems. Normally an ultra wide angle lens is used, similar to the way it would be used in everyday underwater photography. However, the exposure value in the above water part of the image is often higher (brighter) than in the one underwater. There is also the problem of refraction in the underwater segment, and how it affects the overall focus in relation to the air segment. There are specialized split filters designed to compensate for both of these problems, as well as techniques for creating even exposure across the entire image. However, pro photographers often use extremely wide or fisheye lens that provides extensive depth of field - and a very small aperture for even more extensive depth of field; this is intended for acceptably sharp focus both on the nearby underwater subject and the more distant elements above water. An external flash can also be very useful underwater, on a low setting, to balance the light: to overcome the difference in brightness of the elements above and below the water. Over/under photos necessitate the lens or port to be partly below and partly above the surface. When bringing the outer optical surface out of the water, droplets can be left on the surface which can distort the image. This can be avoided to some extent by wiping off the droplets with a chamois leather cloth above the water and lowering the camera to working position. Keeping the port fully wet is an alternative option, which requires the shot to be taken before the water on the top part of the lens surface separates into droplets. Which approach works better will depend on the surface tension of water on the lens surface. David Doubilet explained his technique for split field images in an interview for Nikon Corporation. \\"You need to use a D-SLR and a super wide-angle or fisheye lens and a sophisticated housing that has a dome, not a flat port. Underwater images are magnified by 25 percent, and the dome will correct for that. The technique requires a small f/stop‚Äîf/16 or smaller‚Äîfor great depth of field, plus a lens capable of close-focus; you always focus on the subject below the water line. You also have to balance the light. I look for a light bottom‚Äîwhite sand is best‚Äîor a light underwater subject. I'll put the strobes down below and light the bottom and then expose for the top. If you shoot at, say, ISO 400, you'll have plenty of exposure for the top, and the strobes will take care of the bottom. Of course, you need subjects that suit the technique.\\" Digital darkroom techniques can also be used to \\"merge\\" two images together, creating the appearance of an over/under shot. Applications *Artistic photography *Records of the environment for personal and scientific purposes **Citizen science websites for recording biodiversity using underwater photographs as records, e.g. iNaturalist, Reef Life Survey, iSpot etc. Skills and training Since underwater photography is often performed while scuba diving, it is important that the diver-photographer be sufficiently skilled so that it remains a reasonably safe activity. Good scuba technique also improves the quality of images, since marine life is less likely to be scared away by a calm diver, and the environment is less likely to be damaged or disturbed. There is the possibility of encountering poor conditions, such as heavy currents, tidal flow, or poor visibility. Underwater photographers usually try to avoid these situations whenever possible. Underwater diving training providers provide courses to help improve divers' diving skills and underwater photography skills.PADI Course Flowchart Good diving skills are necessary to avoid damaging the environment when maneuvering close to benthic subjects on reefs. Some underwater photographers have been implicated in reef damage.  Scientific potential  Underwater photography has become more and more popular since the early 2000s, resulting on millions of pictures posted every year on various websites and social media. This mass of documentation is endowed with an enormous scientific potential, as millions of tourists possess a much superior coverage power than professional scientists, who can not allow themselves to spend so much time in the field. As a consequence, several participative sciences programs have been developed, supported by geo-localization and identification web sites (such as iNaturalist.org), along with protocols for auto-organization and self-teaching aimed at biodiversity-interested snorkelers, in order for them to turn their observations into sound scientific data, available for research. This kind of approach has been successfully used in R√©union island, allowing for tens of new records and even new species.

Headquartered in Washington D.C., the CWA is involved in social and political movements, through which it aims to incorporate Christian ideology. The group is primarily led by women for women, but it welcomes men who support its beliefs and efforts. The group was founded in San Diego, California in 1978 by Beverly LaHaye, whose husband Timothy LaHaye was an evangelical Christian minister and author of Battle for the Mind, as well as coauthor of the Left Behind series.Ronnee Schreiber, 'Pro-Women, Pro-Palin, Antifeminist: Conservative Women and Conservative Movement Politics', in Crisis of Conservatism? The Republican Party, the Conservative Movement, & American Politics After Bush, Gillian Peele, Joel D. Aberbach (eds.), Oxford: Oxford University Press, , 2011, p. 133 The CWA identifies itself as an amalgam of \\"policy experts and...activists[s]\\" with an anti-feminist approach to politics.  Formation  Concerned Women for America is part of a movement known as the New Christian Right. Organized in reaction to the establishment of its liberal counterpart, the National Organization for Women; the growing dispute over traditional gender roles; and the rising discussion of the Equal Rights Amendment (ERA), the CWA set out to \\"fight policies that it believe[d] [to] disrupt traditional gender roles and norms.\\" Fueling its formation, an interview between Barbara Walters and Betty Friedan, a prominent feminist activist, gained public attention in 1978 regarding women's issues.Gardiner, S., \\"Concerned Women for America: A Case Study \\", Feminism and Women's Studies, 28 August 2006. Online as of 19 April 2007. In the interview, Friedan claimed to speak as a women's group for American women. Beverly LaHaye did not believe that Betty Friedan was speaking for the majority of women because feminist views were, according to LaHaye, anti-God and anti-family. In regards to the interview, LaHaye stated that she was convinced Friedan‚Äôs goal was a \\"misguided attempt to dismantle the bedrock of American culture: the family,\\"Beverly LaHaye marks three decades of promoting traditional values through CWA Christian Examiner.com, 20 December 09. Retrieved: 14 September 2013. and that she believed Christian women were not included in discussions of women's rights. In this regard, the \\"concern\\" that the CWA had behind the name of the group was in response to the worries that feminism would \\"ruin\\" America. Such fears and opposition to much of the Democratic Party's ideology during this era led Beverly LaHaye to host a series of conventions and rallies in San Diego, resulting in Concerned Women for America's formation. As a result, the CWA became known as \\"the largest women's organization of the Christian Right during the 1980s and 1990s.\\" The CWA began with local prayer chapters mobilized around issues such as the ERA and legalized abortion. In 1987, the CWA relocated from San Diego, California to Washington, DC, at which time it formally established a national office and a national presence.  Issues  The CWA identifies itself as an organization in opposition of feminism that speaks for evangelical women who feel that the national feminist movement does not support their interests. The CWA has taken strong conservative stances on several highly debated matters. The CWA has publicly stated its opposition to issues such as abortion, sex education, same-sex marriage, euthanasia, embryonic stem cell research, needle exchange programs, pornography, cloning, drug abuse, secular education, gambling, or any other efforts which \\"intervene with natural human life.\\" The organization's stance on contraception is not as clear, however, for member's opinions on this topic vary widely. The only definite statement the CWA has put forth in regards to contraception is that its stance, as a whole, is ambiguous, but that \\"many Catholic women follow the church‚Äôs teaching on the use of contraceptives.\\" The CWA focuses on promoting its conservative, Christian-based ideology through seven \\"core issues\\". = Abortion = A few years prior to the organization's founding, the Supreme Court released its decisions regarding Roe v. Wade and Doe v. Bolton, which granted women the right to attain an abortion, and disbanded all state laws restricting such action. Because many of the CWA's members were supporters of the Right to Life Movement and strongly opposed these rulings, Concerned Women for America is recognized as a pro-life organization. At the time of its founding, the CWA, along with similar organizations which spawned during this era, identified itself as part of the \\"pro-family movement,\\" arguing that abortion defied both Christian morality and traditional family values. The CWA was a proponent of the welfare revisions set out by the 1994 \\"Contract with America\\", which aimed to reduce the frequency and acceptance of illegitimate (out of wedlock) births. These revisions suggested (1) incentivizing states to \\"reduce illegitimate births without...increas[ing] abortions\\" by way of block grants; (2) denying monetary assistance to \\"children born to unmarried minor mothers;\\" and (3) establishing a \\"family cap\\" in which unwed mothers could only be compensated for one child, all of which the CWA supported due to its strong opposition to abortion and its defense of the traditional family, as discussed below. Currently, the CWA strives to inform the public of the harm it claims that abortion has on men, women and their families. The CWA began using the common pro-life movement's rhetoric of protecting women and their health in the mid-1990s, as a way to promote interest in the pro-life movement. The CWA lobbies for defunding domestic and international family planning programs, especially those that perform abortions or provide Norplant. The CWA supports crisis pregnancy centers and post-abortion counseling services. The CWA opposes emergency contraception, such as Plan B, on the grounds that it \\"blurs the line\\" between contraception and abortion. = Same-sex marriage = As a supporter of traditional gender roles and the nuclear family, the CWA publicly defends western familialism and traditional sexual division of labor. As such, the CWA is a supporter of the sanctity of marriage and reproduction, and strongly opposes divorce. Regarding the defense of the family, the CWA was a latecomer to the opposition of the ERA. The CWA believes that the woman's place is within the home, therefore the rights set forth by the ERA threatened the traditional nuclear family. The CWA built a national network of prayer chains in opposition to the ERA. The CWA was a supporter of the Defense of Marriage Act as DOMA declared homosexual marriages to be illegal, thus supporting the CWA's ideals of both heterosexuality and marriage. The CWA believes it is a Christian's duty to start a family, explaining their general disapproval of those who do not wish to have children. More specifically, these familial ideals tie into the CWA's understanding of women and motherhood; as expressed by founder Beverly LaHaye, women have a \\"natural\\" desire to be mothers, leading to the organization's encouragement of women's domesticity through stay-at-home motherhood. The CWA opposed the 1988 Act for Better Child Care (H.R. 3660), which would have provided government-sponsored child care for families in which both parents are working. The CWA also testified against the Family and Medical Leave Act of 1993 on the premise that it was biased against those who could not afford to take leave. In support of these ideals, the CWA opposes pornography, believing that consumption of such media can disrupt traditional family values, as well as promote domestic violence. More specifically, the CWA \\"contends that pornography persuades men to demean their wives, to ruin their marriages, and to engage in illicit sexual behaviors\\". In addition, the CWA claims that the proliferation of and lack of regulation for pornography promotes gay rights and premarital sex, both of which it strongly opposes. = Religious education in public schools = Being a Christian organization, the CWA is known to promote Christian teachings in schools. The CWA believes that they must defend \\"God's truth,\\" and to do so, they advocate against \\"secular humanist\\" teachings and influence in public education. It is for these reasons that the CWA initially gained recognition as a public policy organization, for it publicly opposed the U.S. Supreme Court's rulings in 1962 and 1963, which banned religious teachings and practices, such as prayers and Bible readings, in public schools. To provide a more historical context of the organization's educational efforts, in 1983, the CWA's desire for a combination of fundamental and religious teachings was concretely displayed through a lawsuit, known today as Mozert v. Hawkins County Board of Education, which arose between parents (members of the CWA) and a local Tennessee school board. The case began when a local mother, Vicki Frost, reprimanded the administration at her daughter's school for providing students with books that discussed evolution, feminism, and telepathy, which she contended \\"could turn children away from God.\\" The dispute quickly escalated as a group of likeminded parents joined Frost and filed a federal lawsuit, resulting in the CWA's public support against the school and People for the American Way, one of its many liberal counterparts. Fearing the growth of the \\"Religious New Right,\\" the CWA claimed that students should have the right to freely exercise their religion, parents should have a voice in their child's education, and there should be greater control over schools as a whole, arguments which gained favor in the trial court in 1986. To the CWA's dismay, however, U.S. Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit reversed this decision in 1987. The CWA believes that sex education should not be taught in school, and that parents should be empowered to teach their own children about sex. However, they also concede that if it is taught in school, then it needs to be abstinence-only sex education. Many \\"sexual conservatives,\\" as Lisa McGirr refers to them in her research regarding sex education, have relied on the CWA to help them implement such ideology into the development or modification of sex education programs in schools, as well as to provide educational speakers. CWA supports teaching intelligent design in public schools and advocates school prayer, saying in a 1988 book titled America: To Pray or Not To Pray?, that since the Engel v. Vitale Supreme Court case of 1962 outlawed government-directed prayer, morality has declined in public schools and in society in general. As described above, the CWA aided the plaintiff in the 1983 case Mozert v. Hawkins, by arguing it is unconstitutional for public schools to require reading material that conflicts with the religious values of parents. In similar fashion to the Mozert case, the CWA was recognized for its support of Nathan Bishop Middle School and the Providence, Rhode Island school district in the 1992 Lee v. Weisman case. Contrary to Mozert v. Hawkins, in which the CWA protested against the school's nonsecular teaching, Lee v. Weisman resulted in support from conservative Christian organizations, such as the CWA, who fought to defend the maintenance of religious practices in public schools, such as prayer at graduation. Along with its support of the welfare revisions in the Contract with America, the CWA advocated for other amendments, such as the reinstitution of state-sponsored school prayer and \\"the eligibility of religious programs for public funding.\\" = National sovereignty = The CWA originally opposed the U.S. involvement in the United Nations, but have since accepted the UN and instead focus on the alleged dangers of conferences and treaties. The CWA has more influence in international affairs than many other conservative organizations because they are active in the UN. The CWA opposed CEDAW, The Convention on the Elimination of all Forms of Discrimination Against Women, which was adopted by the UN in 1979. They view CEDAW as a tool to undermine the traditional family and guarantee global abortion and prostitution. = Sexual exploitation = The CWA sees a problem with men becoming addicted to pornography asserting that it leads to the exploitation and victimization of women. In addition to pornography, the CWA opposes prostitution. The CWA believes that legalizing prostitution would increase sex trafficking, not decrease it as other organizations have proposed. The CWA has been actively involved in the prevention of sex trafficking; working closely with the National Organization for Women, the Family Research Council, Catholics for a Free Choice, Gloria Steinem, and Chuck Colson, the CWA has increased awareness of this issue, and was a major contributor in the establishment of The Trafficking Victims Protection Act (TVPA) in 2000. In response to Google and Mozilla's plans to test a standard which would encrypt the Domain Name System, which could possibly impede internet surveillance by law enforcement, a CWA spokesperson said \\"We believe it is important for all stakeholders in the internet ecosystem to work together to ensure that encrypted DNS does not lead to unintended consequences that harm our children.\\" = Support for Israel = On 8 May 2013 CWA's board of directors voted unanimously to include support for Israel as part of its core mission. CWA says it will support \\"laws and policies that strengthen the ties between Israel and the U.S.\\" and \\"Policies enacted by our State Department, Department of Defense and others that encourage the development of our relationship with Israel.‚Äù Penny Nancy said that support from CWA's founder, Beverly LaHaye, was the biggest driver behind the group formalizing its support for Israel. This relationship is backed by a long history of conservative Christians' support for Israel.

Retrieved: 14 September 2013.  Working through the media  In the late 1990s, the CWA garnered attention by way of its midday broadcasts on KFAX, a San Francisco- based Christian radio station. These broadcasts often featured Beverly LaHaye Live, a popular talk-show segment which spoke about the CWA's mission, morals, and aspirations for society. Today, the CWA continues to produce a daily radio show, however it is now entitled Concerned Women Today, and focuses primarily on calling members and other listeners to action by encouraging them to \\"lobby senators\\". The CWA publishes a monthly magazine called Family Voice, which chronicles their current events as well as ways in which members can become more involved with the organization.  Beverly LaHaye Institute  The Beverly LaHaye Institute (BLI) is the research arm of the CWA. BLI is considered one of the CWA's official think tanks. The BLI has a variety of research style essays and briefs that cover a wide variety of topics the CWA is interested in, most of which is published or featured on the CWA website. BLI filed an amicus brief in January 2014 in Sebelius vs. Hobby Lobby. Most of the amicus briefs in the Hobby Lobby case focused on religious freedom issues. BLI's brief had a unique focus on rebutting the government's argument that the birth control mandate imposed by Affordable Care Act would improve women's health and prevent unintended pregnancies. The BLI brief rejected a clear-cut notion of \\"intended\\" and \\"unintended\\" pregnancies. BLI argued that the government's evidence, based mostly on a 2011 Institute of Medicine report, did not prove the birth control mandate would increase use rates for birth control or that unintended pregnancies harm women's health. The brief also argued against the government's claim that the mandate promotes \\"gender equity.\\"  Culture and Family Institute  The Culture and Family Institute is one of two of the CWA's research facilities. The Culture and Family Institute, founded in 2001, is a think tank that focuses exclusively on opposition to gay rights activism.  See also  *Women in conservatism in the United States *Susan B.

It frequently refers specifically to recreational diving which takes place in darkness. The diver can experience a different underwater environment at night, because many marine animals are nocturnal. There are additional hazards when diving in darkness, such as dive light failure. This can result in losing vertical visual references and being unable to control depth or buoyancy, being unable to read instruments such as dive computers and diving cylinder contents gauges, and potential separation from the rest of the diving group, boat, or shore cover. Even with a functioning light, these hazards are still present in night diving. Backup lights are recommended.NOAA Diving Manual, 4th Edition CD-ROM prepared and distributed by the National Technical Information Service (NTIS)in partnership with NOAA and Best Publishing Company Normal requirements for night diving are a dive light, and adequate protection from exposure. Some precautions and skills for night diving include: avoiding shining the light in other divers' eyes, to be aware of and use surface light signals for bearings, and if appropriate to use an illuminated shotline buoy. A surface marker buoy with an attached strobe light or cyalume stick can be used to indicate the position of the divers to the surface team. The use of a strobe light by a diver under water can damage the night vision of other divers. Training and certification Several diver certification agencies offer specialty training in night diving, but professional diver training will usually include it in entry level training as it is considered a normal part of occupational diving.Staff, South African Department of Labour, (2007), Class IV Training Standard Revision 5.03 October 2007 Recovering divers If the team surfaces away from the boat, dive lights can be used to signal the dive boat. A surface marker buoy can be illuminated with a dive light at night to increase the visibility of the dive team to the boat. Mirrors or other reflective surfaces can also be used to increase visibility of the team on the surface.

For example: * kaikkialla means \\"everywhere\\" (literally \\"everything-at\\") * t√§√§ll√§ means \\"(at) here\\" (from t√§m√§ - \\"this\\", lit. \\"at this place\\") In Lezgian, the superessive case is marked with suffixes: sew-re-l 'on the bear'. p. 74.

He is recognized as the designer of a popular smiley graphic picture, which became an enduring and notable international icon. He never applied for a trademark for the iconic smiley image and only earned $45 for his efforts. Ball later founded the World Smile Foundation in 1999, a non-profit charitable trust that supports children‚Äôs causes. He died on April 12, 2001 after the result of liver failure.  Early life  Ball was born and raised in Worcester, Massachusetts, by his parents Ernest G. Ball and Christine or Kitty Ross Ball.Massachusetts Archives Vital Records, Birth of Harvey R Ball, 1921, vol.144, p.120 Ball had five siblings, three younger by the names of Merrit, Virginia, and Raymond, and two older by the names of Jessie and Ernest Jr.\\"United States Census, 1930,\\" database with images, FamilySearch(https://familysearch.org/ark:/61903/1:1:XQTF-P94 : accessed 10 May 2018), Ernest G Ball, Worcester, Worcester, Massachusetts, United States; citing enumeration district (ED) ED 109, sheet 20B, line 75, family 287, NARA microfilm publication T626 (Washington D.C.: National Archives and Records Administration, 2002), roll 971; FHL microfilm 2,340,706. During his time as a student at Worcester South High School, he became an apprentice to a local sign painter, and later attended the Worcester Art Museum School, where he studied fine arts.  State Mutual and the birth of the smiley  After World War II, Ball worked for a local advertising firm until he started his own business, Harvey Ball Advertising, in 1959. He designed the smiley in 1963. The State Mutual Life Assurance Company of Worcester, Massachusetts (now known as Hanover Insurance) had purchased Guarantee Mutual Company of Ohio. The merger resulted in low employee morale. In an attempt to solve this, Ball was employed in 1963 as a freelance artist, to come up with an image to increase morale. What he created was a smiley face, with one eye bigger than the other. In less than ten minutes, Harvey Ball came up with the simple yet world- changing smiley face. The simplicity of the image brought smiles to the faces of the executives, who paid him $45 for his creation. The use of the smiley face became part of the company's friendship campaign whereby State Mutual handed out 100 smiley pins to employees. The aim was to get employees to smile while using the phone and doing other tasks. The buttons became popular, with orders being taken in lots of 10,000. More than 50 million smiley face buttons had been sold by 1971, and the smiley has been described as an international icon. Ball never applied for a trademark or copyright of the smiley and earned just $45 for his work (US $315 in 2010 inflation-adjusted dollars). State Mutual, similarly, did not make any money from the design. Ball's son, Charles, is reported to have said his father never regretted not registering the copyright. Telegram & Gazette reported Charles Ball as saying \\"he was not a money-driven guy, he used to say, 'Hey, I can only eat one steak at a time, drive one car at a time.'\\"  From smiley to icon  Ball (seated) at a public signing, 07/18/1998 The phrase \\"Have a happy day\\" became associated with the smiley although it was not part of Ball's original design. Philadelphian brothers Bernard and Murray Spain designed and sold products with the phrase and logo in the early 1970s. They trademarked the combination and later changed the phrase to \\"Have a nice day\\", which itself has become a phrase in everyday use in North America. The smiley was introduced to France in 1972 as a signal of a good news story in the newspaper France Soir. Frenchman Franklin Loufrani used the image this way and made swift moves to trademark the image. His company now turns over $100 million a year and became embroiled in a copyright dispute with Walmart over the image in the 1990s. The BBC broadcast a radio documentary on 4 February 2012 called Smiley's People that covered the story of the smiley.  Promotion  On July 18, 1998, around the 35th anniversary of the design's inception, Ball appeared at That's Entertainment to meet fans and sign smiley pins and art. At this appearance Ball was shown copies of the graphic novel Watchmen issue #1, which featured a notorious image of a smiley face with a splatter of blood across it.Watchmen, DC, 1986 series, entry in the Grand Comics Database, includes picture of cover with the smiley Store Manager Ken Carson was quoted as saying Ball seemed amused to see it on the cover.  World Smile Foundation  Ball founded the World Smile Foundation in 1999 a non-profit charitable trust that supports children's causes. The group licenses Smileys and organizes World Smile Day, which takes place on the first Friday of October each year and is a day dedicated to \\"good cheer and good works\\". The catchphrase for the day is \\"Do an act of kindness - help one person smile\\".  Death and legacy  Ball died on April 12, 2001 as a result of liver failure following a short illness. He was 79. He left behind his wife for 54 years, Winifred Trudell, and four children. The land that was owned by the Ball family, off Granite Street in Worcester, was purchased by the City of Worcester in June 2007, with help from Mass Audubon and a $500,000 grant from the state Executive Office of Environmental Affairs' Division of Conservation Services. This property links Mass Audubon's Broad Meadow Brook Sanctuary with the developing Blackstone River Bikeway. It is now known as the \\"Harvey Ball Conservation Area\\" and is home to the appropriately named \\"Smiley Face Trail\\".  Distinguishing features of Ball's smiley face  Distinguishing features of a Worcester-made smiley face A Harvey Ball smiley face can be identified by three distinguishing features: Narrow oval eyes (with the one on the right slightly larger than the one on the left), a bright sunny yellow color, and a mouth that is not a perfect arc, which has been claimed to be similar to a \\"Mona Lisa Mouth\\". The face has creases at the sides of the mouth, and the mouth is slightly off-center (with the right side a little higher than the left) and the right side of the mouth is slightly thicker than on the left.

The small town on the Ammer River is known for its woodcarvers and woodcarvings, for its NATO School, and across the world for its 380-year tradition of mounting Passion Plays. History =Passion Play= The Oberammergau Passion Play was first performed in 1634. According to local legend, the play is performed every ten years because of a vow made by the inhabitants of the village that if God spared them from the effects of the bubonic plague then sweeping the region, they would perform a passion play every ten years. A man traveling back to the town for Christmas allegedly brought the plague with him by accident. The man purportedly died from the plague and it began spreading throughout Oberammergau. After the vow was made, according to tradition, not another inhabitant of the town died from the plague. All of the town members that were still suffering from the plague are said to have recovered. The play is now performed in years ending with a zero, as well as in 1934 which was the 300th anniversary and 1984 which was the 350th anniversary (though the 1920 performance was postponed to 1922 due to postwar economic conditions, and the 1940 performance was cancelled due to the onset of the Second World War in 1939). The 2020 play is being postponed to 2022 due to the outbreak of COVID-19. It involves over 2000 actors, singers, instrumentalists and technicians, all residents of the village. Geography =Tongue-twister= The name of the village (as well as that of neighbouring Unterammergau) appears in a well-known German tongue-twister, often sung as a round: * German: Heut' kommt der Hans zu mir, / freut sich die Lies. / Ob er aber √ºber Oberammergau, / oder aber √ºber Unterammergau, / oder aber √ºberhaupt nicht kommt, / ist nicht gewi√ü! * English: Hans will come join with me, / rejoices Lies. / If he comes by way of Oberammergau / or by way of Unterammergau, / or if at all he comes, / that is not sure!The ditty is geographically nonsense; since the two villages are just apart in a narrow valley, it's not possible for Hans to come to anywhere by way of one but not the other. Industry = Tourism = About half the inhabitants of Oberammergau took part in the once-a-decade Passion Play in 2010. Over 2,000 villagers performed the story of the Passion of Jesus for the audiences from around the world. This was a labor-intensive community enterprise, in which only natives of the village could participate. Performances have taken place between mid-May and early October. The play has a major economic impact on Oberammergau. There is a local expression \\"Die Passion zahlt\\" (\\"The Passion Play will pay for it\\") in explaining how the Oberammergau community financed construction of a new community swimming pool, community centre, and other civic improvements. Since 1930, the number of visitors has ranged from 420,000 to 530,000. Most tickets are sold as part of a package with one or two nights' accommodation. =Traditional art= The village is also known as the home of a long tradition of woodcarving; the Bavarian State Woodcarving School is located there. Among the celebrated former students is the German artist Wolfram Aichele. His processional church staff depicting Christ on a donkey can be seen in the church of St Peter and St Paul. The streets of central Oberammergau are home to dozens of woodcarver shops, with pieces ranging from religious subjects, to toys, to humorous portraits. Oberammergau is also famous for its \\"L√ºftlmalerei,\\" or frescoes, of traditional Bavarian themes, fairy tales, religious scenes or architectural trompe-l'≈ìil found on many homes and buildings. L√ºftlmalerei is common in Upper Bavaria and its name may be derived from an Oberammergau house called Zum L√ºftl, which was the home of facade painter Franz Seraph Zwinck (1748‚Äì1792). The village is also known for its religious art. A wooden statue of Our Lady of Good Voyage from Oberammergau stands in the Seaport Shrine in Boston, Massachusetts. Transport Oberammergau lies near the Bundesstra√üe 23, part of the Deutsche Alpenstrasse route. Its single-track, single platform railway station is the terminus of the Ammergau Railway. Several Aerial lifts climb the nearby mountains. Military The Conrad von H√∂tzendorf Kaserne was built just east of the village in 1935‚Äì37 as a base for the signals detachment (Gebirgs- Nachrichten-Abteilung 54) of the Mountain Brigade. In October 1943,Christopher, John. The Race for Hitler's X-Planes (The Mill, Gloucestershire: History Press, 2013), p.91. the barracks were taken over by the Messerschmitt company as a research and development site; of tunnels were bored into the neighboring Laber mountain for engine production facilities, and a winter sports hotel was also taken over. In all, Messerschmitt had 500 employees in the design department and about 1,300 more in the factory.Christopher, pp.155-6. At the end of the Second World War, the Messerschmitt design department was visited by both U.S. and British scientific missions, as well as by teams from Bell (who stayed for five weeks) and de Havilland.Christopher, p.156. Among the German staff interviewed by the Fedden Mission were Woldemar Voigt, Messerschmitt's chief designer, Hans Hornung, and Joseph Helmschrott.Christopher, p.157. After the war, the Americans occupied the kaserne, renaming it Hawkins Barracks and making it the primary facility of U.S. Army School Europe;Christopher, p.156. over the next three decades schools in specialties ranging from military police to nuclear weapons handling were located there. The base reverted to German Army control and its original name in 1974. NATO School, formerly NATO Weapons Systems School, the alliance's principal training and education facility on the operational level, has been located at Hawkins Barracks/H√∂tzendorf Kaserne since 1953.

Conqueror the only nuclear-powered submarine to have engaged an enemy ship with torpedoes, sinking the cruiser General Belgrano during the 1982 Falklands War.The only other submarine to sink a warship since World War II is the Pakistani Navy's PNS Hangor in 1971. Construction Conqueror was ordered on 9 August 1966 and was laid down at Cammell Laird's Birkenhead shipyard on 5 December 1967; she was launched on 28 August 1969.Moore 1985, p.617. Construction was delayed by slow working by Cammell Laird's workforce, and sabotage of the ship's gearbox, which delayed completion by several months. Conqueror was finally commissioned on 9 November 1971; she was the last nuclear submarine built by Cammell Laird.Hennessy and Jinks 2016, 300‚Äì301. Operational history =Falklands War= Conqueror, commanded by Commander Chris Wreford- Brown, was deployed during the Falklands War, setting sail from Faslane Naval Base on the Gareloch in Scotland on 3 April 1982, one day after the Argentine invasion. Conqueror arrived in the exclusion zone around the Falkland Islands 21 days later and was ordered to scan the area for Argentine shipping, particularly the aircraft carrier Veinticinco de Mayo (\\"25th of May\\"). On 30 April, she spotted the Argentine light cruiser General Belgrano sailing southwest of the Falklands, just outside the exclusion zone imposed by the British on all shipping. With Veinticinco de Mayo approaching the islands from the north, the commander of the British Taskforce, Admiral 'Sandy' Woodward, feared a pincer attack, with General Belgrano attacking from the south and Veinticinco de Mayo from the north and requested permission from the British government to sink General Belgrano. After some debate, permission to engage General Belgrano was sent to the submarine from the Royal Navy's fleet command centre in Northwood in the United Kingdom. In the intervening period, General Belgrano had retired from its attack position and turned west, since Veinticinco de Mayo was not yet ready to engage the British fleet. This would cause some controversy, although General Belgranos captain and the Argentine government acknowledged that the attack was a legitimate act of war.One Hundred Days: The Memoirs of the Falklands Battle Group Commander, Admiral Sandy Woodward. First Edition (1992). Naval Institute Press. . Belgrano legal action fails, BBC News Report, 19 July 2000 General Belgrano, sinking On 2 May Conqueror became the first nuclear-powered submarine to fire in anger, launching three Mark 8 torpedoes at General Belgrano,Conqueror was also equipped with Tigerfish torpedoes, but her captain chose to use the more reliable, 55-year-old Mark 8 design two of which struck the ship and exploded. Twenty minutes later, the ship was sinking rapidly and was abandoned by her crew. General Belgrano was unable to issue a Mayday signal because of electrical failure; this and poor visibility meant the two escorting destroyers ARA Piedra Buena and ARA Bouchard (both also ex-United States Navy vessels) were unaware of the sinking until some hours later. A total of 323 men were killed. Adding to the confusion, the crew of Bouchard felt an impact that was possibly the third torpedo striking at the end of its run (an examination of the ship later showed an impact mark consistent with a torpedo). The two ships continued on their course westward and began dropping depth charges. By the time the ships realised that something had happened to General Belgrano, it was already dark and the weather had worsened, scattering the life rafts. Conquerors war did not end there. The crew of the submarine had to face Argentine Air Force attempts to locate her in the days after the attack, which had shocked the Argentine people and ruling dictatorship. Conqueror did not fire again in anger throughout the war, but helped the task force by using sophisticated monitoring equipment to track Argentine aircraft departing from the mainland. After the war, Conqueror returned to Faslane, flying a Jolly Roger adorned with torpedoes, a customary act of Royal Navy submarines after a kill. When asked about the incident later, Commander Wreford-Brown responded, \\"The Royal Navy spent thirteen years preparing me for such an occasion. It would have been regarded as extremely dreary if I had fouled it up\\".Sandy Woodward, Patrick Robinson. One hundred days: the memoirs of the Falklands battle group commander, Naval Institute Press, 1992, , . p.161 =Operation Barmaid= Later in 1982, Conqueror completed a raid to acquire a Soviet sonar array from its Polish-flagged towing vessel. The operation, a joint mission between British and American forces, was conducted on the boundary of Soviet territorial waters. Conqueror used cutters affixed to her bow to shear through the three-inch thick wire before silently returning to her base on the Clyde. =Collision= On 2 July 1988 Conqueror was involved in a collision with the Army Sail Training Association yacht Dalriada south of the Mull of Kintyre.

Rutgers University Press, , 1972 page 67  Uses  The decomposition of T-Stoff into hot steam and oxygen caused by the addition of the catalyst Z-Stoff (an aqueous solution of permanganates) was used to drive the split-tube steam catapults which launched the V-1 flying bomb.S Zaloga, V-1 Flying Bomb 1942-52: Hitler's infamous \\"doodlebug\\". Osprey, , 2011 page 7 Similarly generated steam was used to drive the turbopump in the German V2 rocket, and the pumps in several other rocket engines. The turbopump was used to transport fuel and oxidizer liquids under pressure to the rocket engine of the V2.Oberkommando des Heeres ed., Das Ger√§t A4 Baureihe B, Berlin 1945, German. Another of T-Stoff's many uses was to be combined as the oxidizer, with C-Stoff (methanol‚Äìhydrazine‚Äìwater mixture) as the fuel, in the bipropellant Walter HWK 109-509 engine of the Messerschmitt Me 163 and Messerschmitt Me 263, at a ratio of approximately 3.1 parts T-Stoff oxidizer to one part C-Stoff fuel. Because the two substances were so visually similar, a complex testing system was developed to make sure that each propellant was put into the correct tanks of the Messerschmitt Me 163. This was because T-Stoff and C-Stoff are hypergolic propellants: they spontaneously ignite when mixed at normal temperatures. Even slight contamination between the T-Stoff oxidizer and the C-Stoff fuel was likely to cause an explosion. Catalytic decomposition of T-Stoff by Z-Stoff was also used as a monopropellant in several \\"cold\\" Walter rocket engines, including early versions of the engine for the Me 163A, and rocket-assisted takeoff pack engines like the Walter HWK 109-500.  Precautions  Because of its extreme oxidizing potential, T-Stoff was a very dangerous chemical to handle, so special rubberized suits were required when working with it, as it would react with most cloth, leather, or other combustible material and cause it to spontaneously combust.

The riots were a result of rising anti-Catholic sentiment at the growing population of Irish Catholic immigrants. The government brought in over a thousand militia‚Äîthey confronted the nativist mobs and killed and wounded hundreds. In the five months prior to the riots, nativist groups had been spreading a false rumor that Catholics were trying to remove the Bible from public schools. A nativist rally in Kensington erupted in violence on May 6 and started a deadly riot that would result in the destruction of two Catholic churches and numerous other buildings. Riots erupted again in July, after it was discovered that St. Philip Neri's Catholic Church in Southwark had armed itself for protection. Fierce fighting broke out between the nativists and the soldiers sent to protect the church, resulting in numerous deaths and injuries. Two of the 13 Catholic churches were burned. The Catholic Church sued the city and won some money for repairs. Civic leaders deplored the nativist attacks. Nationally, the riots helped fuel criticism of the nativist movement, despite denials of responsibility from nativist groups. The riots made deficiencies in law enforcement in Philadelphia and the surrounding districts readily apparent, influencing various reforms in local police departments and the eventual consolidation of the city in 1854.Patrick Grubbs, \\"Riots (1830s and 1840s)\\" Encyclopedia of Greater Philadelphia (2018) Background Bishop Francis Kenrick As Philadelphia became industrialized, immigrants from Europe, mostly Ireland and Germany, settled in the city and especially in the surrounding districts. In the areas the immigrants settled, tensions that resulted from religious, economic and cultural differences grew between residents. The majority of new arrivals were Catholic. Historian Elizabeth Geffen states: Alarmed by the rising Catholic population, Protestants and native-born Americans started organizing anti-Catholic and nativist groups. On August 26, 1842, an anonymous arsonist set ablaze the bridge of the Philadelphia and Reading Railroad Company. Immediately the responsibility was attributed to the local Irish Catholic community, sparking the founding of a Protestant Institute. The group, alongside others established in the early 1840s, distributed anti-Catholic literature and published anti-Catholic newspapers. During the 1840s, students in Philadelphia schools began the day with reading the Protestant version of the Bible. On November 10, 1842, Philadelphia's Roman Catholic Bishop, Francis Kenrick, wrote a letter to the Board of Controllers of public schools, asking that Catholic children be allowed to read the Douay version of the Bible, used by Roman Catholics. He also asked that they be excused from other religious teaching while at school.Philadelphia: A 300-Year History, pg. 357 As a result, the Board of Controllers ordered that no child should be forced to participate in religious activities and stated that children were allowed to read whichever version of the Bible their parents wished. Nativists further inflamed hostile feelings towards Catholics by reportedly twisting Kenrick's requests to the Board of Controllers as an attack against the Bible used in Protestant devotionals. Approximately one year later, a rumor was circulated that Hugh Clark, a Kensington school director who was Catholic, was visiting a girls school, where he demanded that the principal stop Bible reading in school. The story also claimed that the principal refused and that she would rather lose her job. Clark denied this version of events and claimed that after finding out several students had left a Bible reading to read a different version of the Bible, he commented that if reading the Bible caused this kind of confusion, that it would be better if it were not to be read in school. Protestants claimed that Catholics, with direct influence from the Pope, were trying to remove the Bible from schools. Kenrick issued a statement asserting, \\"It is not consistent with the laws and the discipline of the Catholic Church for her members to unite in religious exercises with those who are not of their communion.\\" Historian David Montgomery argues that the Irish Catholic Democrats in the city had successfully appealed to the upper-class Whig leadership. The Whigs wanted to split the Democratic coalition, so they approved Bishop Kenrick's request that Catholic children be allowed to use their own Bible. That approval outraged the evangelical Protestant leadership, which rallied its support in Philadelphia. Montgomery states: May riot On May 3, 1844, the American Republican Party (a precursor of the American \\"Know- Nothing\\" Party, a Protestant nativist group, and not to be confused with the modern Republican Party, which would be founded a decade later) held a meeting in a predominantly Irish part of the Kensington District, then a suburb of Philadelphia. A group of Irish residents attacked the platform where the speakers were standing, and the nativists retreated. On May 6, nativists returned in greater numbers. During the rally, it began to rain, and the meeting was moved into a nearby market. The inflammatory remarks continued inside the market, where fighting broke out between the local Irish Catholics and the nativists. Fighting spilled outside the market, where nativists were shot at by people in the windows of nearby buildings. One or two nativists were reportedly killed. George Shiffler, an 18 year old leather worker, was the first nativist killed in the riots of 1844. A mob of nativists attacked the Seminary of the Sisters of Charity and several Catholic homes before the riot ended. Numerous people were injured, and two more nativists were killed.Philadelphia: The Place and the People, pp. 346‚Äì47. District constable was powerless to stop the violence. In the 1840s, most suburban districts of Philadelphia were policed by elected constables and part-time watchmen. When violence erupted in a district, the time-consuming process involved the constable summoning the county sheriff Morton McMichael, who would organize a posse. During the May 6 violence, the posse arrived armed only with clubs and was powerless to do anything. St. Augustine's Church on fire On May 7, nativists denounced Catholics and called on Americans to defend themselves from \\"the bloody hand of the Pope.\\" A mob marched to Kensington, where gunfire broke out between nativists and Catholics. During the riot, nativist mobs set fire to and destroyed the Hibernia fire station, thirty homes and the market where the violence had begun the day before. Joseph Rice, described as a bystander, was shot dead; he is the only known Catholic killed. The violence did not end until the local state militia, commanded by General George Cadwalader, arrived and dispersed the crowd. Kenrick quickly issued a statement instructing Catholics to avoid violence and confrontations. After a brief lull, the violence continued on May 8. The nativists came back to Kensington and burned down St. Michael's Catholic Church and rectory at Second and Jefferson Streets, the Seminary of the Sisters of Charity, which had been attacked a few days before, and several homes were attacked before soldiers arrived and the fire was contained. While the riot was being contained in Kensington, another nativist mob had gathered within the borders of Philadelphia itself. They gathered at St. Augustine's Catholic Church, located on Fourth Street between Vine and New Streets. City troops were stationed by the church, and Mayor John Morin Scott pleaded for calm. The rioters threw stones at the mayor, ignored the troops and burned down the church, cheering when the steeple fell. A nearby school with a collection of rare books was also set aflame.Philadelphia: The Place and the People, pp. 348-49 The rioters did not attack an unfinished German Catholic church under construction. During the riots, at least fourteen were killed, an estimated fifty people were injured, two hundred fled their homes, and damage totaled $150,000. This is equivalent to $ in 2016 USD. In the days afterward, Mayor Scott set up a force to protect Catholic churches, and Bishop Kenrick ordered all churches to be closed the following Sunday to avoid any provocation and possible violence. Valuables were removed from the churches and hidden in homes for safekeeping. Bishop Kenrick asked Catholics to offer no resistance and urged them to wait for the law to deal with the rioters. However, in its June 18 report, a grand jury blamed an imperfect response by law enforcement and the Irish Catholics for the riots, stating that the outbreak of violence was due to \\"the efforts of a portion of the community to exclude the Bible from the public schools\\" and the disruption of legitimate meetings by immigrants.Philadelphia: The Place and the People, p. 350 Nativists said they were only responding to being attacked and were justified in their actions but were not responsible for the riots after May 6. The American Republican Party issued a statement blaming Mayor Scott, the sheriff, and the civil authorities for the riots.A History of the People of the United States: From the Revolution to the Civil War, p. 380 July riot Governor David R. Porter allowed St. Philip Neri's church to create an arsenal. On July 3, Father John Patrick Dunn of the Church of St. Philip Neri in the Southwark District was warned in advance of a planned parade by the Native American Party that the church might be attacked. The Native American Party, a nativist political party, planned to hold a large parade the next day on Independence Day. To prepare in the case of violence, the church applied for an arsenal that a volunteer company would use in case the church was attacked. Pennsylvania Governor David R. Porter authorized the formation of a company and the procurement of twenty-five muskets from the Frankford Arsenal. Major General Robert Patterson, commander of the Pennsylvania militia, put the troops on alert in case of violence. Five of the muskets placed in St. Philip Neri's Church were discovered to be defective and were sent back to the Frankford Arsenal to be repaired. There was no violence before or during the parade, but on July 5, a nativist mob numbering in the thousands gathered at the church after some observed five defective muskets being returned to the church. They then demanded that the sheriff remove the weapons, while Father Dunn and volunteers rallied to protect the church. Sheriff Morton McMichael and two aldermen searched the church and removed twelve muskets. After leaving the church, the sheriff urged the crowd to disperse and left a volunteer posse to guard the church. The mob remained, and a man who was injured in the May riots made a speech to the crowd, calling for a second search of the church. The sheriff, an alderman, and seventeen nativists entered the church and found three armed men, fifty-three muskets, ten pistols, a keg of gunpowder and ammunition. To avoid inciting the mob, the sheriff decided not to remove the armaments, and the search party stayed in the church. Just after midnight, July 6, Major General Patterson ordered a company of city guards to clear the streets. After the crowd dispersed, the arms found within the church were removed.Philadelphia: The Place and the People, p. 351 Major General Robert Patterson By midday, the crowds returned around St. Philip Neri's Church. General George Cadwalader ordered the crowds to disperse, but they did not. By the evening, the sheriff had arrived with a 150-strong posse. Throughout the evening, the military presence grew, and three cannons were stationed on the streets. The soldiers cleared the streets near the church, despite being pelted with rocks by the mob. In response to the rock throwers, General Cadwalader ordered a cannon to be fired at the crowd on Third Street. Former U.S. Congressman Charles Naylor begged the general not to fire; he and several others were arrested and held within the church. By the morning of July 7, most of the soldiers had left, but the crowds returned, being led by an alderman and the sheriff, and demanded that the remaining guard release Naylor. Everyone except Naylor was released. The crowds grew, and a cannon was brought from a nearby wharf and used to threaten the church. After further negotiations, Naylor was released and carried home to cheers on people's shoulders. After Naylor was brought home, the mob attacked the church, damaging a wall with the cannon. A second cannon was brought from the wharfs and fired at the church, after which the mob pelted the building with rocks and broke in through a side door. The soldiers fired on the men breaking into the church, who promptly retreated. After retreating, the nativists negotiated with the guard, who agreed to withdraw, allowing the nativists to guard the church. Responding to being pelted with rocks as they left, some soldiers fired back on the crowd, which only incited the mob further. The mob forced its way into the church, causing extensive damage to the interior. After about an hour, a group of twenty men organized themselves to guard St. Philip Neri's, and the mob left the church. By the evening, a large number of soldiers arrived with orders to clear the streets, only to be stoned in the process. After a captain was attacked, the order was given to fire on the mob, which resulted in seven fatalities and nine injuries. Not long after, people with muskets and cannons arrived, and fierce fighting broke out between the soldiers and the mob. The fighting lasted for several hours, with the soldiers being fired upon from alleyways and the windows of nearby buildings. The soldiers brought in two cannons of their own and fired on the mob; the mob returned fire using their own cannons, armed with items such as nails, chains, knives and broken bottles. In an attempt to capture the mob's cannons, soldiers charged one cannon's position, only to be knocked off their horses by a rope tied across the street. The cannons were all eventually captured, and by early morning on July 8, the fighting had ended.Philadelphia: The Place and the People, pp. 352-54 At least fifteen people, including rioters and soldiers, were killed in the riot, and at least fifty people were injured. Under Governor Porter's orders, state troops continued to arrive in the city in the days afterwards, but there was no further violence. An estimated 5,000 militia were used to stop violence. Troops began to withdraw from the city on July 10, and the church took over responsibility from the district of Southwark of protecting the church on July 11. As with the May riots, a grand jury blamed the Irish Catholics for the riots, but supported the military's response to the violence. Aftermath The riots had gained national attention and condemnation. The riots were used as an issue in the 1844 U.S. Presidential election, the Democratic Party condemning the growing Native American Party and the Whig Party, which the Democrats accused of being involved in the nativist movement.A History of the People of the United States: From the Revolution to the Civil War, pp. 384-85 In Philadelphia, the Native American Party ended up making a strong showing in the city's October election.Philadelphia: A 300-Year History, pp. 357-59 In New York City, there were fears nativists would target New York City's Catholic churches. Archbishop John Hughes organized defenders for the churches and told the mayor that if any Catholic churches were burned, \\"New York would be another Moscow.\\" On July 11, 1844, Philadelphia passed an ordinance that gave the city a battalion of artillery, a regiment of infantry and at least one full troop of cavalry for the purpose of providing the preservation of peace within the city when necessary. The difficulty of quelling the riots and other crime led to the Pennsylvania General Assembly to pass an 1845 act that required Philadelphia, the township of Moyamensing and the unincorporated districts of Spring Garden, Northern Liberties, and Penn to maintain a police force of one man per 150 taxable inhabitants. In 1850, another act was passed that established that the Philadelphia police force would police the city and seven surrounding districts. The inability to maintain order effectively in Philadelphia's suburbs would be an important argument for the consolidation of the city in 1854. After the riots, Bishop Kenrick ended his efforts to influence the public education system and began encouraging the creation of Catholic schools, with 17 being founded by 1860. The friars of the Church of St. Augustine sued the city of Philadelphia for not providing the church with adequate protection, claiming $80,000 in damages. The city argued that the friars could not claim their civil rights were violated, as the Order of St. Augustine was a foreign organization under the Pope. Furthermore, the city argued that the friars took a vow of poverty and could not be property owners. The Augustinians ended up proving the Order was incorporated in 1804 and was awarded $45,000. The church was rebuilt in 1848. Military casualties Among the military forces, the riots resulted in two killings, one additional death and 23 others wounded. The following were wounded unless otherwise noted as killed. Casualty of the May 1844 Riot: *State Fencibles: 2nd Lt. John S.

Life and career Born in Bristol, England, he was educated at Bristol Grammar School, and served his compulsory National Service as a clerk in Calcutta and later in the Combined Services Entertainment Unit in Singapore where he entertained the troops alongside John Schlesinger, Stanley Baxter, and Kenneth Williams, before going on to study acting at the Bristol Old Vic Theatre School. He later claimed to have studied acting because there were no dedicated courses for playwrights. While he was working as a teacher he began to write television plays which achieved notice. His first play for the stage was The Hooded Terror, part of a season of new plays at the Little Theatre in Bristol. He later wrote A Day in the Death of Joe Egg for the stage. A Day in the Death of Joe Egg is a one-set drama in music hall style. The National Health is a fantasy farce, also interrupted by vaudeville. Privates on Parade is a musical comedy, partly inspired by Nichols's own experiences in the Combined Services Entertainments Unit. Poppy takes the form of a Christmas pantomime. Despite the comic style, Nichols' plays deal with the most serious of themes. In A Day in the Death of Joe Egg the burden of raising a hopelessly handicapped child shatters a couple's marriage. The patients of The National Health suffer and die, as do the singing soldiers of Privates on Parade. In Poppy, a pantomime take on the Chinese opium wars, Dick Whittington's girlfriend becomes a drug addict. Passion Play (known as Passion in the United States), focuses on adultery and betrayal. In Blue Murder, a comic satire about play censorship, a constable investigates a death. Nichols is often considered an especially autobiographical playwright, and chronicled much of the background to his plays in his published autobiography and diaries. Joe Egg is based on Nichols' own experiences of raising a handicapped child, The National Health draws on a hospital stay of his own, while Privates on Parade draws on his own military experiences. Nichols was appointed Commander of the Order of the British Empire (CBE) in the 2018 New Year Honours for services to drama. He died on 7 September 2019 in Oxford. He was survived by his wife Thelma and three children. Plays His plays include: * Promenade, an original play for television (Granada Television, 1959) * Ben Spray, an original play for television (Granada Television, 1960) * The Hooded Terror (Rehearsed Reading) (Little Theatre, Bristol 1964) * A Day in the Death of Joe Egg (Citizens Theatre, Glasgow 1967) * The Gorge, a play in The Wednesday Play series, (BBC, 1968) * The National Health (National Theatre Company at the Old Vic, 1969) * Forget-Me-Not-Lane (Greenwich Theatre, 1971) * Chez Nous (Globe Theatre, 1974) * Harding's Luck (Greenwich Theatre, 1974) * The Freeway (National Theatre Company at the Old Vic, 1976) * Privates on Parade (Royal Shakespeare Company at the Aldwych Theatre, 1977) * Born in the Gardens (Bristol Old Vic 1970, Globe Theatre, London, 1980) * Passion Play (Royal Shakespeare Company at the Aldwych Theatre 1981, Adelphi, London 1982) * Poppy (Royal Shakespeare Company at the Barbican Theatre, 1982) * A Piece of My Mind (Nuffield Theatre, Southampton 1987, Apollo London, London, 1987) * Blue Murder (Show of Strength Theatre Company, Bristol, 1995) * So Long Life (Show of Strength Theatre Company, Bristol, 2000) * Nicholodeon (Show of Strength Theatre Company, Bristol 2000) * Lingua Franca (Finborough Theatre, London, 2010) Books *Feeling You're Behind an autobiography by Peter Nichols, Weidenfeld & Nicolson (1984) 'Whatever interest my life may have had must have been exhausted.

Along with his lifelong rival, Luis de G√≥ngora, Quevedo was one of the most prominent Spanish poets of the age. His style is characterized by what was called conceptismo. This style existed in stark contrast to G√≥ngora's culteranismo.  Biography  Quevedo was born on 14 September 1580 in Madrid into a family of hidalgosContraction of hijos de algo, meaning sons of someone or something who were a middle class of landed gentry just below the nobility from the village of Vejor√≠s, located in the northern mountainous region of Cantabria. His family was descended from the Castilian nobility. Quevedo's father, Francisco G√≥mez de Quevedo, was secretary to Maria of Spain, daughter of emperor Charles V and wife of Maximilian II, Holy Roman Emperor, and his mother, Madrid-born Mar√≠a de Santib√°√±ez, was lady-in-waiting to the queen. Quevedo matured surrounded by dignitaries and nobility at the royal court. Intellectually gifted, Quevedo was physically handicapped with a club foot, and myopia. Since he always wore pince-nez, his name in the plural, quevedos, came to mean \\"pince-nez\\" in the Spanish language.Francisco de Quevedo Biography and Analysis Portrait of Quevedo (c. 1618) by Francisco Pacheco. Orphaned by the age of six, he was able to attend the Imperial School run by the Jesuits in Madrid. He then attended university at Alcal√° de Henares from 1596 to 1600. By his own account, he made independent studies in philosophy, classical languages, Arabic, Hebrew, French and Italian. In 1601, Quevedo, as a member of the Court, moved to Valladolid, where the Court had been transferred by the King's minister, the Duke of Lerma. There he studied theology, a subject that would become a lifelong interest, and on which in later life he would compose the treatise Providencia de Dios (God's Providence) against atheism. By this time, he was becoming noted as both a poet and a prose writer. Some of his poetry was collected in a 1605 generational anthology by Pedro Espinosa entitled Flores de Poetas Ilustres (Flowers by Illustrious Poets). We can also date back to this time the first draft of his picaresque novel Vida del Busc√≥n -apparently written as an exercise in courtly wit- and a few satirical pamphlets that made him famous among his fellow students and which he would later disown as juvenile pranks. Around this time, he began a very erudite exchange of letters with the humanist Justus Lipsius, in which Quevedo deplored the wars that were ravaging Europe. The Court returned to Madrid in 1606, and Quevedo followed, remaining till 1611. By then, he was a well-known and accomplished man-of-letters. He befriended and was praised by Miguel de Cervantes and Lope de Vega, the premier playwright of the age. = Enemies = Quevedo's enemies included, among others, the dramatist Juan Ruiz de Alarc√≥n for, despite his own physical handicaps, Quevedo found Alarc√≥n's redheaded and hunchbacked physique a source of amusement. Quevedo also attacked Juan P√©rez de Montalb√°n, the son of a bookseller with whom he had quarrelled, satirizing him in \\"La Perinola\\" (\\"The Whirligig\\"), a cruel piece that he included in his book Para todos (To Everyone). In 1608, Quevedo dueled with the author and fencing master Luis Pacheco de Narv√°ez as a result of Quevedo criticizing one of Pacheco's works. Quevedo took off Pacheco's hat in the first encounter. They remained enemies all their lives. In Quevedo's Busc√≥n, this duel was parodied with a fencer relying on mathematical calculations having to run away from a duel with an experienced soldier. Quevedo could be impulsive. He was present at the church of San Mart√≠n in Madrid when a woman praying there was slapped on the cheek by another man who had rushed up to her. Quevedo seized the man, dragging him outside the church. The two men drew swords, and Quevedo ran his opponent through. The man, who died of his wounds some time later, was someone of importance. Quevedo thus retired temporarily to the palace of his friend and patron, Pedro T√©llez-Gir√≥n, 3rd Duke of Osuna. The preferred object of his fury and ridicule, however, was the poet G√≥ngora, whom, in a series of scathing satires, he accused of being an unworthy priest, a homosexual, a gambler, and a writer of indecent verse who used a purposefully obscure language. Quevedo lampooned his rival by writing a sonnet, \\"Aguja de navegar cultos,\\" which listed words from G√≥ngora's lexicon: \\"He would like to be a culto poet in just one day, / must the following jargon learn: / Fulgores, arrogar, joven, presiente / candor, construye, m√©trica, armon√≠a...\\" With the bluntness of his age, Quevedo mercilessly satirized even G√≥ngora's physique, particularly his prominent nose (most famously in the sonnet \\"A una nariz\\", [\\"To a Nose\\"]), which in his day was thought to imply a Jewish heritage, with all the shame, possible censorship, and persecution that such a connection implied in the Spain of the time. Quevedo's \\"A una nariz\\" begins with the lines: √ârase un hombre a una nariz pegado, / √©rase una nariz superlativa, / √©rase una nariz say√≥n y escriba, / √©rase un peje espada muy barbado. G√≥ngora reciprocated with almost equal virulence. = Relationships with the Duke of Osuna = About that time, Quevedo grew very close to Pedro T√©llez-Gir√≥n, 3rd Duke of Osuna, one of the great statesmen and generals of the age, whom he accompanied as secretary to Italy in 1613, carrying out a number of missions for him which took him to Nice, Venice and finally back to Madrid. There he engaged in all manner of courtly intrigue to get the viceroyalty of Naples for Osuna, an effort that finally bore fruit in 1616. He then returned to Italy in the Duke's entourage, where he was entrusted with putting in order the Viceroyalty's finances, and sent on several espionage-related missions to the rival Republic of Venice, although it is now believed these did not involve him personally. He was rewarded for his efforts with a knighthood in the order of Santiago in 1618. = Temporary exile and retirement = Casa Quevedo in Torre de Juan Abad. With the fall from favor of Osuna in 1620, Quevedo lost his patron and protector and was exiled to Torre de Juan Abad (Ciudad Real), whose fiefdom his mother had purchased for him. His supposed vassals, however, refused to acknowledge him, forcing Quevedo into an interminable legal battle with the town's council that would not be won until after his death. Quevedo would write some of his better poetry in this retirement, such as the sonnet \\"Retirado a la paz de estos desiertos...\\" or \\"Son las torres de Joray...\\". He found consolation to his failed ambitions as a courtier in the Stoicism of Seneca, his study and commentary turning him into one of the main exponents of Spanish Neostoicism. The elevation of Philip IV to the throne in 1621 meant the end of Quevedo's exile, and his return to Court and politics, now under the influence of the new minister, the Count-Duke of Olivares. Quevedo accompanied the young king in trips to Andalusia and Aragon, recounting some of its various incidents in interesting letters. At this time he decided to denounce to the Spanish Inquisition his own works, published without his consent by profiteering booksellers. It was a move to frighten off the booksellers and regain control over his writings, with a view to a definitive edition of his work that was not to come in his lifetime. He became known for a disorderly lifestyle: he was a heavy smoker, a frequent visitor to brothels and taverns, and cohabited with a woman only known as \\"Ledesma.\\" G√≥ngora derided him as a drunkard in a satirical poem as Don Francisco de Quebebo (a play on his name that can be roughly translated as \\"Don Francisco of What-I- drink.\\") None of this put a stop to his career at court, perhaps because the king had an equally rowdy reputation. In fact, in 1632 he would become secretary to the king, thus reaching the apex of his political career. His friend Antonio Juan de la Cerda, the Duke de Medinaceli, forced Quevedo to marry against his will with Do√±a Esperanza de Arag√≥n, a widow with children. The marriage, made in 1634, barely lasted three months. Quevedo filled these years with febrile creative activity. In 1634 he published La cuna y la sepultura (\\"The cradle and the sepulchre\\") and the translation of La introducci√≥n a la vida devota (\\"The introduction to a life of devotion\\") of Francis of Sales; between 1633 and 1635 he completed works like De los remedios de cualquier fortuna (\\"Of the remedies of any fortune\\"), the Epicteto, Virtud Militante, Los cuatro fantasmas (\\"The four ghosts\\"), the second part of Pol√≠tica de Dios (\\"Politics of God\\"), Visita y anatom√≠a de la cabeza del cardenal Richelieu (\\"Visit and anatomy of the head of the Cardinal Richelieu\\") or Carta a Luis XIII (\\"Letter to Louis XIII\\"). In 1635 there appeared in Valencia the most important of the numerous libels destined to defame him, El tribunal de la justa venganza, erigido contra los escritos de Francisco de Quevedo, maestro de errores, doctor en desverg√ºenzas, licenciado en bufoner√≠as, bachiller en suciedades, catedr√°tico de vicios y protodiablo entre los hombres. (\\"The Court of the rightful revenge, erected against the writings of Francisco de Quevedo, teacher of errors, doctor in shamelessness, licensed in buffoonery, bachelor in dirt, university professor of vices and proto-devil among men\\"). = Arrest and exile = Le√≥n. In 1639, he was arrested. His books were confiscated. The authorities, hardly giving Quevedo time to get dressed, took the poet to the convent of San Marcos in Le√≥n. In the monastery Quevedo dedicated himself to reading, as recounted in his Carta moral e instructiva (Moral and instructive letter), written to his friend, Ad√°n de la Parra, depicting hour by hour his prison life (\\"From ten to eleven, I spend my time in prayer and devotions, and from eleven to noon I read good and bad authors; because there is no book, despicable as it can be, that does not contain something good...\\"). Quevedo, who was frail and very ill when he left from his confinement in 1643, resigned from royal court definitively to retire at Torre de Juan Abad. He died in the Dominican convent of Villanueva de los Infantes, on 8 September 1645. One tale tells that his tomb was pillaged days later by a gentleman who wished to have the gold spurs with which Quevedo had been buried.  Style  Wall poem in Leiden Quevedo was an adherent of the style known as conceptismo, a name derived from concepto, which has been defined as \\"a brilliant flash of wit expressed in pithy or epigrammatic style.\\" Conceptismo is characterized by a rapid rhythm, directness, simple vocabulary, witty metaphors, and wordplay. In this style, multiple meanings are conveyed in a very concise manner, and conceptual intricacies are emphasised over elaborate vocabulary. Conceptismo can effect elegant philosophical depth, as well as biting satire and humor, such as in the case of the works of Quevedo and Baltasar Graci√°n. The first tercet from Quevedo's sonnet \\"¬°Ah de la vida!\\" is considered to exemplify conceptismo in poetry at its peak: :Ayer se fue, ma√±ana no ha llegado, :Hoy se est√° yendo sin parar un punto; :Soy un fue, y un ser√° y un es cansado.  Works  Monument to Quevedo in Madrid, by Agust√≠ Querol Subirats. = Poetry = Quevedo produced a vast quantity of poetry. His poetry, which was not published in book form during his lifetime, \\"shows the caricature-like vision its author had of men, a vision sometimes deformed by a sharp, cruel, violently critical nature.\\"Eugenio Florit, Introduction to Spanish Poetry (Courier Dover, 1991), 67. This attitude is of a piece with the \\"black seventeenth century\\" he lived in. Despite his satirical work, however, Quevedo was primarily a serious poet who valued love poems. His poetry gives evidence not only of his literary gifts but also of his erudition (Quevedo had studied Greek, Latin, Hebrew, Arabic, French and Italian). One of his sonnets, \\"A Roma sepultada en sus ruinas\\" (1650), was an adaptation of a French poem by Joachim Du Bellay, \\"Nouveau venu qui cherches Rome en Rome,\\" from Les Antiquit√©s de Rome (1558). His poetic works range from satirical and mythological subjects to love poetry and philosophical pieces. Quevedo constantly attacked avarice and avaricious people. His \\"Cartas del Caballero de la Tenaza\\" attack a notorious miser. He also attacked apothecaries, who had a reputation for adulterating and badly preparing medications. His love poetry includes such works as \\"Afectos varios de su coraz√≥n, fluctuando en las ondas de los cabellos de Lisi\\" (\\"Several reactions of his heart, bobbing on the waves of Lisi's hair\\"). As one scholar has written, \\"Even though women were never very much appreciated by Quevedo, who is labeled as a misogynist, it is impossible to imagine that there was anyone else who could adore them more.\\" The first four lines run as follows: : Within a curly storm of wavy gold : must swim great gulfs of pure and blazing light : my heart, for beauty eagerly athirst, : when your abundant tresses you unbind.Quoted and translated at Plaque dedicated to El Busc√≥n in Segovia. His work also employed mythological themes, typical of the age, though it also employs satirical elements, for example in his \\"To Apollo chasing Daphne\\": : Ruddy silversmith from up on high, : in whose bright beams the rabble pick their fleas: : Daphne, that nymph, who takes off and won't speak, : if you'd possess her, pay, and douse your light.Quoted and translated in Quevedo's poetry also includes pieces such as an imagined dedication to Columbus by a piece of the ship in which the navigator had discovered the New World: : Once I had an empire, wanderer, : upon the billows of the salty sea; : I was moved by the wind and well-respected, : to southern lands I forged an opening.Quoted and translated in . = Novel = The only novel written by Quevedo is the picaresque Vida del Busc√≥n or El Busc√≥n (Full title: Historia de la vida del Busc√≥n, llamado Don Pablos, ejemplo de vagamundos y espejo de taca√±os (1626). The work is divided into three books. The novel was popular in English; it was first translated by John Davies in 1657 under the title The Life and Adventures of Buscon the Witty Spaniard, a second edition appearing in 1670.https://books.google.com/books?id=rHRnAAAAcAAJ New translations appeared in 1683 and 1707.https://books.google.com/books?id=5-s8AAAAIAAJ&pg;=PA1968-IA91 = Theological works = Obras de don Francisco de Quevedo Villegas, 1699 Quevedo produced about 15 books on theological and ascetic subjects. These include La cuna y la sepultura (1612; \\"The Cradle and the Grave\\") and La providencia de Dios (1641; \\"The Providence of God\\"). = Literary criticism = His works on literary criticism include La culta latiniparla (\\"The Craze for Speaking Latin\\") and Aguja de navegar cultos (Compass for Navigating among Euphuistic Reefs). Both works were written with the purpose of attacking culteranismo. = Satire = Quevedo's satire includes Sue√±os y discursos, also known as Los Sue√±os (1627; \\"Dreams and Discourses\\"). Quevedo employed much word-play in this work, which consists of five \\"dream-visions.\\" The first is \\"The Dream of the Last Judgment\\", in which Quevedo finds himself witnessing the Day of Judgment, and closes with a glimpse of Hell itself. The second dream is \\"The Bedeviled Constable\\" in which constable is possessed by an evil spirit, which results in the evil spirit begging to be exorcised, since the constable is more evil of the two. The third dream is the long \\"The Vision of Hell\\". The fourth dream-vision is called \\"The World from the Inside\\". The last dream is \\"The Dream of Death\\", in which Quevedo offers examples of man's dishonest ways.Dreams and Discourses ‚Äì Francisco de Quevedo In the Dreams, the somewhat misanthropic Quevedo showcased his antipathy for numerous groups, including but not limited to tailors, innkeepers, alchemists, astrologers, women, the Genovese, Protestants, constables, accountants, Jews, doctors, dentists, apothecaries, and hypocrites of all kinds. He wrote too, in a satirical tone, La hora de todos y la Fortuna con seso (1699), with many political, social and religious allusions. He shows his ability in the use of language, with word- play and fantastic and real characters. La Isla de los Monopantos, a virulently antisemitic tale in the book portraying a secret Jewish plot to destroy Christendom with the assistance of the Monopanto chief Pragas Chincollos (a satirical portrayal of the Count-Duke of Olivares), is believed by some to have been a key influence in Hermann Goedsche's novel Biarritz, one of the unacknowledged sources of The Protocols of the Elders of Zion. = Political works = His political works include La pol√≠tica de Dios, y gobierno de Cristo (1617‚Äì1626; \\"The Politics of the Lord\\") and La vida de Marco Bruto (1632‚Äì1644; \\"The Life of Marcus Brutus\\"). According to writers Javier Mart√≠nez-Pinna and Diego Pe√±a in his writings he always manifested an obsession for the defense of the country, being convinced of the necessity and inevitability of the hegemony of Spain in the world, something that in the full Spanish decline had to do him much harm. It was also integrated in the tradition of laus Hispaniae, established by San Isidoro and used by Quevedo himself to try to recover the values that he thought, made the nation powerful. In a series of works like his defended Spain, he praised the greatness of his most prestigious compatriots, highlighting the Spanish superiority in the field of letters, visible in authors such as Fray Luis de Le√≥n, Jorge Manrique or Garcilaso de la Vega, but also in the art of war, making possible the victory of Castilian weapons in their confrontations against Arabs and other European powers during the sixteenth century  Popular culture  *In Giannina Braschi's novel Yo-Yo Boing! contemporary Latin American poets have a heated, drunken debate about Quevedo's profile in defining the Spanish Golden Age. *Quevedo is a main character of Captain Alatriste's books written by Arturo P√©rez-Reverte. In the movie Alatriste, he was played by Juan Echanove. *He is also a main character in the alternate history novel 1635: The Cannon Law by Eric Flint and Andrew Dennis. * And he is a main character in the 2013 novel \\"Sudden Death\\" (Spanish title \\"Muerte subita\\") by Alvaro Enrigue, where he is pitted in a tennis match against the Italian Baroque painter Caravaggio.

The tale has been adapted to various media including opera, musical, and animated film. The tale is completely Andersen's invention and owes no debt to fairy tales or folklore. Plot When the story begins, a mother duck's eggs hatch. One of the little birds is perceived by the other birds and animals on the farm as an ugly little creature and suffers much verbal and physical abuse from them. He wanders sadly from the barnyard and lives with wild ducks and geese until hunters slaughter the flocks. He finds a home with an old woman, but her cat and hen tease and taunt him mercilessly and once again he sets off alone. The duckling sees a flock of migrating wild swans. He is delighted and excited, but he cannot join them, for he is too young and cannot fly. Winter arrives. A farmer finds and carries the freezing little duckling home, but the foundling is frightened by the farmer‚Äôs noisy children and flees the house. He spends a miserable winter alone in the outdoors, mostly hiding in a cave on the lake that partly freezes over. When spring arrives, a flock of swans descends on the lake. The ugly duckling, now having fully grown and matured, is unable to endure a life of solitude and hardship any more and decides to throw himself at the flock of swans deciding that it is better to be killed by such beautiful birds than to live a life of ugliness and misery. He is shocked when the swans welcome and accept him, only to realize by looking at his reflection in the water that he had been, not a duckling, but a swan all this time. The flock takes to the air, and the now beautiful swan spreads his gorgeous large wings and takes flight with the rest of his new family. Composition and publication history Andersen first conceived the story in 1842 while enjoying the beauty of nature during his stay at the country estate of Bregentved, and lavished a year's worth of attention upon it. He initially considered \\"The Young Swans\\" as the tale's title but, not wanting to spoil the element of surprise in the protagonist‚Äôs transformation, discarded it for \\"The Ugly Duckling\\". He later confessed that the story was \\"a reflection of my own life\\", and, when the critic Georg Brandes questioned Andersen about whether he would write his autobiography, the poet claimed that it had already been written ‚Äî \\"The Ugly Duckling\\". ‚ÄúThe Ugly Duckling‚Äù was first published in Copenhagen, Denmark 11 November 1843 in New Fairy Tales. First Book. First Collection. 1844. (Nye Eventyr. F√∏rste Bind. F√∏rste Samling. 1844.). For the first time the phrase \\"told for children\\" was not part of the title--an omission Andersen scholar Jackie Wullschlager believes exhibited a new confidence on Andersen's part: \\"These [tales] were the most mature and perfectly constructed tales he had written, and though some of them at once became, and have remained, favorites of children, Andersen here melds together the childlike and the profound with exceptional artistry.\\" The first edition of 850 was sold out by December 18, and Reitzel planned another 850. The tale was fourth and last in the volume that included (in contents order), \\"The Angel\\" (\\"Englen\\"), \\"The Nightingale\\" (\\"Nattergalen\\"), and \\"The Sweethearts; or, The Top and the Ball\\" (\\"Kj√¶restefolkene [Toppen og bolden]\\"). The volume sold out almost immediately and Andersen wrote on December 18, 1843: ‚ÄúThe book is selling like hot cakes. All the papers are praising it, everyone is reading it! No books of mine are appreciated in the way these fairy tales are!‚Äù Andersen promoted the tale by reading it aloud at social gatherings. The tale was republished 18 December 1849 in Fairy Tales. 1850. (Eventyr. 1850.) and again 15 December 1862 in Fairy Tales and Stories. First Volume. 1862. (Eventyr og Historier. F√∏rste Bind. 1862.) The tale has since been translated into various languages and published around the world and has become the most famous story by Andersen. Commentaries and criticism A pair of young swans (or cygnets) In reviewing Hans Christian Andersen: A New Life by biographer Jens Andersen, British journalist Anne Chisholm writes ‚ÄúAndersen himself was a tall, ugly boy with a big nose and big feet, and when he grew up with a beautiful singing voice and a passion for the theater he was cruelly teased and mocked by other children\\". The ugly duckling is the child of a swan whose egg accidentally rolled into a duck's nest. Speculation suggests that Andersen was the illegitimate son of Prince Christian Frederik (later King Christian VIII of Denmark), and found this out some time before he wrote the book, and then that being a swan in the story was a metaphor not just for inner beauty and talent but also for secret royal lineage. Bruno Bettelheim observes in The Uses of Enchantment that the Ugly Duckling is not confronted with the tasks, tests, or trials of the typical fairy tale hero. ‚ÄúNo need to accomplish anything is expressed in ‚ÄúThe Ugly Duckling‚Äù. Things are simply fated and unfold accordingly, whether or not the hero takes some action.‚Äù In conjunction with Bettelheim‚Äôs assessment, Maria Tatar notes in ‚Äô‚ÄôThe Annotated Hans Christian Andersen‚Äô‚Äô that Andersen suggests that the Ugly Duckling's superiority resides in the fact that he is of a breed different from the barnyard rabble, and that dignity and worth, moral and aesthetic superiority are determined by nature rather than accomplishment. According to Carole Rosen, the story was inspired in part by Andersen's friend Jenny Lind. Adaptations Disney's 1931 version Disney's 1939 version \\"The Ugly Duckling\\" became one of Andersen's best loved tales and was reprinted around the world. The tale was adapted to a variety of media. Films based on the tale include two Silly Symphonies animated shorts produced by Walt Disney called The Ugly Duckling. The first was produced in 1931 in black and white, and a remake in 1939 in Technicolor. The latter film won the 1939 Academy Award for Best Short Subject (Cartoons), and was the last Silly Symphony to be made. The main difference between the Andersen story and the Disney version is that, in the latter, the little bird's ordeal lasts for only a few minutes, not for months. In 1936, the Fleischer brothers adapted the story for their animated short \\"The Little Stranger\\", reversing the story by having an odd chick born into a family of ducks. In 1956, the Soviet animation studio Soyuzmultfilm produced its own 19 minutes version of The Ugly Duckling.The Ugly Duckling at Animator.ru The anime Princess Tutu is about a duck that turns into a swan- like ballerina. In 2006, the Danish animation studio A. Film produced a spin- off CG feature called The Ugly Duckling and Me!, and later produced a children's CG television series Ugly Duckling Junior which featured the same characters as the movie. The 1954 Tom and Jerry cartoon Downhearted Duckling is also based on the famous story. The tale has seen various musical adaptations. In 1914, the Russian composer Sergei Prokofiev composed a work for voice and piano based on Nina Meshcherskaya's adaptation of the tale and, in 1932, arranged the work for voice and orchestra. This was transcribed by Lev Konov in 1996, and his opera was a great success in Russia. Other musical versions include the song ‚ÄúThe Ugly Duckling‚Äù composed by Frank Loesser and sung by Danny Kaye for the 1952 Charles Vidor musical film Hans Christian Andersen, and Honk!, a musical based on the tale which was produced in Britain and won an Olivier Award. The tale was adapted to a musical by Gail Deschamps and Paul Hamilton with a planned United States tour 2002-2003. In 1998, the musical played the Piccolo Spoleto for seventeen days. In 1999, Jerry Pinkney adapted the story as a children's picture book. In 2009, the Dance Theatre of Bradenton, Florida, presented the ballet version of the popular tale (Allison Norton: The Ugly Duckling). In 2010, Garri Bardin directed a feature-length stop-motion musical of the story set to Tchaikovsky's ballet music. In 2012, a musical adaptation of the story, with ten original songs, was released by JJ‚Äôs Tunes & Tales. The album, titled ‚ÄúThe Ugly Duckling: Story with Songs‚Äù contains both songs and spoken narration, and was released independently on CD Baby and iTunes. Examples of song titles include: Hatching of the Eggs; A Better Place; Song of the Swans; What‚Äôs the Matter with You; It‚Äôs a Big, Big World; Pretty Good Place to Live. GivingTales ‚Äì in 2015 a storytelling app for children was created in aid of Unicef. The Ugly Duckling read by Stephen Fry is included in this collection of fairy tales along with other stories.

The theory of complex-valued numerical functions on the p-adic numbers is part of the theory of locally compact groups. The usual meaning taken for p-adic analysis is the theory of p-adic-valued functions on spaces of interest. Applications of p-adic analysis have mainly been in number theory, where it has a significant role in diophantine geometry and diophantine approximation. Some applications have required the development of p-adic functional analysis and spectral theory. In many ways p-adic analysis is less subtle than classical analysis, since the ultrametric inequality means, for example, that convergence of infinite series of p-adic numbers is much simpler. Topological vector spaces over p-adic fields show distinctive features; for example aspects relating to convexity and the Hahn‚ÄìBanach theorem are different. Important results =Ostrowski's theorem= Ostrowski's theorem, due to Alexander Ostrowski (1916), states that every non- trivial absolute value on the rational numbers Q is equivalent to either the usual real absolute value or a -adic absolute value. =Mahler's theorem= Mahler's theorem, introduced by Kurt Mahler, expresses continuous p-adic functions in terms of polynomials. In any field, one has the following result. Let :(\\\\Delta f)(x)=f(x+1)-f(x) be the forward difference operator. Then for polynomial functions f we have the Newton series: :f(x)=\\\\sum_{k=0}^\\\\infty (\\\\Delta^k f)(0){x \\\\choose k}, where :{x \\\\choose k}=\\\\frac{x(x-1)(x-2)\\\\cdots(x-k+1)}{k!} is the kth binomial coefficient polynomial. Over the field of real numbers, the assumption that the function f is a polynomial can be weakened, but it cannot be weakened all the way down to mere continuity. Mahler proved the following result: Mahler's theorem: If f is a continuous p-adic-valued function on the p-adic integers then the same identity holds. =Hensel's lemma= Hensel's lemma, also known as Hensel's lifting lemma, named after Kurt Hensel, is a result in modular arithmetic, stating that if a polynomial equation has a simple root modulo a prime number , then this root corresponds to a unique root of the same equation modulo any higher power of , which can be found by iteratively \\"lifting\\" the solution modulo successive powers of . More generally it is used as a generic name for analogues for complete commutative rings (including p-adic fields in particular) of the Newton method for solving equations. Since p-adic analysis is in some ways simpler than real analysis, there are relatively easy criteria guaranteeing a root of a polynomial. To state the result, let f(x) be a polynomial with integer (or p-adic integer) coefficients, and let m,k be positive integers such that m ‚â§ k. If r is an integer such that :f(r) \\\\equiv 0 \\\\pmod{p^k} and f'(r) ot\\\\equiv 0 \\\\pmod{p} then there exists an integer s such that :f(s) \\\\equiv 0 \\\\pmod{p^{k+m}} and r \\\\equiv s \\\\pmod{p^{k}}. Furthermore, this s is unique modulo pk+m, and can be computed explicitly as :s = r + tp^k where t = - \\\\frac{f(r)}{p^k} \\\\cdot (f'(r)^{-1}). Applications =P-adic quantum mechanics= P-adic quantum mechanics is a relatively recent approach to understanding the nature of fundamental physics. It is the application of p-adic analysis to quantum mechanics. The p-adic numbers are an intuitive arithmetic system (but geometrically counterintuitive) that was discovered by German mathematician Kurt Hensel in about 1899 and by German mathematician Ernst Kummer(1810-1893) earlier in elementary form. The closely related adeles and ideles were introduced in the 1930s by Claude Chevalley and Andr√© Weil. Their study has now transformed into a major branch of mathematics. They were occasionally applied to the physical sciences, but it wasn't until a publication by the Russian mathematician Volovich in 1987 that the subject was taken seriously in the physics world.I.V.Volovich, Number theory as the ultimate theory, CERN preprint, CERN-TH.4791/87 There are now hundreds of research articles on the subject,V. S. Vladimirov, I.V. Volovich, and E.I. Zelenov P-adic Analyisis and Mathematical Physics, (World Scientific, Singapore 1994)L. Brekke and P. G. O. Freund, P-adic numbers in physics, Phys. Rep. 233, 1-66(1993) along with international journals as well. There are two main approaches to the subject. The first considers particles in a p-adic potential well, and the goal is to find solutions with smoothly varying complex-valued wavefunctions. Here the solutions are to have a certain amount of familiarity from ordinary life. The second considers particles in p-adic potential wells, and the goal is to find p-adic valued wavefunctions. In this case, the physical interpretation is more difficult. Yet the math often exhibits striking characteristics, therefore people continue to explore it. The situation was summed up in 2005 by one scientist as follows: \\"I simply cannot think of all this as a sequence of amusing accidents and dismiss it as a 'toy model'. I think more work on this is both needed and worthwhile.\\" =Local‚Äìglobal principle= Helmut Hasse's local‚Äìglobal principle, also known as the Hasse principle, is the idea that one can find an integer solution to an equation by using the Chinese remainder theorem to piece together solutions modulo powers of each different prime number. This is handled by examining the equation in the completions of the rational numbers: the real numbers and the p-adic numbers. A more formal version of the Hasse principle states that certain types of equations have a rational solution if and only if they have a solution in the real numbers and in the p-adic numbers for each prime p.

The album peaked at number 9 in the UK albums chartOfficial Charts Company and at number 17 on the Billboard 200. It was the last album recorded by the group before their initial breakup. Background and content In January 1968, after some initial success in Britain with their debut album Mr. Fantasy, Dave Mason had departed from the group. He produced the debut album by the group Family, containing in its ranks future Traffic bass player Ric Grech, while Traffic went on the road.Traffic, 1999 reissue Island Records IMCD 265 546498-2, liner notes p. 4. In May, the band had invited Mason back to begin recording the new album. Mason ended up writing and singing half of the songs on the album (including his biggest hit \\"Feelin' Alright?\\"), but making scant contribution to the songs written by Jim Capaldi and Steve Winwood. His flair for pop melody had always been at odds with the others' jazz ambitions, evidenced by the dichotomy seen for the songs on this album, and by October he was again out of the band.Nick Logan and Bob Woffinden, editors. The Illustrated New Musical Express Encyclopedia of Rock. New York: Harmony Books, 1977, p. 234. He would return one more time for a tour and album in 1971 to run out the band's contract.

It is meant to help readers understand an issue, solve a problem, or make a decision. The initial British term, concerning a type of government- issued document, has proliferated, taking a somewhat new meaning in business. In business, a white paper is closer to a form of marketing presentation, a tool meant to persuade customers and partners and promote a product or viewpoint. White papers may be considered grey literature.  In government  The term white paper originated with the British government, and many point to the Churchill White Paper of 1922 as the earliest well-known example under this name. Gertrude Bell, the British explorer and diplomat, was the first woman to author a White Paper. Her 149-page report was entitled \\"Review of the Civil Administration of Mesopotamia\\" and was presented to Parliament in 1920. In British government it is usually the less extensive version of the so- called blue book, both terms being derived from the colour of the document's cover. White papers are a \\"tool of participatory democracy ... not [an] unalterable policy commitment\\".Doerr, Audrey D. The Role of White Papers. In: Doern, G. B. and Peter Aucoin. The Structures of Policy-making in Canada. Toronto, MacMillan, 1971. pp. 179‚Äì203. \\"White papers have tried to perform the dual role of presenting firm government policies while at the same time inviting opinions upon them.\\"Pemberton, John E. Government Green Papers. Library World 71:49 Aug. 1969. In Canada, a white paper is \\"a policy document, approved by Cabinet, tabled in the House of Commons and made available to the general public\\".Doerr, Audrey D. The Role of White Papers in the Policy-making Process: the Experience of the Government of Canada. 1973. Thesis (Ph.D.) ‚Äì Carleton University. 1. 56. The \\"provision of policy information through the use of white and green papers can help to create an awareness of policy issues among parliamentarians and the public and to encourage an exchange of information and analysis. They can also serve as educational techniques.\\"Doerr, Audrey D. The Machinery of Government. Toronto, Methuen, 1981. p. 153. White papers are a way the government can present policy preferences before it introduces legislation. Publishing a white paper tests public opinion on controversial policy issues and helps the government gauge its probable impact.Chapin, Henry and Denis Deneau. Citizen involvement in Public Policy-making: Access and the Policy-making Process. Ottawa, Canadian Council on Social Development, 1978. p. 33. By contrast, green papers, which are issued much more frequently, are more open-ended. Also known as consultation documents, green papers may merely propose a strategy to implement in the details of other legislation, or they may set out proposals on which the government wishes to obtain public views and opinion. Examples of governmental white papers include, in Australia, the White Paper on Full Employment and, in the United Kingdom, the White Paper of 1939 and the 1966 Defence White Paper. In Israeli history, the White Paper of 1939 ‚Äì marking a sharp turn against Zionism in British policy and at the time greeted with great anger by the Jewish Yishuv community in Mandatory Palestine ‚Äì is remembered as \\"The White Paper\\" (in Hebrew Ha'Sefer Ha'Lavan ‚Äì literally \\"The White Book\\").  In business-to-business marketing  Since the early 1990s, the terms \\"white paper\\" or \\"whitepaper\\" have been applied to documents used as marketing or sales tools in business. These white papers are long-form content designed to promote the products or services from a specific company. As a marketing tool, these papers use selected facts and logical arguments to build a case favorable to the company sponsoring the document. B2B (business-to- business) white papers are often used to generate sales leads, establish thought leadership, make a business case, grow email lists, grow audiences, increase sales\\"what is a white paper\\", or inform and persuade readers. The audiences for a B2B white paper can include prospective customers, channel partners, journalists, analysts, investors, or any other stakeholders. White papers are considered to be a form of content marketing or inbound marketing; in other words, sponsored content available on the web with or without registration, intended to raise the visibility of the sponsor in search engine results and build web traffic. Many B2B white papers argue that one particular technology, product or methodology is superior to all others for solving a specific business problem. They may also present research findings, list a set of questions or tips about a certain business issue, or highlight a particular product or service from a vendor. There are, essentially, three main types of commercial white papers: *Backgrounder: Describes the technical or business benefits of a certain vendor's offering; either a product, service, or methodology. This type of white paper is best used to supplement a product launch, argue a business case, or support a technical evaluation at the bottom of the sales funnel or the end of the customer journey. This is the least challenging type to produce, since much of the content is readily available in-house at the sponsor. *Numbered list: Presents a set of tips, questions, or points about a certain business issue. This type is best used to get attention with new or provocative views, or cast aspersions on competitors. Also called a listicle this is the fastest type to create; a numbered list can often be devised from a single brainstorming session, and each item can be presented as an isolated point, not part of any step-by-step logical argument. *Problem/solution: Recommends a new, improved solution to a nagging business problem. This type is best used to generate leads at the top of the sales funnel or the start of the customer journey, build mind share, or inform and persuade stakeholders, building trust and credibility in the subject. This is the most challenging type to produce, since it requires research gathered from third-party sources and used as proof points in building a logical argument. While a numbered list may be combined with either other type, it is not workable to combine a backgrounder with a problem/solution white paper. While a backgrounder looks inward at the details of one particular product or service, a problem/solution looks outward at an industry-wide problem. This is rather like the difference between looking through a microscope and looking through a telescope. Variants Several variations on the colour theme exist: * The green paper is a proposal or consultative document rather than being authoritative or final. Two others are much less well established: * A blue paper sets out technical specifications of a technology or item of equipment. * A yellow paper is a document containing research that has not yet been formally accepted or published in an academic journal. It is synonymous to the more widely used term preprint.

Carmine ( or ), also called cochineal (for the insect from which it is extracted), cochineal extract, crimson lake or carmine lake, natural red 4, C.I. 75470, or E120, is a pigment of a bright-red color obtained from the aluminium complex derived from carminic acid. It is also a general term for a particularly deep-red color.  Etymology  The English word \\"carmine\\" is derived from the French word carmin (12th century), from Medieval Latin carminium, from Persian qirmiz (\\"crimson\\"), which itself derives from Middle Persian carmir (\\"red, crimson\\"). The Persian term carmir likely cognates with Sanskrit krimiga (\\"insect-produced\\"), from krmi (\\"worm, insect\\"). The Persian word for \\"worm, insect\\" is kirm, and in Iran (Persia) the red colorant carmine was extracted from the bodies of dead female insects such as Kermes vermilio and cochineal.Purinton, N., & Watters, M. (1991). A Study of the Materials Used by Medieval Persian Painters. Journal of the American Institute for Conservation, 30(2), 125-144. The form of the term may also have been influenced in Latin by minium (\\"red lead, cinnabar\\"), said to be of Iberian origin. The word \\"carmine\\" has been used as a color name as early as 1799. It is a popular food color, used in yogurt, candy and certain brands of juice, the most notable ones being those of the ruby-red variety. Production A cluster of Dactylopius coccus females growing in Barlovento, Canary Islands Zapotec nests on Opuntia ficus-indica host cacti staining agent in histology (here on a worm) The pigment is produced from carminic acid, which is extracted from some scale insects such as the cochineal scale and certain Porphyrophora species (Armenian cochineal and Polish cochineal). Carmine is a colorant used in the manufacture of artificial flowers, paints, crimson ink, rouge and other cosmetics, and some medications. To prepare carmine, the powdered scale insect bodies are boiled in an ammonia or sodium carbonate solution. After separating the insoluble matter, the extract is treated with alum to precipitate the red solid. This precipitate is called \\"carmine lake\\" or \\"crimson lake\\" (the lake here deriving from the word lac, referring to a resinous secretion). Purity of color is ensured by the absence of iron. Stannous chloride, citric acid, borax, or gelatin may be added to modify the precipitation. The traditional crimson color is affected not only by carminic acid but also by choice of its chelating metal salt ion. For shades of purple, lime is added to the alum. Properties and uses As confirmed by reflectance spectroscopy, carmine reflects mostly red light, i.e., wavelengths longer than about 603 nm. Carmine can be used in histology, as Best's carmine to stain glycogen, mucicarmine to stain acidic mucopolysaccharides, and carmalum to stain cell nuclei. In these applications, it is applied together with a mordant, usually an Al(III) salt. Carmine was used in dyeing textiles and in painting since antiquity. It is not very stable in oil paint, and its use ceased after new and better red pigments became available. Jacopo Tintoretto used carmine in several of his paintings, including Portrait of Vincenzo MorosiniTintoretto, Portrait of Vincenzo Morosini, at ColourLex and Christ Washing the Feet of the Disciples. Regulations for use in foods The extract of carmine was used from the Middle Ages until the 19th century to make crimson dye. Now it is used as a coloring for yogurt and other food products =United States= In January 2006, the United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) evaluated a proposal that would require food products containing carmine to list it by name on the ingredient label.Docket No. 1998P‚Äì0724, formerly 98P‚Äì0724; RIN 0910‚ÄìAF12. Listing of Color Additives Exempt From Certification; Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Labeling: Cochineal Extract and Carmine Declaration. It was also announced that the FDA will separately review the ingredient labels of prescription drugs that contain colorings derived from carmine. A request from the Center for Science in the Public Interest urging the FDA to require ingredient labels to explicitly state that carmine is derived from insects and may cause severe allergic reactions and anaphylactic shock was declined by the FDA. Food industries were aggressively opposed to the idea of writing \\"insect- based\\" on the label, and the FDA agreed to allow \\"cochineal extract\\" or \\"carmine\\". =European Union= In the European Union, the use of carmine in foods is regulated under the European Commission's directives governing food additives in general and food dyes in particular and listed under the names Cochineal, Carminic acid, Carmines and Natural Red 4 as additive E 120 in the list of EU-approved food additives. The directive governing food dyes approves the use of carmine for certain groups of foods onlya list of approved uses is included in Annexes I and III of EU-Directive 94/36 and specifies a maximum amount which is permitted or restricts it to the quantum satis. The EU- Directive 2000/13/EC on food labeling mandates that carmines (like all food additives) must be included in the list of ingredients of a food product with its additive category and listed name or additive number, that is either as Food colour carmines or as Food colour E 120 in the local language(s) of the market(s) the product is sold in. , EFSA has changed the way they allow use of Carmine E120 for pharmaceutical products. The EFSA had raised concerns over the increasing number of allergic reactions to carmine derived from insects (E120.360), when used within the British Pharmacopoeia. Pharmaceutical products which had previously contained insect-derived carmine, have been replaced with a synthesized version of the food colorant. Internal studies have shown that the new formulations of popular anti-nausea and weight-gain liquid medication had a significantly lower risk in terms of allergic reactions. The new formulation is known to be of plant origin, using calcium oxide in order to gauge color depth.

The Archbishop of Wales does not have a fixed archiepiscopal see, but serves concurrently as one of the six diocesan bishops. The position is currently held by John Davies, Bishop of Swansea and Brecon. Unlike the Church of England, the Church in Wales is not an established church. Disestablishment took place in 1920 under the Welsh Church Act 1914.Eighteen cross-border parishes remained in the Church of England and were exempt from disestablishment, The First Report of the Commissioners for Church Temporalities in Wales (1914‚Äì16) Cd 8166, p 5; Second Report of the Commissioners for Church Temporalities in Wales (1917‚Äì18) Cd 8472 viii 93, p 4 As a province of the Anglican Communion, the Church in Wales recognises the Archbishop of Canterbury as a focus of unity but without any formal authority.Except for residual roles ‚Äî in ecclesiastical court to try the archbishop, as metropolitan; and the appointment of notaries, and the granting of Special Marriage Licences, s.6, Welsh Church (Temporalities) Act 1919. Both these functions formed part of the jurisdiction of the Papal Legate which were transferred to the Archbishop of Canterbury at the Reformation. A cleric of the Church in Wales can be appointed to posts in the Church of England, including the See of Canterbury; the former Archbishop of Canterbury, Rowan Williams, was from Wales and served as Archbishop of Wales before his appointment to Canterbury. Official name The Church in Wales () adopted its name by accident. The Welsh Church Act 1914 referred throughout to \\"the Church in Wales\\", the phrase being used to indicate the part of the Church of England within Wales. In 1920, a convention of the Welsh church considered what name to select and tended to favour \\"the Church of Wales\\". However, there were concerns that adopting a name different from that mentioned in the Act might cause legal problems. Given the situation, it seemed sensible to adopt the title \\"the Church in Wales\\". History Christianity in Wales can be traced back to the Romano-British period and an organised episcopal church has had continuous existence in Wales since that time. Wales became a refuge for other Britons following the pagan Anglo-Saxon invasion of what became England. The Welsh refused to co-operate with Augustine of Canterbury's mission to the Anglo-Saxons. However, a combination of other Celtic dioceses reconciling with the See of Rome and the English conquest of Wales meant that from the Middle Ages, the Welsh dioceses were part of the Province of Canterbury and also in communion with the See of Rome until the English Reformation. Afterward they were part of the Church of England until disestablishment in 1920. From the time of Henry VIII, Wales had been absorbed into England as a legal entity and the established church in Wales was the Church of England. =Disestablishment= opposed disestablishment During the 19th century, Nonconformist churches grew rapidly in Wales, and eventually the majority of Welsh Christians were Nonconformists, although the Church of England remained the largest single denomination. By the mid-19th century the failure to appoint a Welsh-speaking bishop to any Welsh diocese for 150 years caused real resentment; disestablishment was seen as a way to assert national and linguistic identity. Under the influence of Nonconformist politicians such as David Lloyd George, the Welsh Church Act 1914 was passed by the Liberal Government to separate Anglicanism in Wales from the Church of England. The bill was fiercely resisted by members of the Conservative Party and blocked in the House of Lords, but it was eventually passed under the provisions of the Parliament Act 1911. The opposition to disestablishment was led by the Conservative politician F. E. Smith, who characterised the disestablishment bill as \\"a Bill which has shocked the conscience of every Christian community in Europe.\\" In response to this description, the writer G. K. Chesterton penned the satirical poem \\"Antichrist, or the Reunion of Christendom: An Ode\\" containing the memorable retort \\"Chuck It, Smith\\".\\"Antichrist, or the Reunion of Christendom: An Ode\\". The Act both disestablished and disendowed the \\"Church in Wales\\", the term used to define the part of the Church of England which was to be separated. Disestablishment meant the end of the church's special legal status, and Welsh bishops were no longer entitled to sit in the House of Lords as Lords Spiritual. As the Church in Wales became independent of the state, tithes were no longer available to the church, leaving it without a major source of income. Disendowment, which was even more controversial than disestablishment, meant that the endowments of the Church in Wales were partially confiscated, and redistributed to the University of Wales and local authorities. Endowments before 1662 were to be confiscated; those of later date were to remain. This was justified by the theory that the pre-1662 endowments had been granted to the national church of the whole population, and hence belonged to the people as a whole rather than to the Church in Wales; understandably, this reasoning was hotly contested. The date 1662 was that of the Act of Uniformity following the Restoration; it was after this point that Nonconformist congregations began to develop and the Church of England ceased to be a comprehensive national church. Although secularisation of the cathedrals had been suggested, the Church in Wales retained all the ancient church buildings and the privilege of conducting legal marriages without reference to the civil registrar. Due to the outbreak of World War I in 1914, the Welsh Church Act 1914 was passed together with the Suspensory Act 1914, meaning that the Welsh Church Act would not be implemented for the duration of the war. Disestablishment finally came into effect in 1920. The Church in Wales adopted a written constitution and elected a Governing Body which initially met once a year, but now meets twice annually. The Governing Body has ultimate authority \\"to approve liturgies, review organizational structures, and secure firm fiscal resources for the mission and ministry of the church\\". The Church in Wales was one of the first members of the Anglican Communion to adopt synodical government. =Since 1920= Parishes overlapping the border were allowed to vote either to accede to the Church in Wales or to continue in the Church of England; so the line of disestablishment is not the same as the border between the two countries. A few districts in the former counties of Monmouthshire, Radnorshire and Flintshire remain attached to parishes in the Dioceses of Hereford and Chester and consequently they are part of the Church of England. A complete English rural deanery with the generalised name March containing Oswestry and areas to the north-west of Shrewsbury, was transferred from its historic setting in the Diocese of St Asaph to be consistent with the civil border there. The churches of St Mary, Caernarfon, and Llangadwaladr, Anglesey, were transferred from the Diocese of Chester to that of Bangor. Today, the Church in Wales is fully independent of both the state and the Church of England. It is an independent member of the Anglican Communion, as are the Church of Ireland and the Scottish Episcopal Church. In the first years of the 21st century, the Church in Wales has begun to engage in numerous debates. These particularly concern the appointment of women to the episcopate and the provincial recognition of the equal statuses of the Welsh and English languages in all aspects of church life. Membership Following disestablishment in 1920, the Church in Wales initially fared better than the Nonconformist churches, which suffered a decline during the late 20th century. The Anglican Church does not have \\"a single definition of 'membership' in the Church in Wales.\\" In 2006 the average weekly attendance was recorded at 6,780 aged under 18 and 39,490 aged over 18. The highest attendance was at Easter, with 68,120 at worship (68,837 in 2007).churchinwales.org.uk In 2014, the attendance in the Church in Wales was 52,021 at Easter: a decline of about 16,000 members since 2007, but an increase from 2013. Also, in 2014, nineteen churches were closed or made redundant. Overall, in 2014, the Church in Wales reported 152,000 attenders in its parishes and congregations, compared to 105,000 in 2013. In 2018, the number of communicants during Easter was 46,163 and the number of persons on the Electoral Roll was 42,441. From 2015 statistics, when all \\"other major acts of worship\\" are included, the church reported having 206,000 total attenders. \\"Such additional services, which include civic services, family services, Remembrance, Carol and Christingle services, registered a total attendance of some 206,000 in 2015, compared with 152,000 in 2014.\\" In 2017, \\"parishes recorded 210,000 people attending other types of traditional worship, which might include civic services, family services, Remembrance, Carol and Christingle services.\\" Structure Flag of the Church in Wales The polity of the Church in Wales is episcopal church governance, which is the same as other Anglican churches. Prior to 1920, there were four dioceses in Wales, all part of the Province of Canterbury and each led by its own bishop: *The Diocese of Bangor *The Diocese of St Asaph *The Diocese of St Davids *The Diocese of Llandaff Two additional dioceses were erected soon after the creation of the Church in Wales: *The Diocese of Monmouth in 1921 *The Diocese of Swansea and Brecon in 1923 Monmouth was created from one of the archdeaconries of Llandaff diocese. Swansea and Brecon was created from the eastern part of the St Davids diocese, largely corresponding to the city and county of Swansea and the traditional counties of Breconshire and Radnorshire. Each diocese is divided into two or three archdeaconries, with 15 of these in total. Each has an archdeacon, who is responsible to the bishop for its administration. The archdeaconries are further divided into deaneries. Each diocese has its own cathedral, the \\"mother church\\" of the diocese and the seat of the bishop. In the cathedral are held important events such as the enthronement of a new bishop. Each cathedral has a Dean, appointed to manage the cathedral, with the assistance of the Chapter. Together with the Archdeacons, the Dean of the Cathedral is one of the most prominent clerics of the diocese, after the Bishop. The Chapter is composed of the Dean and a number of Canons selected from among the clerics of the diocese. =Diocesan and Episcopal coats of arms= The following Episcopal coats of arms are those each bishop is privileged to carry whilst in office. The official Diocesan coat of arms is identical to the Episcopal version, however does not carry the mitre. With the introduction of the new logos for many of the diocese, their strict use has fallen away during recent years (generally since 2006 onwards), and as such, the coats of arms are often used synonymously.

Since independence in 1920, the Church in Wales has been led by the Archbishop of Wales, who is both the metropolitan bishop and primate. The Archbishop of Wales is elected from the currently seated diocesan bishops and continues as a diocesan after election. It is a commonly held misconception that there must be six diocesan bishops in order to hold the electoral college for the Archbishop of Wales. However, the Constitution of the Church in Wales specifies no quantity of Bishops, simply referring to the electoral college as being made up of \\"the Bishops and the first three clerical and the first three lay Episcopal Electors on the list of each Diocese in the Church in Wales.\\" Constitution of the Church in Wales, Chapter V, Paragraph V. (Accessed 19 May 2017) In an archiepiscopal vacancy, the senior Bishop by appointment is acting archbishop.Constitution of the Church in Wales, Chapter V Part II, Section 9 (Accessed 5 January 2017) A former Archbishop of Wales, Rowan Williams, became the first Welsh-born Archbishop of Canterbury. He was consecrated and enthroned as Bishop of Monmouth in 1992 and as Archbishop of Wales in 1999. He was appointed by the Queen (his appointment having been proposed by the Crown Appointments Commission) as Archbishop of Canterbury in July 2002. =Diocesan bishops= Unlike bishops in the Church of England, each bishop of the Church in Wales is elected by an \\"electoral college\\" which consists of representatives of the diocese in which a vacancy occurs, representatives of the other dioceses in Wales and all bishops of the church. In 2013 the Church in Wales officially agreed to the ordination of women as bishops, five years after a previous proposal for their ordination failed in 2008.\\"Female Bishops approved by Church in Wales\\", The Guardian, 12 September 2013. In descending order of seniority, as of January 2020, when Cherry Vann was consecrated bishop, the bench of Welsh bishops consists of: * John Davies, Bishop of Swansea and Brecon, and Archbishop of Wales * Andrew John, Bishop of Bangor * Gregory Cameron, Bishop of St Asaph * Joanna Penberthy, Bishop of St Davids * June Osborne, Bishop of Llandaff * Cherry Vann, Bishop of Monmouth In cases where a see is vacant due to the death or translation of a bishop, episcopal acts such as ordinations and confirmations are carried out by the archbishop or by another bishop appointed for that purpose by the archbishop. =Assistant bishops= Assistant bishops may be appointed within the Church in Wales. In practice, diocesan assistant bishops have only been appointed within the diocese of the archbishop, in order to assist him with diocesan episcopal functions. There are no assistant bishops at present in the Church in Wales. The previous archbishop had an Assistant Bishop of Llandaff. From April 2009 to April 2017 the post was held by David Wilbourne.Bishops' biodata , Church in Wales website See also: Assistant Bishop of St Asaph. A provincial assistant bishop was appointed in 1996 to provide episcopal ministry to congregations which could not accept the ministry of bishops who ordained women. David Thomas held the position for twelve years, retiring in 2008. At that time the Bench of Bishops decided that it would not continue to appoint a specific bishop to minister to those who cannot in conscience accept the ordination of women as priests. This point was reiterated by Barry Morgan at the Governing Body of the Church in Wales in September 2013 during the debate on whether or not the Church in Wales would ordain women to the episcopate. Historically, there have been suffragan bishops both before and since disestablishment, including two Bishops of Swansea and one Bishop of Maenan. From 1946 until his death in 1953, Richard William Jones (Archdeacon of Llandaff and Rector of Peterston-super-Ely) was \\"Assistant Bishop of Wales\\". =Representative Body= The Representative Body of the Church in Wales is responsible for the care of the church's property and for funding many of the activities of the church, including support for priests' stipends and pensions. =Governing Body= The Governing Body is responsible for decisions that affect the Church's Faith, Order and Worship. It also has powers to make regulations for the general management and good government of the Church, and its property and affairs. The Governing Body is the supreme legislature of the Church in Wales, broadly speaking the Parliament of the Church in Wales. It usually meets twice a year to receive reports and make decisions on matters brought before it. Worship and liturgy The Church in Wales as a whole tends to be predominantly High Church, meaning that many of the traditions are inherited from the Oxford Movement in more rural dioceses such as St Davids and Bangor and especially in the industrial parishes of Llandaff and Monmouth. Although the province tends more toward liberal and Anglo-Catholic positions in theology and liturgy, it also has a tradition of evangelicalism, especially in the southern parts of Wales, and the university town of Aberystwyth. In the 1960s there was a revival of evangelicalism within the Church in Wales and the Evangelical Fellowship of the Church in Wales exists to support such members of the church. =Book of Common Prayer= An Act of Parliament passed in the year 1563, entitled \\"An Act for the Translating of the Bible and the Divine Service into the Welsh Tongue,\\" ordered that the Old and New Testament, together with the Book of Common Prayer, were to be translated into Welsh. A translation by Richard Davies, bishop of St Davids and the scholar William Salesbury was published in 1567 by Humphrey Toy as Y Llyfr Gweddi Gyffredin. A new revision ‚Äî based on the 1662 English revision and probably by George Griffith, Bishop of St Asaph \\\\- was published in 1664. The 1662 book and its Welsh equivalent continued to be used, even after the Church in Wales was disestablished in 1920. The Church in Wales began revising the Book of Common Prayer in the 1950s. The first material authorised for experimental use was a lectionary in 1956, followed by a baptism and confirmation service in 1958, an order for Holy Matrimony in 1960, and an order for the Burial of the Dead in 1962. These did not however enjoy widespread use. In 1966 an experimental order for the Holy Eucharist was authorised. This was the first to enjoy widespread use. Revision continued throughout the 60s and 70s, with an experimental version of morning and evening prayer in 1969. In 1971 a definitive version of baptism and confirmation was authorised, replacing the equivalent in the 1662 Book of Common Prayer. This was followed in 1974 with a definitive order for the Burial of the Dead, and in 1975 with a definitive order for Holy Matrimony. It was hoped that a new Book of Common Prayer for the church in Wales would be produced in 1981. However, in 1979 a definitive version of the Holy Eucharist failed to gain a two-thirds majority in the House of Clergy and the House of Laity at the Governing Body. A light revision of the 1966 experimental Eucharist was approved by the Governing Body, and the Book of Common Prayer for use in the Church in Wales was authorised in 1984. This Prayer Book is unique in that it is in traditional English. The Church in Wales first considered a modern language Eucharist in the early 70s but this received a lukewarm reception. A modern language Eucharist (The Holy Eucharist in modern language) was authorised alongside the new prayer book in 1984, but this did not enjoy widespread use. In 1990 new initiation services were authorised, followed in 1992 by an alternative order for morning and evening prayer in 1994 by an alternative order for the Holy Eucharist, in 1995 by the alternative calendar lectionary and collects, and in 1998 an order for compline was produced. These enjoyed widespread use. In 2003 a new calendar and collects was made part of the Book of Common Prayer for use in the Church in Wales. This was followed in 2004 by an order for the Holy Eucharist, services for Christian initiation in 2006 and in 2009 by daily prayer. Experimental services continued, with an ordinal produced in 2004, Ministry to the Sick and Housebound in 2007, healing services in 2008, funeral services in 2009, and in 2010 marriage services which became part of the Book of Common Prayer in 2013. The ordinal was made part of the prayer book the following year. In 2017 prayers for a child were released, together with a Revised Order for Confirmation, the latter authorised for five years experimental use following the bench of Bishops' decision to admit unconfirmed children and adults to communion. In 2018 Times and Seasons was released. All of these were published on line. The following year Funeral Services became part of the Book of Common Prayer, and additional prayers for different events in life were launched (Blessing of a home, prayers for victims of crime etc.). =Other publications= Discontinued publications which frequently provided articles of sub-academic quality were Province, Yr Haul √¢'r Gangell, and Y Llan. Bi- annual news from the Governing Body meeting is released in Highlights. News is predominantly circulated on the Church in Wales' Provincial and Diocesan Websites, and in various Diocesan Magazines. Doctrine and practice Central to the teaching of the Church in Wales is the life, death and resurrection of Jesus Christ. The basic teachings of the church, or catechism, include: *Jesus Christ is fully human and fully God. He died and was resurrected from the dead. *Jesus continues to provide the way to eternal life for those who believe. *The Old and New Testaments were written by people \\"under the inspiration of the Holy Spirit\\". The Apocrypha are additional books that are used in Christian worship, but not for the formation of doctrine. *The two great and necessary sacraments are Holy Baptism and Holy Eucharist *Other sacramental rites are confirmation, holy orders, matrimony, reconciliation of a penitent, and anointing of the sick. *Belief in heaven, hell, and Jesus' return in glory. The balance of Scripture, tradition and reason as authority for faith and practice is traced to the work of Richard Hooker, a sixteenth- century apologist. In Hooker's model, Scripture is the primary means of arriving at doctrine, and things stated plainly in Scripture are accepted as true. Issues that are ambiguous are determined by tradition, which is checked by reason.Anglican Listening goes into detail on how scripture, tradition, and reason work to \\"uphold and critique each other in a dynamic way\\". = Ordination of women = A proposal to ordain women as priests was introduced and debated in 1995 after it had failed to secure a two-thirds majority in 1994. The ordination of women to the priesthood was approved by the two-thirds majority in 1996. The Church in Wales has ordained women as priests since 1997. Prior to 1997, women were permitted to serve as deacons. The first deaconess was consecrated in 1884. In 2013, the church voted to allow women to serve as bishops. In 2016, Canon Joanna Penberthy was elected the first woman bishop in the church. Penberthy was enthroned as Bishop of St Davids on 11 February 2017. As of 2020, following the enthronement of The Right Reverend Cherry Vann as Bishop of Monmouth, there are three women bishops sitting on the Welsh Bench of Bishops. =Same-sex unions and LGBT clergy= Beginning in the 1980s, the Church in Wales embarked on an increasingly open stand on various issues including economic justice, the ordination of women and inclusion of homosexual people. In some areas, such as human sexuality, the church establishment has faced resistance from congregations. In 2005, the church allowed gay priests to enter into civil partnerships. \\"In the wake of civil partnerships, the Welsh Bishops sought legal advice, and told gay partnered clergy that they were welcome, as well as gay ordination candidates.\\" Speaking on such partnerships, it was communicated that ‚ÄúThe Church in Wales has no formal view on whether people in civil partnerships who are in a sexual relationship can serve as clergy. If the issue arises, it is up to the relevant Bishop to decide.\\" Therefore, the Welsh church does not require abstinence for clergy in civil unions. Regarding transgender issues, an officer announced that the church believes transgender people \\"should be acknowledged and celebrated in their new gender.\\" Currently, \\"the Church has published prayers that may be said with a couple following the celebration of a [same-sex] civil partnership or civil marriage.\\" Currently, \\"the Church in Wales is much more liberal on this issue [than the Church of England]\\" and is discussing the possibility of blessing or performing same-sex marriages. In 2018, the Welsh Bishops released a statement saying it was \\"unjust\\" to not offer formal provision for same-sex marriages and civil partnerships. Following the bishops' announcement, the General Synod voted in favour of requesting formal provision for same-sex couples. The Welsh Church has decided to move forward with possibly offering same-sex marriage and blessing rites for same-sex unions. The Diocese of St. Asaph provides a chaplaincy and services for LGBT people. The Very Revd Jeffrey John, who is openly gay and in a civil union, was nearly elected bishop of Llandaff when he \\"won more than half of a Church in Wales electoral college, but fell short of the two-thirds majority required.\\" As of 2020, the Church in Wales has approved the consecration of a bishop, Bishop Cherry Vann, who is openly lesbian and in a civil partnership. \\"The Anglican Church In Wales took the first steps towards allowing clergy to celebrate same sex marriage in its churches when more than half its Governing Body voted in favour of the move.\\" In the 2016 results, 52% of the Governing Body voted in favour of allowing same-sex marriages in church. \\"Members of the Church in Wales Governing Body voted 61 in favour of gay marriages in church, nine in favour of blessing gay partnerships and 50 for making no change.\\" As a result of the majority support for same-sex couples, but not a two-thirds majority needed to create a same-sex marriage ceremony, the church's Bench of Bishops affirmed members in same-sex relationships and \\"published a series of prayers which may be said with a couple following the celebration of a civil partnership or civil marriage.\\" The service, in Form One, gives God thanks \\"for [the two people] who have found such love and companionship in each other, that it has led them to dedicate their lives in support of one another.\\" =Ecumenical relations= Like many other Anglican provinces, the Church in Wales entered into full communion with the Old Catholics. The Church in Wales is also a member of the Porvoo Communion. Because of the Anglo-Catholic dominance, relations with the Free Churches (formerly known during establishment times as Nonconformists), ecumenical progress has been slower in Wales than in England. The Church in Wales is a member of the Covenanted Churches in Wales. A covenant (with church unity as an ultimate goal) was signed by the Church in Wales, the Methodist Church, the Presbyterian Church of Wales, the United Reformed Church, and some Baptist churches in 1982 under the title of Enfys (\\"rainbow\\").

Won Pat International Airport"},{"id":"291341","text":"Map of Albania during World War II In Albania, World War II began with its invasion by Italy in April 1939. Fascist Italy set up Albania as its protectorate or puppet state. The resistance was largely carried out by Communist groups against the Italian (until 1943) and then German occupation in Albania. At first independent, the Communist groups united in the beginning of 1942, which ultimately led to the successful liberation of the country in 1944. The Center for Relief to Civilian Populations (Geneva) reported that Albania was one of the most devastated countries in Europe. 60,000 houses were destroyed and about 10% of the population was left homeless. Background Albanian soldiers in an unidentified location, April 12, 1939. As Germany annexed Austria and moved against Czechoslovakia, Italy saw itself becoming a second-rate member of the Axis. After Hitler invaded Czechoslovakia without notifying Mussolini in advance, the Italian dictator decided in early 1939 to proceed with his own annexation of Albania. Italy's King Victor Emmanuel III criticized the plan to take Albania as an unnecessary risk. Rome, however, delivered Tiran√´ an ultimatum on March 25, 1939, demanding that it accede to Italy's occupation of Albania. King Zog refused to accept money in exchange for countenancing a full Italian takeover and colonization of Albania, and on April 7, 1939, Mussolini's troops, led by General Alfredo Guzzoni, invaded Albania/ attacking all Albanian ports simultaneously. There were 65 units in Saranda, 40 at Vlor√´, 38 in Durr√´s, 28 at Sh√´ngjin and 8 more at Bishti i Pall√´s. The original Italian plans for the invasion called for up to 50,000 men supported by 137 naval units and 400 airplanes. Ultimately the invasion force grew to 100,000 men supported by 600 airplanes. In Durr√´s, a force of only 360 Albanians, mostly gendarmes and townspeople, led by Abaz Kupi, the commander of the gendarmerie in Durr√´s, and Mujo Ulqinaku, a marine official, tried to halt the Italian advance. Equipped only with small arms and three machine guns, they succeeded in keeping the Italians at bay for several hours until a large number of small tanks were unloaded from the Italian ships. After that, resistance began to crumble, and within five hours Italian troops had captured the city. By 1:30 pm on the first day, all Albanian ports were in Italian hands. Unwilling to become an Italian puppet, King Zog, his wife, Queen Geraldine Apponyi, and their infant son Skander fled to Greece and eventually to London. On April 12, the Albanian parliament voted to unite the country with Italy. On April 12, the Albanian parliament voted to depose Zog and unite the nation with Italy \\"in personal union\\" by offering the Albanian crown to Victor Emmanuel III and the Italians set up a fascist government under Shefqet Verlaci and soon absorbed Albania's military and diplomatic service into Italy's. On April 15, 1939, Albania withdrew from the League of Nations, from which Italy had resigned in 1937. On June 3, 1939, the Albanian foreign ministry was merged into the Italian foreign ministry. The Albanian military was placed under Italian command and formally merged into the Italian Army in 1940. Additionally, the Italian Blackshirts formed four legions of Albanian Militia, initially recruited from Italian colonists living in Albania, but later from ethnic Albanians. Upon invading, Galeazzo Ciano hoped to reinforce an impression of benevolence with a number of initial gestures aimed more at public relations than at addressing any of Albania's profound social and economic problems. One of Ciano's first moves was to distribute food and clothing in some of the poor areas and to release political prisoners. He personally distributed 190,000 gold francs to the needy in Tirana, Shkodra, Vlora, Gjirokastra, Saranda, Kor√ßa and Kukes. Because the money was given to the poor, bypassing the usual bureaucracy, it did some good. The Italians also contributed greatly to infrastructure, agriculture, and chrome and hydrocarbon exploration in which Albania was rich. The Italians hoped that extensive investment in Albania would bring both economic and political benefits. Despite a weak domestic economy, Mussolini guaranteed the Albanians the sum of 22 million pounds over five years for economic development, considerably more than the 8.2 million Rome had spent since the early 1920s. Initial reports of the Italian activity were quite favorable. Ruth Mitchell commented at the end of April 1939, \\"What a great improvement there is in the condition of the people already. The whole atmosphere had become brisker and more enterprising; now at least there is hope.\\" Even the German minister Eberhard von Pannwitz, who was perpetually critical of the Italians, commented favorably on the Italian tempo, which he likened to the tempo in Austria after the Anschluss. The new construction projects brought in large amounts of capital and employed many Albanians. The government began letting Italians take technical positions in Albania's civil service, and also began allowing Italian settlers to enter Albania. This largely affected the Albanians' attitude towards the Italian invaders and the locals greeted them with more respect and liking. Italian puppet state In spite of Albania's long-standing protection and alliance with Italy, on 7 April 1939 Italian troops invaded Albania, five months before the start of the Second World War. The Albanian armed resistance proved ineffective against the Italians and, after a short defense, the country was occupied. On 9 April 1939 the Albanian king, Zog I fled to Greece. In an effort to win Albanian support for Italian rule, Ciano and the Fascist regime encouraged Albanian irredentism in the directions of Kosovo and Chameria. Despite Jacomoni's assurances of Albanian support in view of the promised \\"liberation\\" of Chameria, Albanian enthusiasm for the war was distinctly lacking. The few Albanian units raised to fight during the developments of the Greco-Italian War (1940‚Äì1941) alongside the Italian Army mostly \\"either deserted or fled in droves\\". Albanian agents recruited before the war, are reported to have operated behind Greek lines and engaged in acts of sabotage but these were few in number. Support for the Greeks, although of limited nature, came primarily from the local Greek populations who warmly welcomed the arrival of the Greek forces in the southern districts. Communist and Nationalist resistance =Origin of Communism= Faced with an agrarian and mostly Muslim society monitored by King Zog's security police, Albania's Communist movement attracted few adherents in the interwar period. In fact, the country had no fully-fledged Communist Party before World War II. After Fan Noli fled in 1924 to Italy and later the United States, several of his leftist prot√©g√©s migrated to Moscow, where they affiliated themselves with the Balkan Confederation of Communist Parties and through it the Communist International (Comintern), the Soviet- sponsored association of international communist parties. In 1930, the Comintern dispatched Ali Kelmendi to Albania to organize communist cells. However, Albania had no working class on which the communists could rely for support, Paris became the Albanian communists' hub until Nazi deportations depleted their ranks after the fall of France in 1940. =Enver Hoxha's and Mehmet Shehu's early years= Enver Hoxha as a partisan Mehmet Shehu as a partisan Enver Hoxha and a veteran of the Spanish Civil War, Mehmet Shehu, eventually rose to become the most powerful figures in Albania for decades after the war. The dominant figure in modern Albanian history, Enver Hoxha rose from obscurity to lead his people for a longer time than any other ruler. Born in 1908 to a Tosk landowner from Gjirokast√´r who returned to Albania after working in the United States, Hoxha attended the country's best college- preparatory school, the National Lyc√©e in Kor√ß√´. In 1930 he attended the university at Montpellier in France, but lost an Albanian state scholarship for neglecting his studies. He subsequently moved to Paris and Brussels. After returning to Albania in 1936 without having earned a degree, he taught French for years at his former lyc√©e and participated in a communist cell in Kor√ß√´. He later went to Tirana and when the Albanian Communist Party was formed in November 1941, he was appointed as the general secretary of the party, a post which he kept until his death in 1985. Shehu, also a Tosk, studied at Tirana's American Vocational School. He went on to a military college in Naples but was expelled for left-wing political activity. In Spain Shehu fought in the Garibaldi International Brigade and became a commander of one of the brigade's battalions. After the Spanish conflict was over, he was captured and interned in France. He returned to Albania in 1942 and soon became a prominent figure. During the conflict. he won a reputation for his commanding abilities with the partisans. In his memoirs published in 1984, British Special Operations Executive David Smiley wrote: \\"Mehmet Shehu was a short, weiry, dark swallow- faced man of about thirty who seldom smiled except at other people's misfortunes. He spoke good English, was very capable and had far more military knowledge than most other Albanians.... He had a reputation for bravery, courage, ruthlessness, and cruelty--he had boasted that he personally cut the throats of seventy Italian carabinieri who had been taken prisoner. I got along with him at first, for as soldiers we had something in common; but he did little to conceal his dislike for all things British, and my relations with him deteriorated.\\" =Beginning of Albanian Communist and Fascist parties and National Liberation Movement= NLM flag (often seen without a star) After the invasion of Albania by Italy in April 1939, 100,000 Italian soldiers and 11,000 Italian colonists settled in the country. Initially the Albanian Fascist Party received support from the population, mainly because of the unification of Kosovo and other Albanian populated territories with Albania proper after the conquest of Yugoslavia and Greece by the Axis in Spring 1941. Benito Mussolini boasted in May 1941 to a group of Albanian fascists that he had achieved the Greater Albania long wanted by the Tirana nationalists. The Albanian Fascist Party of Tefik Mborja had strong support in the country population after the Albania annexation of Kosovo. Several groups led by Baba Faja Martaneshi, former gendarmerie officer Gani bej Kryeziu, a communist Mustafa Gjinishi, and a rightist politician Muharrem Bajraktari. An attempt to unite those groups in one organization was undertaken by Major Abaz Kupi, by now a democratic politician, who created an underground organization called the Unity Front. This front, which increased in numbers within several months, was crushed in April 1941 after the defeat of Yugoslavia and Greece. Some of its members passed over to the collaborationist camp, some were arrested, and some others fled to the mountains. The warfare ceased for a while. In November 1941, the small Albanian Communist groups established an Albanian Communist Party in Tirana of 130 members under the leadership of Hoxha and an eleven-man Central Committee. The party at first had little mass appeal, and even its youth organization netted few recruits. Lapidar commemorating partisan forces in Southeastern Albania The resistance in Albania became active after the defeats of the Italian forces in the war with Greece, which started on 28 October 1940. Originally the slogan of building the \\"Greater Albania\\", into which the Italians promised to incorporate a substantial part of Greek Epirus (Cameria), allowed collaborationist authorities to mobilize several thousand volunteers for the army (besides regular troops). The collapse of the Italian offensive in Greece caused a crisis among the regular troops, who refused to take part in further fights, as well as in volunteer units, which dispersed; some soldiers made for the mountains. Eventually, the number of combat groups and partisan detachments, reinforced by deserters from the army, had grown to dozens, with over 3,000 men. In November in Lezha, a town near the port of Shengjin on Adriatic coast, mutinous soldiers who refused further service in Italian units fought a battle with an Italian punitive expedition, killing 19 and badly wounding 30 Italians, before retreating to the mountains. In the same month a partisan detachment laid an ambush for an Italian transport column en route to Gjirokastra. Several Italians were killed. On 17 May 1941 in Tirana a young man called Vasil La√ßi attempted to assassinate king Victor Emmanuel III by shooting at him. However he failed and was shortly after executed. In mid-1942, however, the Party called on young people to fight for the liberation of their country from Italy. The propaganda increased the number of new recruits by many young people eager for freedom. In September 1942, the party organized a popular front organization, the National Liberation Movement (NLM), from a number of resistance groups, including several that were strongly anti-Communist. During the war, the NLM's Communist-dominated partisans, in the form of the National Liberation Army, ignored warnings from the Italian occupiers that there would be reprisals for guerrilla attacks. Partisan leaders, on the contrary, counted on using the desire for revenge such reprisals would elicit to win recruits. Major General Spiro Moisiu as military chief of the NLA. On 17‚Äì22 February 1943 in the village of Labinot, the first nationwide conference of ACP took place. The estimation of the political and military situation in the country pointed to the need to create a homogeneous national liberation army. A decision concerning warfare tactics also was taken; it recommended that commanders of units conduct actions with bigger forces. On 17 May, twelve partisan detachments under the homogeneous command carried out an attack on the Italian garrison in Leskoviku, which protected an important road junction. Partisans encircled the town in a tight ring and undertook the offensive. Over 1,000 Italians held the town. The battle lasted three days. The commander of the garrison had demanded air support, but before the support arrived, partisans seized the town. The Italians lost several hundred soldiers and considerable quantities of weapons and equipment. At the end of June the Italians started a punitive expedition against partisans in the region of Mallakastra and Tepelena. Two thousand partisans took up defensive positions on mountain passes. In the first clash the Italians were forced back, but they renewed the action on 14 July with tanks, artillery and aircraft. After four days of fighting, the partisans had suffered heavy losses and retreated to higher parts of the mountains. In general from May to July the Italians lost thousands and many were wounded. After March 1943, the NLM formed its first and second regular battalions, which subsequently became brigades, to operate along with existing smaller and irregular units. Resistance to the occupation grew rapidly as signs of Italian weakness became apparent. At the end of 1942, guerrilla forces numbered no more than 8,000 to 10,000. By the summer of 1943, when the Italian effort collapsed, almost all of the mountainous interior was controlled by resistance units. The NLM formally established the National Liberation Army (NLA) in July 1943 with Spiro Moisiu as its military chief and Enver Hoxha as its political officer. It had 20,000 regular soldiers and guerrillas in the field by that time. However, the NLA's military activities in 1943 were directed as much against the party's domestic political opponents, including prewar liberal, nationalist, and monarchist parties, as against the occupation forces. = Nationalist resistance = Balli Komb√´tar leaders Ali K√´lcyra, Mit'hat Frash√´ri, Thoma Orollogaj (from left to right) in Berat. A nationalist resistance to the Italian occupiers emerged in October 1942. Ali K√´lcyra and Mit‚Äôhat Frash√´ri formed the Western-oriented and anti- communist Balli Komb√´tar (National Front). This movement recruited supporters from both the large landowners and peasantry. They supported the creation of Greater Albania by Italians and called for the creation of a republic and the introduction of economic and social reforms, opposing King Zog's return. Their leaders acted conservatively, however, fearing that the occupiers would carry out reprisals against them or confiscate the landowners' estates. The nationalistic Gheg chieftains and the Tosk landowners often came to terms with the Italians, and later the Germans, to prevent the loss of their wealth and power. The Balli Komb√´tar, which had fought against the Italians, were threatened by the superior forces of the LNC and the Yugoslav Partisans, who were backed by the Allies. Balli Komb√´tar forces in Debar Among prominent Balli Komb√´tar commanders were Safet Butka and Hysni Lepenica. Butka had been interned in Italy for two years until he was released in August 1942 and allowed to return to Albania. He then took to the mountains and became an outstanding leader of the Balli Komb√´tar movement in the Kor√ß√´ area.[4] The nucleus of his guerrilla group was composed of 70 seasoned and highly experienced fighters which in case of emergency could become a thousand men strong.[4] The Butka group had been giving valuable assistance to the fighters at Vlor√´ and had recovered from the military depots in the village of Dardhe, Suli, Gra√ßan, Progri, Pleshishti, and Verbinj all the agricultural production (corn, tobacco, wool, etc.) which the Italians had requisitioned and restored to its owners. His forces attacked Italians on Floq in January 1943, Vithkuq in March 1943. Balli Komb√´tar forces enter Prizren 1944 The fighting that took place with general commander Hysni Lepenica during August 1942 in Dukat, Mavrovo, Vadic√´, Drashovic√´ and Llakatund with the help of Allied aviation resulted in victory. After Italian capitulation, Communists and Ballists sought the surrender of all remaining Italian forces in peace. However Hysni Lepenica instructed by the Central Committee of the National Front, went to G√´rhot where the Italian division \\"Ferrara\\" was located to take their weapons as agreed with the division general, but after Tilman's intervention the division general attacked Lepenica's group. At the battle of Gjorm that resulted in a decisive victory for the Albanians and the death of Italian Colonel Clementi, Lepenica committed suicide when he heard that clashes between the Communists and Ballists had started. In the autumn of 1943, Nazi Germany occupied all of Albania after Italy was defeated. Fearing reprisals from larger forces, the Balli Komb√´tar made a deal with the Germans and formed a \\"neutral government\\" in Tirana which it continued its war with the LNC and the Yugoslav Partisans. The Balli Komb√´tar were also active in Kosovo and Macedonia. Their forces were mainly centered in Kosovska Mitrovica, Drenica, and Tetovo. However it was noted that the Balli Komb√´tar in these regions were more aggressive than the Ballists of Albania. With the Germans driven out by the Yugoslav Partisans, and the Albanian communists claiming victory in Albania, Yugoslav leader Josip Broz Tito ordered the collection of weapons in Kosovo and the arrest of prominent Albanians. This was not well received among Albanians. Combined with the passions felt about Kosovo, inflamed an insurrection. On 2 December 1944, Ballists from the Drenica region attacked the Trepƒça mining complex and other targets. Similarly in Kiƒçevo, Gostivar and Tetovo, the remaining Ballists tried to remain in control of the region after the Yugoslav Partisans announced victory. The insurrection was later crushed and Ballist leaders were either imprisoned, exiled or killed due to their co- operation with the Nazis. Ballists were also active in Montenegro and Sand≈æak fighting the Chetniks in the area. =Between Italian surrender and German occupation= With the overthrow of Benito Mussolini's fascist regime and Italy's surrender in 1943, the Italian military and police establishment in Albania buckled. Five Italian divisions were disarmed by the Germans, but many Italians soldiers evaded capture and flocked to the guerrilla forces; the sixth Italian division in Albania (41st Infantry Division Firenze) went over to the Resistance. The communists took control of most of Albania's southern cities, except Vlor√´, which was a Balli Komb√´tar stronghold, and nationalists attached to the NLM gained control over much of the north. British agents working in Albania during the war fed the Albanian resistance fighters with false information that the Allies were planning a major invasion of the Balkans and urged the disparate Albanian groups to unite their efforts. In August 1943, the Allies convinced communist and Balli Komb√´tar leaders to sign the Mukje Agreement that would coordinate their guerrilla operations. The two groups eventually ended all collaboration, however, over a disagreement on the postwar status of Kosovo. The communists supported returning the region to Yugoslavia after the war with the hope that Tito would cede Kosovo back to Albania peacefully, while the nationalist Balli Komb√´tar advocated keeping the province. Mukje agreement Communists and ballists converse during the Mukje agreement, August 2, 1943The Mukje Agreement was a treaty signed on August 2, 1943 in the Albanian village of Mukje between the nationalist Balli Komb√´tar and the communist National Liberation Movement. The two forces would work together in fighting off Italy's control over Albania. However, A dispute arose concerning the status of Kosovo. Whereas the Balli Kombetar proposed to fight for the integration of Kosovo into Albania, the Communist representatives objected fiercely. The Balli Kombetar labelled the partisans as traitors of Albania and often called them \\"Tito's dogs\\" while the partisans accused the Balli Kombetar of collaborating with the Axis powers, thus igniting a war between the two that would last for one year. =German occupation= German soldiers in Albania. In anticipation of such invasion, the Wehrmacht drew up a series of military plans for action against Italian holdings in the Balkans code-named Konstantin. And for a more direct nature, units of German Military Intelligence (Abwehr) section II were sent to Mitrovica (present day Kosovo) in April 1943 in an attempt to gain some influence among the growing number of Albanians disaffected with the Italians. Even more directly, in July and August 1943, the German army occupied Albanian airports and ports, ostensibly to protect Italian Albania from the possibility of an Allied invasion. By mid-August there were some six thousand German troops in Albania. The Germans planned to construct an independent neutral Albania controlled by a government friendly to the Germans. After the Mukje Agreement was broken by the Albanian Partisans, war broke out between the Albanian Partisans (who were backed by the Yugoslav Partisans, who in turn were backed by the Allies) and the Balli Komb√´tar. After the capitulation of Italian forces on 8 September 1943, German troops swiftly occupied Albania with two divisions. The Germans formed a 'neutral government' in Tirana with the Balli Komb√´tar. German checkpoint in central Albania, September 1943 The Germans were intent on setting up an autonomous administration and endeavored to persuade Albanian leaders to form a government to take over the administration of the country themselves. Many hesitated, in particular when rumors spread that British forces were preparing to invade Albania. Kosovo Albanian leaders, however, realizing that a German defeat would mean a return to Yugoslav rule, were more willing to cooperate. On 14 September 1943, an Albanian government was then set up under Cafo Beg Ulqini, Ibrahim Bi√ßaku of Elbasan, Bedri Pejani and Xhafer Deva of Kosovo. The national assembly, composed of 243 members, began to function on 16 October 1943, electing a four-member High Regency Council (K√´shilli i Lart√´ i Regjenc√´s) to govern the country. The new government, which promised to remain neutral in the war, succeeded in restoring a good deal of stability. The administration and justice systems functioned once again, and Albanian schools were reopened throughout northern and central Albania. Steps were also taken to implement a land reform. After the neutral government was formed, Ballist forces in collaboration with Germans fought the Communists extensively. Balli Komb√´tar also captured Struga in Macedonia after defeating the partisan garrison. In Kosovo and western Macedonia, when it was a part of the independent state of Albania, the German and Ballist forces had occasional skirmishes with Yugoslav partisans. When Maqellar√´, midway between Debar and Peshkopi, was recaptured by the Fifth Partisan Brigade, the Germans with the assistance of the Ballist forces of Xhem Hasa launched an attack from Debar, defeating the partisans. Fiqri Dine, Xhem Hasa and Hysni Dema as well as three German Majors directed military campaigns against the Albanian and Yugoslav partisans. Tirana was liberated by the partisans on 17 November 1944 after a 20-day battle. The partisans entirely liberated Albania from German occupation on 29 November 1944. The National Liberation Army, which in October 1944 consisted of 70,000 regulars, also took part in the war alongside the antifascist coalition. The Albanian partisans also helped in the liberation of Kosovo, and assisted Tito's communist forces in liberating part of Montenegro and southern Bosnia and Herzegovina. By that time, the Soviet Army was also entering neighboring Yugoslavia, and the German Army was retreating from Greece into Yugoslavia. Communist takeover =Provisional Communist administration= Partisans entering Tirana, November 28, 1944 Mother Albania. The partisan monument and graveyard on the outskirts of Tirana, Albania. The communist partisans had regrouped and gained control of much of southern Albania in January 1944. However, they were subject to German attacks driving them out of certain areas until June. On May 29 they called the members of the National Liberation Front (as the movement was by then called) in the Congress of P√´rmet, which chose an Anti-Fascist Council of National Liberation to act as Albania's administration and legislature. Hoxha became the chairman of the council's executive committee and the National Liberation Army's supreme commander. The communist partisans defeated the last Balli Komb√´tar forces in southern Albania by mid- summer 1944 and encountered only scattered resistance from the Balli Komb√´tar when they entered central and northern Albania by the end of July. The British military mission urged the remnants of the nationalists not to oppose the communists' advance, and the Allies recalled their representatives with them to Italy. They did not evacuate nationalist leaders, although many fled. Before the end of November, the main German troops had withdrawn from Tirana, and the communists took control by attacking it. A provisional government, which the communists had formed at Berat in October, administered Albania with Enver Hoxha as prime minister. Aftermath Albania stood in an unenviable position after World War II. The NLF's strong links with Yugoslavia's communists, who also enjoyed British military and diplomatic support, guaranteed that Belgrade would play a key role in Albania's postwar order. The Allies never recognized an Albanian government in exile or King Zog and failed to raise the question of Albania or its borders at any of the major wartime conferences. No reliable statistics on Albania's wartime losses exist, but the United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration reported about 30,000 Albanian war dead, 200 destroyed villages, 18,000 destroyed houses, and about 100,000 people left homeless. Albanian official statistics claim somewhat higher losses. Furthermore, thousands of Chams (Tsams, Albanians living in Northern Greece) were driven out of Greece and were accused of collaborating with the Nazis. During the Nazi occupation, most Jews in Albania proper were saved.Jewish Virtual Library Foreign participation There were a significant number of foreign citizens who participated in Albanian resistance during World War II. They were composed mostly of Italian soldiers who wished to continue the war against Nazi Germany, but other people from different nationalities participated also. =Italian participation= Albanian resistance began in 1940 with small √ßetas but it became a significant force in 1942. Even during this period there were small groups of Italian soldiers who deserted the fascist army and joined the Albanian partisans. When Italy capitulated in September 1943 there were already some 122 Italian partisans dispersed among various units in Albanian National Liberation Army.The National Committee of WWII Veterans, File on Foreign Partisans (Komiteti Komb√´tar i Veteran√´ve t√´ LAN√á-it, Dosja e partizan√´ve t√´ huaj (italian√´), Tiran√´, 1989) When Italy capitulated there were some 100,000 Italian soldiers in Albania. They were from the Firence, Parma, Perugia, Arezzo, Brennero divisions and other small independent units. Many Italian forces surrendered to the advancing German army. A great part of them were sent to concentration camps or to forced labor in Albania in the service of the German army, while there were also mass killings of Italian officers, mostly from the Perugia Division centered in Gjirokast√´r. Its general, Ernesto Chiminello, together with 150 officers, were executed in Saranda. Some other 32 officers were also killed in Ku√ß area three days later.La guerra pi√π lunga: Albania 1943‚Äì1948 Volume 14 of Testimonianze fra cronaca e storia Author Franco Benanti Publisher U. Mursia, 1966 p. 81-83. Some Italians took refuge in the mountains of Albania, while about 15,000 Italian soldiers surrendered to Albanian partisans. Some Italian troops led by Arnaldo Azzi, ex-commander of Firenze Division, created CITM, Comando Italiano Truppe alla Montagna (Italian Command of the Troops in Mountains). Its objective was to resist German troops with help from the Albanian Partisans. They managed to create some units of Italian soldiers under their command, but these troops were dispersed in the months of October‚ÄìNovember 1943, by the German Winter Offensive. The officers of this command were attached to British missions in Albania and were repatriated in Italy in August 1944.secondorisorgimento.it There were also some 2150 Italians who expressed their desire to continue the fight dispersed among Albanian partisan units. Some 472 Italian fighters were dispersed among Partisan Shock Brigades. Here, there was a group of 137 men who created the Antonio Gramsci Battalion attached to First Shock Brigade and the Matteotti unit was attached to Third Shock Brigade.History of 3rd Shock Brigade p. 17-18 (Historiku i Brigad√´s III Sulmuese, f. 17‚Äì18.) Some 401 were engaged in logistic and another 1,277 were attached to local commands. During the period 1943‚Äì1945 there were other units of Italian fighters among Albanian partisans, such as the 6th Battalion of the Fifth Shock Brigade composed of some 200 Italians.History of 5th Shock Brigade p. 364 (Historiku i Brigad√´s V Sulmuese, f. 364) =Wehrmacht deserters= Part of the German force which occupied Albania was composed of Wehrmacht recruits from the Caucasus region. The first Wehrmacht deserters went to Albanian Partisan units at the end of 1943 during the German Winter Offensive, but their numbers grew in the summer of 1944 during the German Summer Offensive. There was a great flow of Wehrmacht deserters during the end of conflict to Albania from September to October 1944 as German forces began withdrawing from Albania. In August 1944 a new unit was formed in Third Shock Brigade from some 40 Wehrmacht deserters (mostly Armenians and Turkmen). Some other 70 Armenians created their own unit attached to First Shock Brigade in September 1944. There were also other small groups of Wehrmacht deserters dispersed among Albanian partisan forces, composed of Germans, Austrians, Frenchmen, Czechs and Poles. =Allied links and assistance= Billy McLean at Shtylla, August 1943 during the first SOE mission to Albania. Behind them are Stilian and Stephan and, on the right, Major Peter Kemp. The British had tried mounting liaison operations into Italian-occupied Albania in early 1941, from what was then neutral Yugoslavia. These attempts were quickly abandoned after the Germans and Italians overran Yugoslavia. Thereafter, no attempt was made to contact Albanian resistance groups until 17 April 1943, when M.O.4, a branch of the liaison organisation SOE, dispatched a mission commanded by Lieutenant Colonel \\"Billy\\" MacLean, with Major David Smiley as his second-in-command. Rather than drop \\"blind\\" into Albania, the mission was dropped into North-West Greece, where British parties were already operating with Greek guerrillas. From there, they made their way into Albania on foot or on mules. After several false starts, the mission made contact with the NLM. The first supply drop of arms and equipment was received on 27 June. The bulk of the stores received in this and subsequent drops were donated to the NLM, who were the dominant group in Southern Albania, and were used to equip the \\"First Partisan Brigade\\". Later in 1943, SOE increased the size of the mission to Albania. The new commander was Brigadier Edmund Frank Davies of the Royal Ulster Rifles (nicknamed \\"Trotsky\\" at Sandhurst because of the \\"disciplined bolshevism\\" in his character), with Lieutenant Colonel Arthur Nicholls as Chief of Staff. MacLean and Smiley were withdrawn to SOE's new base at Bari in Southern Italy to report. Although they noted that the Communist-led NLM appeared to be more interested in securing political power after the war than fighting the Germans, they recommended that SOE continue to supply them, while attempting to achieve agreement between the NLM and the other resistance movements. In January 1944, the Germans attacked and overran the British mission HQ. Brigadier Davies was captured, while Lieutenant Colonel Nicholls died of exposure and post-operative shock after leading the survivors to safety. During the remainder of 1944, SOE continued to supply the NLM, despite complaints from MacLean and Smiley, now running liaison parties with Abaz Kupi's group and the Balli Komb√´tar in Northern Albania, that the NLM were using these arms against their political opponents rather than the Germans. Smiley, MacLean and Julian Amery were evacuated to Italy at the end of October. SOE refused to evacuate Abaz Kupi on the same boat, and he made his own escape from the country, being picked up by a Royal Naval vessel in the Adriatic.

History The dynasty was founded by Zogu Pasha who migrated to Mati, Albania in the early 13th century. The most famous member of the dynasty is Zog I, who in 1928 was proclaimed King of the Albanians and ruled until he was deposed by Victor Emmanuel III of Italy and the Italian invasion in 1939.

Beforehand, he served as the Attorney General of Israel from 1997 to 2004. Rubinstein, a former Israeli diplomat and long-time civil servant, has had an influential role in that country's internal and external affairs, most notably in helping to shape its peace treaties with Egypt and Jordan. Early life Born in Tel Aviv and raised in Givatayim, he graduated the Tzieltin religious high school in Tel Aviv and earned his bachelor's (1969) and master's (1974) degrees from Hebrew University of Jerusalem. Career Rubinstein launched a career in law, serving as a legal advisor to the ministries of Defense and Foreign Affairs during the mid-1970s. His diplomatic career started in 1977, as from then through 1979 he was a member of Israel's delegation to the peace talks with Egypt that led to the signing of the Camp David Accords between the two countries. Upon their completion, he became in 1980 an assistant director-general of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs in charge of implementing the normalization of relations with Egypt. During the early 1980s he served in a variety of capacities in the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, and in 1985-1986 served as Deputy Chief of Mission of the Embassy of Israel in Washington, D.C.. In 1986 he was appointed Cabinet SecretaryElyakim Rubinstein on the official website of the Israeli Courts and in this capacity he served in various roles relating to Israel‚ÄìUnited States relations. In 1991 he was again a member of an Israeli peace negotiating team, traveling as part of the Israeli delegation to the Madrid Peace Conference that opened the negotiations (for which he served as chairman of the Israeli delegation) that would eventually lead to the 1993 Oslo Accords, a major breakthrough in the Israeli‚ÄìPalestinian conflict. Following the conclusion of these talks, he chaired the Israeli delegation to peace talks with Jordan, which concluded successfully with the 1994 Israel‚ÄìJordan peace treaty. Rubinstein (far left) at the signing of the Israel-Jordan peace treaty He then turned towards domestic Israeli jurisprudence, serving as a judge on Jerusalem's District Court from 1995 to 1997, and then as Attorney General of Israel, a position he held until January 25, 2004. He has written several books on Israel's Supreme Court, especially focusing on the relation of Judaism to Israeli political and legal life. In this role he has gained a reputation for being somewhat of a liberal reformer, going up against the established might of Orthodox Judaism in favor of religious pluralism to represent all factions of Judaism. His most important success in this endeavor has been to gain Reform and Conservative Judaism seats on Jerusalem's religious council, previously controlled entirely by the Orthodox. He has proposed opening a section of the Western Wall for non-Orthodox religious services, but this has not yet been successful. Rubinstein has been criticized for being too hesitant or indecisive in cases involving powerful Israeli officials. In particular, he was criticized for having moved too slowly on corruption charges involving Prime Minister Ariel Sharon and his son Gilad. In the weeks following Rubinstein's end of term as Attorney General The State Attorney, Edna Arbel, was quick to recommend that Sharon be indicted on bribery charges, however Rubinstein's replacement Menachem Mazuz subsequently exonerated Sharon and his sons and did not press charges of corruption due to insufficient evidence.Sharon's son ordered to hand over documents CNN, 29 March 2004 In May 2004, Rubinstein was appointed to Israel's Supreme Court. In January 2015 he was appointed Vice President of the Court, a position he held until his statutory retirement at the age of 70, in 2017.  Controversies  = As Attorney General = Rubinstein gained a reputation for being somewhat of a liberal reformer, going up against the established might of Orthodox Judaism in favor of religious pluralism to represent all factions of Judaism.

He has proposed opening a section of the Western Wall for non-Orthodox religious services, but this has not yet been implemented. In 1999, Rubinstein decided not to investigate former Sephardi Chief Rabbi Ovadia Yosef, the founder and spiritual leader of the ultra-Orthodox Shas party, for calling Supreme Court justices \\"evildoers\\", \\"empty-headed and reckless\\" and various other harsh epithets. A year later, however, he did order an investigation after Rabbi Yosef compared the secular education minister, Yossi Sarid, to the Pharaoh of the Book of Exodus and said he should be \\"extirpated from the Earth\\" like Haman in the Book of Esther. In January 2000, Rubinstein asked President Ezer Weizman to hand over financial documents after it was disclosed in the press that he failed to report $450,000 he received as a \\"gift\\" from a friend to the Knesset and tax authorities. Weizman ultimately resigned six months later. Despite this, Rubinstein was often criticized for being too hesitant or indecisive in cases involving powerful Israeli officials, in particular for moving too slowly on those corruption charges involving Prime Minister Ariel Sharon and his son Gilad. In the weeks following the end of his term as Attorney General, the State Attorney, Edna Arbel, was quick to recommend that Sharon be indicted on bribery charges. Rubinstein's initial hesitancy, however, was subsequently vindicated by his replacement, Menachem Mazuz, who decided not to press charges of corruption against Sharon and his son due to insufficient evidence. In the midst of the Sharon investigation Rubinstein suspended a state prosecutor for leaking to a Haaretz reporter a document that outlined corruption allegations against Sharon and his son while the matter was sub judice. During the 2003 legislative election campaign, Attorney General Rubinstein supported the Central Election Committee's decision to ban the anti-Zionist Balad party and its leader, Azmi Bishara, as well as Baruch Marzel of the right-wing Yamin Yisrael party from running, but he objected to its decision to disqualify Ahmad Tibi on account of his public support for Yasser Arafat, which it viewed as tacit support for terrorism. The Committee based its opinion on Article 7 of the Basic Law on the Knesset, which states that candidates for Knesset cannot oppose the Jewish and democratic character of the state, preach racism or support armed attacks by an enemy state or terrorist organization. Rubinstein even submitted to the Court information gathered by the Shin Bet to support the ban on Bishara (who subsequently fled the country before he was charged with treason and espionage for advising Hezbollah during the 2006 Lebanon War and stealing millions of shekels from Arab aid organizations). Balad, Bishara, and Marzel, however, were ultimately allowed to participate in the elections when the decisions against them were overturned by the Supreme Court. = On the Supreme Court = In 2012, Rubinstein, who is regarded by many as a \\"relative conservative\\" on the Court, openly supported the right of his Arab-Christian colleague, Justice Salim Joubran, not to sing the national anthem, Hatikvah, at an official ceremony: In his capacity as chairman of the 2013 Knesset election committee, Rubinstein forced the removal of several television ads, one from Shas, which he viewed as insulting to Russian-speaking immigrants, and the others from Otzma LeYisrael, which he viewed as racist against Arabs. Landmark rulings * CA 4243/08 Assessment Officer - Dan Region v. Vered Peri of April 30, 2009: Rubinstein joined four colleagues in a landmark decision that upheld a Tel Aviv District Court decision allowing working parents to deduct childcare expenses from their taxes. In his concurring opinion, he quoted a commentary by Menachem Mendel Schneerson, the Lubavitcher rebbe, on the obligation of charity in Halakha, or Jewish religious law, to apply a parallel obligation in Israeli civil law, and concluded: * HCJ 746/07 Ragen v. Ministry of Transport of January 5, 2011: Speaking for the High Court of Justice, Rubinstein ruled that public buses could not bow to pressure from Haredim (ultra-Orthodox) Jews and segregate passengers by gender without their consent, citing the American civil rights movement as his precedent: * HCJ 6298/07 Ressler v Knesset of February 21, 2012: Rubinstein sided with the High Court's majority declaring the so-called Tal Law unconstitutional.The law provided special exemption from mandatory military service in the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) to ultra- Orthodox Jews and extended mandatory military service to Israeli-Arabs. Rubinstein, who is religious, included numerous texts from traditional Jewish texts in his written ruling. This prompted former Chief Rabbi Yosef to label the High Court \\"a court of gentiles,\\" call Rubinstein and his colleagues \\"wicked\\" and declare that they should not be allowed to lead synagogue prayers. While sitting on the High Court, Rubinstein ruled in favor of evicting residents of two of the 46 unrecognized Bedouin villages inside Israel that were established illegally, without official administrative or planning approval. * HCJ 3094/11 Ibrahim Farhood Abu al-Qi‚Äôan et al v. the State of Israel of May 5, 2015: In ruling on the case of Umm al-Hiran, Rubinstein wrote: * CA 3094/11 Al-Qi'an v. the State of Israel of May 5, 2015: In a case involving Al-Araqeeb, the court stated that the 2007 United Nations General Assembly‚Äôs Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples and a pro- indigenous peoples‚Äô rights 1992 Australia court ruling were not binding and did not reflect codified customary international law. In his decision, Rubinstein, together with Justice Neal Hendel, approved the removal of the village, stating: * AAA 5875/10 The Conservative Movement and the Movement for Progressive Judaism in Israel v. Be'er Sheva Religious Council and the Ministry of Religious Services of February 11, 2016: In this landmark decision, Rubinstein ruled that all of Israel‚Äôs public ritual baths (mikva'ot) must allow access to groups wishing to perform non-Orthodox conversions. A month later, he joined with the majority in another landmark ruling that held that immigrants who converted to Judaism through independent conversion courts outside the auspices of the Chief Rabbinate of Israel must be recognized as Jews under the country's Law of Return. * HCJ 4374/15 The Movement for Quality Government v. The Prime Minister of Israel of March 27, 2016: Rubinstein wrote the High Court's decision invalidating Israel's natural gas plan, siding with the appellants, which included the Movement for Quality Government in Israel, the Israel Union for Environmental Defense, and the Israel Labor Party and Meretz. The ruling was criticized by Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, who said in response that \\"the court's decision seriously threatens the development of gas reserves of the State of Israel. Israel is seen as a state in which excessive judicial intervention makes it difficult to do business with.\\" Rubinstein wrote: * HCJ 5304/15 Israel Medical Association v. Israel Knesset of September 11, 2016: Rubinstein, joined by other justices on the High Court, denied petitions on behalf of Palestinian hunger strikers imprisoned on terrorism-related charges, challenging an amendment to the law that permits their force-feeding by physicians. Declaring the amendment constitutional, Rubinstein, writing for the Court, declared that a hunger striker \\"is not an ordinary patient but a person who knowingly and willingly places himself in a dangerous situation as a protest or a means of attaining a personal or public goal.\\" He also noted that laws in France, the United States, Australia, Germany, and Austria enable forced artificial feeding under exceptional cases that vary from country to country. Moreover, he argued, relevant decisions of the European Court of Human Rights do not completely prohibit forced feeding. Although security considerations by themselves do not justify the use of forced treatment, Rubinstein stated, such considerations may be weighed when a treating physician has already determined that the prisoner‚Äôs medical status is grave and that there is a real danger to his or her life or that lack of treatment will expose the prisoner to an irreversible serious handicap. Certain Israeli human rights organizations and the appellant, the Israel Medical Association (IMA), opposed the Court's decision. The IMA announced that it would instruct its members to ignore it. \\"This is a case in which medical ethics unequivocally trump the law, and the message we wish to convey to physicians is that forced feeding is tantamount to torture and that no doctor should take part in it,\\" stated the association's president. Personal life Rubinstein's wife, Miriam, is also an advocate, a former director of the Civil Division at the Office of the State Attorney and, like her husband, a former Jerusalem District Court judge. They had four daughters, one of whom, Sari, died after from cancer on October 25, 2016 at the age of 39. A mother of two small daughters herself, Sari, like her parents, studied law and became a licensed advocate upon passing the bar examination, after which she was accepted as a cadet at the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. Elyakim and Miram Rubinstein have 11 grandchildren.

It was composed in 1945 as a patriotic song celebrating independence from Japanese occupation and was adopted as the state anthem in 1947. Etymology \\"Aegukka\\" is a Romanized transliteration of \\"The Patriotic Song\\"; the song is also known by its incipit Ach'im≈≠n pinnara or \\"Let Morning Shine\\" or alternatively as the \\"Song of a Devotion to a Country\\". The Encyclopedia of Korean Culture defines \\"Aegukka\\" as \\"the song to wake up the mind to love the country\\". \\"Aegukka\\" in itself is differentiated from a national anthem. While a national anthem or gukka () is an official symbol of the state, aegukka refers to any song, official or unofficial, that contains patriotic fervor towards its country, such as Hungary's \\"Sz√≥zat\\" or the U.S. \\"The Stars and Stripes Forever\\". However, the nationally designated \\"Aegukka\\" plays the role of symbolizing the country. In general shorthand, the term aegukka refers to the national anthem of North Korea. History Originally, the Korean exile government (1919‚Äì1945) in Shanghai, China adopted as their national anthem \\"Aegukga\\" (which has the same name with a different Romanization) to the tune of \\"Auld Lang Syne\\". After World War II, South Korea kept the words, put to a new tune (changed from \\"Auld Lang Syne\\"), while North Korea adopted this newly written piece in 1947. The words were written by Pak Se-yong and the music was composed by Kim Won- gyun. In the early 1980s, Kim Jong-il sought to reduce the song's importance to the benefit of \\"Song of General Kim Il-sung\\". The complete version of \\"Aegukka\\" consists two verses. On official occasions, when only the first verse is performed, it is customary to repeat the last four bars. However, if both verses are performed, it is the last four bars of the second verse that are repeated instead. \\"Song of General Kim Il-sung\\" and \\"Song of General Kim Jong-il\\" have since taken the place of de facto national anthems domestically, and \\"Aegukka\\" is reserved for representing North Korea internationally: when foreign dignitaries visit the country or North Korean athletes compete at international sporting competitions. Compared to other nations, the North Korean national anthem is not often performed inside the country (except for radio and television sign-off) and thus many North Koreans do not know the lyrics. \\"Aegukka\\" is almost unique among most North Korean patriotic songs, as it praises neither the Workers' Party of Korea, nor the Kim dynasty, but rather the whole of Korea itself. \\"Aegukka\\" is played at the start of each of Korean Central Television's broadcast days.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_OfKEbREFkIhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5GG9kaKJ5_8&feature;=youtu.be&t;=134 See also * National symbols of North Korea * \\"Aegukga\\" References Further reading * External links *Lyrics in English at Naenara *Lyrics in Korean at Naenara *\\"Aegukka\\" (mp3) at Naenara North Korean songs Asian anthems National symbols of North Korea National anthem compositions in B-flat major ","title":"Aegukka"},{"id":"291359","text":"Where on Earth Is Carmen Sandiego? is an American animated television series based on the series of computer games. The show was produced by DIC Productions L.P. and originally aired from 1994 to 1999, on Saturday mornings during FOX's Fox Kids Network block. The series won a Daytime Emmy Award for Outstanding Children's Animated Program in 1995, and in the same year was spun-off into a Where in the World-styled video game entitled Carmen Sandiego Junior Detective. Its theme tune bears a close resemblance to the chorus \\"Singt dem gro√üen Bassa Lieder\\" (\\"Sing Songs of the Great Pasha\\") from Mozart's opera Die Entf√ºhrung aus dem Serail (The Abduction from the Seraglio). History =Production and broadcast (1994‚Äì1999)= The script for every Earth episode had to meet the approval of Broderbund, which created and, at the time, owned the Carmen franchise. Their cause for concern was the level of the violence on other FOX children's shows such as X-Men and Mighty Morphin Power Rangers. Broderbund did not require this of the creators of the World and Time game shows that aired on PBS, presumably since PBS, as the distributor of such shows as Sesame Street, had a long-standing reputation for non-violent educational children's programming. The lead characters of Earth were featured in Carmen Sandiego Junior Detective, released in 1995. The opening theme song for the show is \\"Singt dem gro√üen Bassa Lieder\\" from Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart's Die Entf√ºhrung aus dem Serail, with new lyrics, pop instrumentation, and a backbeat. The Rainbow Animation Group (later renamed Galaxy World, Inc., not to be confused with the Italian studio Rainbow S.p.A.), and Han Yang Productions contributed some animation for this series. =Home media releases= Fox Video originally released the series on VHS through their Fox Kids Video label, which contained two episodes each. In November 2001, Lions Gate Home Entertainment and Trimark Home Video released two VHS tapes, Carmen's Revenge and Time Traveler, consisting of the show's three-part episodes (\\"Retribution\\" and \\"Labyrinth\\") in a feature-length format. Time Traveller was also released on DVD, and alongside the \\"Labyrinth\\" episode, also came with a demo of Where in the World is Carmen Sandiego? Treasures of Knowledge. A video of the episode \\"Timing is Everything\\" was included with some versions of the mentioned game. In September 2003, Sterling Entertainment released Into the Maelstrom and No Place like Home on VHS and DVD. Into the Maelstrom contained the three part \\"Retribution\\" episode, while No Place like Home contained the episode \\"The Remnants\\" and the two-part episode \\"Can You Ever Go Home Again?\\" The DVD versions contained \\"When it Rains...\\" and \\"Follow My Footprints\\" as bonus episodes, respectively. NCircle Entertainment reissued both DVDs in 2007. On June 13, 2006, Shout! Factory and Sony BMG Music Entertainment released the first season on DVD. Due to poor sales, no further seasons were released. On July 22, 2011, Mill Creek Entertainment announced that they had acquired the rights to the series and planned on releasing it in its entirety in 2012. They subsequently released Where on Earth Is Carmen Sandiego? ‚Äì The Complete Series on DVD in Region 1 on February 21, 2012. This four-disc set contains all forty episodes of the series. They also released a ten-episode best-of collection the same day. These releases have been discontinued and are now out of print. On June 6, 2017, Mill Creek re-released the complete series on DVD in Region 1. Plot Following the plot of the Carmen Sandiego franchise, Earth sees international thief Carmen Sandiego lead the organization V.I.L.E. in stealing treasures from around the world and leaving clues behind for ACME agents Zack (voiced by Scott Menville) and Ivy (voiced by Jennifer Hale), under the guidance of the Chief (voiced by Rodger Bumpass), to find, in order to capture her. In this version, Carmen Sandiego is a former agent of ACME who left to seek a greater challenge, and has a strong code of ethics when stealing items. The Player is an unseen live-action character who bookends acts by communicating with Carmen; it is implied that to them the television series is a video game that they are playing from a computer. While Carmen is originally presented as the show's antagonist, she becomes more like an anti-hero as the series progresses; she even helps Zack and Ivy against mutual enemies. Characters =Main characters= * Carmen Sandiego (voiced by Rita Moreno) ‚Äì An international thief and the head of V.I.L.E.

Traitor ‚Äì A court judge-turned-criminal who hunts crooks down and sentences them to a secret jail while stealing their loot. He appeared in \\"The Trail of Carmen Sandiego\\" where he had Carmen Sandiego abducted from her caper in the Mayan Ruins and subpoenaed Zack and Ivy to his hidden courtroom in Italy using Lee Galese as bait. Once Zack and Ivy arrived, Judge R.B. Traitor dismissed Galese and had them represent Sandiego when she was accused of stealing a copy of Magna Carta.

They both like to steal antique Chinese artifacts. =Other villains= As Carmen Sandiego became less villainous and evolved into more of an antihero, other characters began to fill her original role as the show's antagonist. The following villains are: * Dr. Sara Bellum ‚Äì Carmen Sandiego's former mad scientist who makes all sorts of gadgets for Carmen Sandiego and her V.I.L.E. agents to use. In one episode, she tried to flood the Atacama Desert in Chile to retrieve the Giant of the Atacama, all while dressed as Carmen Sandiego in an effort to take over V.I.L.E. Eventually, Carmen, Zack, and Ivy stopped Sara Bellum's mad plan in time. However in the episode \\"Follow My Footsteps,\\" she returned to V.I.L.E. It is possible she might be pretending to help Carmen or she has reformed. Her name is a pun on \\"cerebellum,\\" a part of the brain. * Dr. Gunnar Maelstrom (voiced by Tim Curry) ‚Äì A Swedish hostile and extremely violent criminal whose archenemy is Carmen Sandiego. Maelstrom considers her a threat because she and Chief captured him back in her detective days at ACME in 1985 and got him sent to Folsom State Prison in northern California. In \\"Maelstrom's Revenge,\\" he escapes from prison by using a bomb attached to his watch as a diversion so he could escape through the back door. Carmen Sandiego was forced to team up with Zack and Ivy to help capture him and send him back to prison. * Mason Dixon ‚Äì The henchman who betrayed V.I.L.E. in numerous ways in the episode \\"Timing is Everything.\\" It began in 1989 when Carmen and Mason were in Amsterdam to steal a Rembrandt painting. Mason was captured and sentenced to 7 years in prison, while Carmen escaped from the police. When Mason was released, Carmen began searching for a Civil War-era sofa in the Appomattox Courthouse. The caper failed, resulting in Carmen being furious with Mason. As retaliation, he stole Carmen's time machine and went back to 1989 to change the outcome of the Rembrandt theft so Carmen would go to jail and he would go on to run V.I.L.E. as the world's greatest thief. In this alternate reality, Carmen becomes Mason's henchman and has low self-esteem because she \\"almost always [gets] caught.\\" Mason, with Carmen's unwilling aid, began stealing a series of items that would change the outcome of the Civil War. Carmen helped Zack and Ivy recapture him and take back control over V.I.L.E., making her the world's greatest thief once more. His name is a play on the surveyors Mason and Dixon who drew the border between Maryland and Pennsylvania in the 1760s known as the Mason‚ÄìDixon line. * Lee Jordan (voiced by David Coburn) ‚Äì The only ACME agent to have \\"officially\\" captured Carmen Sandiego. He was perhaps the most accomplished of all of ACME's employees and as such, had quite a conceited attitude about himself. He was often flirtatious with Ivy (much to her disgust), who hated his arrogance. He went on hiatus from ACME for an indeterminate amount of time, during which his outlook on his career took a drastic turn. Embittered by his fame and the lack of challenge the concept of fighting crime, he quit working for ACME and helped Carmen Sandiego escape in order to train to be a V.I.L.E. agent. However, his impulsive and unscrupulous nature clashed greatly with Carmen Sandiego's more refined, pessimistic approach and because of that, he was fired. Infuriated by this, he joined the ranks of former V.I.L.E. agents who sought to usurp Carmen Sandiego from her title as \\"the world's greatest thief.\\" He was foiled twice in this endeavor, both by the combined efforts of ACME and Carmen Sandiego, but still remains hostile, violent and dangerous. Unlike Carmen Sandiego, he sees nothing against putting another person's life in danger to further his own personal gain and has even abducted and used a hostage as blackmail to force Carmen Sandiego into working for him.

When the Roman Empire divided into east and west in 395, the territories of modern Albania became part of the Byzantine Empire. At the end of the 12th century, the northern part of Albania became part of the Kingdom of Serbia (medieval) succeeded by the Serbian Empire, which took over the entirety of Albania and most of the Balkans by the mid 14th century. When the Serbian Empire began, its fall (1355‚Äì1371) most significant ports, located in Albania (Scutari and Durazzo), were captured by the Venetian Republic and became Albania Veneta. The remainder of the region of Albania was divided by local chieftains, most in vassal relation to Venetians or Serbian Despotate. After the Battle of Savra in 1385 most of local chieftains became Ottoman vassals. In 1415‚Äì1417 most of the central and southern Albania was incorporated into the Ottoman Empire and its newly established Sanjak of Albania. In 1432-36 local Albanian chieftains dissatisfied with losing their pre-Ottoman privileges organized a revolt in southern Albania. The revolt was suppressed until another revolt was organized by Skanderbeg in 1443, after the Ottoman defeat in the Battle of Ni≈°, during the Crusade of Varna. In 1444, under Venetian patronage with Skanderbeg as leader of the regional Albanian and Serbian chieftains united against the Ottoman Empire into short-lived alliance disestablished by 1450. Skanderbeg's rebellion against the Ottoman Empire lasted for 25 years. Despite his military valor he was not able to do more than to hold his own possessions within the very small area in the North Albania where almost all his victories against the Ottomans took place. By 1479 the Ottomans captured all Venetian possessions, except Durrazo which they captured in 1501. Until 1913 the territory of Albania would remain part of the Ottoman Empire.  History  = Proto-Albanians = = Byzantine Empire = After the region fell to the Romans in 168 BC it became part of Epirus Nova that was in turn part of the Roman province of Macedonia. Later it was part of provinces of the Byzantine empire called themes. When the Roman Empire was divided into East and West in 395, the territories of modern Albania became part of the Byzantine Empire. Beginning in the first decades of Byzantine rule (until 461), the region suffered devastating raids by Visigoths, Huns, and Ostrogoths. In the 6th and 7th centuries, the region experienced an influx of Slavs. The Albanians appear in medieval Byzantine chronicles in the 11th century, as Albanoi and Arbanitai, and in medieval Latin sources as Albanenses and Arbanenses,Malcolm, Noel. \\"Kosovo, a short history\\". London: Macmillan, 1998, p.29. gradually entering in other European languages, in which other similar derivative names emerged.Lloshi, Xhevat (1999). \\"Albanian\\", p. 277. At this point, they are already fully Christianized. In later Byzantine usage, the terms Arbanitai and Albanoi, with a range of variants, were used interchangeably, while sometimes the same groups were also called by the classicising name Illyrians.Mazaris 1975, pp. 76‚Äì79.N. Gregoras (ed. Bonn) V, 6; XI, 6.. When the Christian church split in 1054 between the East and Rome, the region of southern Albania retained its ties to Constantinople while the north reverted to the jurisdiction of Rome. This split in marked the first significant religious fragmentation of the country. The Albanians, during the Middle Ages, referred to their country as Arb√´ria () and called themselves Arb√´resh√´ ().Demiraj, Bardhyl (2010), pp. 534.Kamusella, Tomasz (2009). The politics of language and nationalism in modern Central Europe. Basingstoke: Palgrave Macmillan. p. 241. = Barbarian Invasions = In the first decades under Byzantine rule (until 461), Epirus nova suffered the devastation of raids by Visigoths, Huns, and Ostrogoths. Not long after these barbarian invaders swept through the Balkans, the Slavs appeared. Between the 6th and 8th centuries they settled in Roman territories. In the 4th century, barbarian tribes began to prey upon the Roman Empire. The Germanic Goths and Asiatic Huns were the first to arrive, invading in mid-century; the Avars attacked in AD. 570; and Slavs invaded in the 6th and 7th century. About fifty years later, the Bulgars conquered much of the Balkan Peninsula and extended their domain to the lowlands of what is now central Albania. In general, the invaders destroyed or weakened Roman and Byzantine cultural centers in the lands that would become Albania. = Bulgarian Empire = In the mid-9th century most of eastern Albania became part of the First Bulgarian Empire, during the reign of Khan Presian. The area, known as Kutmichevitsa, became an important Bulgarian cultural center in the 10th century with many thriving towns such as Devol, Glavinitsa (Ballsh) and Belgrad (Berat). Coastal towns such as Durr√´s remained in the hands of the Byzantines for most of that period. When the Byzantines managed to conquer the Bulgarian Empire in 1018‚Äì19, the fortresses in eastern Albania were some of the last Bulgarian strongholds to be submitted by the Byzantines. Durr√´s was one a centre of a major Bulgarian uprising in 1040‚Äì41 following the discontent of the Bulgarian population by the heavy taxes levied by the Byzantines. Soon the rebellion encompassed the whole of Albania, but it was quelled in 1041, after which Albania again came under Byzantine rule. In 1072 another uprising broke out under Georgi Voiteh but it was also crushed. Later the region was recovered by the Second Bulgarian Empire. The last Bulgarian Emperor to govern the whole territory was Ivan Asen II (1218‚Äì1241) but after his successors the Bulgarian rule diminished. = Serbian Empire = The Serbs controlled parts of what is now northern and eastern Albania toward the end of the 12th century. In 1204, after Western crusaders sacked Constantinople, Venice won nominal control over Albania and the Epirus region of northern Greece and took possession of Durr√´s. A prince from the overthrown Byzantine ruling family, Michael Comnenus, made alliances with Albanian chiefs and drove the Venetians from lands that now make up southern Albania and northern Greece, and in 1204 he set up an independent principality, the Despotate of Epirus, with Ioannina in northwest Greece) as its capital. In 1272 the king of Naples, Charles I of Anjou, occupied Durr√´s and formed an Albanian kingdom that would last for a century. Internal power struggles further weakened the Byzantine Empire in the 14th century, enabling Serbian most powerful medieval ruler, Stefan Dusan, to establish a short-lived empire that included all of Albania except Durr√´s.  Principality of Arbanon  Arbanon was an autonomous principality that existed between the late 12th century and the 1250s. Throughout its existence, the principality was an autonomous dependency of its neighbouring powers, first Byzantium and, after the Fourth Crusade, Epirus, while it also maintained close relations with Serbia. Arbanon extended over the modern districts of central Albania, with the capital at Kruja, and it did not have direct access to the sea. Progon was the first ruler, believed to have ruled in ca. 1190. He was succeeded by his sons Gjin (r. c. 1200‚Äì08) and Dimitri (r. 1208‚Äì16). After this dynasty, the principality came under Greek lord Gregory Kamonas and then his son-in-law Golem. Dimitri's widow, Serbian princess Komnena Nemanjiƒá, had inherited the rule and remarried Kamonas. Arbanon declined after a rebellion against Nicaea in favour of Epirus in 1257‚Äì58.  Kingdom of Albania  Kingdom of Albania at its maximum extent After the fall of the Principality of Arber in its territories and in territories captured by the Despotate of Epiros was created the Kingdom of Albania, which was established by Charles of Anjou. He took the title of King of Albania in February, 1272. The kingdom extended from Durazzo (modern Durr√´s) south along the coast to Cape Linguetta, with vaguely defined borders in the interior. A Byzantine counter-offensive soon ensued, which drove the Angevins out of the interior by 1281. The Sicilian Vespers further weakened the position of Charles, and the Kingdom was soon reduced by the Epirotes to a small area around Durr√´s. The Angevins held out here, however, until 1368, when the city was captured by Karl Thopia. After the fall of the Principality of Arber in territories captured by the Despotate of Epirus, the Kingdom of Albania was established by Charles of Anjou. He took the title of King of Albania in February 1272. The kingdom extended from the region of Durr√´s (then known as Dyrrhachium) south along the coast to Butrint. After the failure of the Eighth Crusade, Charles of Anjou returned his attention to Albania. He began contacting local Albanian leaders through local catholic clergy. Two local Catholic priests, namely John from Durr√´s and Nicola from Arbanon, acted as negotiators between Charles of Anjou and the local noblemen. During 1271 they made several trips between Albania and Italy eventually succeeding in their mission. On 21 February 1272, a delegation of Albanian noblemen and citizens from Durr√´s made their way to Charles' court. Charles signed a treaty with them and was proclaimed King of Albania \\"by common consent of the bishops, counts, barons, soldiers and citizens\\" promising to protect them and to honor the privileges they had from Byzantine Empire. The treaty declared the union between the Kingdom of Albania (Latin: Regnum Albanie) with the Kingdom of Sicily under King Charles of Anjou (Carolus I, dei gratia rex Siciliae et Albaniae). He appointed Gazzo Chinardo as his Vicar-General and hoped to take up his expedition against Constantinople again. Throughout 1272 and 1273 he sent huge provisions to the towns of Durr√´s and Vlor√´. This alarmed the Byzantine Emperor, Michael VIII Palaiologos, who began sending letters to local Albanian nobles, trying to convince them to stop their support for Charles of Anjou and to switch sides. However, the Albanian nobles placed their trust on Charles, who praised them for their loyalty. But Charles of Anjou imposed a military rule on Kingdom of Albania. Throughout its existence the Kingdom saw armed conflict with the Byzantine empire. By 1282 the Angevins were weakened by the Sicilian Vespers but held control of the nominal parts of Albania and even recaptured some and held out until 1368 when the kingdom's territory was reduced to a small area in Durr√´s. Even before the city of Durr√´s was captured, it was landlocked by Karl Thopia's principality. Declaring himself as Angevin descendant, with the capture of Durr√´s in 1368 Karl Thopia created the Princedom of Albania. During its existence Catholicism saw rapid spread among the population which affected the society as well as the architecture of the Kingdom.A Western type of feudalism was introduced and it replaced the Byzantine Pronoia.  Albanian principalities  The 14th century and the beginning of the 15th century was the period in which sovereign principalities were created in Albania under Albanian noblemen. Those principalities were created between the fall of the Serbian Empire and the Ottoman invasion of Albania. In the summer of 1358, Nikephoros II Orsini, the last despot of Epirus of the Orsini dynasty, fought against the Albanian chieftains in Acheloos, Acarnania. The Albanian chieftains won the war and they managed to create two new states in the southern territories of the Despotate of Epirus. Because a number of Albanian lords actively supported the successful Serbian campaign in Thessaly and Epirus, the Serbian Tsar granded them specific regions and offered them the Byzantine title of despotes in order to secure their loyalty. The two Albanian lead states were: the first with its capital in Arta was under the Albanian nobleman Peter Losha, and the second, centered in Angelokastron, was ruled by Gjin Bua Shpata. After the death of Peter Losha in 1374, the Albanian despotates of Arta and Angelocastron were united under the rule of Despot Gjin Bua Shpata. The territory of this despotate was from the Corinth Gulf to Acheron River in the North, neighboring with the Principality of Gjon Zenevisi, another state created in the area of the Despotate of Epirus. From 1335 until 1432 four main principalities were created in Albania. The first of them was the Muzakaj Principality of Berat, created in 1335 in Berat and Myzeqe. The most powerful was the Princedom of Albania, formed after the disestablishment of Kingdom of Albania, by Karl Thopia. The principality changed hands between the Thopia dynasty and the Balsha dynasty, until 1392, when it was occupied by the Ottoman Empire. When Skanderbeg liberated Kruja and reorganised the Principality of Kastrioti, the descendant of Gjergj Thopia, Andrea II Thopia, managed to regain control of the Princedom. Finally, it was united with other Albanian Principalities forming the League of Lezha in 1444. Another principality was Kastrioti, created by Gjon Kastrioti, and later captured by the Ottoman Empire. Finally, it was liberated by the national hero of Albania, George Kastrioti Skanderbeg. The Principality of Dukagjini extended from the Mal√´sia region to Pristina in Kosovo. League of Lezh√´ Under pressure by the Ottoman Empire, the Albanian Principalities were united into a confederation, created in the Assembly of Lezh√´ on 2 March 1444. The league was led by George Kastrioti Skanderbeg, and by Lek√´ Dukagjini following his death. Skanderbeg organized a meeting of Albanian nobles: the Arianiti, Dukagjini, Spani, Thopias, Muzakas, and the leaders of the free Albanian principalities from high mountains, in the town of Lezh√´, where the nobles agreed to fight together for mutual gain against the common Turkish enemy. They voted Skanderbeg as their suzerain chief. The League of Lezh√´ was a confederation and each principality kept its sovereignty. In the light of the modern geopolitical science, the League of Lezh√´ represented an attempt to form a state union. In fact, this was a federation of independent rulers who undertook the duty to follow a common foreign policy, to jointly defend their independence and recruit their allied armed forces. Naturally, it required a collective budget for covering the military expenditures; each family contributed their mite to the common funds of the League. At the same time, each clan kept its possessions and autonomy, to solve internal problems within its own estate. The formation and functioning of the League, of which George Kastrioti was the supreme feudal lord, was the most significant attempt to build up an all-Albanian resistance against the Ottoman occupation and, simultaneously, an effort to create, for the span of its short-lived functioning, of some sort of a unified Albanian state. Under Skanderbeg's command, the Albanian forces marched east, capturing the cities of Dibra and Ohrid. For 25 years, from 1443 ‚Äì 1468, Skanderbeg's 10,000 men army marched through Ottoman territory, winning victory after victory against the consistently larger and better supplied Ottoman forces. Threatened by Ottoman advances in their homeland, Hungary, and later Naples and Venice, their former enemies, provided the financial backbone and support for Skanderbeg's army. On 14 May 1450, an Ottoman army, larger than any previous force encountered by Skanderbeg or his men, stormed and overwhelmed the castle of the city of Kruj√´. This city was particularly symbolic to Skanderbeg as he had been previously appointed suba of Kruj√´ in 1438 by the Ottomans. The fighting lasted four months, with an Albanian loss of over 1,000 men and over 20,000 for the Ottomans. The Ottoman forces were unable to capture the city and had no choice but to retreat before winter set in. In June 1446, Mehmed II, known as \\"the conqueror\\", led an army of 150,000 soldiers back to Kruj√´, but failed to capture the castle. Skanderbeg's death in 1468 did not end the struggle for independence, and fighting continued until 1481, under Lek√´ Dukagjini, when Albanian lands were finally forced to succumb to the Ottoman forces. Medieval culture In the latter part of the Middle Ages, Albanian urban society reached a high point of development. Foreign commerce flourished to such an extent that leading Albanian merchants had their own agencies in Venice, Ragusa (modern Dubrovnik, Croatia), and Thessalonica (now Thessaloniki, Greece). The prosperity of the cities also stimulated the development of education and the arts. Albanian, however, was not the language used in schools, churches, and official government transactions. Instead, Greek and Latin, which had the powerful support of the state and the church, were the official languages of culture and literature. The new administrative system of the themes, or military provinces created by the Byzantine Empire, contributed to the eventual rise of feudalism in Albania, as peasant soldiers who served military lords became serfs on their landed estates. Among the leading families of the Albanian feudal nobility were the Topia, Balsha, Shpata, Muzaka, Araniti, Dukagjini, and Kastrioti. The first three of these rose to become rulers of principalities that were practically independent of Byzantium.

","title":"Albania in the Middle Ages"},{"id":"291374","text":"Nongonococcal urethritis (NGU) is an inflammation of the urethra that is not caused by gonorrheal infection. For treatment purposes, doctors usually classify infectious urethritis in two categories: gonococcal urethritis, caused by gonorrhea, and nongonococcal urethritis (NGU). Symptoms The symptoms of urethritis can include pain or a burning sensation upon urination (dysuria), a white/cloudy discharge and a feeling that one needs to pass urine frequently. For men, the signs and symptoms are discharge from the penis, burning or pain when urinating, itching, irritation, or tenderness. In women, the signs and symptoms are discharge from vagina, burning or pain when urinating, anal or oral infections, abdominal pain, or abnormal vaginal bleeding, which may be an indication that the infection has progressed to Pelvic Inflammatory Disease. NGU is transmitted by touching the mouth, penis, vagina or anus by penis, vagina or anus of a person who has NGU. NGU is more common in men than women. Men may have a discharge (strange liquid) from the penis, pain when urinating, and itching, irritation or tenderness around the opening of the penis. Women might not have any symptoms and may not know they have NGU until severe problems occur. Women might have discharge from the vagina, burning or pain when urinating, pain in the abdominal (stomach) area, or bleeding from the vagina that is not from a monthly period. (This may be an sign that NGU has become worse and turned into Pelvic Inflammatory Disease, or PID). Causes There are many causes of NGU. This is in part due to the large variety of organisms living in the urinary tract. Ureaplasma urealyticum and Mycoplasma genitalium are some of the culprits. NGU is also associated with reactive arthritis, in which the triad of arthritis, conjunctivitis, and urethritis is seen. =Bacterial= The most common bacterial cause of NGU is Chlamydia trachomatis, but it can also be caused by Ureaplasma urealyticum, Haemophilus vaginalis, Mycoplasma genitalium, Mycoplasma hominis, Neisseria meningitidis, Gardnerella vaginalis, Acinetobacter lwoffii, Acinetobacter calcoaceticus, and E.coli. =Viral= Herpes simplex virus, Adenovirus, Cytomegalovirus =Fungi= Candida Albicans =Parasitic= Parasitic causes include Trichomonas vaginalis (rare). =Noninfectious= Urethritis can be caused by mechanical injury (from a urinary catheter or a cystoscope), or by an irritating chemical (antiseptics or some spermicides). Diagnosis It has been easy to test for the presence of gonorrhea by viewing a Gram stain of the urethral discharge under a microscope: The causative organism is distinctive in appearance; however, this works only with men because other non-pathogenic gram-negative microbes are present as normal flora of the vagina in women. Thus, one of the major causes of urethritis can be identified (in men) by a simple common test, and the distinction between gonococcal and non-gonococcal urethritis arose for this reason. Non-gonococcal urethritis (NGU) is diagnosed if a person with urethritis has no signs of gonorrhea bacteria on laboratory tests. The most frequent cause of NGU (23%-55% of cases) is C. trachomatis. Non-specific urethritis In the United Kingdom, NGU is more often called non-specific urethritis;Non-specific urethritis, NHSNon-specific Urethritis (NSU) , NHS, Genito-Urinary Medicine (GUM)NSU (non-specific urethritis), BBC \\"non-specific\\" is a medical term meaning \\"specific cause has not been identified\\", and in this case refers to the detection of urethritis, and the testing for but found negative of gonorrhea. In this sense, the most likely cause of NSU is a chlamydia infection. However, the term NSU is sometimes distinguished and used to mean that both gonorrhea and chlamydia have been ruled out.Non-specific urethritis (NSU) and Cervicitis Thus, depending on the sense, chlamydia can either be the most likely cause or have been ruled out, and frequently detected organisms are Ureaplasma urealyticum and Mycoplasma hominis. Treatment Treatment is based on the prescription and use of the proper antibiotics depending on the strain of the ureaplasma. Because of its multi-causative nature, initial treatment strategies involve using a broad range antibiotic that is effective against chlamydia (such as doxycycline). It is imperative that both the patient and any sexual contacts be treated. Women infected with the organisms that cause NGU may develop pelvic inflammatory disease. If symptoms persist, follow-up with a urologist may be necessary to identify the cause. According to a study, tinidazole used with doxycycline or azithromycin may cure NGU better than when doxycycline or azithromycin is used alone. If left untreated, complications include epididymitis and infertility. Consistent and correct use of latex condoms during sexual activity greatly reduces the likelihood of infection.

Prior to the rise of nationalism, Albania remained under the rule of the Ottoman Empire for almost five centuries and the Ottoman authorities suppressed any expression of national unity or national conscience by the Albanian people. There is some debate among experts regarding when the Albanian nationalist movement should be considered to have started.

Page 39 On December 20, 1912, the Conference of Ambassadors in London recognized an independent Albania within its present-day borders.Richard C. Hall, The Balkan Wars, 1912‚Äì1913: prelude to the First World War Background =1831‚Äì1878= Pashalik of Scutari (1757‚Äì1831) was the last of the Albanian pashaliks to fall. After the fall of the Yanina Pashalik, the power and influence of the Albanian beys had faded. The remaining beys thus attempted to restore their rule. An assembly was held in Berat in 1828. In this Convention, the leaders were Ismail Bey Qemali, Zylyftar Poda and Shahin bej Delvina. The Ottoman Empire tried to prevent the rise of local beys, which presented a menace to centralized power. In 1830, the Sublime Porte sent an expeditionary force under the command of Re≈üid Mehmed Pasha to suppress the local Albanian beys. On hearing the news of the Ottoman forces' arrival, the three most powerful local chiefs, Zylyftar Poda, accompanied by the remains of Ali Pasha's faction, Veli Bey (whose power base was around Yannina), and Arslan Bey, along with other less powerful beys, began to prepare their forces to resist a probable Ottoman attack. Realising the seriousness of the situation and the danger of a general uprising, Re≈üid Mehmed Pasha invited the Albanian beys to a meeting on the pretext that they would be rewarded for their loyalty to the Porte. The beys however, were all killed along with their guards. The last Albanian pashalik to fall was the Scutari Pashalik. The Bushati dynasty rule ended when an Ottoman army under Mehmed Reshid Pasha besieged the Rozafa Castle and forced Mustafa Reshiti to surrender (1831). The Albanian defeat ended a planned alliance between the Albanian beys and the Bosnian nobility, who were similarly seeking autonomy. Instead of the pashalik, the vilayets of Scutari and that of Kosovo were created. = Early revolts = By removing the Timar system, the Sublime Porte intended to strengthen its central government and reclaim the power of the Empire which had been severely weakened due to economic and social backwardness, from the exploitative system and from the ongoing uprisings of peoples. Reforms began to be implemented in Albania since the 1830s. They gave a blow to the ranks of the old military feudal class which had been weakened from Ottoman expeditions from 1822 to 1831. Parts of the feudal heads that had launched revolts were eliminated, others were exiled and those who could, had escaped from the country. All their properties were declared state-owned. This gave rise to new landowners who had connections to the Sublime Porte. Due to the Ottoman occupation, the ideology of Nationalism developed difficultly and were limited in Albanian-inhabited territories in the Balkan. They found more favorable development conditions outside, in the capital of the Empire, Istanbul, Italy, other Balkan countries etc. The national ideas became apparent via popular uprisings against the Tanzimat reforms, but they still did not reach a period to be formulated in full policy of the National Movement. They were more expressed with literary works and studies of the Albanian people, history, language and culture. In their writings, the Rilindas fought to invoke feelings of love for the country by exalting patriotic traditions and episodes of history, especially that of the Skanderbeg era and folk culture; They devoted a lot of attention to native language and Albanian schools as a means to affirm individuality and national vindication. The centralizing reforms of the Ottoman government were implemented immediately with the deployment of civil and military personnel in Albania. This was met with resistance by the local population which first began with the refusal to execute orders and quickly transformed into armed rebellion. After two local uprisings that burst in the beginning of 1833 in Kolonj√´ and in Dib√´r were repressed, uprisings occurred in Berat-Vlor√´- Delvin√´-√áam√´ria area in larger scales than before. The actions of the Ottoman army were driven by terror and increased unhappiness in the local population, who were aptly anticipated to revolt again. Fugitive agitators circulated across the provinces to organize further rebellions, calling on the people to prepare for war. Others were sent to neighboring provinces to secure their presence by pointing out they are \\"brothers.\\" To get ahead of the danger Of the new outbreak of popular hate, at the beginning of 1844, the Ottoman authorities urged urgent action. They concentrated large military forces at various points, especially in Bitola where the state was worse. By the end of March 1844, the new uprising erupted but was suppressed. In the ensuing years there were bursts of armed insurrections throughout Albania against the Ottoman centralizing reforms, and especially against the burden of the new taxes imposed and against the obligatory military service. But, at the same time and within the bosom of these insurrections, preliminary national claims started to spread. These claims came forth especially in the revolt of 1847, which assumed great proportions in two zones of Southern Albania: in the Gjirokastra region led by Zenel Gjoleka and in that of Berat led by Rapo Hekali.  History  = Formation = The 4 Ottoman vilayets (Kosovo, Scutari, Monastir and Janina), proposed as Albanian vilayet, by the League of Prizren 1878. There is some debate among experts regarding when the Albanian nationalist movement should be considered to have started. Some sources attribute its origins to the revolts against centralization in the 1830s, others to the publication of the first attempt by Naum Veqilharxhi at a standardized alphabet for Albanian in 1844, or to the collapse of the League of Prizren during the Eastern Crisis in 1881. Various compromise positions between these three theses have also emerged, such as one view positing that Albanian nationalism had foundations that dated earlier but \\"consolidated\\" as a movement during the Eastern Crisis (1878-1881). Another view is that Albanian nationalism's roots \\"sprouted\\" in the reforms of the first decades of the 19th century but Albanian nationalism emerged properly in the 1830s and 1840s as a romantic movement for societal reform that was initially mainly driven by Albanians publishing from a broad, and it transformed into an overt political national movement in the 1870s. According to the view that the Rilindja evolved in the 1870s, because of religious ties of the Albanian majority of the population with the ruling Ottomans and the lack of an Albanian state in past, nationalism was less developed and the national movement was greatly delayed among Albanians in the 19th century compared to neighboring southeast European nations, such as the Greeks, Serbs, Bulgarians and Romanians. The Rilindja was a continuation of the Albanian revolts and cultural activities for independence that took place during the entire Ottoman period. The centralist Tanzimat reforms, which were aimed at replacing local Albanian functionaries and suppression of Albanian culture sowed the seeds of the Rilindja. In that period an intellectual and merchant class with the new ideas that were emerging in Europe was shaped, empowering the existing struggle against the Ottoman rule. Political nationalism and economic liberalism were two modern platforms that inspired many Albanian intellectuals. The French Revolution left a socio-economic impact on the Albanian society, with many Albanian intellectuals highlighting ideals of the Revolution and important figures such as Voltaire and Jean-Jacques Rousseau. During that time, the destruction of the Pashalik of Yanina and the growing Greek nationalist ambitions fueled reaction among the Albanian intellectual elite. The son of one merchant family, Naum Veqilharxhi, started his work to write an alphabet intended to help Albanians overcome religious and political issues in 1824 or 1825. Veqilharxhi thought that the continuous occupations had caused many problems to Albanian education. His work facilitated the difussion of national awareness based on the unity of kin, identity of language and traditions. Some Albanian patriots, among them many from the Arb√´resh√´ communities in Italy, built contacts with Italian democratic and revolutionary forces. This helped the Rilindja movement to expand beyond the frame of Albanian-Ottoman relations, and become an international issue. The Risorgimento actually served as an inspiration for the movement. The 1877‚Äì1878 Russo-Turkish War dealt a decisive blow to Ottoman power in the Balkan Peninsula. The Albanians' fear that the lands they inhabited would be partitioned among Montenegro, Serbia, Bulgaria, and Greece fueled the rise of the Albanian national movement. The first postwar treaty, the abortive Treaty of San Stefano signed on March 3, 1878, assigned Albanian-populated lands to Serbia, Montenegro, and Bulgaria. Austria-Hungary and the United Kingdom blocked the arrangement because it awarded Russia a predominant position in the Balkans and thereby upset the European balance of power. A peace conference to settle the dispute was held later in the year in Berlin.Arthur Bullard,The Diplomacy of the Great War, BiblioBazaar 2009 , . Length 360 pages The Treaty of San Stefano triggered profound anxiety among the Albanians meanwhile, and it spurred their leaders to organize a defense of the lands they inhabited. In the spring of 1878, influential Albanians in Constantinople‚Äîincluding Abdyl Frash√´ri, one of the first political ideologues of the National Revival-organized a secret committee to direct the Albanians' resistance. In May the group called for a general meeting of representatives from all the Albanian-populated lands. On June 10, 1878, about eighty delegates, mostly Muslim religious leaders, clan chiefs, and other influential people from the four Albanian-populated Ottoman vilayets, met in Prizren. The delegates declared the formation of the League of Prizren which consisted of two branches: the Prizren branch and the southern branch. The Prizren branch was led by Iljas Dibra and it had representatives from the areas of Kir√ßova (Kicevo), Kalkandelen (Tetovo), Pristine (Pristina), Mitrovi√ßa (Kosovska Mitrovica), Vi√ßitirin (Vucitrn), √úsk√ºp (Skopje), Gilan (Gnjilane), Manastir (Bitola), Debar (Debar) and Gostivar. The southern branch, led by Abdyl Frash√´ri consisted of sixteen representatives from the areas of Kolonj√´, Kor√ß√´, Arta, Berat, Parga, Gjirokast√´r, P√´rmet, Paramythia, Filiates, Margariti, Vlor√´, Tepelen√´ and Delvin√´. The League of Prizren was set under the direction of a central committee that had the power to impose taxes and raise an army. The League of Prizren worked to gain autonomy for the Albanians and to thwart implementation of the Treaty of San Stefano, but not to create an independent Albania.Leften Stavros Stavrianos, Traian Stoianovich, The Balkans since 1453, Edition 2, C. Hurst & Co. Publishers, 2000 , Length 970 pages. page 502 The participants wanted to return to the status quo before the start of Russo-Turkish War of 1877‚Äì1878. The main aim was to defend from immediate dangers. Among other things the League requested an official status for the Albanian language in the Albanian-inhabited territories and the foundation of Albanian schools. At first the Ottoman authorities supported the League of Prizren, but the Sublime Porte pressed the delegates to declare themselves to be first and foremost Ottomans rather than Albanians. Some delegates supported this position and advocated emphasizing Muslim solidarity and the defense of Muslim lands, including present-day Bosnia and Herzegovina. Other representatives, under Frash√´ri's leadership, focused on working toward Albanian autonomy and creating a sense of Albanian identity that would cut across religious and tribal lines. Because conservative Muslims constituted a majority of the representatives, the League of Prizren supported maintenance of Ottoman suzerainty. League of Prizren, group photo, 1878 In July 1878, the league sent a memorandum to the Great Powers at the Congress of Berlin, which was called to settle the unresolved problems of Turkish War, demanding that all Albanians be united in a single autonomous Ottoman province. The Congress of Berlin ignored the league's memorandum. The congress ceded to Montenegro the cities of Bar and Podgorica and areas around the mountain towns of Gusinje and Plav, which Albanian leaders considered Albanian territory. Serbia also gained some Albanian-inhabited lands. The Albanians, the vast majority loyal to the empire, vehemently opposed the territorial losses. Albanians also feared the possible loss of Epirus to Greece. The League of Prizren organized armed resistance efforts in Gusinje, Plav, Scutari, Prizren, Preveza, and Ioannina. A border tribesman at the time described the frontier as \\"floating on blood.\\" Flag used during the Albanian National Awakening and by early 20th- century Albanian rebels. In August 1878, the Congress of Berlin ordered a commission to trace a border between the Ottoman Empire and Montenegro. The congress also directed Greece and the Ottoman Empire to negotiate a solution to their border dispute. The Great Powers expected the Ottomans to ensure that the Albanians would respect the new borders, ignoring that the sultan's military forces were too weak to enforce any settlement and that the Ottomans could only benefit by the Albanians' resistance. The Sublime Porte, in fact, armed the Albanians and allowed them to levy taxes, and when the Ottoman army withdrew from areas awarded to Montenegro under the Treaty of Berlin, Roman Catholic Albanian tribesmen simply took control. The Albanians' successful resistance to the treaty forced the Great Powers to alter the border, returning Gusinje and Plav to the Ottoman Empire and granting Montenegro the Albanian-populated coastal town of Ulcinj. There the Albanians refused to surrender as well. Finally, the Great Powers blockaded Ulcinj by sea and pressured the Ottoman authorities to bring the Albanians under control. The Great Powers decided in 1881 to cede Greece only Thessaly and the district of Arta.Leften Stavros Stavrianos, Traian Stoianovich, The Balkans since 1453 Edition 2, illustrated Publisher C. Hurst & Co. Publishers, 2000 , . page 503. Length 970 pages Faced with growing international pressure \\"to pacify\\" the refractory Albanians, the sultan dispatched a large army under Dervish Turgut Pasha to suppress the League of Prizren and deliver Ulcinj to Montenegro. Albanians loyal to the empire supported the Sublime Porte's military intervention. In April 1881, Dervish Pasha's 10,000 men captured Prizren and later crushed the resistance at Ulcinj. The League of Prizren's leaders and their families were arrested and deported. Frash√´ri, who originally received a death sentence, was imprisoned until 1885 and exiled until his death seven years later. In the three years it survived, the League of Prizren effectively made the Great Powers aware of the Albanian people and their national interests. Montenegro and Greece received much less Albanian-populated territory than they would have won without the league's resistance. Formidable barriers frustrated Albanian leaders' efforts to instill in their people an Albanian rather than an Ottoman identity. Divided into four vilayets, Albanians had no common geographical or political nerve center. The Albanians' religious differences forced nationalist leaders to give the national movement a purely secular character that alienated religious leaders. The most significant factor uniting the Albanians, their spoken language, lacked a standard literary form and even a standard alphabet. Each of the three available choices, the Latin, Cyrillic, and Arabic scripts, implied different political and religious orientations opposed by one or another element of the population. In 1878 there were no Albanian-language schools in the most developed of the Albanian-inhabited areas and the choice for education was between Orthodox Church schools, where education was in Greek and Ottoman government schools where education was in Turkish.Leften Stavros Stavrianos, Traian Stoianovich, The Balkans since 1453 Edition 2, C.

The authorities strove without success to control the political situation in the empire's Albanian- populated lands, arresting suspected nationalist activists. When the sultan refused Albanian demands for unification of the four Albanian-populated vilayets, Albanian leaders reorganized the League of Prizren and incited uprisings that brought the Albanian-populated lands, especially Kosovo, to near anarchy. The imperial authorities disbanded a successor organisation Besa-Bes√´ (League of Peja) founded in 1897, executed its president Haxhi Zeka in 1902, and banned Albanian-language books and correspondence. In Macedonia, where Bulgarian-, Greek-, and Serbian-backed guerrillas were fighting Ottoman authorities and one another for control, Muslim Albanians suffered attacks, and Albanian guerrilla groups retaliated. Albanian leaders meeting in Bitola during 1905 established the Secret Committee for the Liberation of Albania. In 1905, priest Kristo Negovani who had attained Albanian national sentiments abroad returned to his native village of Negovan and introduced the Albanian language for the first time in Orthodox liturgy. For his efforts Negovani was killed by a Greek guerilla band on orders from Bishop Karavangelis of Kastoria that aroused a nationalist response with the Albanian guerilla band of Bajo Topulli killing the Metropolitan of Kor√ß√´, Photios.. \\"Negovani‚Äôs actions caused institutional responses that ultimately intensified the contradictions facing the church and its imperial patron. In the end, Papa Kristo Negovani was murdered for his acts of defiance of the explicit orders of Karavangjelis, the Metropolitan of Kastoria, who condemned the use of Tosk√´risht during mass. \\"The nationalist cause was given impetus in 1905 when the Albanian priest and poet, Papa Kristo Negovani, was killed by Greek chauvinists after he had introduced the Albanian language into Orthodox liturgy.\\". \\"In one case, a guerilla band executed Father Kristo Negovani (1875-1905) on 12 February 1905, two days after he had performed a church service in Albanian.

In 1906 opposition groups in the Ottoman Empire emerged, one of which evolved into the Committee of Union and Progress, more commonly known as the Young Turks, which proposed restoring constitutional government in Constantinople, by revolution if necessary. In July 1908, a month after a Young Turk rebellion in Macedonia supported by an Albanian uprising in Kosovo and Macedonia escalated into widespread insurrection and mutiny within the imperial army, Sultan Abd√ºl Hamid II agreed to demands by the Young Turks to restore constitutional rule. Many Albanians participated in the Young Turks uprising, hoping that it would gain their people autonomy within the empire. The Young Turks lifted the Ottoman ban on Albanian-language schools and on writing the Albanian language. As a consequence, Albanian intellectuals meeting in Bitola in 1908 chose the Latin alphabet as a standard script. The Young Turks, however, were set on maintaining the empire and not interested in making concessions to the myriad nationalist groups within its borders. After securing the abdication of Abd√ºl Hamid II in April 1909, the new authorities levied taxes, outlawed guerrilla groups and nationalist societies, and attempted to extend Constantinople's control over the northern Albanian mountain men. In addition, the Young Turks legalized the bastinado, or beating with a stick, even for misdemeanors, banned carrying rifles, and denied the existence of an Albanian nationality. The new government also appealed for Islamic solidarity to break the Albanians' unity and used the Muslim clergy to try to impose the Arabic alphabet. The Albanians refused to submit to the Young Turks' campaign to \\"Ottomanize\\" them by force. New Albanian uprisings began in Kosovo and the northern mountains in early April 1910. Ottoman forces quashed these rebellions after three months, outlawed Albanian organizations, disarmed entire regions, and closed down schools and publications. Montenegro held ambitions of future expansion into neighbouring Albanian-populated lands and supported a 1911 uprising by the mountain tribes against the Young Turks regime that grew into a widespread revolt. Unable to control the Albanians by force, the Ottoman government granted concessions on schools, military recruitment, and taxation and sanctioned the use of the Latin script for the Albanian language. The government refused, however, to unite the four Albanian-inhabited vilayets.History of the Balkans: Twentieth century Volume 2 of History of the Balkans, Barbara Jelavich History of the Balkans: Twentieth Century, Barbara Jelavich Volume 12 of Publication series, Joint Committee on Eastern Europe Cambridge paperback library Author Barbara Jelavich Edition illustrated, reprint Publisher Cambridge University Press, 1983 , Length 476 pages page 87-88 link = Revolts of 1910 and 1911= Guerrilla fighter Isa Boletini.Idriz Seferi with his rebels entering Ferizaj in 1910 In 1910, due to the new centralization policies of the Young Turk Ottoman government towards Albanians, local Albanian leaders Isa Boletini and Idriz Seferi started an uprising against the Ottomans in the Kosovo vilayet. After subduing the Ottoman garrisons in towns such as Prishtina and Ferizaj, the Ottoman government declared martial law and sent a military expedition of 16,000 men led by Shefket Turgut Pasha. Simultaneously, forces under Idriz Seferi captured the Ka√ßanik pass. They successfully defended the pass from the Ottoman expeditionary force thus, forcing them to send a force of 40,000 men. After two weeks the pass was lost to the Ottomans After fierce fighting, the rebels retreated to Drenica and the Ottomans seized control of Prizren, Gjakova and Peja Afterwards Ottoman forces incurred into Northern Albania and Macedonia. Ottoman forces were stopped for more than 20 days in the Agri Pass, from the Albanian forces of Shal√´, Shosh√´, Nikaj and M√´rtur areas, led by Prel Tuli, Mehmet Shpendi, and Marash Delia. Unable to repress their resistance, this column took another way to Scutari, passing from the Puk√´ region. On July 24, 1910, Ottoman forces entered the city of Scutari. During this period martial courts were put in action and summary executions took place. A large number of firearms were collected and many villages and properties were burned by the Ottoman army. In 1911, the Albanian National Committee was formed. In a meeting of the committee held in Podgorica from 2 to 4 February 1911, under the leadership of Nikolla bey Ivanaj and Sokol Baci Ivezaj, it was decided to organize an Albanian uprising. Terenzio Tocci gathered the Mirdit√´ chieftains on 26/27 April 1911 in Orosh, proclaimed the independence of Albania, raised the flag of Albania (according to Robert Elsie it was raised for the first time after Skanderbeg's death) and established the provisional government. Shefqet Turgut Pasha wanted to meet this threat and returned to the region with 8.000 soldiers. As soon as he reached Shkod√´r on 11 May, he issued a general proclamation which declared martial law and offered an amnesty for all rebels (except for Mal√´sor chieftains) if they immediately return to their homes. After Ottoman troops entered the area Tocci fled the empire abandoning his activities. After months of intense fighting, the rebels were trapped and decided to escape to Montenegro. On 23 June 1911, in the village of Gerƒçe, in Montenegro, an assembly of the tribal leaders of the revolt was held to adopt the \\"Gre√ß√´ Memorandum\\". This memorandum was signed by 22 Albanian chieftains, four from each tribe of Hoti, Grud√´ and Skrel, five from Kastrati, three from Klemendi and two from Shal√´. Sokol Baci Ivezaj ‚Äî one of the leaders of the 1911 revolt Requests of the memorandum included: # general amnesty for all participants in the revolt # demand for recognition of the Albanian ethnicity # election of the deputies of Albanian ethnicity for the Ottoman Parliament according to the proportional system # Albanian language in schools # governor and other appointed high officials have to know Albanian language and all other positions in the administration have to be reserved only for people of Albanian ethnicity # men who are ethnic Albanians to serve army only in Albania during the peacetime # confiscated arms to be returned # all Albanian property damaged by Ottoman troops to be compensated The Memorandum was submitted to the representatives of Great Powers in Cetinje, Montenegro. Ottoman representatives managed to deal with the leaders of Albanian rebels in Kosovo Vilayet and Scutari Vilayet separately, because they were not united and lacked central control. The Ottomans promised to meet most Albanian demands, limited mainly to Catholic highlanders like general amnesty, the opening of Albanian language schools, and the restriction that military service was to be performed only in the territory of the vilayets with substantial Albanian population. Other demands included requiring administrative officers to learn the Albanian language, and that the possession of weapons would be permitted. = Revolts of 1912 = Skopje after being captured by Albanian revolutionaries in August, 1912 who defeated the Ottoman forces holding the city. The Albanian Revolt of 1912 was one of many Albanian revolts in the Ottoman Empire and lasted from January until August 1912. Albanian soldiers and officers deserted the Ottoman military service and joined the insurgents. After a series of successes, Albanian revolutionaries managed to capture the city of Skopje, the administrative centre of Kosovo vilayet within the Ottoman rule. On August 9, 1912, Albanian rebels presented a new list of demands (the so-called list of Fourteen Points), related to the Albanian vilayet, that can be summarized as follows: * autonomous system of administration and justice of four vilayets populated with Albanians (Albanian vilayet) * Albanians to perform military service only in territory of four vilayets populated with Albanians, except in time of war * employing officials who know local language and customs, but not necessarily Albanians, * establishment of new licees and agricultural schools in the bigger districts * reorganization and modernization of the religious schools and use of Albanian language in secular schools * freedom to establish private schools and societies * the development of trade, agriculture and public works * general amnesty for all Albanians involved in revolt * court martial for those Ottoman officers who attempted to suppress the revolt The revolt ended when the Ottoman government agreed to fulfill the rebels' demands, except of the last one, on September 4, 1912. The autonomous system of administration and justice of the four vilayets with a substantial Albanian population was accepted by the Ottoman Empire, however they avoided granting autonomy to a unitary Albanian vilayet which was part of the Albanian National Awakening agenda during the League of Prizren. = Independence = Members of the Assembly of Vlor√´ photographed in November 1912. The First Balkan War, however, erupted before a final settlement could be worked out. The Balkan allies‚ÄîSerbia, Bulgaria, Montenegro and Greece‚Äîquickly drove the Ottomans to the walls of Constantinople. The Montenegrins surrounded Scutari. An assembly of Muslim and Christian leaders meeting in Vlor√´ in November 1912 declared Albania an independent country. The complete text of the declaration was: > In Vlora, on the 15th/28th of November. That time the President was Ismail > Kemal Bey, in which he spoke of the great perils facing Albania today, the > delegates have all decided unanimously that Albania, as of today, should be > on her own, free and independent. A second session of the Assembly of Vlor√´ was held on December 4, 1912. During that session members of the assembly established the Provisional Government of Albania. It was a government that consisted of ten members, led by Ismail Qemali until his resignation on 22 January 1914. The Assembly established the Senate () with an advisory role to the government, consisting of 18 members of the Assembly. An ambassadorial conference that opened in London in December decided the major questions concerning the Albanians after the First Balkan War in its concluding Treaty of London of May 1913. The Albanian delegation in London was assisted by Aubrey Herbert, MP, a passionate advocate of their cause. Ismail Qemali and his cabinet during the celebration of the first anniversary of independence in Vlor√´ on 28 November 1913.The recognized borders of Albania. One of Serbia's primary war aims was to gain an Adriatic port, preferably Durr√´s. Austria-Hungary and Italy opposed giving Serbia an outlet to the Adriatic, which they feared would become a Russian port. They instead supported the creation of an autonomous Albania. Russia backed Serbia's and Montenegro's claims to Albanian-inhabited lands. Britain and Germany remained neutral. Chaired by Britain's foreign secretary, Sir Edward Grey, the ambassadors' conference initially decided to create an autonomous Albania under continued Ottoman rule, but with the protection of the Great Powers. This solution, as detailed in the Treaty of London, was abandoned in the summer of 1913 when it became obvious that the Ottoman Empire would, in the Second Balkan War, lose Macedonia and hence its overland connection with the Albanian-inhabited lands.History of the Balkans: Twentieth century Volume 2 of History of the Balkans, Barbara Jelavich History of the Balkans: Twentieth Century, Barbara Jelavich Volume 12 of Publication series, Joint Committee on Eastern Europe Cambridge paperback library Author Barbara Jelavich Edition illustrated, reprint Publisher Cambridge University Press, 1983 , Length 476 pages page 87 link In July 1913, the Great Powers opted to recognize an independent, neutral Albanian state ruled by a constitutional monarchy and under the protection of the Great Powers. The August 1913 Treaty of Bucharest established that independent Albania was a country with borders that gave the new state about 28,000 square kilometers of territory and a population of 800,000. Montenegro had to surrender Scutari after having lost 10,000 men in the process of taking the town. Serbia reluctantly succumbed to an ultimatum from Austria-Hungary, Germany, and Italy to withdraw from northern Albania. The treaty, however, left large areas with majority Albanian populations, notably Kosovo and western Macedonia, outside the new state and failed to solve the region's nationality problems.  Culture  = Arts = Motra Tone by Kol√´ Idromeno. The Albanian Renaissance is one of the most valuable periods in Albanian culture, a period characterised by a cultural, economic, political and social flourishing of Albanian consciousness within the Ottoman Empire. The period is directly connected with Jorgji Panariti and Kol√´ Idromeno, the most renowned representatives of the Albanian Renaissance. = Literature = Albanezul, the newspaper of the Albanian minority in Romania from 1889.Naum Veqilharxhi's Vithkuqi script was the first Albanian alphabet published in 1845. Albanian intellectuals in the nineteenth century began devising a single, standard Albanian literary language and making demands that it be used in schools. In Constantinople in 1879, Sami Frash√´ri founded a cultural and educational organization, the Society for the Printing of Albanian Writings, whose membership comprised Muslim, Catholic, and Orthodox Albanians. Naim Frash√´ri, the most-renowned Albanian poet, joined the society and wrote and edited textbooks. Albanian √©migr√©s in Bulgaria, Egypt, Italy, Romania, and the United States supported the society's work. The Greeks, who dominated the education of Orthodox Albanians, joined the Turks in suppressing the Albanians' culture, especially Albanian-language education. In 1886 the ecumenical patriarch of Constantinople threatened to excommunicate anyone found reading or writing Albanian, and priests taught that God would not understand prayers uttered in Albanian. In 1844-5 however, Albanian intellectual Naum Veqilharxhi published his work Ev√´tori Shqip Fort i Shkurt√´r (English: The short Albanian Ev√´tor) which was an alphabet that included thirty three letters which were invented by himself. He avoided the use of Latin, Greek or Arabic alphabets and characters because of their religious associations and divisions. In November 1869, a Commission for the Alphabet of the Albanian Language was gathered in Istanbul. Manastir Congress in a rare photo (1908).right One of its members was Kostandin Kristoforidhi and the main purpose of the Commission was the creation of a unique alphabet for all the Albanians. In January 1870 the Commission ended its work of the standardization of the alphabet, which was mainly in Latin letters. A plan on the creation of textbooks and spread of Albanian schools was drafted. However this plan was not realized, because the Ottoman Government wouldn't finance the expenses for the establishment of such schools. Although this commission had gathered and delivered an alphabet in 1870, the writers from the North still used the Latin-based alphabet, whereas in Southern Albania writers used mostly the Greek letters. The turning point was the aftermath of the League of Prizren (1878) events when in 1879 Sami Frash√´ri and Naim Frash√´ri formed the Society for the Publication of Albanian Writings. Members of the society Sami Frash√´ri, Naim Frash√´ri and Jani Vreto published the Primer of the Albanian language and other works in Albanian that dealt with the humanities, natural sciences and so on. \\"Among the first published was the Primer of the Albanian language. Within a few years, grammar, geography, history readers, natural sciences, agriculture, and other books authored by Sami and Naim Frash√´ri, and by Jani Vreto were published by the Society.\\" After a long time struggling with obstacles coming from the Ottoman authorities, the first secular school of Albanian language was opened on the initiative of individual teachers and other intellectuals on 7 March 1887 in Korce. Diamanti T√´rpo, a citizen of the city, offered her house to serve as a school building. The first director and teacher of the school was Pandeli Sotiri. One year earlier, the Albanian dictionary (Fjalori i Gjuh√´s Shqipe) by Kostandin Kristoforidhi had been published in 1904. The dictionary had been drafted 25 years before its publication and was written in the Greek alphabet. In 1908, the Congress of Monastir was held by Albanian intellectuals in Bitola (in modern-day North Macedonia). The Congress was hosted by the Bashkimi (unity) club, and prominent delegates included Gjergj Fishta, Ndre Mjeda, Mit'hat Frash√´ri, Sotir Pe√ßi, Shahin Kolonja, and Gjergj D. Qiriazi. There was much debate and the contending alphabets were Istanbul, Bashkimi and Agimi. However, the Congress was unable to make a clear decision and opted for a compromise solution of using both the widely used Istanbul, with minor changes, and a modified version of the Bashkimi alphabet. Usage of the alphabet of Istanbul declined rapidly and it was essentially extinct over the following decades. The Bashkimi alphabet is at the origin of the official alphabet of the Albanian language in use today. A major role during the Albanian National Awakening was played by literature, which served to many Rilindas as a way to express their ideas. It was imbued with the spirit of national liberation, with the nostalgia of the √©migr√© and the rhetorical pathos of past heroic wars. This literary school developed the poetry most. Regarding the motifs and poetical forms, its hero was the ethical man, the fighting Albanian, and to a lesser degree the tragic man. Because its major purpose was to awaken national consciousness it was closely linked with the folklore tradition.

According to the contemporary historian Polybius, it was the people (and thus the assemblies) who had the final say regarding the election of magistrates, the enactment of Roman laws, the carrying out of capital punishment, the declaration of war and peace, and the creation (or dissolution) of alliances. Under the Constitution of the Roman Republic, the people (and thus the assemblies) held the ultimate source of sovereignty. Since the Romans used a form of direct democracy, citizens, and not elected representatives, voted before each assembly. As such, the citizen- electors had no power, other than to cast a vote. Each assembly was presided over by a single Roman Magistrate, and as such, it was the presiding magistrate who made all decisions on matters of procedure and legality. Ultimately, the presiding magistrate's power over the assembly was nearly absolute. The only check on that power came in the form of vetoes handed down by other magistrates. In the Roman system of direct democracy, two primary types of gatherings were used to vote on legislative, electoral, and judicial matters. The first was the Assembly (comitia), which was a gathering that was deemed to represent the entire Roman people, even if it did not contain all of the Roman citizens or, like the comitia curiata, excluded a particular class of Roman citizens (the plebs). The second was the Council (concilium), which was a gathering of citizens of a specific class. In contrast, the Convention was an unofficial forum for communication. Conventions were simply forums where Romans met for specific unofficial purposes, such as, for example, to hear a political speech. Voters always assembled first into Conventions to hear debates and conduct other business before voting, and then into Assemblies or Councils to actually vote.  Assembly procedure  Growth of the city region during the kingdom There were no set dates to hold assemblies, but notice had to be given beforehand if the assembly was to be considered formal. Elections had to be announced 17 days before the election took place. Likewise, 17 days had to pass between the proposal of legislation and its enactment by an assembly.Lintott, 44 In addition to the presiding magistrate, several additional magistrates were often present to act as assistants.Taylor, 63 There were also religious officials known as augurs either in attendance or on-call, who would be available to help interpret any signs from the gods (omens). On several known occasions, presiding magistrates used the claim of unfavorable omens as an excuse to suspend a session that was not going the way they wanted.Taylor, 96 Any decision made by a presiding magistrate could be vetoed by a magistrate known as a Plebeian Tribune. In addition, decisions made by presiding magistrates could also be vetoed by higher-ranking magistrates. On the day of the vote, the electors first assembled into their conventions for debate and campaigning.Taylor, 2 In the Conventions, the electors were not sorted into their respective units (curia, centuries or tribes). Speeches from private citizens were only heard if the issue to be voted upon was a legislative or judicial matter.Lintott, 45 If the purpose of the ultimate vote was for an election, no speeches from private citizens were heard, and instead, the candidates for office used the Convention to campaign.Taylor, 16 During the Convention, the bill to be voted upon was read to the assembly by an officer known as a \\"Herald\\". Then, if the assembly was composed of Tribes, the order of the vote had to be determined. A Plebeian Tribune could use his veto against pending legislation until the point when the order of the vote was determined.Lintott, 46 The electors were then told to break up the Convention and assemble into the formal Assembly or Council. The electors voted by placing a pebble or written ballot into an appropriate jar.Lintott, 46‚Äì47 The baskets that held the votes were watched by specific officers, who then counted the ballots, and reported the results to the presiding magistrate. The majority of votes in any Curia, Tribe, or Century decided how that Curia, Tribe, or Century voted. Each Curia, Tribe, or Century received one vote, regardless of how many electors each Tribe or Century held. Once a majority of Curiae, Tribes, or Centuries voted in the same way on a given measure, the voting ended, and the matter was decided.Taylor, 40 If a law was passed in violation of proper procedures (such as failing to wait 17 days before voting on a law), the Senate could declare the law nonbinding.Lintott, 62 Assembly of the Curiae The Curiate Assembly (comitia curiata) was the principal assembly during the first two decades of the Roman Republic. The Curiate Assembly was organized as an Assembly, and not as a Council even though only patricians were members. During these first decades, the People of Rome were organized into thirty units called Curiae.Byrd, 33Taylor, 3‚Äì4 The Curiae were ethnic in nature, and thus were organized on the basis of the early Roman family, or, more specifically, on the basis of the thirty original Patrician (aristocratic) clans.Abbott, 250 The Curiae assembled into the Curiate Assembly, for legislative, electoral, and judicial purposes. The Curiate Assembly passed laws, elected Consuls (the only elected magistrates at the time),Abbott, 253 and tried judicial cases. Consuls always presided over the assembly.Holland, 5 Shortly after the founding of the republic, most of the powers of the Curiate Assembly were transferred to the Centuriate Assembly and the Tribal Assembly. While it then fell into disuse, it did retain some theoretical powers, most importantly, the power to ratify elections of the top-ranking Roman Magistrates (Consuls and Praetors) by passing the statute that gave them their legal command authority, the lex curiata de imperio. In practice, however, they actually received this authority from the Centuriate Assembly (which formally elected them), and as such, this functioned as nothing more than a reminder of Rome's regal heritage. Other acts that the Curiate Assembly voted on were mostly symbolic and usually in the affirmative. At one point, possibly as early as 218 BC, the Curiate Assembly's thirty Curia were abolished, and replaced with thirty lictors, one from each of the original Patrician clans. Since the Curia had always been organized on the basis of the Roman family, the Curiate Assembly actually retained jurisdiction over clan matters even after the fall of the Roman Republic in 27 BC. Under the presidency of the Pontifex Maximus, it witnessed wills and ratified adoptions, inaugurated certain priests, and transferred citizens from Patrician class to Plebeian class (or vice versa). In 44 BC, for example, it ratified the will of Julius Caesar, and with it Caesar's adoption of his nephew Gaius Octavian (the future Roman emperor Augustus) as his son and heir. However, this might not have been the comitia curiata but instead the comitia calata. Assembly of the Centuries Roman Dictator Sulla, who attempted to increase the power of the Centuriate Assembly at the expense of the Tribal Assembly The Centuriate Assembly (comitia centuriata or \\"Army Assembly\\") of the Roman Republic was originally the democratic assembly of the Roman soldiers. The Centuriate Assembly organized the Roman citizens into classes, which were defined by a means test and were economic in nature.McCullough, 943 The Roman army was divided into units called \\"Centuries\\", and these gathered into the Centuriate Assembly for legislative, electoral, and judicial purposes. However, since the number of centuries in each class was fixed, centuries could contain far more than 100 men. Only this assembly could declare war or elect the highest-ranking Roman Magistrates: Consuls, Praetors and Censors.Abbott, 257 The Centuriate Assembly could also pass a statute that granted constitutional command authority to Consuls and Praetors, and Censorial powers to Censors. In addition, the Centuriate Assembly served as the highest court of appeal in certain judicial cases, and ratified the results of the Census. While the voters in this assembly wore white undecorated togas and were unarmed, while taking part in the Assembly they were classified as soldiers, and as such they could not meet inside of the physical boundary of the city of Rome. The president of the Centuriate Assembly was usually a Consul (although sometimes a Praetor). Only Consuls (the highest-ranking of all Roman Magistrates) could preside over the Centuriate Assembly during elections because the higher-ranking Consuls were always elected together with the lower-ranking Praetors. Once every five years, after the new Consuls for the year took office, they presided over the Centuriate Assembly as it elected the two Censors. The Centuriate Assembly was supposedly founded by the legendary Roman King Servius Tullius, less than a century before the founding of the Roman Republic in 509 BC. As such, the original design of the Centuriate Assembly was known as the \\"Servian organization\\". Under this organization, the assembly was supposedly designed to mirror the Roman army during the time of the Roman Kingdom. Soldiers in the Roman army were classified on the basis of the amount of property that they owned, and as such, soldiers with more property had more influence than soldiers with less property. The 193 Centuries in the assembly under the Servian Organization were each divided into one of three different grades: the officer class, the enlisted class, and a class of unarmed adjuncts.Taylor, 85 The officer class was grouped into eighteen Centuries. The enlisted class was grouped into five separate property classes, for a total of 170 Centuries.Taylor, 87 The unarmed soldiers were divided into the final five Centuries.Abbott, 21 Of five enlisted classes, the wealthiest controlled 80 of the votes.E. S. Staveley. Greek and Roman Voting and Elections. Cornell University Press, 1972, p. 126. During a vote, all of the Centuries of one class had to vote before the Centuries of the next lower class could vote.Taylor, 86 The first candidate to reach a majority of 97 votes was victorious. When a measure or candidate received 97 votes, a majority of the centuries, the voting ended, and as such, many lower ranking Centuries rarely if ever had a chance to actually vote. Combined the 18 equites and the 80 centuries of the first property class had one more century than needed, and a unanimous vote from the elite would thus elect a candidate.Rachel Feig Vishnia. Roman Elections in the Age of Cicero: Society, Government, and Voting. Routledge, Mar 12, 2012, p. 113. Chart Showing the Checks and Balances of the Constitution of the Roman Republic In 241 BC, the assembly was reorganized, though the exact details are uncertain. Some sources have a new total of 373 Centuries,Abbott, 75 but Cicero still writes of 193 centuries in his era, and most scholars still use that numberE. S. Staveley. Greek and Roman Voting and Elections. Cornell University Press, 1972, p. 127. It known that the first property class was reduced form 80 to 70 centuries, and the order of voting was changed so that the first class would go first, and be followed by the equites.Rachel Feig Vishnia. Roman Elections in the Age of Cicero: Society, Government, and Voting. Routledge, Mar 12, 2012, p. 123. The lowest ranking Century in the Centuriate Assembly was the fifth Century (called the proletarii) of the unarmed adjunct class. This Century was the only Century composed of soldiers who had no property, and since it was always the last Century to vote, it never had any real influence on elections. In 107 BC, in response to high unemployment and a severe manpower shortage in the army, the general and Consul Gaius Marius reformed the organization of the army, and allowed individuals with no property to enlist. As a consequence of these reforms, this fifth unarmed Century came to encompass almost the entire Roman army. This mass disenfranchisement of most of the soldiers in the army played an important role in the chaos that led to the fall of the Roman Republic in 27 BC. During his dictatorship from 82 BC until 80 BC, Lucius Cornelius Sulla restored the old Servian Organization to this assembly. Sulla died in 78 BC, and in 70 BC, the Consuls Pompey Magnus and Marcus Licinius Crassus repealed Sulla's constitutional reforms, including his restoration of the Servian Organization to this assembly. Thus, they restored the newer organization that had originated in 241 BC. The organization of the Centuriate Assembly was not changed again until its powers were all transferred to the Roman Senate by the first Roman Emperor, Augustus, after the fall of the Roman Republic in 27 BC.Abbott, 107 Assembly of the Tribes The Tribal Assembly (comitia populi tributa) of the Roman Republic was the democratic assembly of Roman citizens. The Tribal Assembly was organized as an Assembly, and not as a Council. During the years of the Roman Republic, citizens were organized on the basis of thirty-five Tribes which included patricians and plebeians. The Tribes gathered into the Tribal Assembly for legislative, electoral, and judicial purposes. The president of the Tribal Assembly was usually either a Consul (the highest ranking Roman Magistrate) or a Praetor (the second-highest ranking Roman Magistrate). The Tribal Assembly elected three different magistrates: Quaestors, Curule Aediles, and Military Tribunes.Taylor, 7 The Tribal Assembly also had the power to try judicial cases.Abbott, 261 The thirty-five Tribes were not ethnic or kinship groups, but rather a generic division into which Roman citizens were distributed. When the Tribes were created the divisions were geographical, similar to modern Parliamentary constituencies. However, since one joined the same Tribe that one's father belonged to, the geographical distinctions were eventually lost.Lintott, 51 The order that the 35 Tribes voted in was selected randomly by lot. The order was not chosen at once, and after each Tribe had voted, a lot was used to determine which Tribe should vote next.Taylor, 77 The first Tribe selected was usually the most important Tribe, because it often decided the matter. It was believed that the order of the lot was chosen by the Gods, and thus, that the position held by the early voting Tribes was the position of the Gods.Taylor, 76 Once a majority of Tribes had voted the same way, voting ended. Plebeian Council The Plebeian Council (concilium plebis) was the principal popular gathering of the Roman Republic. As the name suggests, the Plebeian Council was organized as a Council, and not as an Assembly. It functioned as a gathering through which the Plebeians (commoners) could pass laws, elect magistrates, and try judicial cases. This council had no political power until the offices of Plebeian Tribune and Plebeian Aedile were created in 494 BC, due to the Plebeian Secession that year. According to legend, the Roman King Servius Tullius enacted a series of constitutional reforms in the 6th century BC. One of these reforms resulted in the creation of a new organizational unit with which to divide citizens. This unit, the Tribe, was based on geography rather than family, and was created to assist in future reorganizations of the army. In 471 BC,Abbott, 196 a law was passed which allowed the Plebeians to begin organizing by Tribe. Before this point, they had organized on the basis of the Curia. The only difference between the Plebeian Council after 471 BC and the ordinary Tribal Assembly (which also organized on the basis of the Tribes) was that the Tribes of the Plebeian Council only included Plebeians, whereas the Tribes of the Tribal Assembly included both Plebeians and Patricians. The Plebeian Council elected two 'Plebeian Magistrates', the Plebeian Tribunes and the Plebeian Aediles. Usually the Plebeian Tribune presided over the assembly, although the Plebeian Aedile sometimes did as well. Originally, statutes passed by the Plebeian Council (\\"Plebiscites\\") only applied to Plebeians.Byrd, 31 However, in 449 BC, a statute of an Assembly was passed which gave Plebiscites the full force of law over all Romans (Plebeians and Patricians).Abbott, 51 It was not until 287 BC, however, that the last mechanism which allowed the Roman Senate to veto acts of the Plebeian Council was revoked. After this point, almost all domestic legislation came out of the Plebeian Council.

Players form a line or circle, and the first player comes up with a message and whispers it to the ear of the second person in the line. The second player repeats the message to the third player, and so on. When the last player is reached, they announce the message they heard to the entire group. The first person then compares the original message with the final version. Although the objective is to pass around the message without it becoming garbled along the way, part of the enjoyment is that, regardless, this usually ends up happening. Errors typically accumulate in the retellings, so the statement announced by the last player differs significantly from that of the first player, usually with amusing or humorous effect. Reasons for changes include anxiousness or impatience, erroneous corrections, and the difficult-to-understand mechanism of whispering. The game is often played by children as a party game or on the playground. It is often invoked as a metaphor for cumulative error, especially the inaccuracies as rumours or gossip spread, or, more generally, for the unreliability of human recollection or even oral traditions. Etymology As the game is popular among children worldwide, it is also known under various other names depending on locality, such as Russian scandal,Gryski, Camilla (1998). Let's Play: Traditional Games of Childhood, p.36. Kids Can. . whisper down the lane, broken telephone (in Greece), operator, grapevine, gossip, secret message, the messenger game, and pass the message, among others. In Turkey, this game is called kulaktan kulaƒüa, which means from (one) ear to (another) ear. In France, it is called t√©l√©phone arabe (Arabic telephone) or t√©l√©phone sans fil (wireless telephone).T√©l√©phone arabe, Retrieved 25 July 2018 In Malaysia, this game is commonly referred to as telefon rosak, in Israel as telefon shavur (◊ò◊ú◊§◊ï◊ü ◊©◊ë◊ï◊®) and in Greece as spazmeno tilefono (œÉœÄŒ±œÉŒºŒ≠ŒΩŒø œÑŒ∑ŒªŒ≠œÜœâŒΩŒø) which all translate to \\"broken telephone\\". In Poland it is called g≈Çuchy telefon, which means deaf telephone. In the United States, the game is known under the name telephone ‚Äì which in this use is never shortened to the colloquial and more common word phone. The name \\"Chinese whispers\\" stems from an unfounded idea in the 1800s that Chinese people spoke in a way that was deliberately unintelligible, associating the Chinese language with confusion and incomprehensibility. Now, the game is more commonly referred to as \\"the telephone game\\" or simply \\"telephone\\" in the United States. Historians trace Westerners' use of the word Chinese to denote \\"confusion\\" and \\"incomprehensibility\\" to the earliest contacts between Europeans and Chinese people in the 17th century, and attribute it to Europeans' inability to understand China's culture and worldview. Using the phrase \\"Chinese whispers\\" suggested a belief that the Chinese language itself is not understandable. Additionally, Chinese people have historically been stereotyped by Westerners as secretive or inscrutable. The more fundamental metonymic use of the name of a foreign language to represent a broader class of situations involving foreign languages or difficulty of understanding a language is also captured in older idioms, such as \\"It's all Greek to me\\". Game The game has no winner: the entertainment comes from comparing the original and final messages. Intermediate messages may also be compared; some messages will become unrecognizable after only a few steps. As well as providing amusement, the game can have educational value. It shows how easily information can become corrupted by indirect communication. The game has been used in schools to simulate the spread of gossip and its supposed harmful effects. It can also be used to teach young children to moderate the volume of their voice, and how to listen attentively; in this case, a game is a success if the message is transmitted accurately with each child whispering rather than shouting. It can also be used for older or adult learners of a foreign language, where the challenge of speaking comprehensibly, and understanding, is more difficult because of the low volume, and hence a greater mastery of the fine points of pronunciation is required.For example, see Hill, op. cit.; or Variants A variant of Chinese whispers is called Rumors. In this version of the game, when players transfer the message, they deliberately change one or two words of the phrase (often to something more humorous than the previous message). Intermediate messages can be compared. What an individual player changes in the message often says something about the player. There is a second derivative variant, no less popular than Rumors, known as Mahjong Secrets (UK), or, more commonly, Broken Telephone (US), where the objective is to receive the message from the whisperer and whisper to the next participant the first word or phrase that comes to mind in association with what was heard. At the end, the final phrase is compared to the first in front of all participants. A game of Eat Poop You Cat, starting with \\"Only the good die young\\" and ending with \\"The three vikings visit Christ\\". The pen-and-paper game Telephone Pictionary (also known as Eat Poop You Cat) is played by alternately writing and illustrating captions, the paper being folded so that each player can only see the previous participant's contribution. The game was first implemented online by Broken Picture Telephone in early 2007. Following the success of Broken Picture Telephone, commercial boardgame versions Telestrations and Cranium Scribblish were released two years later in 2009. Other online creations Drawception and other websites also arrived in 2009. A translation relay is a variant in which the first player produces a text in a given language, together with a basic guide to understanding, which includes a lexicon, an interlinear gloss, possibly a list of grammatical morphemes, comments on the meaning of difficult words, etc. (everything except an actual translation). The text is passed on to the following player, who tries to make sense of it and casts it into his/her language of choice, then repeating the procedure, and so on. Each player only knows the translation done by his immediate predecessor, but customarily the relay master or mistress collects all of them.

The Ottomans first entered Albania in 1385 at the invitation of the Albanian Noble Karl Thopia to suppress the forces of the other Albanian noble Balsha II at the Battle of Savra. The Sanjak of Albania was established in 1420 controlling mostly Central Albania, while Ottoman rule became more consolidated in 1479, after the fall of Shkodra. The Albanians revolted again in 1481 but the Ottomans finally controlled Albania by 1488. The Ottomans had previously ruled some Albanian regions after the Battle of Savra in 1385. The Ottomans placed garrisons throughout southern Albania by 1418 and established formal jurisdiction in central Albania by 1431. Even though The Ottomans claimed rule of all Albanian lands, most Albanian ethnic territories were still governed by Albanian Princes who were free of Ottoman rule. In 1431 Many Albanian Princes including Gjergj Arianiti, Zenevisi family and Gjon Kastrioti started a war against the Ottoman Empire which resulted in defeat of Gjon Kastrioti but victory in 5 battles for Gjergj Arianiti ( Gjergj Atianiti being the first European prince to defeat Ottomans in 5 battles). These Albanian victories opened the way for the coming of Skanderbeg in 1443 in Kruja. Independence for most of the Albanian regions was maintained during 1443‚Äì1479, with the uprising under the lead of Skanderbeg.https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world- factbook/geos/al.html The Albanian resistance and war against Ottomans continued for 37 years. The last towns captured by the Ottomans were Shkod√´r in 1479 and Durr√´s in 1501. A period of the semi-independence started in the 1750s with the Independent Albanian Pashas. In 1754 the autonomous Albanian Pashalik of Bushati family would be established with center the city of Shkodra called Pashalik of Shkodra. Later on the same autonomous Pashalik of Berat would be established and culminating with the Albanian Pashalik of Ali Pashe Tepelena in 1787. Albanian Pashaliks would end in 1831 with the last one being the Bushati Pashalik. These half independent Albanian Pashaliks would extend from Bosnia up to Southern Greece. Albanians would enter later on in the 16th and 17th centuries a period of Islamization. The territory which today belongs to the Republic of Albania remained part of the Ottoman Empire until it declared independence in 1912, during the Balkan Wars. In 1909, New York newspaper The Sun published an article about the Ottoman Empire describing the subjects of the Ottoman Empire who were generally proud to call themselves Turks, but Muslim Albanians never accepted this and stated that they \\"belonged to a different race\\". Ottoman rule Sanjak of Albania in 1431. Elifbaja shqip - Albanian Arabic script alphabet The Ottomans expanded their control from Anatolia to the Balkans in the middle of the 14th century. They entered European territory in 1352, and they defeated a Serbian army in the Battle of Kosovo in 1389. Ottoman pressure lessened in 1402 when the Turco-Mongol leader Timur (Tamerlane) attacked Anatolia from the east, killed the Sultan, and sparked a civil war.Dimitris J. Kastritsis, The Sons of Bayezid: Empire building and Representation in the Ottoman Civil War of 1402‚Äì1413, (BRILL, 2007), 1‚Äì3. When order was restored, the Ottomans renewed their westward progress. In 1453, Sultan Mehmed II's forces overran Constantinople and killed the last Byzantine emperor. The division of the Albanian-populated lands into small, quarreling fiefdoms ruled by independent feudal lords and tribal chiefs made them easy prey for the Ottoman armies. In 1385, the Albanian ruler of Durr√´s, Karl Thopia, appealed to the sultan for support against his rivals, the Bal≈°iƒá noble family. An Ottoman force quickly marched into Albania along the Via Egnatia and routed Balsha II in the Battle of Savra. Some of the Albanian Principalities soon started to become vassals of the Ottoman Empire after 1420. Gjirokastra became the county town of the Sanjak of Albania in 1420. and than Kruja was established as the center of Sanjak of Albania after Gjergj Arianiti defeated the Ottomans between 1431‚Äì1435. The Ottomans allowed Albanian clan chiefs to maintain their positions, rule and property, but they had to pay tribute, and sometimes send their sons to the Ottoman court as hostages, and provide the Ottoman army with auxiliary troops. However many Albanian clans and Principalities did not recognize the Ottoman authority and did not pay tribute. The Albanians' resistance to the Ottomans in the 14th century and especially in the 15th century won them acclaim all over Europe. Gjon Kastrioti of Kruj√´ was one of the Albanian clan leaders who submitted to Ottoman suzerainty in 1425. He was compelled to send his four sons to the Ottoman capital to be trained for military service. The youngest, George Kastrioti (1403‚Äì68), who would become the Albanians' national hero, captured the sultan's attention. Renamed Iskander when he converted to Islam, the young man participated in military expeditions to Asia Minor and Europe. When appointed to administer a Balkan district, Iskander became known as Skanderbeg. After Ottoman forces under Skanderbeg's command suffered defeat in a battle near Ni≈° in present-day Serbia in 1443, Skanderbeg rushed to Kruj√´ and tricked a Turkish pasha into surrendering the Albanian fortress. Skanderbeg then embraced Roman Catholicism and declared a holy war against the Turks. K√∂pr√ºl√º Mehmed Pasha was the most powerful Ottoman Grand Vizier of Albanian origins. On 1 March 1444, Albanian chieftains gathered in the cathedral of Lezh√´ with the prince of Montenegro and delegates from Venice and proclaimed Skanderbeg commander of the Albanian resistance. All of Albania accepted his leadership against the Ottomans, but local leaders kept control of their own districts. Under a red flag bearing Skanderbeg's heraldic emblem, an Albanian force of about 10,000-15.000 men held off Ottoman campaigns against their lands for twenty-four years. Three times the Albanians overcame sieges of Kruj√´. In 1450, the Albanians routed Sultan Murad II himself. Later, they repulsed attacks led by Sultan Mehmed II in 1466 and 1467. In 1461, Skanderbeg went to the aid of his suzerain, King Alfonso I of Naples, against the kings of Sicily. The government under Skanderbeg was unstable, however, and at times local Albanian rulers cooperated with the Ottomans against him. With political and minor material support from the Kingdom of Naples and the Vatican, resistance to the Ottoman Empire continued for 35 years. Kruj√´ fell to the Ottomans only in 1478, ten years after the death of Skanderbeg; Shkod√´r succumbed in 1479 after a failed siege in 1474 and a stronger siege in 1478 that ended with Venice ceding Shkodra to the Ottomans. The Venetians then evacuated Durr√´s, in 1501. The conquests triggered a great Albanian exodus to Venice and Italy, especially to the kingdom of Naples, as well as to Sicily, Romania and Egypt. Most of the Albanian refugees belonged to the Orthodox Church. The Albanians of Italy significantly influenced the Albanian national movement in future centuries, and Albanian Franciscan priests, most of whom were descended from √©migr√©s to Italy, played a significant role in the preservation of Catholicism in Albania's northern regions. Skanderbeg's long struggle to keep Albania free became highly significant to the Albanian people, as it strengthened their solidarity, made them more conscious of their national identity, and served later as a great source of inspiration in their struggle for national unity, freedom, and independence.http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/12472/Albania/42646/The- decline-of-Byzantium The memory of the mid-15th century resistance under Skanderbeg continues to be important to Albanians, and his family's banner, bearing a black two-headed eagle on a red field, became the flag under which the Albanian national movement rallied centuries later. After the death of Skenderbeg and the fall of Kruj√´, the Ottoman Empire gained control of the ethnic Albanian territories and made many changes. The Albanian population gradually began to convert to Islam through the teachings of Bektashism, which offered considerable material advantages in Ottoman trade networks, bureaucracy and army. Many Albanians were recruited into the Janissary and Dev≈üirme and later on through becoming Muslims they opened their path for very successful military and political carriers. For example, 42 Grand Viziers were of Albanian origin. The most prominent Albanians during Ottoman rule were: George Kastrioti Skanderbeg, Ballaban Badera, Koca Davud Pasha, Hamza Kastrioti, Iljaz Hoxha, Mimar Sinan, Nezim Frakulla, K√∂pr√ºl√º Mehmed Pasha, Ali Pasha, Edhem Pasha, Omer Vrioni, Patrona Halil, Haxhi Shehreti, Ali Pasha of Gucia, Ibrahim Pasha of Berat, K√∂pr√ºl√º Fazƒ±l Ahmed, Muhammad Ali of Egypt, Kara Mahmud Bushati, Kara Murad Pasha, Ahmet Kurt Pasha, Mustafa Bushati, Ibrahim Bushati, Sedefkar Mehmed Agha. Albanians also played a crucial role during the Ottoman‚ÄìVenetian War (1499‚Äì1503), Ottoman‚ÄìHungarian Wars and Ottoman‚ÄìHabsburg wars before gaining Independence. =18th century= Fethiye mosque just adjacent to Ali Pasha's grave. Ali Pasha of Tepelen√´ is one of the most famous Albanians in Ottoman history. The weakening of Ottoman central authority and the timar system brought anarchy to the Albanian-populated lands. In the late 18th century, two Albanian centers of power emerged: Shkod√´r, under the Bushati family; and Ioannina, under Ali Pasha of Tepelen√´. When it suited their goals, both places cooperated with the Sublime Porte, and when it was expedient to defy the central government, each acted independently. The Bushati family dominated the Shkod√´r region through a network of alliances with various highland tribes. Kara Mahmud Bushati attempted to establish an independent principality and expand the lands under his control by playing off Austria and Russia against the Sublime Porte. In 1785, Kara Mahmud's forces attacked Montenegrin territory, and Austria offered to recognize him as the ruler of all Albania if he would ally himself with Vienna against the Sublime Porte. Seizing an opportunity, Kara Mahmud sent the sultan the heads of an Austrian delegation in 1788, and the Ottomans appointed him governor of Shkod√´r. When he attempted to wrest land from Montenegro in 1796, however, he was defeated and beheaded. Kara Mahmud's brother, Ibrahim Bushati, cooperated with the Sublime Porte until his death in 1810, but his successor, Mustafa Pasha Bushati, proved to be recalcitrant despite participation in Ottoman military campaigns against Greek revolutionaries and rebel pashas. He cooperated with the mountain tribes and brought a large area under his control. Flag of the Bushatli dynasty (1796). South of the Shkumbini River, the mostly peasant Tosks lived in compact villages under elected rulers. Some Tosks living in settlements high in the mountains maintained their independence and often escaped payment of taxes. The Tosks of the lowlands, however, were easy for the Ottoman authorities to control. The Albanian tribal system disappeared there, and the Ottomans imposed a system of military fiefs under which the sultan granted soldiers and cavalrymen temporary landholdings, or timars, in exchange for military service. By the 18th century, many military fiefs had effectively become the hereditary landholdings of economically and politically powerful families who squeezed wealth from their hard-strapped Christian and Muslim tenant farmers. The beys, like the clan chiefs of the northern mountains, became virtually independent rulers in their own provinces, had their own military contingents, and often waged war against each other to increase their landholdings and power. The Sublime Porte attempted to press a divide-and-rule policy to keep the local beys from uniting and posing a threat to Ottoman rule itself, but with little success. =19th century= Janissary guns from the year 1826, during the Auspicious Incident. Ottoman-Albanian relations worsened in the year 1826 during the reign of Mahmud II, he had instigated the notorious Auspicious Incident and the turmoil that followed caused the violent dissolution of the Janissary, Dev≈üirme and the entire Balkan Muslim leadership in Rumelia causing a new wave of revolts and instability in the gradually weakening Ottoman Empire. After crushing the Bushatis and Ali Pasha, the Sublime Porte introduced a series of reforms, known as the tanzimat, which were aimed at strengthening the empire by reining in fractious pashas. The timars officially became large individual landholdings, especially in the lowlands. In 1835, the Sublime Porte divided the Albanian-populated lands into the vilayets of Janina and Rumelia and dispatched officials from Constantinople to administer them. This provoked a series of revolts in 1843‚Äì1844, but they were suppressed by the Ottoman army. After 1865, the central authorities redivided the Albanian lands between the vilayets of Scutari, Janina, and Monastir. The reforms angered the highland Albanian chieftains, who found their privileges reduced with no apparent compensation, and the authorities eventually abandoned efforts to control them. Ottoman troops crushed local rebellions in the lowlands, however, and conditions there remained bleak. The religious division of the northern Albanian tribes brought them into opposition. The Muslim northern Albanian tribes participated in the Ottoman campaigns against Christian Albanian tribes, such as in 1876 when they devastated the territory populated by the Mirdit√´ Catholics. Large numbers of Tosks emigrated to join sizable Albanian √©migr√© communities in Romania, Egypt, Bulgaria, Constantinople, southern Italy, and later the United States. Against the Young Turks Kosovo, Scutari, Monastir and Janina), proposed to form the Albanian Vilayet. Flag used during the Albanian National Awakening and by early 20th century Albanian rebels In 1906 opposition groups in the Ottoman Empire emerged, one of which evolved into the Committee of Union and Progress, more commonly known as the Young Turks, which proposed restoring constitutional government in Constantinople, by revolution if necessary. In July 1908, a month after a Young Turk rebellion in Macedonia supported by an Albanian uprising in Kosovo and Vardar Macedonia escalated into widespread insurrection and mutiny within the imperial army, Sultan Abd√ºl Hamid II agreed to demands by the Young Turks to restore constitutional rule. Many Albanians participated in the Young Turks uprising, hoping that it would gain their people autonomy within the empire. The Young Turks lifted the Ottoman ban on Albanian-language schools and on writing the Albanian language. As a consequence, Albanian intellectuals meeting in Manastir (present day town of Bitola) in 1908 chose the Latin alphabet as a standard script. The Young Turks, however, were set on maintaining the empire and not interested in making concessions to the myriad nationalist groups within its borders. After securing the abdication of Abd√ºl Hamid II in April 1909, the new authorities levied taxes, outlawed guerrilla groups and nationalist societies, and attempted to extend Constantinople's control over the northern Albanian mountain men. In addition, the Young Turks legalized the bastinado, or beating with a stick, even for misdemeanors, banned carrying rifles, and denied the existence of an Albanian nationality. The new government also appealed for Islamic solidarity to break the Albanians' unity and used the Muslim clergy to try to impose the Arabic alphabet. The Albanians refused to submit to the Young Turks' campaign to \\"Ottomanize\\" them by force. New Albanian uprisings began in Kosovo and the northern mountains in early April 1910. Ottoman forces quashed these rebellions after three months, outlawed Albanian organizations, disarmed entire regions, and closed down schools and publications. Montenegro, preparing to grab Albanian-populated lands for itself, supported a 1911 uprising by the mountain tribes against the Young Turks regime that grew into a widespread revolt. Unable to control the Albanians by force, the Ottoman government granted concessions on schools, military recruitment, and taxation and sanctioned the use of the Latin script for the Albanian language. The government refused, however, to unite the four Albanian-inhabited vilayets into one, Albanian vilayet. Governing structure Administratively, the Ottomans divided the Albanian-inhabited lands among a number of districts, or vilayets. The Ottoman authorities did not initially stress conversion to Islam. By 1479, the entire country, except for Durr√´s, Ulcinj and Bar, was under Ottoman suzerainty. Prominent viziers and pashas hailed from Albania, and were appointed to their posts long before the majority of Albanians professed Islam. =Administrative= Albanian mercenaries in the Ottoman Army in the year 1857. : For details of : State Organization The Ottoman sultan considered himself God's agent on Earth, the leader of a religious‚Äînot a national‚Äîstate whose purpose was to defend and propagate Islam. Non-Muslims paid extra taxes and held an inferior status, but they could retain their old religion and a large measure of local autonomy. By converting to Islam, individuals among the conquered could elevate themselves to the privileged stratum of society. In the early years of the empire, all Ottoman high officials were the sultan's bondsmen the children of Christian subjects chosen in childhood for their promise, converted to Islam, and educated to serve. Some were selected from prisoners of war, others sent as gifts, and still others obtained through devshirme, the tribute of children levied in the Ottoman Empire's Balkan lands. Many of the best fighters in the sultan's elite guard, the janissaries, were conscripted as young boys from Christian Albanian families, and high-ranking Ottoman officials often had Albanian bodyguards. =Taxation= According to historian Zija Shkodra, Albania was developed as much as the rest of the Balkans . In the mountains north of the Shkumbini River, Geg herders maintained their self-governing society base on clans. An association of clans was called a bajrak. Taxes on the northern tribes were difficult if not impossible for the Ottomans to collect because of the rough terrain and fierceness of the Albanian highlanders. Some mountain tribes succeeded in defending their independence through the centuries of Ottoman rule, engaging in intermittent guerrilla warfare with the Ottomans, who never deemed it worthwhile to subjugate them. Until recent times, Geg clan chiefs, or bajraktars, exercised patriarchal powers, arranged marriages, mediated quarrels, and meted out punishments. The tribesmen of the northern Albanian mountains recognized no law but the Code of Lek√´ Dukagjini (Kanuni i Lek√´ Dukagjinit), a collection of tribal laws transcribed in the 14th century by a Roman Catholic priest. The code regulates a variety of subjects, including blood vengeance. Even today, many Albanian highlanders regard the canon as the supreme law of the land. =Religion= The Albanian, Abdurrahman Abdi Arnavut was one of the most important Ottoman commanders during the War of the Holy League. Five centuries of Ottoman rule grouped the Albanian people along religious, regional, and tribal lines. In the early 17th century, however, Albanians converted to Islam in large numbers by force as a result of the Ottoman occupation. Within a century, the Muslim Albanian community was the largest religious community in the country, unfortunately losing their previous entirely Catholic religious identity. Albanians in this time were divided into two distinct tribal and dialectal groupings: the Gegs and Tosks (see Albanian language). In the rugged northern mountains, Geg shepherds lived in a tribal society often completely independent of Ottoman rule. In the south, Muslim and Orthodox Tosks worked the land for Muslim beys, provincial rulers who frequently revolted against the sultan's authority. In the early 17th century, many Albanian converts to Islam migrated elsewhere within the Ottoman Empire and found careers in the Ottoman military and government. Some attained powerful positions in the Ottoman administration, which severely disadvantaged the Catholic community since conversion to Islam came with numerous upper-class affiliations. About thirty Albanians rose to the position of grand vizier, chief deputy to the sultan himself. In the second half of the 17th century, the Albanian K√∂pr√ºl√º family provided four grand viziers, who fought against corruption, temporarily shored up eroding central government control over rapacious local beys, and won several military victories. As early as the 18th century, a mystic Islamic sect, the Bektashi dervishes, spread into the empire's Albanian-populated lands. Probably founded in the late 13th century in Anatolia, Bektashism became the janissaries' official faith in the late 16th century. The Bektashi sect contains features quite distinct from normative Islam and emphasizes man as a reflection of the Divine. Women, veiled, participate in Bektashi ceremonies and the celebrants use wine despite the ban on alcohol in most Islamic interpretations of the Sharia. The Bektashis became a fringe zealous religious group in southern Albania after the sultan disbanded the janissaries in 1826. Bektashi leaders played key roles in the Albanian nationalist movement of the late 19th century. In the 19th century, the Ottoman sultans tried in vain to shore up their collapsing empire by introducing a series of reforms aimed at reining in recalcitrant local officials and dousing the fires of nationalism among its myriad peoples. The power of nationalism, however, proved too strong to counteract. Nowadays, Albanians tend to not have strong affiliations to their varied religious identities as a result of about 50 years of Communist rule that banned the practice of religion. The irreparable changes to the religious landscape of the country have been made by the Ottoman occupation, which is responsible for not only the physical colonization of the country for about five centuries, but also for the permanently changed religious identities from that prior to the Ottoman occupation, specifically in Kosovo. Albanian nationalism As a result of contacts maintained between the Tosks and their relatives living or returning from abroad, foreign ideas began to seep into Albania.

Olav Aukrust (21 January 1883 ‚Äì 3 November 1929) was a Norwegian poet and teacher. He popularized the use of Nynorsk as a literary language and is most commonly associated with his poem Himmelvarden (1916). Biography Aukrust was born in the parish of Lom in Oppland, Norway. He was raised in the traditional region of Gudbrandsdal. His parents Olav Olavsson Aukrust (1851‚Äì1931) and Mari P√•lsdatter Andvord (1864‚Äì1936) were farmers on the Nordgard Aukrust farm in the valley of B√∏verdalen. His brother Lars Olsen Aukrust (1886‚Äì1965) was a teacher and local official. His nephews Odd Aukrust (1915 ‚Äì2008) was an economist and Kjell Aukrust (1920‚Äì2002) was an author, poet and artist. Aukrust was a student of the folk college at Romundgard in Sel operated by priest and educator Christopher Bruun (1839‚Äì1920). From 1915 to 1917, he worked as a teacher at the folk high school at Dovre where future novelist Ingeborg M√∏ller (1878‚Äì1964) was also a teacher. He later taught at Gausdal. In 1911, he married Gudrun Blekastad (1887‚Äì1984), daughter of Haugean businessman Ivar Blekastad (1850‚Äì1936). She was the sister of artist Hallvard Blekastad (1883‚Äì1966) and sister-in-law of literary historian Milada Blekastad (1917‚Äì2003). He was strongly influenced by priest and author Ivar Mortensson- Egnund (1857‚Äì1934) who advocate of the use of Nynorsk. Aukrust wrote poems with a renewed national romantic style and used a characteristically similar form. His use of rural dialect contributed to the growth of Nynorsk as a literary language. Olav Aukrust joined the Anthroposophical Society in December 1921 after he and his wife, Gudrun Aukrust, traveled through Goetheanum on their way home from Italy. He suffered from tuberculosis, which came to characterize his last year and led to an early death at age 46. Legacy Nordgard Aukrust is now open to the public.

Unfortunately for Raleigh, this document was rendered worthless by a flaw that gave the king eventual possession of the property. Acting on the advice of Robert Cecil, 1st Earl of Salisbury, his Secretary of State, James conferred the manor on Carr. The case was argued at law, and in 1609 judgment was given for the Crown. Apparently Lady Raleigh received some inadequate compensation, and Carr at once entered on possession. Carr's influence became such that in 1610 he was instrumental in persuading the king to dissolve Parliament, which had shown signs of attacking the king's Scottish favourites. On 24 March 1611 he was created Viscount Rochester, and subsequently a Privy Councillor.\\"Robert Carr, Earl of Somerset (1585/6‚Äì1645)\\", The Fitzwilliam Museum Marriage to Frances Howard William Larkin, c. 1615 When Salisbury died in 1612, James had the notion of governing in person as his own chief Minister of State, with Carr carrying out many of Salisbury's former duties and acting as the king's secretary. But James' inability to attend closely to official business exposed the government to factionalism.Willson, p 334‚Äì5. The Howard party, consisting of Henry Howard, 1st Earl of Northampton; Thomas Howard, 1st Earl of Suffolk; his son-in-law William Knollys, 1st Earl of Banbury; Charles Howard, 1st Earl of Nottingham, and Sir Thomas Lake, soon took control of much of the government and its patronage. Even the powerful Carr, hardly experienced for the responsibilities thrust upon him and often dependent on his intimate friend Overbury for assistance with government papers,Willson, p 349; Perry, p 105. fell into the Howard camp. He had done this after beginning an affair with Frances Howard, Countess of Essex, daughter of the Earl of Suffolk. Overbury mistrusted the Howards and still had Carr's ear, and tried to prevent the marriage. In order to remove him from court, the Howard faction manipulated Overbury into seeming to be disrespectful to the queen. They then persuaded the king to offer Overbury an assignment as ambassador to the court of Tsar Michael of Russia, aware that his refusal would be tantamount to treason. The plan worked and Overbury declined, wishing to remain in England and at his friend's side. On 22 April 1613 Overbury was placed in the Tower of London at the king's \\"request\\",Willson, p 342. eventually dying there five months later on 15 September \\"of natural causes\\". On 25 September 1613, and supported by the king, Lady Essex obtained a decree of nullity of marriage against her husband, Robert Devereux, 3rd Earl of Essex. On 3 November 1613 Carr was advanced to the Earldom of Somerset, on 23 December appointed Treasurer of Scotland. On 26 December, Lady Essex married Carr. Power, scandal, and downfall In 1614 Carr was appointed Lord Chamberlain. He supported the earl of Northampton and the Spanish party in opposition to the old tried advisers of the king, such as the Lord Chancellor Ellesmere, who were endeavouring to maintain the union with the Protestants abroad. As the years progressed James showered Somerset with more gifts, until 1615 when the two men had a falling out and Somerset was replaced by George Villiers (whom James made Duke of Buckingham). James wrote a letter that year detailing a list of complaints he then had against Somerset. Somerset still retained some favour, and might possibly have remained in power for some time longer but for the discovery in July of the murder of Overbury by poisoning.Lindley, p 146; Barroll, Anna of Denmark, p 136. At the infamous trial Edward Coke and Francis Bacon were set to unravel the plot. Eventually, four people had been convicted for taking part in the murder, and hanged at Tyburn at the end of 1615. They were Sir Gervase Helwys, Lieutenant of the Tower of London, Richard Weston, a gaoler, Mrs Anne Turner, a \\"waiting woman\\" of Frances Howard, and an apothecary called Franklin. Sir Thomas Monson, 1st Baronet was also implicated in the case, but the charges against him were later dropped. Somerset and Howard were brought to trial in the spring of 1616.Cassell's Illustrated History of England (1865), vol 3, p.59 The latter confessed, and her guilt is widely accepted. Somerset's share is far more difficult to uncover, and probably will never be fully known. The evidence against him rested on mere presumption, and he consistently declared himself innocent. Probabilities are on the whole in favour of the hypothesis that he was no more than an accessory after the fact. Fearing Somerset might seek to implicate him, James repeatedly sent messages to the Tower pleading with him to admit his guilt in return for a pardon stating, \\"It is easy to be seen that he would threaten me with laying an aspersion upon me of being, in some sort, accessory to his crime\\".Cassell's Illustrated History of England (1865), vol 3, p.59 The king eventually let matters take their course, and both Somerset and Howard were found guilty and confined to the Tower. The sentence, however, was not carried into effect against either culprit. Howard was pardoned immediately, but both remained in the Tower until 1622. Somerset appears to have refused to buy forgiveness by concessions, and did not obtain his pardon until 1624. He emerged into public view only once more when, in 1630, he was prosecuted in the Star Chamber for communicating a paper recommending the establishment of arbitrary government by Robert Dudley to John Holles, 1st Earl of Clare. Somerset died in July 1645, leaving one daughter, Anne, the sole issue of his ill-fated marriage, afterwards wife of William Russell, 1st Duke of Bedford. Popular culture The rise and fall of Robert Carr and his relationship to Thomas Overbury are the subject of Rafael Sabatini's 1930 novel The Minion, written shortly before Sabatini's divorce from his first wife in 1931.trove.nla.gov.au/newspaper/article/4388007/484100 (Given The Minions more tragic tone, it may have been Sabatini's divorce that tainted his normally optimistic, hero-wins-out writing style.)

There may also be limited emission of heat. Given reactants A and B, with an excited intermediate ‚óä, :[A] + [B] ‚Üí [‚óä] ‚Üí [Products] + light For example, if [A] is luminol and [B] is hydrogen peroxide in the presence of a suitable catalyst we have: :\\\\underset{luminol}{C8H7N3O2} + \\\\underset{hydrogen\\\\ peroxide}{H2O2} -> 3-APA[\\\\lozenge] -> {3-APA} + light where: * 3-APA is 3-aminophthalate * 3-APA[‚óä] is the vibronic excited state fluorescing as it decays to a lower energy level. General description The decay of this excited state[‚óä] to a lower energy level causes light emission. In theory, one photon of light should be given off for each molecule of reactant. This is equivalent to Avogadro's number of photons per mole of reactant. In actual practice, non-enzymatic reactions seldom exceed 1% QC, quantum efficiency. In a chemical reaction, reactants collide to form a transition state, the enthalpic maximum in a reaction coordinate diagram, which proceeds to the product. Normally, reactants form products of lesser chemical energy. The difference in energy between reactants and products, represented as \\\\Delta H_{rxn}, is turned into heat, physically realized as excitations in the vibrational state of the normal modes of the product. Since vibrational energy is generally much greater than the thermal agitation, it rapidly disperses in the solvent through molecular rotation. This is how exothermic reactions make their solutions hotter. In a chemiluminescent reaction, the direct product of the reaction is an excited electronic state. This state then decays into an electronic ground state and emits light through either an allowed transition (analogous to fluorescence) or a forbidden transition (analogous to phosphorescence), depending partly on the spin state of the electronic excited state formed. Chemiluminescence differs from fluorescence or phosphorescence in that the electronic excited state is the product of a chemical reaction rather than of the absorption of a photon. It is the antithesis of a photochemical reaction, in which light is used to drive an endothermic chemical reaction. Here, light is generated from a chemically exothermic reaction. The chemiluminescence might be also induced by an electrochemical stimulus, in this case is called electrochemiluminescence. Bioluminescence in nature: A male firefly mating with a female of the species Lampyris noctiluca. A standard example of chemiluminescence in the laboratory setting is the luminol test. Here, blood is indicated by luminescence upon contact with iron in hemoglobin. When chemiluminescence takes place in living organisms, the phenomenon is called bioluminescence. A light stick emits light by chemiluminescence.  Liquid-phase reactions  Chemiluminescence in aqueous system is mainly caused by redox reactions. Chemiluminescence after a reaction of hydrogen peroxide and luminol * Luminol in an alkaline solution with hydrogen peroxide in the presence of iron or copper, or an auxiliary oxidant, produces chemiluminescence.

This is a gas-phase reaction of phosphorus vapor, above the solid, with oxygen producing the excited states (PO)2 and HPO.Rauhut, Michael M. (1985), Chemiluminescence. In Grayson, Martin (Ed) (1985). Kirk-Othmer Concise Encyclopedia of Chemical Technology (3rd ed), pp 247 John Wiley and Sons. * Another gas phase reaction is the basis of nitric oxide detection in commercial analytic instruments applied to environmental air-quality testing. Ozone is combined with nitric oxide to form nitrogen dioxide in an activated state. :NO+O3 ‚Üí NO2[‚óä]+ O2 :The activated NO2[‚óä] luminesces broadband visible to infrared light as it reverts to a lower energy state. A photomultiplier and associated electronics counts the photons that are proportional to the amount of NO present. To determine the amount of nitrogen dioxide, NO2, in a sample (containing no NO) it must first be converted to nitric oxide, NO, by passing the sample through a converter before the above ozone activation reaction is applied. The ozone reaction produces a photon count proportional to NO that is proportional to NO2 before it was converted to NO. In the case of a mixed sample that contains both NO and NO2, the above reaction yields the amount of NO and NO2 combined in the air sample, assuming that the sample is passed through the converter. If the mixed sample is not passed through the converter, the ozone reaction produces activated NO2[‚óä] only in proportion to the NO in the sample. The NO2 in the sample is not activated by the ozone reaction. Though unactivated NO2 is present with the activated NO2[‚óä], photons are emitted only by the activated species that is proportional to original NO.

Infrared chemiluminescence  In chemical kinetics, infrared chemiluminiscence (IRCL) refers to the emission of infrared photons from vibrationally excited product molecules immediately after their formation. The intensities of infrared emission lines from vibrationally excited molecules are used to measure the populations of vibrational states of product molecules.Atkins P. and de Paula J. Physical Chemistry (8th ed., W.H.Freeman 2006) p.886 Steinfeld J.I., Francisco J.S. and Hase W.L. Chemical Kinetics and Dynamics (2nd ed., Prentice-Hall 1998) p.263 The observation of IRCL was developed as a kinetic technique by John Polanyi, who used it to study the attractive or repulsive nature of the potential energy surface for gas-phase reactions. In general the IRCL is much more intense for reactions with an attractive surface, indicating that this type of surface leads to energy deposition in vibrational excitation. In contrast reactions with a repulsive potential energy surface lead to little IRCL, indicating that the energy is primarily deposited as translational energy.Atkins P. and de Paula J. p.889-890  Enhanced chemiluminescence  Enhanced chemiluminescence is a common technique for a variety of detection assays in biology. A horseradish peroxidase enzyme (HRP) is tethered to an antibody that specifically recognizes the molecule of interest. This enzyme complex then catalyzes the conversion of the enhanced chemiluminescent substrate into a sensitized reagent in the vicinity of the molecule of interest, which on further oxidation by hydrogen peroxide, produces a triplet (excited) carbonyl, which emits light when it decays to the singlet carbonyl. Enhanced chemiluminescence allows detection of minute quantities of a biomolecule. Proteins can be detected down to femtomole quantities,Enhanced CL review. Biocompare.com (2007-06-04).

Applications  * Gas analysis: for determining small amounts of impurities or poisons in air. Other compounds can also be determined by this method (ozone, N-oxides, S-compounds). A typical example is NO determination with detection limits down to 1 ppb. Highly specialised chemiluminescence detectors have been used recently to determine concentrations as well as fluxes of NOx with detection limits as low as 5 ppt.Stella, P., Kortner, M., Ammann, C., Foken, T., Meixner, F.

Biological applications  Chemiluminescence has been applied by forensic scientists to solve crimes. In this case, they use luminol and hydrogen peroxide. The iron from the blood acts as a catalyst and reacts with the luminol and hydrogen peroxide to produce blue light for about 30 seconds. Because only a small amount of iron is required for chemiluminescence, trace amounts of blood are sufficient. In biomedical research, the protein that gives fireflies their glow and its co-factor, luciferin, are used to produce red light through the consumption of ATP. This reaction is used in many applications, including the effectiveness of cancer drugs that choke off a tumor's blood supply. This form of bioluminescence imaging allows scientists to test drugs in the pre-clinical stages cheaply. Another protein, aequorin, found in certain jellyfish, produces blue light in the presence of calcium. It can be used in molecular biology to assess calcium levels in cells. What these biological reactions have in common is their use of adenosine triphosphate (ATP) as an energy source. Though the structure of the molecules that produce luminescence is different for each species, they are given the generic name of luciferin. Firefly luciferin can be oxidized to produce an excited complex. Once it falls back down to a ground state a photon is released. It is very similar to the reaction with luminol. :Luciferin{} + O2{} + ATP ->[\\\\text{Luciferase}] Oxyluciferin{} + CO2{} + AMP{} + PPi{} + light Many organisms have evolved to produce light in a range of colors. At the molecular level, the difference in color arises from the degree of conjugation of the molecule, when an electron drops down from the excited state to the ground state. Deep sea organisms have evolved to produce light to lure and catch prey, as camouflage, or to attract others. Some bacteria even use bioluminescence to communicate. The common colors for the light emitted by these animals are blue and green because they have shorter wavelength than red and can transmit more easily in water. In April 2020, researchers reported to have genetically engineered plants to glow much brighter than previously possible by inserting genes of the bioluminescent mushroom Neonothopanus nambi. The glow is self-sustained, works by converting plants' caffeic acid into luciferin and, unlike for bacterial bioluminescence genes used earlier, has a relatively high light output that is visible to the naked eye. Chemiluminescence is different from fluorescence. Hence the application of fluorescent proteins such as Green fluorescent protein is not a biological application of chemiluminescence.

After the glass capsule is broken and the solutions mix, the glowstick glows. Different color glow sticks meant for use as bracelets A glow stick is a self-contained, short-term light-source. It consists of a translucent plastic tube containing isolated substances that, when combined, make light through chemiluminescence, so it does not require an external energy source. The light cannot be turned off and can be used only once. Glow sticks are often used for recreation, but may also be relied upon for light during military, police, fire, or emergency medical services operations. They are also used by military and police to mark \\"clear\\" areas.  History  Bis(2,4,5-trichlorophenyl-6-carbopentoxyphenyl)oxalate, trademarked \\"Cyalume\\", was invented in 1971 By Michael M. Rauhut and Laszlo J. Bollyky of American Cyanamid, based on work by Edwin A. Chandross of Bell Labs. Other early work on chemiluminescence was carried out at the same time, by researchers under Herbert Richter at China Lake Naval Weapons Center. Several US patents for \\"glow stick\\" type devices were received by various inventors. Bernard Dubrow and Eugene Daniel Guth patented a packaged chemiluminescent material in June 1965 (Patent 3,774,022). In October 1973, Clarence W. Gilliam, David Iba Sr., and Thomas N. Hall were registered as inventors of the Chemical Lighting Device (Patent 3,764,796). In June 1974, a patent for a Chemiluminescent Device was issued with Herbert P. Richter and Ruth E. Tedrick listed as the inventors (Patent 3,819,925). In January 1976, a patent was issued for the Chemiluminescent Signal Device, with Vincent J. Esposito, Steven M. Little, and John H. Lyons listed as the inventors (Patent 3,933,118). This patent recommended a single glass ampoule that is suspended in a second substance, that when broken and mixed together, provide the chemiluminescent light. The design also included a stand for the signal device so it could be thrown from a moving vehicle and remain standing in an upright position on the road. The idea was this would replace traditional emergency roadside flares and would be superior, since it was not a fire hazard, would be easier and safer to deploy, and would not be made ineffective if struck by passing vehicles. This design, with its single glass ampoule inside a plastic tube filled with a second substance that when bent breaks the glass and then is shaken to mix the substances, most closely resembles the typical glow stick sold today. In December 1977, a patent was issued for a Chemical Light Device with Richard Taylor Van Zandt as the inventor (Patent 4,064,428). This design alteration features a steel ball which shatters the glass ampoule when the glow stick is exposed to a predetermined level of shock; an example is an arrow flown dark but illuminating its landing location upon sudden deceleration. Disassembly of a chemoluminescent glow stick, from left to right: (1) original, intact lightstick; (2) opened glow stick with peroxide mixture poured into a graduated cylinder and glass ampoule of fluorophore removed; (3) all three under UV illumination showing fluorophore fluorescence and plastic container fluorescence; (4) chemoluminescence of mixed substances in the graduated cylinder; (5) the mixture returned to the original plastic container, showing a slightly different (more orange) colour of light emission.  Uses  Glow sticks are waterproof, do not use batteries, generate negligible heat, are inexpensive, and are reasonably disposable. They can tolerate high pressures, such as those found under water. They are used as light sources and light markers by military forces, campers, and recreational divers. = Entertainment = Glow sticks providing decor at a party Glowsticking is the use of glow sticks in dancing. This is one of their most widely known uses in popular culture, as they are frequently used for entertainment at parties (in particular raves), concerts, and dance clubs. They are used by marching band conductors for evening performances; glow sticks are also used in festivals and celebrations around the world. Glow sticks also serve multiple functions as toys, readily visible night-time warnings to motorists, and luminous markings that enable parents to keep track of their children. Yet another use is for balloon-carried light effects. Glow sticks are also used to create special effects in low light photography and film. The Guinness Book of Records says the world's largest glow stick was cracked at tall. It was created by the University of Wisconsin‚ÄìWhitewater's Chemistry Department to celebrate the school's sesquicentennial, or 150th birthday in Whitewater, Wisconsin and cracked on 09 September 2018.  Operation  Glow sticks emit light when two chemicals are mixed. The reaction between the two chemicals is catalyzed by a base, usually sodium salicylate. The sticks consist of a tiny, brittle container within a flexible outer container. Each container holds a different solution. When the outer container is flexed, the inner container breaks, allowing the solutions to combine, causing the necessary chemical reaction. After breaking, the tube is shaken to thoroughly mix the components. The glow stick contains two chemicals, a base catalyst, and a suitable dye (sensitizer, or fluorophor). This creates an exergonic reaction. The chemicals inside the plastic tube are a mixture of the dye, the base catalyst, and diphenyl oxalate. The chemical in the glass vial is hydrogen peroxide. By mixing the peroxide with the phenyl oxalate ester, a chemical reaction takes place, yielding two moles of phenol and one mole of peroxyacid ester (1,2-dioxetanedione). The peroxyacid decomposes spontaneously to carbon dioxide, releasing energy that excites the dye, which then relaxes by releasing a photon. The wavelength of the photon‚Äîthe color of the emitted light‚Äîdepends on the structure of the dye. The reaction releases energy mostly as light, with very little heat. The reason for this is that the reverse [2 + 2] photocycloadditions of 1,2-dioxetanedione is a forbidden transition (it violates Woodward‚ÄìHoffmann rules) and cannot proceed through a regular thermal mechanism. Oxidation of an diphenyl oxalate (top), decomposition of 1,2-dioxetanedione (middle), relaxation of dye (lower) By adjusting the concentrations of the two chemicals and the base, manufacturers can produce glow sticks that glow either brightly for a short amount of time or more dimly for an extended length of time. This also allows glow sticks to perform satisfactorily in hot or cold climates, by compensating for the temperature dependence of reaction. At maximum concentration (typically found only in laboratory settings), mixing the chemicals results in a furious reaction, producing large amounts of light for only a few seconds. The same effect can be achieved by adding copious amounts of sodium salicylate or other bases. Heating a glow stick also causes the reaction to proceed faster and the glow stick to glow more brightly for a brief period. Cooling a glow stick slows the reaction a small amount and causes it to last longer, but the light is dimmer. This can be demonstrated by refrigerating or freezing an active glow stick; when it warms up again, it will resume glowing. The dyes used in glow sticks usually exhibit fluorescence when exposed to ultraviolet radiation‚Äîeven a spent glow stick may therefore shine under a black light. The light intensity is high immediately after activation, then exponentially decays. Leveling of this initial high output is possible by refrigerating the glow stick before activation. Spectral emission of chemiluminescence (green line) of mixed fluorophore and peroxide, which was removed from an orange glow stick, fluorescence of liquid fluorophore in glass ampoule only (before mixing) while under black light (yellow-orange line), fluorescence of plastic outer container of orange glow stick under black light (red line), and spectrum of reassembled chemiluminescent glow stick (glowing liquid poured back into original orange plastic vial) (darker orange line). This plot thus shows that the orange light from an orange glow stick (identical to the one in the above glow stick disassembly image) is created by a greenish-yellow light emitting chemoluminescent liquid partially inducing fluorescence in (and being filtered by) an orange plastic container. A combination of two fluorophores can be used, with one in the solution and another incorporated to the walls of the container. This is advantageous when the second fluorophore would degrade in solution or be attacked by the chemicals. The emission spectrum of the first fluorophore and the absorption spectrum of the second one have to largely overlap, and the first one has to emit at shorter wavelength than the second one. A downconversion from ultraviolet to visible is possible, as is conversion between visible wavelengths (e.g., green to orange) or visible to near-infrared. The shift can be as much as 200 nm, but usually the range is about 20‚Äì100 nm longer than the absorption spectrum. Glow sticks using this approach tend to have colored containers, due to the dye embedded in the plastic. Infrared glow sticks may appear dark-red to black, as the dyes absorb the visible light produced inside the container and reemit near-infrared. Light emitted from a white glow stick. Four or five peaks are observed in the spectrum, suggesting the presence of four or five different fluorophores contained in the glow stick. On the other hand, various colors can also be achieved by simply mixing several fluorophores within the solution to achieve the desired effect. These various colors can be achieved due to the principles of additive color. For example, a combination of red, yellow, and green fluorophores is used in orange light sticks, and a combination of several fluorescers is used in white light sticks. = Fluorophores used = *9,10-Diphenylanthracene (DPA) emits blue light *9-(2-phenylethenyl) anthracene emits teal light *1-chloro-9,10-diphenylanthracene (1-chloro(DPA)) and 2-chloro-9,10-diphenylanthracene (2-chloro(DPA)) emit blue-green light more efficiently than nonsubstituted DPA *9,10-Bis(phenylethynyl)anthracene (BPEA) emits green light with maximum at 486 nm *1-Chloro-9,10-bis(phenylethynyl)anthracene emits yellow-green light, used in 30-minute high-intensity Cyalume sticks *2-Chloro-9,10-bis(phenylethynyl)anthracene emits green light, used in 12-hour low-intensity Cyalume sticks *1,8-dichloro-9,10-bis(phenylethynyl)anthracene emits yellow light, used in Cyalume sticks *Rubrene emits orange-yellow at 550 nm *2,4-di-tert-butylphenyl 1,4,5,8-tetracarboxynaphthalene diamide emits deep red light, together with DPA is used to produce white or hot-pink light, depending on their ratio *Rhodamine B emits red light.

It is advisable to keep the mixture away from skin and to prevent accidental ingestion if the glow stick case splits or breaks. If spilled on skin, the chemicals could cause slight skin irritation, swelling, or, in extreme circumstances, vomiting and nausea. Some of the chemicals used in older glow sticks were thought to be potential carcinogens. The sensitizers used are polynuclear aromatic hydrocarbons, a class of compounds known for their carcinogenic properties. Dibutyl phthalate, an ingredient sometimes used in glow sticks, has raised some health concerns. While there is no evidence that dibutyl phthalate poses any major health risk, it was put on California's list of suspected teratogens in 2006. Glow sticks contain ingredients that act as a plasticizer. This means if a glow stick leaks onto anything plastic it can liquefy it. Diphenyl oxalate can sting and burn eyes, irritate and sting skin and can burn the mouth and throat if ingested.

It is often used alone, somewhat loosely, to refer to people of British Isles descent in the North America, the Caribbean, South Africa, Namibia, Australia, and New Zealand. It is used in Canada to differentiate between the French speakers (Francophone) of mainly Quebec and some parts of New Brunswick, and the English speakers (Anglophone) in the rest of Canada. It is also used in the United States to distinguish the growing Spanish-speaking Latino population from the English-speaking majority. It is also used, both in English-speaking and non-English-speaking countries, to refer to Anglophone people of other European origins. Anglo is a Late Latin prefix used to denote English- in conjunction with another toponym or demonym. The word is derived from Anglia, the Latin name for England and still used in the modern name for its eastern region, East Anglia. Anglia and England both mean land of the Angles, a Germanic people originating in the north German peninsula of Angeln, that is, the region of today's Lower Saxony that joins the Jutland Peninsula. (There are various hypotheses for the origin of the name 'Angeln'.) It is also often used to refer to British in historical and other contexts after the Acts of Union 1707, for example such as in the Anglo- Dutch Treaty of 1824, where in later years agreement was between the British government and the Dutch, not an English government. Typical examples of this use are also shown below, where non-English people from the British Isles are described as being Anglo. Anglo is not an easily defined term. For traditionalists, there are linguistic problems with using the word as an adjective or noun on its own. For example, the purpose of the -o ending is to enable the formation of a compound term (for example Anglo-Saxon meaning of Angle and Saxon origin), so there is only an apparent parallelism between, for example, Latino and Anglo. However, a semantic change has taken place in many English-speaking regions so that in informal usage the meanings listed below are common. The definition is changed in each region which defines how it is identified. Specialized usage =Africa= The term Anglo-African has been used historically to self-identify by people of mixed British and African ancestry born in the United States and in Africa. The Anglo-African and The Weekly Anglo-African were the names of newspapers published by African American abolitionist Robert Hamilton (1819‚Äì1870) in New York during the American Civil War era. The Anglo-African was also the name of a newspaper published in Lagos (now part of Nigeria) from 1863 to 1865. It was founded and edited by Robert Campbell (1829‚Äì1884), a Jamaican born son of a Scottish father and Mulatto mother. The term has also been used historically to describe people living in the British Empire in Africa. Harry Johnston (1858‚Äì1927) and E. D. Morel (1873‚Äì1924) are referred to as Anglo-Africans in this publication. The Anglo-African Who's Who and Biographical Sketch-Book published in London in 1905 includes details of prominent British and Afrikaner people in Africa at that time. =Australia= In Australia, Anglo is used as part of the terms Anglo-Australian and Anglo-Celtic, which refer to the majority of Australians, who are of English, Scottish, Welsh and Irish descent. =Canada= In Canada, and especially in Canadian French, the terms Anglophone, Anglo-Canadian or simply Anglo, are widely used to designate someone whose mother tongue is English, as opposed to Francophone, which describes someone whose mother tongue is French, and to Allophone, which describes someone whose mother tongue is a language other than English or French. (In Quebec, the word Anglophone or Anglo refers to English-speaking Quebecers in both English and French.) Anglo-Metis is also sometimes used to refer to a historical ethnic group. =Israel= Immigrants from English- speaking countries are sometimes referred to as Anglos. =Scotland= In Scotland the term Anglo-Scot, often shortened to Anglos, is used to refer to people with mixed Scottish-English ancestry, or people with English ancestry born in Scotland. The term Anglo-Scot is more often used to describe Scottish sports players who are based in England or playing for English teams, or vice versa. This usage is especially used in football and notably in rugby union, where the Anglo Scots were a Scottish non-native select provincial District side that competed in the Scottish Inter-District Championship. =United States= In many parts of the United States, especially those with high Hispanic populations, \\"Anglo-American\\" is shortened to \\"Anglo\\" and applied to white Americans who are not of Hispanic or Latino origin and sometimes to those who are not of French origin, but the latter criterion is based on specific linguistic considerations and limited to Louisiana and parts of Texas. If language is taken into consideration the term \\"Anglo-American\\" also excludes Franco-Americans such as the Cajuns of Louisiana, but would include them when language is excluded as a criterion. In the Southwest United States, \\"Anglo\\", short for \\"Anglo American\\", is used as a synonym for non-Hispanic Whites; that is European Americans (except people who speak Romance languages), most of whom speak the English language, even those who are not necessarily of English or British descent. Some non-Hispanic whites in the United States who speak English but are not of English or British ancestry do not identify with the term Anglo and find the term offensive. For instance, some Cajuns in south Louisiana use the term to refer to area whites who do not have Francophone backgrounds. Irish Americans, the second largest self- identified ethnic group in the United States following German-Americans, also sometimes take umbrage at being called \\"Anglo\\".\\"The Irish-Mexican Thing\\" by Julie Reynolds.

But even if no infinities arose in loop diagrams in quantum field theory, it could be shown that it would be necessary to renormalize the mass and fields appearing in the original Lagrangian.See e.g., Weinberg vol I, chapter 10. For example, an electron theory may begin by postulating an electron with an initial mass and charge. In quantum field theory a cloud of virtual particles, such as photons, positrons, and others surrounds and interacts with the initial electron. Accounting for the interactions of the surrounding particles (e.g. collisions at different energies) shows that the electron-system behaves as if it had a different mass and charge than initially postulated. Renormalization, in this example, mathematically replaces the initially postulated mass and charge of an electron with the experimentally observed mass and charge. Mathematics and experiments prove that positrons and more massive particles like protons, exhibit precisely the same observed charge as the electron - even in the presence of much stronger interactions and more intense clouds of virtual particles. Renormalization specifies relationships between parameters in the theory when parameters describing large distance scales differ from parameters describing small distance scales. In high-energy particle accelerators like the CERN Large Hadron Collider the concept named pileup occurs when undesirable proton-proton collisions interact with data collection for simultaneous, nearby desirable measurements. Physically, the pileup of contributions from an infinity of scales involved in a problem may then result in further infinities. When describing space-time as a continuum, certain statistical and quantum mechanical constructions are not well-defined. To define them, or make them unambiguous, a continuum limit must carefully remove \\"construction scaffolding\\" of lattices at various scales. Renormalization procedures are based on the requirement that certain physical quantities (such as the mass and charge of an electron) equal observed (experimental) values. That is, the experimental value of the physical quantity yields practical applications, but due to their empirical nature the observed measurement represents areas of quantum field theory that require deeper derivation from theoretical bases. Renormalization was first developed in quantum electrodynamics (QED) to make sense of infinite integrals in perturbation theory. Initially viewed as a suspect provisional procedure even by some of its originators, renormalization eventually was embraced as an important and self-consistent actual mechanism of scale physics in several fields of physics and mathematics. Today, the point of view has shifted: on the basis of the breakthrough renormalization group insights of Nikolay Bogolyubov and Kenneth Wilson, the focus is on variation of physical quantities across contiguous scales, while distant scales are related to each other through \\"effective\\" descriptions. All scales are linked in a broadly systematic way, and the actual physics pertinent to each is extracted with the suitable specific computational techniques appropriate for each. Wilson clarified which variables of a system are crucial and which are redundant. Renormalization is distinct from regularization, another technique to control infinities by assuming the existence of new unknown physics at new scales.  Self-interactions in classical physics  Figure 1. Renormalization in quantum electrodynamics: The simple electron/photon interaction that determines the electron's charge at one renormalization point is revealed to consist of more complicated interactions at another. The problem of infinities first arose in the classical electrodynamics of point particles in the 19th and early 20th century. The mass of a charged particle should include the mass-energy in its electrostatic field (electromagnetic mass). Assume that the particle is a charged spherical shell of radius . The mass‚Äìenergy in the field is :m_\\\\text{em} = \\\\int \\\\frac{1}{2} E^2 \\\\, dV = \\\\int_{r_e}^\\\\infty \\\\frac{1}{2} \\\\left( \\\\frac{q}{4\\\\pi r^2} \\\\right)^2 4\\\\pi r^2 \\\\, dr = \\\\frac{q^2}{8\\\\pi r_e}, which becomes infinite as . This implies that the point particle would have infinite inertia, making it unable to be accelerated. Incidentally, the value of that makes m_\\\\text{em} equal to the electron mass is called the classical electron radius, which (setting q = e and restoring factors of and \\\\varepsilon_0) turns out to be :r_e = \\\\frac{e^2}{4\\\\pi\\\\varepsilon_0 m_e c^2} = \\\\alpha \\\\frac{\\\\hbar}{m_e c} \\\\approx 2.8 \\\\times 10^{-15}~\\\\text{m}, where \\\\alpha \\\\approx 1/137 is the fine- structure constant, and \\\\hbar/(m_e c) is the Compton wavelength of the electron. Renormalization: The total effective mass of a spherical charged particle includes the actual bare mass of the spherical shell (in addition to the mass mentioned above associated with its electric field). If the shell's bare mass is allowed to be negative, it might be possible to take a consistent point limit. This was called renormalization, and Lorentz and Abraham attempted to develop a classical theory of the electron this way. This early work was the inspiration for later attempts at regularization and renormalization in quantum field theory. (See also regularization (physics) for an alternative way to remove infinities from this classical problem, assuming new physics exists at small scales.) When calculating the electromagnetic interactions of charged particles, it is tempting to ignore the back-reaction of a particle's own field on itself. (Analogous to the back- EMF of circuit analysis.) But this back-reaction is necessary to explain the friction on charged particles when they emit radiation. If the electron is assumed to be a point, the value of the back-reaction diverges, for the same reason that the mass diverges, because the field is inverse-square. The Abraham‚ÄìLorentz theory had a noncausal \\"pre-acceleration.\\" Sometimes an electron would start moving before the force is applied. This is a sign that the point limit is inconsistent. The trouble was worse in classical field theory than in quantum field theory, because in quantum field theory a charged particle experiences Zitterbewegung due to interference with virtual particle- antiparticle pairs, thus effectively smearing out the charge over a region comparable to the Compton wavelength. In quantum electrodynamics at small coupling, the electromagnetic mass only diverges as the logarithm of the radius of the particle.  Divergences in quantum electrodynamics  (a) Vacuum polarization, a.k.a. charge screening. This loop has a logarithmic ultraviolet divergence. (b) Self-energy diagram in QED (c) Example of a ‚Äúpenguin‚Äù diagram When developing quantum electrodynamics in the 1930s, Max Born, Werner Heisenberg, Pascual Jordan, and Paul Dirac discovered that in perturbative corrections many integrals were divergent (see The problem of infinities). One way of describing the perturbation theory corrections' divergences was discovered in 1947‚Äì49 by Hans Kramers,Kramers presented his work at the 1947 Shelter Island Conference, repeated in 1948 at the Solvay Conference. The latter did not appear in print until the Proceedings of the Solvay Conference, published in 1950 (see Laurie M. Brown (ed.), Renormalization: From Lorentz to Landau (and Beyond), Springer, 2012, p. 53). Kramers' approach was nonrelativistic (see Jagdish Mehra, Helmut Rechenberg, The Conceptual Completion and Extensions of Quantum Mechanics 1932-1941. Epilogue: Aspects of the Further Development of Quantum Theory 1942-1999: Volumes 6, Part 2, Springer, 2001, p. 1050). Hans Bethe, Julian Schwinger, Richard Feynman, and Shin'ichiro Tomonaga, and systematized by Freeman Dyson in 1949. The divergences appear in radiative corrections involving Feynman diagrams with closed loops of virtual particles in them. While virtual particles obey conservation of energy and momentum, they can have any energy and momentum, even one that is not allowed by the relativistic energy‚Äìmomentum relation for the observed mass of that particle (that is, E^2 - p^2 is not necessarily the squared mass of the particle in that process, e.g. for a photon it could be nonzero). Such a particle is called off-shell. When there is a loop, the momentum of the particles involved in the loop is not uniquely determined by the energies and momenta of incoming and outgoing particles. A variation in the energy of one particle in the loop can be balanced by an equal and opposite change in the energy of another particle in the loop, without affecting the incoming and outgoing particles. Thus many variations are possible. So to find the amplitude for the loop process, one must integrate over all possible combinations of energy and momentum that could travel around the loop. These integrals are often divergent, that is, they give infinite answers. The divergences that are significant are the \\"ultraviolet\\" (UV) ones. An ultraviolet divergence can be described as one that comes from * the region in the integral where all particles in the loop have large energies and momenta, * very short wavelengths and high-frequencies fluctuations of the fields, in the path integral for the field, * very short proper-time between particle emission and absorption, if the loop is thought of as a sum over particle paths. So these divergences are short-distance, short-time phenomena. Shown in the pictures at the right margin, there are exactly three one-loop divergent loop diagrams in quantum electrodynamics: :(a) A photon creates a virtual electron‚Äìpositron pair, which then annihilates. This is a vacuum polarization diagram. :(b) An electron quickly emits and reabsorbs a virtual photon, called a self-energy. :(c) An electron emits a photon, emits a second photon, and reabsorbs the first. This process is shown in the section below in figure 2, and it is called a vertex renormalization. The Feynman diagram for this is also called a ‚Äúpenguin diagram‚Äù due to its shape remotely resembling a penguin. The three divergences correspond to the three parameters in the theory under consideration: # The field normalization Z. # The mass of the electron. # The charge of the electron. The second class of divergence called an infrared divergence, is due to massless particles, like the photon. Every process involving charged particles emits infinitely many coherent photons of infinite wavelength, and the amplitude for emitting any finite number of photons is zero. For photons, these divergences are well understood. For example, at the 1-loop order, the vertex function has both ultraviolet and infrared divergences. In contrast to the ultraviolet divergence, the infrared divergence does not require the renormalization of a parameter in the theory involved. The infrared divergence of the vertex diagram is removed by including a diagram similar to the vertex diagram with the following important difference: the photon connecting the two legs of the electron is cut and replaced by two on-shell (i.e. real) photons whose wavelengths tend to infinity; this diagram is equivalent to the bremsstrahlung process. This additional diagram must be included because there is no physical way to distinguish a zero-energy photon flowing through a loop as in the vertex diagram and zero-energy photons emitted through bremsstrahlung. From a mathematical point of view, the IR divergences can be regularized by assuming fractional differentiation w.r.t. a parameter, for example: : \\\\left( p^2 - a^2 \\\\right)^{\\\\frac{1}{2}} is well defined at but is UV divergent; if we take the -th fractional derivative with respect to , we obtain the IR divergence : \\\\frac{1}{p^2 - a^2}, so we can cure IR divergences by turning them into UV divergences. = A loop divergence = Figure 2. A diagram contributing to electron‚Äìelectron scattering in QED. The loop has an ultraviolet divergence. The diagram in Figure 2 shows one of the several one- loop contributions to electron‚Äìelectron scattering in QED. The electron on the left side of the diagram, represented by the solid line, starts out with 4-momentum and ends up with 4-momentum . It emits a virtual photon carrying to transfer energy and momentum to the other electron. But in this diagram, before that happens, it emits another virtual photon carrying 4-momentum , and it reabsorbs this one after emitting the other virtual photon. Energy and momentum conservation do not determine the 4-momentum uniquely, so all possibilities contribute equally and we must integrate. This diagram's amplitude ends up with, among other things, a factor from the loop of :-ie^3 \\\\int \\\\frac{d^4 q}{(2\\\\pi)^4} \\\\gamma^\\\\mu \\\\frac{i (\\\\gamma^\\\\alpha (r - q)_\\\\alpha + m)}{(r - q)^2 - m^2 + i \\\\epsilon} \\\\gamma^\\\\rho \\\\frac{i (\\\\gamma^\\\\beta (p - q)_\\\\beta + m)}{(p - q)^2 - m^2 + i \\\\epsilon} \\\\gamma^ u \\\\frac{-i g_{\\\\mu u}}{q^2 + i\\\\epsilon}. The various factors in this expression are gamma matrices as in the covariant formulation of the Dirac equation; they have to do with the spin of the electron. The factors of are the electric coupling constant, while the i\\\\epsilon provide a heuristic definition of the contour of integration around the poles in the space of momenta. The important part for our purposes is the dependency on of the three big factors in the integrand, which are from the propagators of the two electron lines and the photon line in the loop. This has a piece with two powers of on top that dominates at large values of (Pokorski 1987, p. 122): :e^3 \\\\gamma^\\\\mu \\\\gamma^\\\\alpha \\\\gamma^\\\\rho \\\\gamma^\\\\beta \\\\gamma_\\\\mu \\\\int \\\\frac{d^4 q}{(2\\\\pi)^4} \\\\frac{q_\\\\alpha q_\\\\beta}{(r - q)^2 (p - q)^2 q^2}. This integral is divergent and infinite, unless we cut it off at finite energy and momentum in some way. Similar loop divergences occur in other quantum field theories.  Renormalized and bare quantities  The solution was to realize that the quantities initially appearing in the theory's formulae (such as the formula for the Lagrangian), representing such things as the electron's electric charge and mass, as well as the normalizations of the quantum fields themselves, did not actually correspond to the physical constants measured in the laboratory. As written, they were bare quantities that did not take into account the contribution of virtual-particle loop effects to the physical constants themselves. Among other things, these effects would include the quantum counterpart of the electromagnetic back-reaction that so vexed classical theorists of electromagnetism. In general, these effects would be just as divergent as the amplitudes under consideration in the first place; so finite measured quantities would, in general, imply divergent bare quantities. To make contact with reality, then, the formulae would have to be rewritten in terms of measurable, renormalized quantities. The charge of the electron, say, would be defined in terms of a quantity measured at a specific kinematic renormalization point or subtraction point (which will generally have a characteristic energy, called the renormalization scale or simply the energy scale). The parts of the Lagrangian left over, involving the remaining portions of the bare quantities, could then be reinterpreted as counterterms, involved in divergent diagrams exactly canceling out the troublesome divergences for other diagrams. = Renormalization in QED = Figure 3. The vertex corresponding to the counterterm cancels the divergence in Figure 2. For example, in the Lagrangian of QED :\\\\mathcal{L}=\\\\bar\\\\psi_B\\\\left[i\\\\gamma_\\\\mu \\\\left (\\\\partial^\\\\mu + ie_BA_B^\\\\mu \\\\right )-m_B\\\\right]\\\\psi_B -\\\\frac{1}{4}F_{B\\\\mu u}F_B^{\\\\mu u} the fields and coupling constant are really bare quantities, hence the subscript above. Conventionally the bare quantities are written so that the corresponding Lagrangian terms are multiples of the renormalized ones: :\\\\left(\\\\bar\\\\psi m \\\\psi\\\\right)_B = Z_0 \\\\bar\\\\psi m \\\\psi :\\\\left(\\\\bar\\\\psi\\\\left(\\\\partial^\\\\mu + ieA^\\\\mu \\\\right )\\\\psi\\\\right)_B = Z_1 \\\\bar\\\\psi \\\\left (\\\\partial^\\\\mu + ieA^\\\\mu \\\\right)\\\\psi :\\\\left(F_{\\\\mu u}F^{\\\\mu u}\\\\right)_B = Z_3\\\\, F_{\\\\mu u}F^{\\\\mu u}. Gauge invariance, via a Ward‚ÄìTakahashi identity, turns out to imply that we can renormalize the two terms of the covariant derivative piece :\\\\bar \\\\psi (\\\\partial + ieA) \\\\psi together (Pokorski 1987, p. 115), which is what happened to ; it is the same as . A term in this Lagrangian, for example, the electron- photon interaction pictured in Figure 1, can then be written :\\\\mathcal{L}_I = -e \\\\bar\\\\psi \\\\gamma_\\\\mu A^\\\\mu \\\\psi - (Z_1 - 1) e \\\\bar\\\\psi \\\\gamma_\\\\mu A^\\\\mu \\\\psi The physical constant , the electron's charge, can then be defined in terms of some specific experiment: we set the renormalization scale equal to the energy characteristic of this experiment, and the first term gives the interaction we see in the laboratory (up to small, finite corrections from loop diagrams, providing such exotica as the high-order corrections to the magnetic moment). The rest is the counterterm. If the theory is renormalizable (see below for more on this), as it is in QED, the divergent parts of loop diagrams can all be decomposed into pieces with three or fewer legs, with an algebraic form that can be canceled out by the second term (or by the similar counterterms that come from and ). The diagram with the counterterm's interaction vertex placed as in Figure 3 cancels out the divergence from the loop in Figure 2. Historically, the splitting of the \\"bare terms\\" into the original terms and counterterms came before the renormalization group insight due to Kenneth Wilson. According to such renormalization group insights, detailed in the next section, this splitting is unnatural and actually unphysical, as all scales of the problem enter in continuous systematic ways. = Running couplings = To minimize the contribution of loop diagrams to a given calculation (and therefore make it easier to extract results), one chooses a renormalization point close to the energies and momenta exchanged in the interaction. However, the renormalization point is not itself a physical quantity: the physical predictions of the theory, calculated to all orders, should in principle be independent of the choice of renormalization point, as long as it is within the domain of application of the theory. Changes in renormalization scale will simply affect how much of a result comes from Feynman diagrams without loops, and how much comes from the remaining finite parts of loop diagrams. One can exploit this fact to calculate the effective variation of physical constants with changes in scale. This variation is encoded by beta-functions, and the general theory of this kind of scale-dependence is known as the renormalization group. Colloquially, particle physicists often speak of certain physical \\"constants\\" as varying with the energy of interaction, though in fact, it is the renormalization scale that is the independent quantity. This running does, however, provide a convenient means of describing changes in the behavior of a field theory under changes in the energies involved in an interaction. For example, since the coupling in quantum chromodynamics becomes small at large energy scales, the theory behaves more like a free theory as the energy exchanged in an interaction becomes large ‚Äì a phenomenon known as asymptotic freedom. Choosing an increasing energy scale and using the renormalization group makes this clear from simple Feynman diagrams; were this not done, the prediction would be the same, but would arise from complicated high-order cancellations. For example, :I=\\\\int_0^a \\\\frac{1}{z}\\\\,dz-\\\\int_0^b \\\\frac{1}{z}\\\\,dz=\\\\ln a-\\\\ln b-\\\\ln 0 +\\\\ln 0 is ill-defined. To eliminate the divergence, simply change lower limit of integral into and : :I=\\\\ln a-\\\\ln b-\\\\ln{\\\\varepsilon_a}+\\\\ln{\\\\varepsilon_b} = \\\\ln \\\\tfrac{a}{b} - \\\\ln \\\\tfrac{\\\\varepsilon_a}{\\\\varepsilon_b} Making sure , then  Regularization  Since the quantity is ill-defined, in order to make this notion of canceling divergences precise, the divergences first have to be tamed mathematically using the theory of limits, in a process known as regularization (Weinberg, 1995). An essentially arbitrary modification to the loop integrands, or regulator, can make them drop off faster at high energies and momenta, in such a manner that the integrals converge. A regulator has a characteristic energy scale known as the cutoff; taking this cutoff to infinity (or, equivalently, the corresponding length/time scale to zero) recovers the original integrals. With the regulator in place, and a finite value for the cutoff, divergent terms in the integrals then turn into finite but cutoff-dependent terms. After canceling out these terms with the contributions from cutoff-dependent counterterms, the cutoff is taken to infinity and finite physical results recovered. If physics on scales we can measure is independent of what happens at the very shortest distance and time scales, then it should be possible to get cutoff-independent results for calculations. Many different types of regulator are used in quantum field theory calculations, each with its advantages and disadvantages. One of the most popular in modern use is dimensional regularization, invented by Gerardus 't Hooft and Martinus J. G. Veltman, which tames the integrals by carrying them into a space with a fictitious fractional number of dimensions. Another is Pauli‚ÄìVillars regularization, which adds fictitious particles to the theory with very large masses, such that loop integrands involving the massive particles cancel out the existing loops at large momenta. Yet another regularization scheme is the lattice regularization, introduced by Kenneth Wilson, which pretends that hyper-cubical lattice constructs our space-time with fixed grid size. This size is a natural cutoff for the maximal momentum that a particle could possess when propagating on the lattice. And after doing a calculation on several lattices with different grid size, the physical result is extrapolated to grid size 0, or our natural universe. This presupposes the existence of a scaling limit. A rigorous mathematical approach to renormalization theory is the so-called causal perturbation theory, where ultraviolet divergences are avoided from the start in calculations by performing well-defined mathematical operations only within the framework of distribution theory. In this approach, divergences are replaced by ambiguity: corresponding to a divergent diagram is a term which now has a finite, but undetermined, coefficient. Other principles, such as gauge symmetry, must then be used to reduce or eliminate the ambiguity. = Zeta function regularization = Julian Schwinger discovered a relationship between zeta function regularization and renormalization, using the asymptotic relation: : I(n, \\\\Lambda )= \\\\int_0^{\\\\Lambda }dp\\\\,p^n \\\\sim 1+2^n+3^n+\\\\cdots+ \\\\Lambda^n \\\\to \\\\zeta(-n) as the regulator . Based on this, he considered using the values of to get finite results. Although he reached inconsistent results, an improved formula studied by Hartle, J. Garcia, and based on the works by E. Elizalde includes the technique of the zeta regularization algorithm : I(n, \\\\Lambda) = \\\\frac{n}{2}I(n-1, \\\\Lambda) + \\\\zeta(-n) - \\\\sum_{r=1}^{\\\\infty}\\\\frac{B_{2r}}{(2r)!} a_{n,r}(n-2r+1) I(n-2r, \\\\Lambda), where the B's are the Bernoulli numbers and :a_{n,r}= \\\\frac{\\\\Gamma(n+1)}{\\\\Gamma(n-2r+2)}. So every can be written as a linear combination of . Or simply using Abel‚ÄìPlana formula we have for every divergent integral: : \\\\zeta(-m, \\\\beta )-\\\\frac{\\\\beta ^{m}}{2}-i\\\\int_ 0 ^{\\\\infty}dt \\\\frac{ (it+\\\\beta)^{m}-(-it+\\\\beta)^{m}}{e^{2 \\\\pi t}-1}=\\\\int_0^\\\\infty dp \\\\, (p+\\\\beta)^m valid when , Here the zeta function is Hurwitz zeta function and Beta is a positive real number. The \\"geometric\\" analogy is given by, (if we use rectangle method) to evaluate the integral so: : \\\\int_0^\\\\infty dx \\\\, (\\\\beta +x)^m \\\\approx \\\\sum_{n=0}^\\\\infty h^{m+1} \\\\zeta \\\\left( \\\\beta h^{-1} , -m \\\\right) Using Hurwitz zeta regularization plus the rectangle method with step h (not to be confused with Planck's constant). The logarithmic divergent integral has the regularization : \\\\sum_{n=0}^{\\\\infty} \\\\frac{1}{n+a}= - \\\\psi (a)+\\\\log (a) since for the Harmonic series \\\\sum_{n=0}^{\\\\infty} \\\\frac{1}{an+1} in the limit a \\\\to 0 we must recover the series \\\\sum_{n=0}^{\\\\infty}1 =1/2 For multi-loop integrals that will depend on several variables k_1, \\\\cdots, k_n we can make a change of variables to polar coordinates and then replace the integral over the angles \\\\int d \\\\Omega by a sum so we have only a divergent integral, that will depend on the modulus r^2 = k_1^2 +\\\\cdots+k_n^2 and then we can apply the zeta regularization algorithm, the main idea for multi-loop integrals is to replace the factor F(q_1,\\\\cdots,q_n) after a change to hyperspherical coordinates so the UV overlapping divergences are encoded in variable . In order to regularize these integrals one needs a regulator, for the case of multi-loop integrals, these regulator can be taken as : \\\\left (1+ \\\\sqrt{q}_{i}q^{i} \\\\right )^{-s} so the multi-loop integral will converge for big enough using the Zeta regularization we can analytic continue the variable to the physical limit where and then regularize any UV integral, by replacing a divergent integral by a linear combination of divergent series, which can be regularized in terms of the negative values of the Riemann zeta function .  Attitudes and interpretation  The early formulators of QED and other quantum field theories were, as a rule, dissatisfied with this state of affairs. It seemed illegitimate to do something tantamount to subtracting infinities from infinities to get finite answers. Freeman Dyson argued that these infinities are of a basic nature and cannot be eliminated by any formal mathematical procedures, such as the renormalization method. Dirac's criticism was the most persistent.P.A.M. Dirac, \\"The Evolution of the Physicist's Picture of Nature,\\" in Scientific American, May 1963, p. 53. As late as 1975, he was saying:Kragh, Helge; Dirac: A scientific biography, CUP 1990, p. 184 : Most physicists are very satisfied with the situation. They say: 'Quantum electrodynamics is a good theory and we do not have to worry about it any more.' I must say that I am very dissatisfied with the situation because this so-called 'good theory' does involve neglecting infinities which appear in its equations, ignoring them in an arbitrary way. This is just not sensible mathematics. Sensible mathematics involves disregarding a quantity when it is small ‚Äì not neglecting it just because it is infinitely great and you do not want it! Another important critic was Feynman. Despite his crucial role in the development of quantum electrodynamics, he wrote the following in 1985:Feynman, Richard P.; QED: The Strange Theory of Light and Matter, Penguin 1990, p. 128 : The shell game that we play is technically called 'renormalization'. But no matter how clever the word, it is still what I would call a dippy process! Having to resort to such hocus-pocus has prevented us from proving that the theory of quantum electrodynamics is mathematically self-consistent. It's surprising that the theory still hasn't been proved self-consistent one way or the other by now; I suspect that renormalization is not mathematically legitimate. Feynman was concerned that all field theories known in the 1960s had the property that the interactions become infinitely strong at short enough distance scales. This property called a Landau pole, made it plausible that quantum field theories were all inconsistent. In 1974, Gross, Politzer and Wilczek showed that another quantum field theory, quantum chromodynamics, does not have a Landau pole. Feynman, along with most others, accepted that QCD was a fully consistent theory. The general unease was almost universal in texts up to the 1970s and 1980s. Beginning in the 1970s, however, inspired by work on the renormalization group and effective field theory, and despite the fact that Dirac and various others‚Äîall of whom belonged to the older generation‚Äînever withdrew their criticisms, attitudes began to change, especially among younger theorists. Kenneth G. Wilson and others demonstrated that the renormalization group is useful in statistical field theory applied to condensed matter physics, where it provides important insights into the behavior of phase transitions. In condensed matter physics, a physical short-distance regulator exists: matter ceases to be continuous on the scale of atoms. Short-distance divergences in condensed matter physics do not present a philosophical problem since the field theory is only an effective, smoothed-out representation of the behavior of matter anyway; there are no infinities since the cutoff is always finite, and it makes perfect sense that the bare quantities are cutoff- dependent. If QFT holds all the way down past the Planck length (where it might yield to string theory, causal set theory or something different), then there may be no real problem with short-distance divergences in particle physics either; all field theories could simply be effective field theories. In a sense, this approach echoes the older attitude that the divergences in QFT speak of human ignorance about the workings of nature, but also acknowledges that this ignorance can be quantified and that the resulting effective theories remain useful. Be that as it may, Salam's remark in 1972 seems still relevant : Field-theoretic infinities ‚Äî first encountered in Lorentz's computation of electron self-mass ‚Äî have persisted in classical electrodynamics for seventy and in quantum electrodynamics for some thirty- five years. These long years of frustration have left in the subject a curious affection for the infinities and a passionate belief that they are an inevitable part of nature; so much so that even the suggestion of a hope that they may, after all, be circumvented ‚Äî and finite values for the renormalization constants computed ‚Äî is considered irrational. Compare Russell's postscript to the third volume of his autobiography The Final Years, 1944‚Äì1969 (George Allen and Unwin, Ltd., London 1969),Russell, Bertrand. The Autobiography of Bertrand Russell: The Final Years, 1944-1969 (Bantam Books, 1970) p. 221: :: In the modern world, if communities are unhappy, it is often because they have ignorances, habits, beliefs, and passions, which are dearer to them than happiness or even life. I find many men in our dangerous age who seem to be in love with misery and death, and who grow angry when hopes are suggested to them. They think hope is irrational and that, in sitting down to lazy despair, they are merely facing facts. In QFT, the value of a physical constant, in general, depends on the scale that one chooses as the renormalization point, and it becomes very interesting to examine the renormalization group running of physical constants under changes in the energy scale. The coupling constants in the Standard Model of particle physics vary in different ways with increasing energy scale: the coupling of quantum chromodynamics and the weak isospin coupling of the electroweak force tend to decrease, and the weak hypercharge coupling of the electroweak force tends to increase. At the colossal energy scale of 1015 GeV (far beyond the reach of our current particle accelerators), they all become approximately the same size (Grotz and Klapdor 1990, p. 254), a major motivation for speculations about grand unified theory. Instead of being only a worrisome problem, renormalization has become an important theoretical tool for studying the behavior of field theories in different regimes. If a theory featuring renormalization (e.g. QED) can only be sensibly interpreted as an effective field theory, i.e. as an approximation reflecting human ignorance about the workings of nature, then the problem remains of discovering a more accurate theory that does not have these renormalization problems. As Lewis Ryder has put it, \\"In the Quantum Theory, these [classical] divergences do not disappear; on the contrary, they appear to get worse. And despite the comparative success of renormalisation theory, the feeling remains that there ought to be a more satisfactory way of doing things.\\"Ryder, Lewis. Quantum Field Theory, page 390 (Cambridge University Press 1996).  Renormalizability  From this philosophical reassessment, a new concept follows naturally: the notion of renormalizability. Not all theories lend themselves to renormalization in the manner described above, with a finite supply of counterterms and all quantities becoming cutoff-independent at the end of the calculation. If the Lagrangian contains combinations of field operators of high enough dimension in energy units, the counterterms required to cancel all divergences proliferate to infinite number, and, at first glance, the theory would seem to gain an infinite number of free parameters and therefore lose all predictive power, becoming scientifically worthless. Such theories are called nonrenormalizable. The Standard Model of particle physics contains only renormalizable operators, but the interactions of general relativity become nonrenormalizable operators if one attempts to construct a field theory of quantum gravity in the most straightforward manner (treating the metric in the Einstein‚ÄìHilbert Lagrangian as a perturbation about the Minkowski metric), suggesting that perturbation theory is useless in application to quantum gravity. However, in an effective field theory, \\"renormalizability\\" is, strictly speaking, a misnomer. In nonrenormalizable effective field theory, terms in the Lagrangian do multiply to infinity, but have coefficients suppressed by ever-more-extreme inverse powers of the energy cutoff. If the cutoff is a real, physical quantity‚Äîthat is, if the theory is only an effective description of physics up to some maximum energy or minimum distance scale‚Äîthen these additional terms could represent real physical interactions. Assuming that the dimensionless constants in the theory do not get too large, one can group calculations by inverse powers of the cutoff, and extract approximate predictions to finite order in the cutoff that still have a finite number of free parameters. It can even be useful to renormalize these \\"nonrenormalizable\\" interactions. Nonrenormalizable interactions in effective field theories rapidly become weaker as the energy scale becomes much smaller than the cutoff. The classic example is the Fermi theory of the weak nuclear force, a nonrenormalizable effective theory whose cutoff is comparable to the mass of the W particle. This fact may also provide a possible explanation for why almost all of the particle interactions we see are describable by renormalizable theories. It may be that any others that may exist at the GUT or Planck scale simply become too weak to detect in the realm we can observe, with one exception: gravity, whose exceedingly weak interaction is magnified by the presence of the enormous masses of stars and planets.  Renormalization schemes  In actual calculations, the counterterms introduced to cancel the divergences in Feynman diagram calculations beyond tree level must be fixed using a set of renormalisation conditions. The common renormalization schemes in use include: * Minimal subtraction (MS) scheme and the related modified minimal subtraction (MS-bar) scheme * On-shell scheme  Renormalization in statistical physics  =History= A deeper understanding of the physical meaning and generalization of the renormalization process, which goes beyond the dilatation group of conventional renormalizable theories, came from condensed matter physics. Leo P. Kadanoff's paper in 1966 proposed the \\"block-spin\\" renormalization group.L.P. Kadanoff (1966): \\"Scaling laws for Ising models near T_c\\", Physics (Long Island City, N.Y.) 2, 263. The blocking idea is a way to define the components of the theory at large distances as aggregates of components at shorter distances. This approach covered the conceptual point and was given full computational substance in the extensive important contributions of Kenneth Wilson. The power of Wilson's ideas was demonstrated by a constructive iterative renormalization solution of a long-standing problem, the Kondo problem, in 1974, as well as the preceding seminal developments of his new method in the theory of second-order phase transitions and critical phenomena in 1971. He was awarded the Nobel prize for these decisive contributions in 1982. =Principles= In more technical terms, let us assume that we have a theory described by a certain function Z of the state variables \\\\\\\\{s_i\\\\\\\\} and a certain set of coupling constants \\\\\\\\{J_k\\\\\\\\}. This function may be a partition function, an action, a Hamiltonian, etc. It must contain the whole description of the physics of the system. Now we consider a certain blocking transformation of the state variables \\\\\\\\{s_i\\\\\\\\}\\\\to \\\\\\\\{\\\\tilde s_i\\\\\\\\}, the number of \\\\tilde s_i must be lower than the number of s_i. Now let us try to rewrite the Z function only in terms of the \\\\tilde s_i. If this is achievable by a certain change in the parameters, \\\\\\\\{J_k\\\\\\\\}\\\\to \\\\\\\\{\\\\tilde J_k\\\\\\\\}, then the theory is said to be renormalizable. The possible macroscopic states of the system, at a large scale, are given by this set of fixed points. =Renormalization group fixed points= The most important information in the RG flow is its fixed points. A fixed point is defined by the vanishing of the beta function associated to the flow. Then, fixed points of the renormalization group are by definition scale invariant. In many cases of physical interest scale invariance enlarges to conformal invariance. One then has a conformal field theory at the fixed point. The ability of several theories to flow to the same fixed point leads to universality. If these fixed points correspond to free field theory, the theory is said to exhibit quantum triviality. Numerous fixed points appear in the study of lattice Higgs theories, but the nature of the quantum field theories associated with these remains an open question.

This emulator enabled running applications and system code that were originally written for the 680x0-based Macintosh models. With a few exceptions, notably Connectix's RAM Doubler, the emulator ran all software with no noticeable impact other than lower performance relative to the same program when compiled for PowerPC. Origins The first version was written by Gary Davidian, who had originally created it for use on the Motorola 88000 CPU, used in Apple's abortive first attempt at a RISC target platform. A later version, using dynamic recompilation, was developed by Eric Traut, who later worked on successful emulation projects at Connectix such as Virtual Game Station and Virtual PC. Prior to Traut's arrival there, Connectix had released Speed Doubler, which included an even faster PowerPC 68k emulator. Implementation All versions of this emulator emulated the \\"user\\" subset of the 68EC040 instruction set with a 68020/68030 exception stack frame. Apple developer documents indicate that the emulator provided an operating environment most closely resembling that of the Macintosh Centris 610, a system based on the Motorola 68LC040 microprocessor. Early versions emulated it by decoding each instruction and immediately carrying out a series of equivalent PowerPC instructions. For the PCI PowerMacs, the dynamic recompilation emulator was used to boost performance. Dynamic recompilation works by \\"recompiling\\" common sections of the code into faster, PowerPC-native, sequences that were locally cached. The emulator could recognise the same sequence of 680x0 code and run the previously-cached PowerPC code to avoid doing the translation again. This emulator was theoretically capable of emulating 680x0 code faster than any real 680x0 was capable of running it. The 68LC040 had no floating point instructions, making this feat slightly simpler but no less impressive. One reason that this emulation was so successful is that many of the APIs for the Mac OS were originally implemented as traps on the 680x0 processor; therefore, calling an API actually was recognised by the 680x0 as the equivalent of an error condition, which would cause it to handle that error through one of its hardware vectors. In turn, this vector would look up and run the operating system routine from ROM or RAM. In the emulator, such traps could be replaced by native PowerPC code, so the only code being emulated was the application itself, and any system API it called could be accelerated with native PowerPC code. This also allowed Apple time to port the OS to the PowerPC. At first only time-critical aspects were rewritten in native code, leaving much of the OS emulated. Gradually most of the OS was rewritten to be native, so the OS got faster over time. For the programmer, the transition to the PowerPC was made fairly painless, because the emulator was started and stopped automatically. This was achieved using a new type of pointer called a Universal Procedure Pointer (UPP). For 68k code, this pointer appeared to be an ordinary pointer to code and could be used as such. However, it actually led to a data structure which contained a special trap instruction and flags indicating the instruction set architecture (ISA) of the called code. From PowerPC code, this UPP could be passed to the CallUniversalProc( ) function to call it. The 68k emulator then dealt with details such as presenting passed parameters in the right order for the ISA in question, as well as starting and stopping the emulator as required. The compilers for Mac OS created such UPPs automatically when the proper macros were used, and the PowerPC system libraries contained native stubs to transparently call through to native or still-68k functions as needed. This meant that dealing with the dual architecture required very little work for the programmer, and just like the OS, applications themselves could mix and match 680x0 and PowerPC code fairly easily. Current status Because it was built into all PowerPC versions of the classic Mac OS, the emulator was also part of the Classic environment in Mac OS X. PowerPC Macintosh emulators such as SheepShaver therefore use the emulator as well when running the classic Mac OS. Native Mac OS X outside of Classic never used the emulator.

Description The English Shepherd is a medium-sized breed of dog, it weighs between and stands between , dogs are typically larger than bitches. The breed has a long, straight or wavy double coat with feathering on the legs and tail, traditionally it has four different color combinations, black and white, black and tan, sable and white or tricolor (black, white and tan), although shades of fawn and red tan to white are also seen in the breed. According to the breed standard, the coat may be straight, wavy or curly, except on the face, skull and front of legs where it is short and smooth. History The progenitors of the English Shepherd were collies of various types brought to the New World by early settlers from Britain and Ireland, as such it shares ancestry with the modern Border Collie, Scotch Collie and Australian Shepherd. The ancestors of the English Shepherd were used extensively on farms throughout the eastern states, principally as a sheep and cattle herder, although it also performed the roles of watchdog, ratter and companion. The United Kennel Club (UKC) has been registering English Shepherds since 1927, originally the UKC called the breed the American Farm Shepherd but in 2003 renamed it the English Shepherd. The breed is not recognized by the American Kennel Club.

Pre-eclampsia is a disorder of pregnancy in which there is high blood pressure and either large amounts of protein in the urine or other organ dysfunction. Onset may be before, during, or after delivery. Most often it is during the second half of pregnancy. The seizures are of the tonic‚Äìclonic type and typically last about a minute. Following the seizure there is typically either a period of confusion or coma. Complications include aspiration pneumonia, cerebral hemorrhage, kidney failure, pulmonary oedema, HELLP syndrome, coagulopathy, abruptio placentae and cardiac arrest. Pre-eclampsia and eclampsia are part of a larger group of conditions known as hypertensive disorders of pregnancy. Recommendations for prevention include aspirin in those at high risk, calcium supplementation in areas with low intake, and treatment of prior hypertension with medications. Exercise during pregnancy may also be useful. The use of intravenous or intramuscular magnesium sulfate improves outcomes in those with eclampsia and is generally safe. This is true in both the developed and developing world. Breathing may need to be supported. Other treatments may include blood pressure medications such as hydralazine and emergency delivery of the baby either vaginally or by cesarean section. Pre-eclampsia is estimated to affect about 5% of deliveries while eclampsia affects about 1.4% of deliveries. In the developed world rates are about 1 in 2,000 deliveries due to improved medical care. Hypertensive disorders of pregnancy are one of the most common causes of death in pregnancy. They resulted in 46,900 deaths in 2015. Around one percent of women with eclampsia die. The word eclampsia is from the Greek term for lightning. The first known description of the condition was by Hippocrates in the 5th century BC. Signs and symptoms Diagram of the regions (or quadrants) of the abdomen, to assist in locating the right upper quadrant or the epigastric region, where eclampsia-associated pain may occur Eclampsia is a disorder of pregnancy characterized by seizures in the setting of pre-eclampsia. Typically the pregnant woman develops hypertension and proteinuria before the onset of a convulsion (seizure). * Long-lasting (persistent) headaches * Blurred vision * Photophobia (i.e. bright light causes discomfort) * Abdominal pain **Either in the epigastric region (the center of the abdomen above the navel, or belly- button) ** And/or in the right upper quadrant of the abdomen (below the right side of the rib cage) * Altered mental status (confusion) Any of these symptoms may present before or after a seizure occurs. It is also possible that none of these symptoms will develop. Other cerebral signs may immediately precede the convulsion, such as nausea, vomiting, headaches, and cortical blindness. If the complication of multi-organ failure ensues, signs and symptoms of those failing organs will appear, such as abdominal pain, jaundice, shortness of breath, and diminished urine output. = Onset = The seizures of eclampsia typically present during pregnancy and prior to delivery (the antepartum period), but may also occur during labor and delivery (the intrapartum period) or after the baby has been delivered (the postpartum period). If postpartum seizures develop, it is most likely to occur within the first 48 hours after delivery. However, late postpartum seizures of eclampsia may occur as late as 4 weeks after delivery. = Complications= There are risks to both the mother and the fetus when eclampsia occurs. The fetus may grow more slowly than normal within the womb (uterus) of a woman with eclampsia, which is termed intrauterine growth restriction and may result in the child appearing small for gestational age or being born with low birth weight. Eclampsia may cause problems with the placenta to occur. The placenta may bleed (hemorrhage) or it may begin to separate from the wall of the uterus. It is normal for the placenta to separate from the uterine wall during delivery, but it is abnormal for it to separate prior to delivery; this condition is called placental abruption and can be dangerous for the fetus. Placental insufficiency may also occur, a state in which the placenta fails to support appropriate fetal development because it cannot deliver the necessary amount of oxygen or nutrients to the fetus. During an eclamptic seizure, the beating of the fetal heart may become slower than normal (bradycardia). If any of these complications occurs, fetal distress may develop. Treatment of the mother's seizures may also manage fetal bradycardia. If the risk to the health of the fetus or the mother is high, the definitive treatment for eclampsia is delivery of the baby. Delivery by cesarean section may be deemed necessary, especially if the instance of fetal bradycardia does not resolve after 10 to 15 minutes of resuscitative interventions. It may be safer to deliver the infant preterm than to wait for the full 40 weeks of fetal development to finish, and as a result prematurity is also a potential complication of eclampsia. In the mother, changes in vision may occur as a result of eclampsia, and these changes may include blurry vision, one-sided blindness (either temporary due to amaurosis fugax or potentially permanent due to retinal detachment), or cortical blindness, which affects the vision from both eyes. There are also potential complications in the lungs. The woman may have fluid slowly collecting in the lungs in a process known as pulmonary edema. During an eclamptic seizure, it is possible for a person to vomit the contents of the stomach and to inhale some of this material in a process known as aspiration. If aspiration occurs, the woman may experience difficulty breathing immediately or could develop an infection in the lungs later, called aspiration pneumonia. It is also possible that during a seizure breathing will stop temporarily or become inefficient, and the amount of oxygen reaching the woman's body and brain will be decreased (in a state known as hypoxia). If it becomes difficult for the woman to breathe, she may need to have her breathing temporarily supported by an assistive device in a process called mechanical ventilation. In some severe eclampsia cases, the mother may become weak and sluggish (lethargy) or even comatose. These may be signs that the brain is swelling (cerebral edema) or bleeding (intracerebral hemorrhage). Risk factors Eclampsia, like pre-eclampsia, tends to occur more commonly in first pregnancies. Women who have long term high blood pressure before becoming pregnant have a greater risk of pre-eclampsia. Furthermore, women with other pre-existing vascular diseases (diabetes or nephropathy) or thrombophilic diseases such as the antiphospholipid syndrome are at higher risk to develop pre-eclampsia and eclampsia. Having a large placenta (multiple gestation, hydatidiform mole) also predisposes women to eclampsia. In addition, there is a genetic component: a woman whose mother or sister had the condition is at higher risk than otherwise. Women who have experienced eclampsia are at increased risk for pre-eclampsia/eclampsia in a later pregnancy. Mechanism Diagram of the placenta and its position in the uterus during pregnancyImage of a placenta after delivery The presence of a placenta is required, and eclampsia resolves if it is removed. Reduced blood flow to the placenta (placental hypoperfusion) is a key feature of the process. It is accompanied by increased sensitivity of the maternal vasculature to agents which cause constriction of the small arteries, leading to reduced blood flow to multiple organs. Also, an activation of the coagulation cascade may lead to microthrombi formation, which can further impair blood flow. Thirdly, increased vascular permeability results in the shift of extracellular fluid from the blood to the interstitial space, with further reduction in blood flow, and edema. These events lead to hypertension; renal, pulmonary, and hepatic dysfunction; and cerebral edema with cerebral dysfunction and convulsions. Before symptoms appear, increased platelet and endothelial activation may be detected. Placental hypoperfusion is linked to abnormal modelling of the fetal‚Äìmaternal placental interface that may be immunologically mediated. The invasion of the trophoblast appears to be incomplete. The placenta produces the potent vasodilator adrenomedullin: it is reduced in pre-eclampsia and eclampsia. Other vasodilators are also reduced, including prostacyclin, thromboxane A2, nitric oxide, and endothelins, also leading to vasoconstriction. Eclampsia is a form of hypertensive encephalopathy: cerebral vascular resistance is reduced, leading to increased blood flow to the brain, cerebral edema and resultant convulsions. An eclamptic convulsion usually does not cause chronic brain damage unless intracranial haemorrhage occurs. Diagnosis The hallmark symptom of eclampsia is a seizure, and the steps for diagnosing eclampsia depend on what is already known at the time when the seizure occurs. If a pregnant woman has already been diagnosed with pre-eclampsia during the current pregnancy and then develops a seizure, she may be assigned a 'clinical diagnosis' of eclampsia without further workup. This means that a diagnosis of eclampsia is most likely given the symptoms and medical history, and eclampsia can be assumed to be the correct diagnosis until proven otherwise. However, if a woman has a seizure and it is unknown whether or not she has pre-eclampsia, testing can help make the diagnosis clear. = Vital signs = One of the core features of pre-eclampsia is high blood pressure. Blood pressure is a measurement of two numbers. If either the top number (systolic blood pressure) is greater than 140 mmHg or the bottom number (diastolic blood pressure) is greater than 90 mmHg, then the blood pressure is higher than the normal range and the person has high blood pressure. If the systolic blood pressure is greater than 160 or the diastolic pressure is greater than 110, the hypertension is considered to be severe. = Laboratory testing = Another core feature of pre-eclampsia is proteinuria, which is the presence of excess protein in the urine. To determine if proteinuria is present, the urine can be collected and tested for protein; if there is 0.3 grams of protein or more in the urine of a pregnant woman collected over 24 hours, this is one of the diagnostic criteria for pre-eclampsia and raises the suspicion that a seizure is due to eclampsia. In cases of severe eclampsia or pre-eclampsia, the level of platelets in the blood can be low in a condition termed thrombocytopenia. A complete blood count, or CBC, is a test of the blood that can be performed to check platelet levels. Other investigations include: kidney function test, liver function tests (LFT), coagulation screen, 24-hour urine creatinine, and fetal/placental ultrasound. = Differential diagnosis= Convulsions during pregnancy that are unrelated to pre-eclampsia need to be distinguished from eclampsia. Such disorders include seizure disorders as well as brain tumor, aneurysm of the brain, and medication- or drug-related seizures. Usually, the presence of the signs of severe pre-eclampsia precede and accompany eclampsia, facilitating the diagnosis. Prevention Detection and management of pre- eclampsia is critical to reduce the risk of eclampsia. The USPSTF recommends regular checking of blood pressure through pregnancy in order to detect preeclampsia. Appropriate management of women with pre-eclampsia generally involves the use of magnesium sulfate to prevent convulsions. Treatment The four goals of the treatment of eclampsia are to stop and prevent further convulsions, to control the elevated blood pressure, to deliver the baby as promptly as possible, and to monitor closely for the onset of multi-organ failure. =Convulsions= Convulsions are prevented and treated using magnesium sulfate. The study demonstrating the effectiveness of magnesium sulfate for the management of eclampsia was first published in 1955. Serum magnesium concentrations associated with maternal toxicity as well as neonatal respiratory depression, low muscle tone, and low Apgar scores are: * 7.0‚Äì10.0 mEq/L: loss of patellar reflex * 10.0‚Äì13.0 mEq/L: respiratory depression * 15.0‚Äì25.0 mEq/L: altered atrioventricular conduction and (further) complete heart block * >25.0 mEq/L: cardiac arrest With intravenous administration, the onset of anticonvulsant action is fast and lasts about 30 minutes. Following intramuscular administration the onset of action is about one hour and lasts for three to four hours. Effective anticonvulsant serum levels range from 2.5 to 7.5 mEq/liter. Magnesium is excreted solely by the kidneys at a rate proportional to the plasma concentration and glomerular filtration. Even with therapeutic serum magnesium concentrations, recurrent convulsions may occur, and additional magnesium may be needed, but with close monitoring for respiratory, cardiac, and neurological depression. If magnesium administration with resultant high serum concentrations fail to control convulsions, the addition of other intravenous anticonvulsants may be used, facilitate intubation and mechanical ventilation, and to avoid magnesium toxicity including maternal thoracic muscle paralysis. Magnesium sulfate results in better outcomes than diazepam, phenytoin or a combination of chlorpromazine, promethazine, and pethidine. =Blood pressure management= Blood pressure control is used to prevent stroke, which accounts for 15 to 20 percent of deaths in women with eclampsia. The agents of choice for blood pressure control during eclampsia are hydralazine or labetalol. This is because of their effectiveness, lack of negative effects on the fetus, and mechanism of action. Blood pressure management is indicated with a diastolic blood pressure above 105‚Äì110 mm Hg. =Delivery= If the baby has not yet been delivered, steps need to be taken to stabilize the woman and deliver her speedily. This needs to be done even if the baby is immature, as the eclamptic condition is unsafe for both baby and mother. As eclampsia is a manifestation of a type of non-infectious multiorgan dysfunction or failure, other organs (liver, kidney, lungs, cardiovascular system, and coagulation system) need to be assessed in preparation for a delivery (often a caesarean section), unless the woman is already in advanced labor. Regional anesthesia for caesarean section is contraindicated when a coagulopathy has developed. There is limited to no evidence in favor of a particular delivery method for women with eclampsia. Therefore, the delivery method of choice is an individualized decision. =Monitoring= Invasive hemodynamic monitoring may be elected in an eclamptic woman at risk for or with heart disease, kidney disease, refractory hypertension, pulmonary edema, or poor urine output. Etymology The Greek noun , eklamps√≠a, denotes a \\"light burst\\"; metaphorically, in this context, \\"sudden occurrence.\\" The New Latin term first appeared in Johannes Varandaeus‚Äô 1620 treatise on gynaecology Tractatus de affectibus Renum et Vesicae. The term toxemia of pregnancy is no longer recommended: placental toxins are not the cause of eclampsia occurrences, as previously believed.FAQ: Toxemia at the Pre-Eclampsia Foundation website Popular culture In Downton Abbey, a historical drama television series, the character Lady Sybil dies (in series 3, episode 5) of eclampsia shortly after child birth. In Call the Midwife, a medical drama television series set in London in the 1950s and 1960s, the character (in series 1, episode 4) named Margaret Jones is struck with pre- eclampsia, ultimately proceeding from a comatose condition to death. The term \\"toxemia\\" was also used for the condition, in the dialogue. In House M.D., a medical drama television series set in the U.S., Dr. Cuddy, the hospital director, adopts a baby whose teenage mother dies from eclampsia and had no other parental figures available.

Lattices such as this are used - for example - in the Flory‚ÄìHuggins solution theory In physics, a lattice model is a physical model that is defined on a lattice, as opposed to the continuum of space or spacetime. Lattice models originally occurred in the context of condensed matter physics, where the atoms of a crystal automatically form a lattice. Currently, lattice models are quite popular in theoretical physics, for many reasons. Some models are exactly solvable, and thus offer insight into physics beyond what can be learned from perturbation theory. Lattice models are also ideal for study by the methods of computational physics, as the discretization of any continuum model automatically turns it into a lattice model. Examples of lattice models in condensed matter physics include the Ising model, the Potts model, the XY model, the Toda lattice. The exact solution to many of these models (when they are solvable) includes the presence of solitons. Techniques for solving these include the inverse scattering transform and the method of Lax pairs, the Yang‚ÄìBaxter equation and quantum groups. The solution of these models has given insights into the nature of phase transitions, magnetization and scaling behaviour, as well as insights into the nature of quantum field theory. Physical lattice models frequently occur as an approximation to a continuum theory, either to give an ultraviolet cutoff to the theory to prevent divergences or to perform numerical computations. An example of a continuum theory that is widely studied by lattice models is the QCD lattice model, a discretization of quantum chromodynamics. However, digital physics considers nature fundamentally discrete at the Planck scale, which imposes upper limit to the density of information, aka Holographic principle. More generally, lattice gauge theory and lattice field theory are areas of study. Lattice models are also used to simulate the structure and dynamics of polymers. Examples include the bond fluctuation model and the 2nd model.

An audience is a formal meeting that takes place between a head of state and another person at the invitation of the head of state. Often, the invitation follows a request for a meeting from the other person. Though sometimes used in republics to describe meetings with presidents, the term is more usually associated with monarchs and popes. Holy See In the past, rigid dress codes had to be followed by those granted a papal audience. For a general audience, smart business professional attire (technically, informal wear, that is, a suit and tie or equivalent for ladies) was acceptable. The suit was to be dark, and ladies would ideally not wear slacks anywhere in the Vatican. Private audiences, however, were a much more formal affair. Ladies were to wear a long (well below the knees), black dress, with a matching hat or other head covering and veil. Exceptions were made for Catholic queens who by dispensation could wear white (privil√®ge du blanc). Gentlemen were to wear a correct morning suit, either black or very dark gray with the traditional striped trousers, patent leather shoes, and cutaway. An ascot or equivalent formal tie would be worn with a gray waistcoat over a white dress shirt with arrow collars. If any part of the audience were to occur outdoors, a black top hat would be worn. If the function were entirely indoors, then the hat was optional for men. Both gentlemen and ladies were to wear dress gloves. Evening functions were usually white tie. Formal dress is now normally reserved for diplomatic audiences. In the 1990s, an Irish Catholic priest provoked a controversy by claiming that the president of his country, Mary Robinson, had breached protocol by wearing jewellery and by not wearing black nor a mantilla for an audience with Pope John Paul II. The Vatican subsequently pointed out that the traditional form of dress worn for papal audiences was no longer obligatory. Modern popes grant large audiences to crowds in St. Peter's Square or the Paul VI Audience Hall. United Kingdom In the United Kingdom, audiences with the British monarch are usually listed in the Court Circular, which is published daily by the broadsheet press. The British Prime Minister has a weekly audience with Elizabeth II, usually every Wednesday, during parliamentary time at Buckingham Palace. Denmark In the Kingdom of Denmark, public audiences with the Queen usually take place every other Monday at Christiansborg Palace. An invitation is not required for the public audiences. Private audiences of the Queen with heads of state, heads of government, parliamentary delegations, leaders of international organisations and military leaders are usually held at the residence palace of the Monarch at Amalienborg Palace.

This is an 1875 replacement for a statue damaged in the French Revolution. Tancred of Hauteville (c. 980 - 1041) was an 11th-century Norman petty lord about whom little is known. He was a minor noble near Coutances in the Cotentin. Tancred is also known by the achievements of his twelve sons. Various legends arose about Tancred which have no supporting contemporary evidence that has survived the ages.

In 1983, at age 16, she began appearing as a topless model on Page 3 of British tabloid newspaper The Sun, and continued as a Page 3 girl until 1986. During this time, she became the most popular pin-up girl of her era, as well as one of the most photographed British women of the 1980s. In 1986, she launched a pop music career with her debut single \\"Touch Me (I Want Your Body)\\", which peaked at number-one in 17 countries. Fox had three songs reach the top 10 on the Billboard Hot 100 including Touch Me (I Want Your Body), Naughty Girls (Need Love Too) and I Wanna Have Some Fun. In 1988, Fox received a Brit Award nomination for Best British Female Artist. She has also appeared in a number of films and reality television shows, and has occasionally worked as a television presenter. Early life Samantha Fox is the elder daughter of actress Carole Ann Wilken and John Patrick Fox. Her sister is Vanessa and she has two half-siblings from her father's second marriage, Frederica and Frankie. Fox comes from a family of market traders. Fox attended St Thomas More Catholic School, Wood Green and took an interest in the theatre from an early age. She first appeared on a theatre stage at age 3, formed her first pop band with Richard Smart, Edward Gallagher, and Bob Day when she was fourteen years old. She was enrolled in the Anna Scher Theatre School from age 15. The next year she got her first record deal, with Lamborghini Records. Career =Modelling and music= In 1983, when Fox was 16, she released her first single. Released on the Lamborghini Records label, \\"Rockin' With My Radio\\"/\\"My Old Man\\" was produced by Ian Gillan Band and Spencer Davis Group member Ray Fenwick, who also wrote the b-side. The collaboration with Fenwick continued into 1984 and her second single, \\"Aim to Win\\"/\\"17 and Holding\\", where he again produced and wrote the song on the b-side. Also, in 1983, her mother submitted several photographs that she had taken of her daughter in lingerie to The Sunday People newspaper's Girl of the Year amateur modelling contest. Alt URL She came in second place out of 20,000 entrants and the photographs drew her to the attention of the newspaper The Sun, which invited her to pose for Page 3. Her parents gave their consent for her to pose topless, and her first Page 3 photograph appeared in the Sun on 22 February 1983. She signed a four-year Page 3 modelling contract with the Sun, and won its \\"Page 3 Girl of the Year\\" award for three consecutive years: 1984 to 1986. She is recognised today as the most popular pin-up girl of her era, as well as one of the most-photographed British women of the 1980s. In 1986, Fox retired from Page 3 modelling, at the age of 20, and transitioned into a career in pop music. In 1995, aged 29, she made a one-off appearance in The Sun to promote Page 3's 25th anniversary. After receiving an overwhelmingly positive reader response, she appeared in the slot every day of that week, with Friday's final topless picture given away as an A3-sized poster. The following year, she appeared in the October issue of Playboy magazine.Gallery of various 1996 issues of Playboy featuring Fox at playboycoverarchive.com In December 2009, her latest compilation album was issued, Greatest Hits, both in single CD and double CD formats.

The school's total enrollment of 3,200 makes it the largest public high school in Montgomery County and Maryland as a whole. The school was named after Montgomery Blair, a lawyer who represented Dred Scott in his Supreme Court case, and later served as Postmaster General under President Abraham Lincoln. After opening in 1925 as Takoma Park-Silver Spring High School, the Blair name was adopted in 1935 when the school moved to a location overlooking Sligo Creek at 313 Wayne Avenue. In 1998, the campus moved again two miles (3 km) north to the Kay Tract, a long-vacant site adjacent to the Capital Beltway, and the old building was repurposed to house Silver Spring International Middle School and Sligo Creek Elementary School. About 15% of the student body is part of one of two magnet programs: the Science, Math, and Computer Science Magnet, and the Communication Arts Program (CAP), which draw students from both the Silver Spring area and across Montgomery County, and make up approximately 20% of Blair's student population. It is a member of the National Consortium for Specialized Secondary Schools of Mathematics, Science and Technology (NCSSSMST). Prior to the 2010 U.S. Census the school was within the Silver Spring census-designated place, but as of 2015 it now resides in the Four Corners CDP.\\"2010 CENSUS - CENSUS BLOCK MAP: Four Corners CDP, MD\\" (Archive).

Detail 1 (Archive), Detail 2 (Archive) History =Philadelphia- Chicago Campus Era (1925‚Äì1935)= Montgomery Blair High School, then known as Takoma-Silver Spring High School, became the first high school to serve Silver Spring, Maryland when it opened in 1925 with 86 students. The campus was located at the corner of Philadelphia Avenue and Chicago Avenue in suburban Takoma Park, Maryland. By the end of the 1920s the school had expanded to host students in eighth and ninth grades, who attended the school's junior high school, as well as tenth, eleventh, and twelfth grades, who attended the school's senior high school. As Silver Spring and Takoma Park continued to rapidly grow, the school eventually encompassed all levels from kindergarten to twelfth grade. By 1934, the school was over-capacity with a total enrollment of 450 students, and so, in September 1935, the tenth, eleventh, and twelfth grades relocated to a new high school named Montgomery Blair Senior High School, also known as the Wayne Avenue Campus. During the transition period, students, teachers, and administrators had to commute between the two campuses and created the annual yearbook, Silverlogue. =Wayne Avenue Campus Era (1935‚Äì1998)= When Montgomery Blair High School's Wayne Avenue campus opened in March 1935, it was the sixth high school in Montgomery County, and the first in the lower county. One of several Montgomery County schools designed during that period by Howard Wright Cutler, the facility then consisted only of the C building, overlooking Sligo Creek. In 1936, the Auxiliary Gymnasium was added, followed by the B building in 1940, and the D building in 1942. MBHS's first football team was founded in 1944, and the War Memorial Stadium opened in 1947. In 1950, the A building was constructed, containing the Blair Library/Media Center. With the addition of the Main Gymnasium/Fieldhouse in 1954, MBHS possessed one of the finest basketball and football facilities in the county. The E building was added in 1959 as an administrative section, followed by the 1969 opening of the 1200-seat auditorium, named for long-time teacher and librarian, Elizabeth Stickley. The most recent addition was the automotive shop building in 1973. During World War II, students from the University of Maryland taught several classes, and in some cases, able senior students taught sophomore classes. The Blair Library created the \\"Senior Corner\\" to honor those who had not returned from war. Life Magazine featured the school's Victory Corps close order drill team. Prior to the Supreme Court decision in Brown v. Board of Education, Blair was an all-white school. In 1955, the school began to integrate along with the rest of Montgomery County. With Silver Spring's growth, Blair's enrollment jumped from 600 students in 1946, to 1900 by 1956, peaking at 2900 in 1965 before being reduced from 1700 to 1400 after re-zoning in 1982. Enrollment was around 1800 when the Science, Mathematics, and Computer Science Magnet program brought 80 new students in the fall of 1985. The Communication Arts Program (CAP) followed in 1987, founded by Alicia Coleman, brought 75 new students. Overcrowding became an issue for Montgomery Blair High School, as portable buildings covered what was once open land and enrollment exceeded the building's capacity of 2,000. In 1994, it was decided that the school should relocate to an empty tract of land to the north. Construction began on the Kay Tract in the mid-nineties and the Four Corners Campus opened in the fall of 1998. After the move, Blair's Wayne Avenue campus converted into a combination Elementary/Middle School; currently Sligo Creek Elementary School and Silver Spring International Middle School each take up half the campus. The Elizabeth Stickley Auditorium, however, was not included in the conversion plans, and has remained closed since 1997. Nevertheless, the auditorium has received a significant amount of attention throughout the region as it has fallen into disrepair. Several local politicians and leaders, including former Maryland state senator Ida Ruben, current U.S. representative Jamie Raskin and former U.S. Senator Barbara Mikulski, have endorsed projects to restore the auditorium to its former condition. The Blair Cupola and Steeple at the Four Corners Campus =Four Corners Campus Era (1998‚Äìpresent)= Montgomery Blair High School remained at the Wayne Avenue Campus for over six decades until its 1998 move to the current Four Corners Campus at the intersection of University Boulevard, Colesville Road, and the Capital Beltway. When it opened, the new facilities were the largest in the county, spanning a region, which was nearly twice as large as the old Wayne Avenue site. During the early- to mid- 2000s, the school population spiked to its highest in history at approximately 3,400 students, rivaling that of some community colleges. Although enrollment has since receded to about 2,900 students, the school still has the largest student population in the county. The 2008 year marked a technological breakthrough for MBHS, as interactive digital Promethean boards were installed in many classrooms. =Notable events= In April 1992, Montgomery Blair High School was the first high school in the nation to initiate and sponsor a display of the NAMES Project AIDS Memorial Quilt.

Bush and Blair alumnus Ben Stein ('62) attend a political event held at Blair. It has been a popular stop for many politicians because of the school's diversity, strong academic programs, and proximity to the nation's capital. On February 5, 1998, President Bill Clinton and UK Prime Minister Tony Blair stopped at Montgomery Blair High School during a state visit. On March 7, 2003, United States Secretary of Homeland Security Tom Ridge and Secretary of Education Rod Paige visited Blair. On June 23, 2005, President George W. Bush visited the school to discuss his plan to partially privatize Social Security. Students were not permitted to attend. Bush's presence at the school drew approximately 400 protesters, who, despite the last-minute announcement of the visit, questioned both his proposed policies and the fact that this town hall-style meeting was not open to the general public. The demonstration included community members, students and union members. The police tried to move the demonstration to a park more than a block away, but protesters pointed out that there was no reason they couldn't continue their peaceful protest on the public sidewalk outside the fence around the school. During the 2010‚Äì2011 school year, NBA Hall of Famer Kareem Abdul-Jabbar spoke to a packed auditorium of students about his upcoming film and about his life and struggle to become the basketball player he became. Abdul-Jabbar then spoke privately with both the varsity and junior varsity basketball teams before posing for photos and signing a few autographs. On June 1, 2016, Secretary of State John Kerry visited Blair to discuss ocean conservation. On February 26, 2018, U.S. Congressmen Jamie Raskin and Ted Deutch brought survivors of the Stoneman Douglas High School shooting to Blair to meet with Blair students. Campus Aerial photograph of Four Corners Campus The current campus of Montgomery Blair High School covers forty-two acres between the Capital Beltway, U.S. Route 29, and Maryland Route 193 in Silver Spring's Four Corners neighborhood. The school contains of space and was originally designed for 2,830 students. Eight years after its completion, the school was more than 500 students over capacity, with a population of about 3,400. As a result, the school at one point had eight auxiliary portable classrooms. Population has decreased slightly due to the opening of other schools and the Downcounty Consortium, and as a result 2 portables were removed at the beginning of the 2006‚Äì2007 school year. As of April 2010, the enrollment at Blair is 2,788, and the portable classrooms have been removed. Blair remains the county's largest school. A sundial was added to the school's main courtyard in March 2006 The school has baseball and softball fields to the east of the main building as well as Blazer Stadium which serves as the home of the school's football, soccer, field hockey, and lacrosse teams. There are three courtyards located throughout the main building. A greenhouse and accompanying patio is located on the second floor on the west side of the main building for the use of horticulture classes. The school building contains a 750-seat auditorium. The main hallway of the school, 'Blair Boulevard\\" displays flags from many countries, representing its extremely diverse student body. In the school year of 2017‚Äì2018, Montgomery County Public School's Department of Facilities Management added four new portables to the school's campus, due to the large spike in enrollment. In 2022, Blair is expected to undergo construction for a new gym, a larger Student Activity Center and 18 new classrooms. A panoramic of the MBHS Faculty Courtyard Academics In 2016, MBHS was ranked 22nd within Maryland and 528 nationally by U.S. News & World Report. The school has an Honors Program and an Advanced Placement Program. The school is one of the few US high schools to have a .edu domain name, with its internet connection having gone live in the late 1980s. MBHS is home to two separately-run student news publications: Silver Chips is the school's print newspaper that is self- funded, and Silver Chips Online is an exclusively online publication which received the National Scholastic Press Association Online Pacemaker Award in 2004, 2005 and 2006. Blair is also home to Silver Quill, a literary arts magazine. Silver Quill is distributed with the school yearbook at the end of the school year. =Science, Mathematics, and Computer Science Magnet Program= In 1985, Montgomery County Public Schools opened its first Science, Mathematics, and Computer Science Magnet program at Blair. At the time, Blair had the highest minority population among the high schools in the county and the lowest standardized test scores. The school board conducted a survey to decide that a specialized science magnet program would attract high-achieving white and Asian students to Blair. Although there was criticism of the program from some parents and students, the leaders of the PTA and the principal supported the program, noting that by 1989 more families were staying in the neighborhood to attend Blair and fewer students were seeking to transfer out. In 1993, the Superintendent of Montgomery County Public Schools told the New York Times: \\"I have never seen a high school's image turn around so quickly.\\" Since its inception, the Magnet has offered accelerated, interdisciplinary courses in science, mathematics, and computer science. The Magnet offers dozens of courses, including in quantum physics, complex analysis, thermodynamics, discrete mathematics, marine biology, 3D computer graphics, artificial intelligence, the history of science, and organic chemistry. Qualified students who are not in the program can and do enroll in its elective courses. In their senior year, Magnet students complete research projects to enter into the Science Talent Search, in which the program has a long history of success. In 2017, the Magnet's mean SAT score was 2253. The Blair Magnet is open to students from the southern and eastern areas of Montgomery County, who are selected through a competitive application and testing process (a program at Poolesville High School provides a similar curriculum for students in the northern and western areas of the county). The Magnet program has been criticized for being overwhelmingly white and Asian, enrolling few black and Hispanic students. The Magnet was threatened with proposed budget cuts in 2008, but after student protests, it was spared from the most severe cuts. In 2018, a retired Magnet teacher was accused of sexual harassment by many former students. =Communication Arts Program= The Communication Arts Program (CAP) at was established at Blair soon after the Magnet, in 1988. It strives to provide a comprehensive educational approach to the humanities by offering accelerated, interdisciplinary courses in English, social studies, and media for participating students. CAP is open to students in the Downcounty Consortium and admission is competitive by application and testing. CAP offers courses in drama, photography, video production, history, government, English literature, writing composition, journalism and research. The number of CAP classes decreases by year, until students only complete one CAP class in 12th grade. The curriculum frequently builds off of existing Advanced Placement courses but uses the program's resources to add interdisciplinary experiences, such as a simulated presidential election that occurs over the course of a week at end of 10th grade, in which some students serve as candidates and others as campaign staff and reporters. CAP students also maintain portfolios of their work throughout the four years, which must include independent and service-based projects done outside of school. In 12th grade, they must successfully defend the portfolio's contents to a faculty committee in order to complete the program and graduate with a CAP Diploma. =English Department= In addition to offering standard English courses, the English Department also offers AP courses in Language and Literature, as well as studies in dramatics, journalism, and theater. =Fine Arts Department= The Fine Arts Department consists of two sub-departments of Music and Visual Arts.

The jazz ensembles are Advanced Jazz Ensemble (Honors), and Jazz Lab Band. In addition, the music program also contains a marching band and a theatrical pit orchestra, as well as an audio library and a professional recording studio. In the Spring of 2014, MBHS's Chamber Orchestra hosted British Composer Paul Lewis as a Composer-in-Residence, receiving pay from the Wolftrap Foundation. Students played the world premiere of a 5 movement long piece called \\"Salute the Silents\\". Choral Music Department The Choral Music Department consists of Chorus, Show Choir, Chamber Choir (Honors), a Cabaret, and InToneNation, an a cappella group.

It was introduced in the late 17th century and continued its use until the end of Ottoman rule in Rumelia. The bajrak included one or more clans. It was especially implemented in northern Albania and in parts of Kosovo (Sanjak of Prizren and Sanjak of Scutari), where in the 19th century these regions constituted the frontier with the Principality of Serbia and Principality of Montenegro. These sanjaks had notable communities of Gheg Albanians (Muslims and Catholics), Serbs and Slavic Muslims. The Albanians adopted the system into their clan structure, and bajraks endured during the Kingdom of Serbia (1882‚Äì1918) and People's Socialist Republic of Albania (1944‚Äì1992). Overview The bajrak was a territorial unit of the Ottoman Empire, consisting of a group of villages, from which military recruitment was organized ‚Äì a \\"territorialized military organization.\\" The bajrak was composed of one or more clans. Several smaller clans could inhabit a single bajrak while larger clans occupied several bajrak; usually a bajraktar (\\"standard-bearer\\") led a clan, while in some cases a bajraktar led several clans or a single clan had several bajraktars. The Ottomans entrusted the bajraktar with providing soldiers from his bajrak in exchange for privileges, and sometimes he performed important administrative and judicial duties. The bajraktar was usually hereditary position, via paternal ancestry appointed by the Ottoman government. Bajraks formed loose tribal confederations; for example, the Shala joined the Shoshi. The bajrak system existed in many mountainous ethnographic regions, such as Lum√´. Aftermath =In Serbia and Yugoslavia= In Kosovo, after the conquest by Kingdom of Serbia, the Albanians incorporated the bajrak into their clan system (known as fis). The Yugoslav authorities tried to break up the feudal relations created through this system. =In Albania= The Albanian Communist President Enver Hoxha (r. 1941‚Äì85) tried to abolish the bajrak by liquidating the bajraktars, as they enjoyed considerable influence.

His eighteen-year tenure as President of the Massachusetts Senate is the longest in history. He then became president of the University of Massachusetts. His brother was convicted mob boss James \\"Whitey\\" Bulger, who led the Winter Hill Gang. In 2003 he refused to testify in a congressional hearing about communications he had with his then-fugitive brother. For that he was forced to resign from the presidency of the University of Massachusetts. Bulger was a political ally of Massachusetts Senator and United States Secretary of State (2013‚Äì2017) John Kerry, with their long overlap by state and by party.  Early life  William Bulger's father, James Joseph Bulger Sr., was from Harbour Grace, Newfoundland. After settling in Everett, Massachusetts, James Sr. married Jane Veronica \\"Jean\\" McCarthy, a first- generation Irish immigrant. William Bulger was born in Dorchester, Massachusetts, and is the third of six children in the family, and younger brother of former mob boss James Joseph \\"Whitey\\" Bulger Jr. (1929‚Äì2018). Bulger's father worked as a union laborer and occasional longshoreman; he lost his arm in an industrial accidentCarr, Howie. The Brothers Bulger: How They Terrorized and Corrupted Boston For a Quarter Century. Lebanon, IN: Warner Books (Hachette Book Group, Inc.), 2006. . and the family was reduced to poverty. In May 1938, When Bulger was four years old, the family moved to South Boston's Old Harbor Village housing project, soon after it opened. He grew up there and has maintained lifelong friendships with many of those who were his former neighbors, including best friend, Korean War Marine P.O.W. and Purple Heart recipient Fred L. Toomey. The late Congressman Joe Moakley (1927‚Äì2001) was also a close childhood neighbor. Although the Bulger family was poor, William matriculated into Boston College High School. He enrolled at Boston College in 1952, but his undergraduate career was interrupted when he joined the United States Army. He served from September 1953 to November 1955, then returned to Boston College, completing his undergraduate degree in English Literature with the help of the G.I. Bill. He attended Boston College Law School, from which he received his Doctor of Jurisprudence degree in 1961. He is also the recipient of over 20 honorary degrees from a variety of academic institutions.  Political career  Bulger became interested in politics in 1959 and was first elected to the Massachusetts House of Representatives as a Democrat in 1960. After serving five terms, Bulger was elected to the Massachusetts State Senate in 1970 representing the First Suffolk District. In 1973 he was named Second Assistant Floor Majority Leader. After Joseph DiCarlo's conviction for extortion in 1977, Bulger succeeded him as Senate Majority Leader. Bulger was elected President of the Massachusetts State Senate in 1978 and was re-elected every two years to 1996, making his time as State Senate president the longest tenure in Massachusetts history. Bulger joined other Irish-American neighborhood leaders in opposition to court-ordered desegregated busing. Like other Massachusetts politicians who were elected leaders of their legislative chambers, Bulger was frequently pilloried in the media, but remained very popular in his district. He won his district election every two years from 1961 to 1994 without ever facing a challenge more serious than he faced in the Democratic primary in 1988, when Stephen Holt, a neophyte liberal activist and bookstore owner from Dorchester won 31 out of 60 precincts, only to lose the district by a landslide due to the huge turnout of Bulger supporters in South Boston. For many years, Bulger hosted the annual St. Patrick's Day Breakfast in South Boston. This is a \\"roast\\" of politicians. = Political milestones = Boston Mayor Raymond Flynn (left), in the 1980s. During the 1960s, he led efforts to write the first child abuse reporting laws in the state. He was supportive of environmental protection legislation. Bulger was among the first advocates of charter schools and public school choice. During the 1980s, he advocated funding of public libraries, the expansion of childhood nutrition services and fuel assistance programs. As Senate president, Bulger led the debate on welfare reform in the early 1990s, with the resulting legislation becoming the model for a national law.  President of the University of Massachusetts system  Bulger was appointed President of the University of Massachusetts by the Board of Trustees on November 28, 1995. His candidacy for the UMass position was supported by Governor William Weld. The appointment was controversial in academic circles, as Bulger had no prior experience in higher education, and lacked the academic doctoral degree usually required for the presidency of a major state university system. On August 6, 2003, Bulger announced that he would resign as president of the system effective September 1, 2003. His resignation came due to pressure from Governor Mitt Romney after Bulger had refused to cooperate with authorities who were searching for Bulger's brother, the notorious mobster James \\"Whitey\\" Bulger. Jack M. Wilson, Vice President for Academic and Student Affairs, who had come to UMass from the post of J. Erik Jonsson Distinguished Professor at Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute to create UMassOnline, was tapped to be the interim president. Wilson was appointed as the president in March 2004 after the conclusion of a national search.  Controversy over brother  Bulger's older brother James \\"Whitey\\" Bulger, Jr., was a convicted crime boss and multiple murderer and the former boss of the Winter Hill Gang. Whitey was a fugitive from 1995 until his arrest in June 2011. In 1999, Whitey's longtime aide, Kevin Weeks, pleaded guilty to a number of charges related to Whitey's crime spree and became a cooperating witness. Weeks revealed that in 1995, William talked to Whitey during an arranged phone conversation just two weeks after Whitey fled a pending racketeering indictment. William was called before a grand jury in April 2001 and admitted to talking with his brother. When asked why he didn't urge Whitey to turn himself in, William replied that he didn't feel it was in his brother's best interest to give himself up at the time. After portions of Bulger's testimony were published in The Boston Globe, he testified to a Congressional committee about the incident on June 19, 2003 after being granted immunity from prosecution for obstruction of justice. Bulger revealed that he went to an arranged location in 1995 to take a call from his fugitive brother, apparently to avoid electronic eavesdropping. He claimed that not notifying authorities about the call was \\"in no way inconsistent with my devotion to my own responsibilities, my public responsibilities\\" as state senate president.Edward Achorn,\\"The Anti-Brahmins: Not Every Massachusetts Dynasty Is Great,\\" book review of The Brothers Bulger: How They Terrorized and Corrupted Boston For a Quarter Century, by Howie Carr, The Weekly Standard magazine, July 24, 2006. During the hearing, when asked what he thought James (Whitey) did for a living, William Bulger said: > I had the feeling that he was in the business of gaming and ... whatever. It > was vague to me, but I didn't think, for a long while he had some jobs, but > ultimately, it was clear that he was not being, you know, he wasn't doing > what I'd like him to do. He added that he loved his brother and hoped that the most brutal rumors concerning him would be proven false. Bulger came under harsh criticism for his apparent evasiveness, and Governor Mitt Romney, among others, demanded his resignation as president of the University of Massachusetts. Under pressure from all quarters, Bulger resigned in the fall of 2003. Bulger also testified that the FBI never asked if he knew of Whitey's location. Those remarks were disputed by a former FBI agent who claimed Bulger declined to submit to an interview with the FBI.Fox Butterfield, \\"F.B.I.Used Killers as Informants, Report Says,\\" New York Times, November 21, 2003, accessed September 10, 2006 Months later, the committee report found Bulger's testimony \\"inconsistent\\" about whether the FBI had contacted him in its search for his fugitive brother. Upon Whitey's arrest in California in June 2011, William Bulger issued a statement expressing his \\"sympathies to the families hurt\\" in the case, and asking for privacy for his family.  Active retirement and family  Bulger is a past president of the Boston Public Library and past member of the Board of Trustees. He is also Overseer Emeritus of the Boston Symphony Orchestra. In addition, he is a former member of the Massachusetts General Hospital Board of Trustees, Museum of Fine Arts Board of Trustees, and McLean Hospital Board of Trustees. He joined the faculties of Boston College and Suffolk University as a lecturer of political science in 2004. Bulger lives in South Boston with Mary Foley, his wife whom he married in 1960. According to the Massachusetts Open Checkbook list of state pensions, Bulger's pension from Massachusetts for his position as University of Massachusetts President ranged from $198,926 to $201,266 for the years 2011 to 2019.\\"View Pensions\\", Massachusetts Open Checkbook, 2015 See also * Massachusetts House of Representatives' 5th Suffolk district * 1979‚Äì1980 Massachusetts legislature * 1981‚Äì1982 Massachusetts legislature * 1983-1984 Massachusetts legislature * 1985‚Äì1986 Massachusetts legislature * 1987‚Äì1988 Massachusetts legislature * 1989‚Äì1990 Massachusetts legislature * 1991-1992 Massachusetts legislature * 1993‚Äì1994 Massachusetts legislature * 1995-1996 Massachusetts legislature  Biographical works  * Bulger, William M.

Richard Montgomery has also had multiple Marian Greenblatt Education Fund award winner teachers. History and campus Class in 1936 Richard Montgomery High School is the oldest public high school in Montgomery County. It was first established in 1892 as \\"Rockville High School\\", when the state Board of Education first allocated funds to local school to educate high school students. The first class of twelve seniors graduated in 1897. A new high school was constructed and opened for use in September 1905 on East Montgomery Avenue and Monroe Street. An addition was built in 1917, expanding the school to 19 classrooms. Rockville Colored High School was opened in 1927.George Washington Carver High School Retrieved November 2, 2017. The school for white students was renamed Richard Montgomery High School to distinguish between the two in 1935.History of Richard Montgomery High School Retrieved November 2, 2017. The building was completed in 1942 at , after a fire destroyed the old high school in 1940.

In April 2008 stories appeared in the Washington Post, the Montgomery County Gazette, and the Montgomery Sentinel,The Sentinel alleging that the school principal, Moreno Carrasco, had been running a private business on school time and was using materials that appeared to be plagiarized from a seminar that he had attended at school district expense. Carrasco went on extended sick leave. During Carrasco's absence, the student newspaper, The Tide, requested that administrators approve publication of an article about the investigation into Carrasco's alleged ethics violations and business endeavors. Assistant Principal Veronica McCall denied permission for publication of the article, but was overridden by Community Superintendent Dr. Sherry Liebes after The Tide editors announced that they would go public with news of the denial. The article was finally published online on April 24, 2008.The Tide Online- Richard Montgomery's Student Newspaper On June 10, 2008, Montgomery County Public Schools announced that Carrasco had been named the new director of secondary leadership training. The announcement also stated that the allegations about Carrasco's involvement in private consulting were \\"thoroughly investigated\\" and \\"not substantiated\\". On June 23, 2008, Nelson McLeod II was named the new principal of Richard Montgomery High School. He left the position in May 2014 due to a cardiac medical condition, and was replaced by Damon Monteleone in July 2014. Reconstruction Richard Montgomery opened a new $71 million building following the end of students' 2007 winter break. The new building features wireless internet for the teachers which has since been opened to student access, LCD projectors in every classroom, dozens of Promethean interactive whiteboards and learner response devices, a modern auditorium, and a recording and TV studio. The new facilities lack the capability to access older forms of media, such as material on VHS and photographic slides; however, teachers sometimes bring in their own video players to rectify the problem. The school has an artificial turf stadium next to tennis courts and a track. Athletics Athletics Director, Jon Freda, is an RM Alum class of 2001.

He was conceived when his father Solomon tricked his visiting mother, the Queen of Sheba, into sleeping with him. His mother raised him as a Jew in Ethiopia and he only traveled to Jerusalem to meet his father for the first time when he was in his twenties. While his father begged Menelik to stay and rule over Israel, Menelik told him that he wanted to return to Ethiopia. So, Solomon sent many Israelites with him, to aid him in ruling according to biblical standards, and they, aggrieved at being exiled forever, King Solomon gave his Ark of the Covenant to his son as gift for being his son and being king of Ethiopia. Menelik then became king of Ethiopia, upon the death of his mother.  Dynasty  According to legend, Menelik I founded the Solomonic dynasty of Ethiopia that ruled Ethiopia with few interruptions for close to three thousand years. This ended 225 generations later, with the deposition of Emperor Haile Selassie in 1974. However, historical records show that the Solomonic dynasty began in 1262 CE, when Yekuno Amlak, who claimed descent from the Kings of Aksum and Solomon and Sheba, overthrew the last ruler of the Zagwe dynasty, dismissing them as not of \\"the house of Israel\\" (i.e., of Solomon). To date, there is no evidence that the people of highland Ethiopia were Jews before the fourth century CE.Ullendorff, Edward. 1956. \\"Hebraic-Jewish Elements in Abyssinian (monophysite) Christianity.\\" Journal of Semitic Studies 1 (3):216-256.  Popular culture  Much tourist art in Ethiopia depicts the narrative about Menelik I in a series of panels, 44 scenes, eleven for each of four lines. The story depicted on them is the oral version (beginning with a backstory on Sheba and including an Ethiopian maid who also becomes pregnant by Solomon), not the medieval text version. 2004 short documentary, Menelik I, was filmed in Ethiopia.

Canada, a lawsuit filed by one of its members, Tony O'Donohue. This suit challenged the constitutionality of certain provisions of the Act of Settlement, 1701, one of the laws governing succession to the Canadian throne, which disallows the sovereign from either being or married to a Roman Catholic. O'Donohue argued that it thus violates the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms. The case was dismissed in 2003, a ruling that was upheld in 2005, part of the rationale behind the decision being that, as the Act of Settlement is a constitutional document on equal-footing with the Charter, it could not be pre-empted by the Charter.O‚ÄôDonohue v. Canada, 2003 CanLII 41404 (ON S.C.) =Oath of Allegiance= The co-founder of the CCR, Pierre L. J. Vincent, became a republican activist in 1998 when he objected to taking the Oath of Allegiance, then required by law for all Canadian public servants beginning employment within the Civil Service. His refusal, partly based on his Acadian ancestry, sparked a publicized three-year legal battle involving the Government of Canada's Public Service Commission. In 2001, the commission ruled that he could keep his job, a legal precedent that was later applied to a similar oath refusal. Both cases are recognized as being a major impetus for the 2003 Public Service Modernization Act, which ended the requirement for Government of Canada civil servants to swear an oath to the Queen as of December 31, 2005. In 2007, CCR member Charles Roach filed suit in opposition to the requirement of new citizens to swear an oath to the Queen.

It operates by using a processor with the additional ability to support debugging operations, as well as to carry out the main function of the system. Particularly for older systems, with limited processors, this usually involved replacing the processor temporarily with a hardware emulator: a more powerful although more expensive version. It was historically in the form of bond-out processor which has many internal signals brought out for the purpose of debugging. These signals provide information about the state of the processor. More recently the term also covers Joint Test Action Group (JTAG) based hardware debuggers which provide equivalent access using on-chip debugging hardware with standard production chips. Using standard chips instead of custom bond-out versions makes the technology ubiquitous and low cost, and eliminates most differences between the development and runtime environments. In this common case, the in- circuit emulator term is a misnomer, sometimes confusingly so, because emulation is no longer involved. Embedded systems present special problems for programmers because they usually lack keyboards, monitors, disk drives and other user interfaces that are present on computers. These shortcomings make in-circuit software debugging tools essential for many common development tasks. Function An in-circuit emulator (ICE) provides a window into the embedded system. The programmer uses the emulator to load programs into the embedded system, run them, step through them slowly, and view and change data used by the system's software. An emulator gets its name because it emulates (imitates) the central processing unit (CPU) of the embedded system's computer. Traditionally it had a plug that inserts into the socket where the CPU integrated circuit chip would normally be placed. Most modern systems use the target system's CPU directly, with special JTAG-based debug access. Emulating the processor, or direct JTAG access to it, lets the ICE do anything that the processor can do, but under the control of a software developer. ICEs attach a computer terminal or personal computer (PC) to the embedded system. The terminal or PC provides an interactive user interface for the programmer to investigate and control the embedded system. For example, it is routine to have a source code level debugger with a graphical windowing interface that communicates through a JTAG adapter (emulator) to an embedded target system which has no graphical user interface. Notably, when their program fails, most embedded systems simply become inert lumps of nonfunctioning electronics. Embedded systems often lack basic functions to detect signs of software failure, such as a memory management unit (MMU) to catch memory access errors. Without an ICE, the development of embedded systems can be extremely difficult, because there is usually no way to tell what went wrong. With an ICE, the programmer can usually test pieces of code, then isolate the fault to a particular section of code, and then inspect the failing code and rewrite it to solve the problem. In usage, an ICE provides the programmer with execution breakpoints, memory display and monitoring, and input/output control. Beyond this, the ICE can be programmed to look for any range of matching criteria to pause at, in an attempt to identify the origin of a failure. Most modern microcontrollers use resources provided on the manufactured version of the microcontroller for device programming, emulating, and debugging features, instead of needing another special emulation-version (that is, bond-out) of the target microcontroller. Even though it is a cost-effective method, since the ICE unit only manages the emulation instead of actually emulating the target microcontroller, trade-offs must be made to keep prices low at manufacture time, yet provide enough emulation features for the (relatively few) emulation applications. Advantages Virtually all embedded systems have a hardware element and a software element, which are separate but tightly interdependent. The ICE allows the software element to be run and tested on the hardware on which it is to run, but still allows programmer conveniences to help isolate faulty code, such as source-level debugging (which shows a program as it was originally written) and single-stepping (which lets programmers run programs step-by-step to find errors). Most ICEs consist of an adaptor unit that sits between the ICE host computer and the system to be tested. A pin header and cable assembly connects the adaptor to a socket where the actual central processing unit (CPU) or microcontroller mounts within the embedded system. Recent ICEs enable programmers to access the on-chip debug circuit that is integrated into the CPU via JTAG or background debug mode interface (BDM) to debug the software of an embedded system. These systems often use a standard version of the CPU chip, and can simply attach to a debug port on a production system. They are sometimes called in-circuit debuggers or ICDs, to distinguish the fact that they do not replicate the functionality of the CPU, but instead control an already existing, standard CPU. Since the CPU need not be replaced, they can operate on production units where the CPU is soldered in and cannot be replaced. On x86 Pentiums, a special 'probe mode' is used by ICEs to aid in debugging.http://www.rcollins.org/articles/probemd/ProbeMode.html In the context of embedded systems, the ICE is not emulating hardware. Rather, it is providing direct debug access to the actual CPU. The system under test is under full control, allowing the developer to load, debug and test code directly. Most host systems are ordinary commercial computers unrelated to the CPU used for development. For example, a Linux PC might be used to develop software for a system using a Freescale 68HC11 chip, a processor that cannot run Linux. The programmer usually edits and compiles the embedded system's code on the host system, as well. The host system will have special compilers that produce executable code for the embedded system, termed cross compilers or cross assemblers.  On-chip debugging  On-chip debugging is an alternative to in-circuit emulation. It uses a different approach to address a similar goal. On-chip debugging, often loosely termed as Joint Test Action Group (JTAG), uses the provision of an additional debugging interface to the live hardware, in the production system. It provides the same features as in- circuit debugging, such as inspection of internal state or variables and may have the ability to set checkpoints, breakpoints and watchpoints. The difference is that this is provided by additional silicon within the production processor, rather than swapping the processor for an off-board debugging emulator. For this reason, some of the functions of the ICE is changed by the specifications of the processor. An additional JTAG interface is added to the controller board, and this is required on every production system, but as this only requires a few signal pins the extra cost is minimal. JTAG interfaces were originally developed for, and are still useful for, end of production testing.

Career =Early career= At school, Stossel aspired to work at Seattle Magazine, but it went out of business by the time he graduated. His contacts there assisted him in getting a job at KGW-TV in Portland, Oregon, where Stossel began as a newsroom gofer, working his way up to researcher and then writer. After a few years, the news director told Stossel to go on the air and read what he wrote. Despite his stage fright, Stossel says his fear spurred him to improve, examining and imitating broadcasts of David Brinkley and Jack Perkins. Stossel had also stuttered since childhood. After a few years of on-air reporting, Stossel was hired by WCBS-TV in New York City, by Ed Joyce, the same news director who hired Arnold Diaz, Linda Ellerbee, Dave Marash, Joel Siegel and Lynn Sherr. Stossel was disappointed at CBS, feeling that the more limited amount of time spent there on research lowered the quality of its journalism compared to Portland. Stossel cites union work rules that discouraged the extra work that Stossel felt allowed employees to be creative, which he says represented his \\"first real introduction to the deals made by special interests\\". Stossel also \\"hated\\" Joyce, who he felt was \\"cold and critical\\", though Stossel credits Joyce with allowing him the freedom to pursue his own story ideas, and with recommending the Hollins Communications Research Institute in Roanoke, Virginia, that helped Stossel manage his stutter.Stossel. 2004. pp. 3‚Äì8 Stossel grew continuously more frustrated with having to follow the assignment editor's vision of what was news. Perhaps because of his stuttering, he had always avoided covering what others covered, feeling he could not succeed if he were forced to compete with other reporters by shouting out questions at news conferences. However, this led to the unexpected realization for Stossel that more important events were those that occurred slowly, such as the women's movement, the growth of computer technology, and advancements in contraception, rather than daily events like government pronouncements, elections, fires, or crime. One day, Stossel bypassed the assignment editor to give Ed Joyce a list of story ideas the assignment editor had rejected. Joyce agreed that Stossel's ideas were better, and approved them.

In addition to appearing on The O'Reilly Factor every Tuesday night, he also hosted a one- hour weekly program for Fox Business Network and a series of one-hour specials for Fox News Channel, as well as making regular guest appearances on Fox News programs. The program, Stossel, debuted December 10, 2009, on Fox Business Network. The program examined issues related to individual freedom, free market capitalism and small government, such as civil liberties, the business of health care, and free trade. The final episode premiered on December 16, 2016. At the end of that episode, a retrospective that spotlighted moments from seven years of the program, Stossel explained that due to his age, he wanted to help develop a younger generation of journalists with his views, and would continue to appear as a guest on Fox programs, and also help produce content for Reason TV.Welch, Matt (December 16, 2016). \\"Thank You, John Stossel, for Teaching Libertarians How to Do Cable News\\".

Give Me a Break: How I Exposed Hucksters, Cheats, and Scam Artists and Became the Scourge of the Liberal Media is a 2005 autobiography from Harper Perennial documenting his career and philosophical transition from liberalism to libertarianism. It describes his opposition to government regulation, his belief in free market and private enterprise, support for tort reform, and advocacy for shifting social services from the government to private charities. It was a New York Times bestseller for 11 weeks. Myths, Lies, and Downright Stupidity: Get Out the Shovel ‚Äì Why Everything You Know Is Wrong, which was published in 2007 by Hyperion, questions the validity of various conventional wisdoms, and argues that the belief he is conservative is untrue. On April 10, 2012, Threshold Editions, an imprint of Simon & Schuster, published Stossel's third book No, They Can't: Why Government Fails ‚Äì But Individuals Succeed. It argues that government policies meant to solve problems instead produce new ones, and that free individuals and the private sector perform tasks more efficiently than the government does. With financial support from the libertarian Palmer R. Chitester Fund, Stossel and ABC News launched a series of educational materials for public schools in 1999 entitled \\"Stossel in the Classroom\\". It was taken over in 2006 by the Center for Independent Thought and releases a new DVD of teaching materials annually. In 2006, Stossel and ABC released Teaching Tools for Economics, a video series based on the National Council of Economics Education standards.

Political positions Stossel's news reports and writings attempt to debunk popular beliefs. His Myths and Lies series of 20/20 specials challenges a range of liberal beliefs. He also hosted The Power of Belief (October 6, 1998), an ABC News Special that focused on assertions of the paranormal and people's desire to believe.

Guatemala, January 2008 and the free market. He frequently uses television airtime to advance these views and challenge viewers' distrust of free-market capitalism and economic competition. He received an Honoris Causa Doctorate from Francisco Marroquin University, a libertarian university in Guatemala, in 2008. He told The Oregonian, on October 26, 1994: Stossel argues that individual self- interest, or \\"greed\\", creates an incentive to work harder and to innovate. He has promoted school choice as a way to improve American schools, believing that when people are given a choice, they will choose the schools best suited for their children. Referring to educational tests that rank American students lower than others he says: Stossel has criticized government programs for being inefficient, wasteful, and harmful. He has also criticized the American legal system, opining that it provides lawyers and vexatious litigators the incentive to file frivolous lawsuits indiscriminately. Stossel contends that these suits often generate more wealth for lawyers than for deserving clients, stifle innovation and personal freedoms, and cause harm to private citizens, taxpayers, consumers and businesses.Stossel, 2004. \\"The Trouble with Lawyers\\". pp. 177‚Äì179 Although Stossel concedes that some lawsuits are necessary in order to provide justice to people genuinely injured by others with greater economic power,Martel, Frances.\\"John Stossel Fights Frivolous Lawsuits On A Go-Cart\\".

In his first episode on Fox Business Channel, Stossel mocked scientists for warning about climate change. Stossel disagrees with scientific consensus on the subject of global climate change, rejecting the notion that it will have net negative consequences, pointing to assertedly warmer periods in human history. Part of his criticism of environmentalists who advocate the idea of the public should be worried about the issue is that they tend to received more public attention, donations, and government funding than those who argue that it should not be. He points to groups like the World Wildlife Fund, Greenpeace, the Environmental Defense Fund, the Natural Resources Defense Council, and to activists such as Rachel Carson and former U.S. Vice President Al Gore as examples of environmental scaremongers. In 2001, the media watchdog organization FAIR criticized Stossel's reportage of global warming in his documentary, Tampering with Nature, for using \\"highly selective...information\\" that placing undue emphasis to three dissenters from among the 2,000 members of the UN's Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, which had recently released a report stating that global temperatures were rising almost twice as fast as previously thought. He claims that proposals surrounding the proposed solutions to reduce global warming are \\"myths,\\" which will not only not solve the problem but will restrict freedom. Praise and criticism =Awards= As of 2001, Stossel had won 19 Emmy Awards. He was honored six times for excellence in consumer reporting by the National Press Club, has received a George Polk Award for Outstanding Local Reporting and a Peabody Award.ABC News: John Stossel According to Stossel, when he was in favor of government intervention and skeptical of business, he was deluged with awards, but in 2006, he stated, \\"They like me less... Once I started applying the same skepticism to government, I stopped winning awards.\\" On April 23, 2012, Stossel was awarded the Chapman University Presidential Medal, by the current president, James Doti, and chancellor, Danielle Struppa. The award has been presented to only a handful of people over the past 150 years. Stossel received an honorary doctorate from Universidad Francisco Marroqu√≠n. =Praise= The Nobel Prize- winning Chicago School monetarist economist Milton Friedman lauded Stossel, stating: \\"Stossel is that rare creature, a TV commentator who understands economics, in all its subtlety.\\" Steve Forbes, the editor of Forbes magazine, described Stossel as riveting and \\"one of America's ablest and most courageous journalists.\\" P. J. O'Rourke, best-selling author of Eat the Rich and Parliament of Whores praised Stossel, stating: An article published by the libertarian group Advocates for Self Government notes praise for Stossel. Independent Institute Research Analyst Anthony Gregory, writing on the libertarian blog, LewRockwell.com, described Stossel as a \\"heroic rogue... a media maverick and proponent of freedom in an otherwise statist, conformist mass media.\\" Libertarian investment analyst Mark Skousen said Stossel is \\"a true libertarian hero\\". =Criticism and controversy= Progressive organizations such as Fairness and Accuracy In Reporting (FAIR) and Media Matters for America (MMfA) have criticized Stossel's work, for what they described as a lack of balance of coverage and distortion of facts on his part. For example, Stossel was criticized for a segment on his October 11, 1999, show during which he argued that AIDS research has received too much funding, \\"25 times more than on Parkinson's, which kills more people.\\" FAIR pointed out that AIDS had in fact killed more people in the United States in 1999.Hart, Peter (March 1, 2003). \\"Give Us a Break: The World According to John Stossel\\". Extra!, FAIR. In a February 2000 Salon feature on Stossel titled \\"Prime-time propagandist\\", David Mastio wrote that Stossel has a conflict of interest in donating profits from his public speaking engagements to, among others, a non-profit called \\"Stossel in the Classroom\\" which includes material for use in schools, some of which uses material made by Stossel.; and, University of Texas economist James K. Galbraith has alleged that Stossel, in his September 1999 special Is America #1?, used an out-of- context clip of Galbraith to convey the notion that Galbraith advocated the adoption by Europe of the free market economics practiced by the United States, when in fact Galbraith actually advocated that Europe adopt some of the United States' social benefit transfer mechanisms such as Social Security, which is the economically opposite view. Stossel denied any misrepresentation of Galbraith's views and stated that it was not his intention to convey that Galbraith agreed with all of the special's ideas. However, he re-edited that portion of the program for its September 2000 repeat, in which Stossel paraphrased, \\"Even economists who like Europe's policies, like James Galbraith, now acknowledge America's success.\\"Rose, Ted (March 2000) \\"Laissez- Faire TV: ABC's John Stossel is a man on a mission to teach Americans about the evils of government regulation and the rewards of free enterprise.\\" Brill's Content; and, David Schultz incident On December 28, 1984, during an interview for 20/20 on professional wrestling, wrestler David Schultz struck Stossel twice after Stossel said professional wrestling was \\"fake\\". Stossel said he suffered from pain and buzzing in his ears eight weeks after the assault. Stossel sued and obtained a settlement of $280,000 from the World Wrestling Federation (WWF). In his book, Myths, Lies, and Downright Stupidity, Stossel noted his regret, believing lawsuits harm innocent people.Wrestling Babylon by Irvin Muchnick ECW Press 2007 p. 118; and, Give Me a Break by John Stossel, p. 211 Schultz maintains that he attacked Stossel on orders from Vince McMahon, the head of the then-WWF. Organic vegetables A February 2000 story about organic vegetables on 20/20 included statements by Stossel that tests had shown that neither organic nor conventional produce samples contained any pesticide residue, and that organic food was more likely to be contaminated by E. coli bacteria. The Environmental Working Group objected to his report, mainly questioning his statements about bacteria, but also managed to determine that the produce had never been tested for pesticides. They communicated this to Stossel, but after the story's producer backed Stossel's statement that the test results had been as described, the story was rebroadcast months later, unchanged, and with a postscript in which Stossel iterated his claim. Later, after a report in The New York Times confirmed the Environmental Working Group's claims, ABC News suspended the producer of the segment for a month and reprimanded Stossel. Stossel apologized, saying that he had thought the tests had been conducted as reported. However, he asserted that the gist of his report had been accurate. Frederick K. C. Price In a March 2007 segment about finances and lifestyles of televangelists, 20/20 aired a segment by Stossel that included a clip of television minister Frederick K. C. Price, which had originally been broadcast by the Lifetime Network in 1997. Price alleged that the clip portrayed him describing his wealth in extravagant terms, when he was actually telling a parable about a rich man. ABC News twice aired a retraction and apologized for the error.; and, The suit concluded with an out of court settlement including a public apology by ABC. Personal life Stossel lives in New York City with his wife, Ellen AbramsWiggins, James, V.I.P Address Book (2008), p. 653 and children, Lauren and Max. They also own a home in Massachusetts. Stossel came to embrace his family's Ashkenazi Jewish heritage after marrying his wife, who is also Jewish. They also raised their children Jewish. Stossel identified himself as an agnostic in \\"Skeptic or Believer\\", the December 16, 2010 episode of Stossel, explaining that he had no belief in God but was open to the possibility. Stossel's brother, Thomas P. Stossel, was a Harvard Medical School professorStossel, 2004, p. 214. and co-director of the Hematology Division at Boston's Brigham and Women's Hospital.Stossel, John (2006).

His court was in Ioannina, and the territory he governed incorporated most of Epirus and the western parts of Thessaly and Greek Macedonia. Ali had three sons: Muhtar Pasha, who served in the 1809 war against the Russians, Veli Pasha, who became Pasha of the Morea Eyalet and Salih Pasha, governor of Vlore.http://dergiler.ankara.edu.tr/dergiler/18/24/106.pdf Ali first appears in historical accounts as the leader of a band of brigands who became involved in many confrontations with Ottoman state officials in Albania and Epirus. He joined the administrative-military apparatus of the Ottoman Empire, holding various posts until 1788 when he was appointed pasha, ruler of the sanjak of Ioannina. His diplomatic and administrative skills, his interest in modernist ideas and concepts, his popular piety, his religious neutrality, his suppression of banditry, his vengefulness and harshness in imposing law and order, and his looting practices towards persons and communities in order to increase his proceeds caused both the admiration and the criticism of his contemporaries, as well as an ongoing controversy among historians regarding his personality. Finally falling afoul of the Ottoman central government, Ali Pasha was declared a rebel in 1820 and was killed in 1822 at the age of 81 or 82. In Western literature, Ali Pasha became the personification of an \\"oriental despot\\". Name His name in the local languages were: ; ; or (Ali Pasha of Ioannina); and (). Background and early years The statue of Ali Pasha in Tepelen√´ At some point in the 19th century, Ali's family was attributed with a legendary ancestry; according to this claim, Ali's family supposedly descended from a Mevlevi dervish named Nazif who migrated from Konya to Tepelene through K√ºtahya. However, this tradition is unfounded, and Ali's family, in all likelihood, were of local origins.Ahmet Uzun. Œü ŒëŒªŒÆ Œ†Œ±œÉŒ¨œÇ Œø Œ§ŒµœÄŒµŒªŒµŒΩŒªŒÆœÇ Œ∫Œ±Œπ Œ∑ œÄŒµœÅŒπŒøœÖœÉŒØŒ± œÑŒøœÖ..

Ali's grandfather (Muhtar Bey) and great-grandfather were both bandit chieftains. His grandfather had died during the 1716 siege of Corfu. His father, Veli bey, was a local ruler of Tepelena. Ali himself was born in Tepelena or in the adjacent village of Be√ßisht. According to George Bowen, Ali Pasha was part of the Lab tribe; as this tribe was in disrepute among the other Albanians for their poverty and predatory habits, he thought it proper to call himself after Tepelena, a town of the Tosks; no one dared to dispute this until after his death.George Bowen (1852), Mount Athos, Thessaly and Epirus: A diary of a Journey, Francis & John Rivington, London, p. 192, cited in Hart Laurie Kain (1999)Culture, civilization and demarcation at the northwest borders of Greece, American Ethnologist, 26(1), pp. 196‚Äì220, footnote 19. Ali's father was involved in a rivalry with his father's cousin Islam Bey, who was also a local ruler. Islam Bey was appointed mutasarrƒ±f of Delvin√´ in 1752, but Ali's father managed to kill him and was allowed to succeed his cousin as mutasarrƒ±f in 1762. However, his father was assassinated shortly after (when Ali was nine or ten), and he was brought up by his mother, Chamko (or Hanko), who originally hailed from Konitsa. In Ali's early years, he distinguished himself as a bandit. He affiliated himself with the Bektashi sect. The family lost much of its political and material status following the murder of his father. In 1758, his mother, Hanko, reportedly a woman of extraordinary character, thereupon herself formed and led a brigand band, and studied to inspire the boy with her own fierce and indomitable temper, with a view to revenge and the recovery of their lost wealth. According to Byron: \\"Ali inherited 6 dram and a musket after the death of his father. Ali collected a few followers from among the retainers of his father, made himself master, first of one village, then of another, amassed money, increased his power, and at last found himself at the head of a considerable body of Albanians\\". Ali became a famous brigand leader and attracted the attention of the Ottoman authorities. He was assigned to suppress brigandage and fought for the \\"Sultan and Empire\\" with great bravery, particularly against the famous rebel Pazvantoƒülu. He aided the Pasha of Negroponte in putting down a rebellion at Shkod√´r, it was during this period that he was introduced to the Janissary units and was inspired by their discipline. In 1768 he married the daughter of the wealthy Pasha of Delvina, with whom he entered into an alliance. In 1784 he seized Delvina, with the sultan's approval. Ali was appointed mutasarrƒ±f of Ioanninna at the end of 1784 or beginning of 1785, but was soon dismissed. His rise through Ottoman ranks continued with his appointment as lieutenant to the Pasha of Rumelia. In 1787 he was awarded the pashaluk of Trikala in reward for his services at Banat during the Austro-Turkish War (1787‚Äì1791). In 1788 he seized control of Ioannina and enlisted most of the Brigands under his own banner. Ioannina would be his power base for the next 33 years. He took advantage of a weak Ottoman government to expand his territory still further until he gained control of most of Albania, western Greece and the Peloponnese. During war- time, Ali Pasha could assemble an army of 50,000 men in a matter of two to three days and could double that number in two to three weeks. Leading these armed forces was the Supreme Council. The Commander-in-chief was the founder and financier, Ali Pasha. Council members included Muftar Pasha, Veli Pasha, Cel√¢leddin Bey, Abdullah Pashe Taushani and a number of his trusted men like Hasan Dervishi, Halil Patrona, Omar Vrioni, Me√ßo Bono, Ago Myhyrdari, Thanasis Vagias, Veli Gega (murdered by Antonis Katsantonis), and Tahir Abazi. Ali Pasha as ruler Fortifications built during Ali Pasha's reign in Butrint, southern Albania Firman issued by Ali Pasha in 1810, written in vernacular Greek. Ali used Greek for all his courtly dealings. Kira Vassiliki, by Paul Emil Jacobs As Pasha of Ioannina, he slowly laid the foundations for the creation of an almost independent state, which included a large part of Greece and Albania. During his rule, the town of Ioannina developed into a major educational, cultural, political and economic hub. In order to achieve his goals, he allied with all religious and ethnic groups in his territory. At the same time, he did not hesitate to fiercely crush any opponent. As he also developed relations with European powers. Ali's policy as ruler of Io√°nnina was mostly governed by expediency; he operated as a semi-independent despot and pragmatically allied himself with whoever offered the most advantage at the time. In fact, it was Ali Pasha and his Albanian soldiers and mercenaries who subdued the independent Souli.Sakellariou pp. 250‚Äì251 Ali Pasha wanted to establish in the Mediterranean a sea-power which would be a counterpart of that of the Dey of Algiers, Ahmed ben Ali. In order to gain a seaport on the Albanian coast, which was dominated by Venice, Ali Pasha formed an alliance with Napoleon I of France, who had established Fran√ßois Pouqueville as his general consul in Ioannina, with the complete consent of the Ottoman Sultan Selim III. After the Treaty of Tilsit, where Napoleon granted the Czar his plan to dismantle the Ottoman Empire, Ali Pasha switched sides and allied with Britain in 1807; a detailed account of his alliance with the British was written by Sir Richard Church. His actions were permitted by the Ottoman government in Constantinople. Ali Pasha was very cautious and displeased by the emergence of the new Ottoman Sultan Mahmud II in the year 1808. Lord Byron visited Ali's court in Io√°nnina in 1809Lord Byron's Correspondence; John Murray, editor. and recorded the encounter in his work Childe Harold. He evidently had mixed feelings about the despot, noting the splendour of Ali Pasha's court and the Greek cultural revival that he had encouraged in Io√°nnina, which Byron described as being \\"superior in wealth, refinement and learning\\" to any other Greek town. In a letter to his mother, however, Byron deplored Ali's cruelty: \\"His Highness is a remorseless tyrant, guilty of the most horrible cruelties, very brave, so good a general that they call him the Mahometan Buonaparte ... but as barbarous as he is successful, roasting rebels, etc, etc..\\"Rowland E. Prothero, ed., The Works of Lord Byron: Letters and Journals, Vol. 1, 1898, p. 252 (letter dated Prevesa, 12 November 1809) Different tales about his sexual proclivities emerged from western visitors to Pasha's court (including Lord Byron, the ,Vaudoncourt, Guillaume de Memoirs on the Ionian Islands ... : including the life and character of Ali Pasha. London: Baldwin, Cradock and Joy, 1816 and Frederick North, Earl of Guildford). These documenters wrote that he kept a large harem of both women and men. Such accounts may reflect the Orientalist imagination of Europe and underplay the historical role of Pasha rather than telling us anything concrete about his sexuality.Murray, Stephen O. & Roscoe, Will (1997) Islamic Homosexualities: culture, history, and literature, NYU Press Ali Pasha, according to one opinion, \\"was a cruel and faithless tyrant; still, he was not a Turk, but an Albanian; he was a rebel against the Sultan (Mahmud II), and he was so far an indirect friend of the Sultan's enemies\\". The Ottoman Power in Europe by Edward Augustus Freeman Throughout his rule he is known to have maintained close relations and corresponded with famous leaders such as Husein Grada≈°ƒçeviƒá, Ibrahim Bushati, Mehmet Ali Pasha and Ibrahim Pasha. Though certainly no friend to the Greek Nationalists (he had personally ordered the painful execution of the Klepht Katsantonis), his rule brought relative stability. It was only after his forceful deposition that the people of Greece objected to the rule of the Sultan Mahmud II and the newly appointed Hursid Pasha and thus began the Greek War of Independence. Ali Pasha used Greek in his court, and over the gate of his castle in Yannina there was an inscription in Greek claiming his descent from King Pyrrhus of Epirus. It is reported that he conversed with foreigners in Greek. Holland Henry, Travels in the Ionian Isles, Albania, Thessaly, Macedonia &c.; during the years 1812 and 1813. London 1815, p. 126. A long epic poem known as the Alipashiad consisting of more than 10,000 lines is dedicated to the exploits of Ali Pasha. The Alipashiad was composed by Haxhi Shekreti, an Albanian Muslim from Delvino and was written entirely in Greek.Wace A.J.B. and Thompson M. S. (1914) The nomads of the Balkans: An account of life and customs among the Vlachs of Northern Pindus, Methuen & Co., Ltd., p. 192. =Impact on modern Greek Enlightenment= Although Ali Pasha's native language was Albanian he used Greek for all his courtly dealings since the population of the region of Epirus (now mainly in northwestern Greece) which he ruled was predominantly Greek speaking.Fleming (1999): p. 64. As a consequence, a part of the local Greek population showed sympathy towards his rule.Fleming (1999): p. 63. This also activated new educational opportunities, with businessmen of the Greek diaspora, subsidizing a number of new educational purposes. As historian Douglas Dakin notes: =Atrocities= \\"Ali Pasha hunting on the lake\\" by Louis Dupr√© (1825) In 1808, M√ºh√ºrdar, a commanding Janissary of Ali Pasha, captured one of his most renowned opponents, the Greek klepht Katsantonis, who was executed in public by having his bones broken with a sledgehammer.Merry, Bruce. Encyclopedia of Modern Greek Literature. Greenwood Publishing Group, 2004. , p. 231. One of Ali's notorious crimes was the mass murder of 17 or 18 without a legal indictment chosen young Greek girls of Ioannina. They were without a trial sentenced as adulteresses, tied up in sacks and drowned in Lake Pamvotis.Fleming (1999): p. 168. Oral Aromanian tradition (songs) tells about the cruelty of Ali Pasha's troops. In October 1798 Ali's troops attacked the coastal town of Preveza, which was defended by a small garrison of 280 French grenadiers and local Greeks. When the town was finally conquered, a major slaughter occurred against the local people as retaliation for their resistance.Fleming (1999): p. 99. He also tortured the French and Greek prisoners of war before their execution. A French officer described the atrocities ordered by Ali Pasha and his cruel character: Every French captive was given a razor with which he was forced to skin the severed heads of his compatriots. Those who refused were beaten on the head with clubs. After the heads were skinned, the masks were salted and put in cloth bags. When the operation was finished, the French were driven back into the hangar, and they were warned to prepare for death. In the early nineteenth century his troops completed the destruction of the once prosperous cultural center of Moscopole, in modern southeastern Albania, and forced its Aromanian population to flee from the region.Winnifrith, Tom. Vlachs: the history of a Balkan people. Duckworth, 1987, , p. 130. Downfall In 1819, Halet Efendi brought to the attention of Sultan Mahmud II issues conspicuously related to Ali Pasha; Halet Efendi accused Ali Pasha of grabbing power and influence in Ottoman Rumelia away from the Sublime Porte. In 1820, Ali Pasha, after long tensions with the Turkish Reforms, allegedly ordered the assassination of Gaskho Bey, a political opponent in Constantinople; Sultan Mahmud II, who sought to restore the authority of the Sublime Porte, took this as a major opportunity to move against Ali Pasha by ordering his immediate deposition. Ali Pasha's head being presented to the Ottoman Sultan Mahmud II Ali Pasha's tomb in Ioannina Ali Pasha refused to resign his official post and put up a fierce resistance to the Sultan's troop movements as some 20,000 Turkish troops led by Hursid Pasha were fighting Ali Pasha's small but formidable army. Most of his followers abandoned him without fighting and fled, including Androutsos and his sons Veli and Muhtar, or else joined the Ottoman army. Among these were Omer Vrioni and Alexis Noutsos, who went unopposed to Ioannina, which was besieged in September 1820. On December 4, 1820, Ali Pasha and the Souliotes formed an anti-Ottoman coalition, to which the Souliotes contributed 3,000 soldiers. Ali Pasha gained the support of the Souliotes mainly because he offered to allow the return of the Souliotes to their land, and partly by appeal to their perceived Albanian origin. Initially, the coalition was successful and managed to control most of the region, but when the Muslim Albanian troops of Ali Pasha were informed of the beginning of the Greek revolts in the Morea, it was terminated. Ali's rebellion against the Sublime Porte increased the value of the Greek military element since their services were sought by the Porte as well. He is said to have contracted the services of the Klephts and Souliots in exile in the Ionian Islands as well as the armatoles under his command.John S. Koliopoulos Brigands with a Cause, p. 40 However he feared that the Klephts might rout him before the arrival of the Ottoman Turks. His separatist actions constitute a great example of the institutional corruption and dividing trends prevailing in the Ottoman Empire at the time. His effort to become an independent ruler finally caused the reaction of the Sublime Porte, which sent the army against him. After about two years of fighting, in January 1822, Ottoman forces had taken most of the fortifications of Ioannina except the fortified palace inside the kastro. Ali Pasha opened negotiations. Deceived with offers of a full pardon, he was persuaded to leave the fortress and settle in the Monastery of St Panteleimon on the island in Lake Pamvotis, previously taken by the Ottoman army during the siege. When asked to surrender for beheading, he famously proclaimed: \\"My head ... will not be surrendered like the head of a slave,\\"Ali Pacha: Celebrated Crimes by Alexandre Dumas, p√®re and kept fighting till the end. He was shot through the floor of his room and his head was cut off to be sent to the Sultan. Thus, Ali Pasha of Tepelena died in 1822. > Hursid Pasha, to whom it was presented on a large dish of silver plate, rose > to receive it, bowed three times before it, and respectfully kissed the > beard, expressing aloud his wish that he himself might deserve a similar > end. To such an extent did the admiration with which Ali's bravery inspired > these men to efface the memory of his crimes. Ali Pasha was buried with full honors in a mausoleum next to the Fethiye Mosque, which still stands. Despite his brutal rule, villagers paid their last respect to Ali: \\"Never was seen greater mourning than that of the warlike Epirotes.\\" The former monastery in which Ali Pasha was killed is today a popular tourist attraction. The holes made by the bullets can still be seen, and the monastery has dedicated to him a museum, which includes a number of his personal possessions. Religion Ali Pasha was born into a Muslim family. Regardless, the struggle for power and the political turmoils within the empire required for him to support non-Muslim or heterodox priests, beliefs, and orders, and especially the Greek Orthodox population which formed the majority of the population in the region he ruled.Fleming (1992): 66 One of the spiritual figures which influenced him was Saint Cosmas. Ali ordered and supervised the construction of a monastery dedicated to him near Berat. Ali Pasha maintain control over the Christian population but respected the monasteries and stayed on good terms with the upper clergy. He strongly supported the Sufi orders, well-spread in Rumelia at the time. Ali was close to the dominant Sufi orders as the Naqshbandi, Halveti, S√¢d√Æyye, or even Alevi. Specifically the famous Sufi shrines in Yanina and Parga were Naqshbandi. The order that was mostly supported by him was Bektashi and he is accepted today to have been a Bektashi follower, initiated by Baba Shemin of Fush√´-Kruj√´. Through his patronage, Bektashism spread in Thessaly, Epirus, South Albania, and in Kruja. Ali's tomb headstone was capped by the crown (taj) of the Bektashi order. Nasibi Tahir Babai, a Bektashi saint, is regarded as one of three spiritual advisers of Ali Pasha. Ali Pasha in literature mace, now at the National Historical Museum of Athensleft According to the Encyclopedia of Islam, in Western literature, Ali Pasha became the personification of an \\"oriental despot\\". In early 19th century, Ali's personal balladeer, Haxhi Shekreti, composed the poem Alipashiad. The poem was written in Greek language, since the author considered it a more prestigious language in which to praise his master. Alipashiad bears the unusual feature of being written from the Muslim point of view of that time. He is the title character of the 1828 German singspiel Ali Pascha von Janina by Albert Lortzing. In the novel The Count of Monte Cristo by Alexandre Dumas, p√®re, Ali Pasha's downfall is revealed to have been brought about by French Army officer Fernand Mondego. Unaware of Mondego's collusion with the Sultan's forces, Pasha is described as having entrusted his wife, Kyra Vassiliki, and daughter, Hayd√©e, to Mondego, who sells them into slavery. Mondego then personally murders Ali Pasha and returns to France with a fortune. The novel's protagonist, Edmond Dant√©s, subsequently locates Hayd√©e, buys her freedom, and helps her avenge her parents by testifying at Mondego's court martial in Paris. Mondego, who is found guilty of \\"felony, treason, and dishonor\\", is abandoned by his wife and son and later commits suicide. Alexandre Dumas, p√®re wrote a history, Ali Pacha, part of his eight-volume series Celebrated Crimes (1839‚Äì40). Ali Pasha is also a major character in the 1854 M√≥r J√≥kai's Hungarian novel Janics√°rok v√©gnapjai (\\"The Last Days of the Janissaries\\"), translated into English by R. Nisbet Bain, 1897, under the title The Lion of Janina. Ali Pasha and Hursid Pasha are the main characters in Ismail Kadare's historic novel The Traitor's Niche (original title Kamarja e turpit). Ali Pasha provokes the bey Mustapha (a fictional character) in Patrick O'Brian's The Ionian Mission to come out fighting on his own account, when the British navy is in the area seeking an ally to push the French off Corfu. The Turkish expert for the British Navy visits him to learn this tangled story, which puts Captain Aubrey out to sea to take Mustapha in battle. Many of the conflicting versions about the origin of the \\"Spoonmaker's Diamond\\", a major treasure of the Topkapi Palace in Istanbul, link it with Ali Pasha ‚Äì though their historical authenticity is doubtful. Loretta Chase's 1992 historical romance novel The Lion's Daughter includes Ali Pasha and a possible revolt against him by a cousin, Ismal.

Written by Van Sant and Daniel Yost, and based on an autobiographical novel by James Fogle, the film stars Matt Dillon, Kelly Lynch, Heather Graham and William S. Burroughs. It was Van Sant's second film as director. At the time the film was made, the source novel by Fogle was unpublished. It was later published in 1990, \\"Drugstore Cowboy\\". by which time Fogle had been released from prison. Fogle, like the characters in his story, was a long-time drug user and dealer. The film was a critical success and currently holds a 100% rating at Rotten Tomatoes, with an average score of 8/10 based on 27 reviews.  Plot  In 1971, 26-year-old Bob Hughes leads a nomadic group of drug addicts‚Äîhis wife Dianne, his best friend Rick, and Rick's teenage girlfriend Nadine‚Äîwho travel across the Pacific Northwest robbing pharmacies and hospitals to support their habits. After stealing from a Portland, Oregon, pharmacy, they drive home to get high, and are visited by David, a local low-life seeking hard-to-find Dilaudid. Bob claims they have none but offers to trade him morphine for speed. Initially reluctant, David is persuaded to trade and leaves. Later, police officers led by Detective Gentry, who correctly assumes the group is responsible for the pharmacy robbery, raid and wreck the apartment in an unsuccessful search for the stolen drugs, which Diane has buried outside. After moving to another apartment, Bob realizes that Gentry has the group under surveillance. Bob then plots an elaborate deception which results in one of the policemen, Trousinski, being mistaken for a peeper by a neighbor who shoots and injures him. The next day, a furious Gentry assaults Bob. Believing a hex has been brought upon them, the group goes \\"crossroading\\", and robs a drugstore via an open transom. They find their haul includes vials of pure powdered Dilaudid worth thousands of dollars each. Bob, declaring, \\"when you're hot, you're hot,\\" convinces Dianne that he should rob a hospital. During the robbery, Bob is almost captured and the group returns to their motel to find Nadine has fatally overdosed on a stolen bottle of Dilaudid. She has also put \\"the worst of all hexes\\" on them by leaving a hat on the bed. After temporarily storing Nadine's body in the motel's attic, they are alerted by the motel manager that their room was previously booked for a sheriff convention and they must check out. Bob, suffering tremendous anxiety and stress-induced visions of handcuffs and prison, sneaks the body out of the motel in a garment bag. Before burying Nadine in a forest, Bob tells Dianne that he is going to get clean and begin a 21-day methadone treatment program. Shocked by Bob's decision, Dianne refuses to join him. Bob moves into a long- stay motel in Portland and gets a low-level manufacturing job. At the methadone clinic, he encounters an elderly, drug-addicted priest named Tom, whom Bob remembers from his childhood days as an altar boy. Gentry pays a visit to the motel and says that Trousinski has been making threats against Bob, whom Gentry encourages to stay sober. Bob later runs into David, who is bullying a kid who supposedly owes David money. Bob stops David and lets the kid escape, much to David's disgust. One night, Dianne arrives at the motel and reveals that she is now in a relationship with Rick, the group‚Äôs new leader. Dianne asks Bob what happened on the road to make him change his life, and he answers that Nadine's death, the hex she put on them, and the possibility of serious prison time contributed to his decision. He reveals a deal he made with a higher power: if he could get Nadine's body out of the motel, past the cops, and into the ground, he would straighten out his life. Bob suggests Dianne stay the night with him, but she declines, and gives Bob a package of drugs before leaving. Bob gives the drugs to Tom (who rejects all of them except for a bottle of Dilaudid). Returning to his room, Bob is attacked by two masked figures, one of whom is David, who think he has drugs. Bob tells them that he is clean, but David does not believe this and shoots him. A neighbor phones for help, and Bob is loaded onto an ambulance. Asked who shot him, Bob tells Gentry it was \\"the hat.\\" Whilst riding in the ambulance, Bob concludes in a voiceover that he has \\"paid his debt to the hat\\" and so can resort to his former lifestyle without breaking his commitment. He is amused by the perceived irony of the police driving him to a hospital ‚Äî \\"the fattest pharmacy in town.\\"  Cast  * Matt Dillon as Robert \\"Bob\\" Hughes * Kelly Lynch as Dianne Hughes * James LeGros as Rick * Heather Graham as Nadine * Max Perlich as David * James Remar as Gentry * Grace Zabriskie as Mrs. Hughes * William S. Burroughs as Father Tom Murphy  Production  Tom Waits was Van Sant's first choice to play the lead although the finance company would not support Van Sant if he had cast him. Officially the reason given was that Waits was appearing in another movie they were financing although Van Sant has said he suspected the Oscar win of Kiss of the Spider Woman, a film they had also financed, had made them want a lead who could win an Oscar. = Filming locations = Drugstore Cowboy was filmed mainly around Portland, Oregon, including in an area in the Pearl District that used to be a railyard, with a viaduct going over it.\\"Filming Locations for Drugstore Cowboy\\". miskoviec.com.
