Accessed September 8, 2007. The Greenway is being developed under the joint auspices of the New York City Department of Transportation and the New York City Department of Parks and Recreation. As of 2007, the majority of the route is in parks or otherwise segregated from motor traffic. The remainder is implemented as painted lanes or signed routes in streets. The 40-mile (64 km) route includes portions of existing bike routes in Prospect Park, and along Eastern Parkway and Ocean Parkway in Brooklyn, and in Alley Pond Park, Cunningham Park, Forest Park, Kissena Park and Ridgewood Reservoir in Queens.Brooklyn-Queens Greenway guide, New York City Department of Parks and Recreation. Accessed September 8, 2007. Queens North end Joe Michael's Mile Crossing Long Island Expressway to Cunningham Park The northern terminus of the Brooklyn‚ÄìQueens Greenway is in Little Bay Park, near the north end of Utopia Parkway in the shadow of the Throgs Neck Bridge. Passing the entrance to Fort Totten Park, the Greenway runs south, parallel to the Cross Island Parkway and is known as \\"Joe Michaels Mile.\\" After crossing busy Northern Boulevard, the route becomes a well signed bike route along quiet residential streets, climbing to the former Long Island Motor Parkway. The LIMP section of the Greenway is above-grade and most is closed to motor vehicle traffic. Using the LIMP, a branch of the Greenway goes eastward into Alley Pond Park to picnic tables, tennis courts and locker rooms. This eastern branch proceeds to the Alley Pond Adventure Course and the Winchester Boulevard bike lane. The westward or main line of the Greenway makes its way through Cunningham Park and Kissena Park, and eventually goes around the south side of Queens Botanical Garden on streets, crossing the Whitestone Expressway on its own high overpass into Flushing Meadows-Corona Park. Once in Flushing Meadows, the Greenway runs along the eastern shores of both Meadow and Willow Lakes, exiting the park onto Jewel Avenue. The route continues on quiet residential streets such as Hoover and Coolidge Avenues, and on more heavily trafficked ones such as Main Street, and crosses Queens Boulevard. The Greenway enters Forest Park at the Overlook and continues down Forest Park Drive passing the Urban Park Ranger station at Woodhaven Boulevard, the George Seuffert, Sr. Bandshell, and the Forest Park Golf Course. Exiting the park, the Greenway continues along parts of Cooper Avenue and other local streets to Highland Park and the Ridgewood Reservoir. Brooklyn After exiting Highland Park, the Brooklyn leg of the Greenway uses various local streets in East New York to connect to Eastern Parkway. From here to the end, there is little mixing with motor traffic for the 3-mile (5 km) Eastern Parkway bike route, 2 miles (3 km) through Prospect Park, and the 5-mile (8 km) Ocean Parkway to the southern terminus at the Riegelmann Boardwalk in Coney Island. The Brooklyn portion is less hilly than the Queens portion, except in Prospect Park where it crosses over the terminal moraine that divides Long Island in half.

White moves first. Turkish draughts (also known as Dama) is a variant of draughts (checkers) played in Turkey, Greece, Egypt, Kuwait, Lebanon, Syria, Jordan and several other locations around the Mediterranean Sea and middle east. Rules Qataris playing Dama in Souq Waqif On an 8√ó8 board, 16 ' are lined up on each side, in two rows. The back rows are vacant. A traditional Turkish draughts is mono-coloured. White moves first. Men move orthogonally forwards or sideways one square, capturing by means of a jump; they cannot move or capture backwards or diagonally. When a man reaches the back row, it promotes to a king. Kings can move any number of empty squares orthogonally forwards, backwards or sideways. A king captures by jumping over a single piece any number of empty squares away, landing on any open square beyond the captured piece along a straight line. Pieces are removed from the board immediately after being jumped. If a jump is available it must be taken. If there is more than one way to jump, the one capturing the most number of pieces must be taken. There is no distinction between king and man during captures; each counts as a piece. If there is more than one way to capture the maximum number of pieces, the player may choose. Within a multicapture, turning 180 degrees between two captures is not allowed. A player wins if the opponent has no legal move, either because all his pieces are captured or he is completely blocked. A king versus single man also wins the game.Zeybek, Atila. \\"T√ºrk Damasi\\" Turkish Checkers Rules. pp. 1-9, www.boardspace.net/checkers/english/Turkish_Checkers_Rules.pdf. Accessed 17 Sept. 2020. =Observations= * Unlike other draughts variants, since pieces in a multicapture are removed immediately after being jumped and before the captor continues jumping, as pieces are captured and removed, it is possible to cross a square previously occupied by a captured piece more than once, which can open up additional jumps previously impossible. * Without the rule whereby a player wins in the case of king versus a single man, the player owning the man could avoid capture indefinitely. World championships Since 2014, World Championships have taken place annually. The first official Turkish Draughts World Championships were held 22‚Äì24 October 2014 in Izmir, Turkey. The second championships were also held in Izmir, with the third in Doha, the capital of Qatar. The first Women's Turkish Draughts World Championships took place in Izmir during May 2016.  Trivia  * Dama can be played online against other players at Brain King and iggamecenter. * Dama was the core inspiration for the games Dameo and Croda. * In Dama two kings always beat a lone king under skillful play compared to 4 kings needed to capture a lone king in international draughts. * Dama has a much lower draw rate than Checkers or International Draughts.  Variants  Tobit is a draughts game that resembles Turkish draughts and Armenian draughts in that pieces move orthogonally (forward, backward, sideways). It especially resembles Turkish draughts in that pieces only move orthogonally. In Armenian draughts, pieces may also move diagonally. Tobit has a few distinguishing features. The game is played on a grid board and pieces are placed on the intersections and endpoints, whereas the other two games are played on a 8x8 square board and pieces are placed within the squares. The grid board is not a square or a rectangle. The grid board can be created by having four horizontal lines intersect five vertical lines. The grid board has 20 intersection points and 18 endpoints thus creating a grid board of 38 spaces which is smaller than the 64 squares (spaces) of Turkish draughts and Armenian draughts. Each player has 12 men distinguishable from the other player (whereas each player has 16 men in Turkish draughts and Armenian draughts). Each player's 12 men are initially placed in their respective first two ranks leaving only the two central rows vacant at the beginning of the game. As in Turkish draughts, men may only move one step orthogonally forward or sideways (left or right), but kings may move one step forward, backward, or sideways which is unlike Turkish draughts or Armenian draughts where kings may move several spaces to move or capture. It is played in the Republic of Khakassia of Russia. The history and etymology of the game is unclear. There are several variants as in different size boards and number of pieces, but the one describe here has become the standard. In the past, the grid board was drawn on the ground with animal bones used as playing pieces. The first competitions with the standard variant only began in 2002, and has grown significantly since then. Due to the game only having 38 spaces, the game is more of a tactical game and less of a strategic game as compared to Turkish draughts, but there is a lot of strategy in Tobit.

The novels were initially a trilogy, consisting of Ring, Spiral, and Loop. A short story collection called Birthday was released shortly after, introducing extra stories interconnecting the trilogy. Two further books, S and Tide, were published in 2012 and 2013, respectively. The novels revolve around a curse, embodied within a videotape, unleashed by Sadako Yamamura, the ghost of a psychic who was raped and murdered before being thrown into a well. Though the curse was initially presented as a supernatural force, it is eventually revealed to be a cataclysmic virus which Sadako utilizes for her own misanthropic ends. The success of the novels led to the release of numerous film adaptations in Japan, South Korea, and the United States.  Books  =Ring (1991)= This story is set in present-day Tokyo. When four teenagers mysteriously die one night at the same time, Kazuyuki Asakawa, a journalist and uncle to one of the teens, takes a particular interest in the case and investigates. This leads him to a holiday resort called Hakone Pacific Island, where the four teens stayed one week before their death. There he watches a videotape left behind in their room which contains a series of abstract and realistic images. At the end of the sequence of cryptic and disturbing images, a warning appears: \\"The one who saw these images is destined to die in one week at this time. If you do not wish to die, do as will be said from now on. That is‚Äî\\" but the rest is erased by an advertisement. This has a strange mental effect on Kazuyuki, who immediately believes that the tape has now placed its mark on him. He enlists the help of his best friend, Ryuji Takayama, a philosophy graduate and an admitted rapist. When Ryuji hears Kazuyuki's story, he watches the tape, and asks Kazuyuki to make him a copy for him to study at home. Their investigations lead them to the volcanic island of Oshima. After Kazuyuki's wife and child also watch the tape, Kazuyuki realises he must find the truth and perform the \\"charm\\" to prevent the deaths of both his family and his friend. Then their investigations lead them to search for a person named Sadako Yamamura. Sadako was the daughter of Shizuko Yamamura, who was known for her exceptional ESP abilities but later branded as a charlatan. In depression, Shizuko jumped into Mount Mihara's crater. Later they learn that Sadako, who lived 30 years ago, was still missing. The evidence leads them back to Hakone where they find a well. At the bottom lie Sadako's remains; Kazuyuki sets her free by giving her a proper burial. Thinking he has performed the charm, Ryuji and Kazuyuki go home convinced. At Ryuji's deadline, he is watching the videotape; the space around the TV becomes distorted. He dials Mai Takano, his assistant. The television shows the scene of rolling dice. Ryuji tries to telephone Kazuyuki and yells \\"Get me out of here!\\" before screaming as he is killed by the curse. When Kazuyuki realizes that the charm was to copy the tape and show it to somebody else, he rushes to his family to save them. =Spiral (1995)= The events in the story occur a day after Ryuji's death. By chance, Ando Mitsuo, Ryuji's former university classmate, is assigned to do the autopsy of Ryuji. He and his colleague, Miyashita, found a benign tumor in Ryuji's throat which is believed to be the cause of his death. They are puzzled because the tumor that they find resembles a smallpox tumor that was eradicated 30 years ago. Ando, along with his colleague, Miyashita, find out that an organism called the Ring Virus causes this tumour. The virus is transferred to the body through the tape and begins to grow into a tumour inside the viewer's throat. When the charm is not performed, the tumor grows until it blocks the airway and kills the person. To stop this, the tape must be copied and shown to another person. Inside his stomach they find the word RING and a series of cryptic messages. This further perplexes Ando. In search for the cryptic messages meaning, he comes to meet Ryuji's assistant, Mai Takano. Mai, who seems to know something about the videotape, tells Ando about the curse but is unsure how Ryuji died. As a scientist, Ando laughs at Mai's explanation. He goes to talk to Kazuyuki but finds that he and his family were involved in a car accident. It is discovered that Kazuyuki's wife and child were dead before the crash. Kazuyuki is critically wounded and unable to talk. At the accident site there lies a crushed videotape. When Mai suddenly disappears, Ando is further motivated to investigate. He stumbles upon Ryuji's files which contain the title, THE RING. He is uncertain about the discovery because it contains supernatural explanations and contradicts scientific ones. The virus mutated and uses the report as a medium. After reading the report, Ando has thoughts of Sadako and the well. Through a series of events, he is led to the well in Hakone. Days after Mai's disappearance, he meets a beautiful woman named Masako who introduced herself as Mai's older sister. He falls in love with her. In doing so, they make love one night and Masako ends up pregnant. Later he finds out that Masako and Sadako are the same. One night he receives a letter from Sadako/Masako stating; \\"Don't ever disobey me because you don't know who you are dealing with.\\" Ando chooses Sadako and is told to publish Ryuji's files and dominate the world. =Loop (1998)= A medical student named Kaoru Futami has a father who has contracted a deadly disease called Metastatic Human Cancer (MHC), a cancer involving both animals and plants. He discovers that his father was involved in a massive supercomputer project named LOOP. The LOOP was a computer simulation of the emergence of life but that did not succeed. It is known that everyone who was involved in the LOOP has died by the same type of cancer. In the course of events, Kaoru meets a woman named Reiko and falls in love with her. They sleep together, and Reiko becomes pregnant, which makes Reiko vulnerable to MHC. Kaoru continues his investigations, which lead him to a man (and the last surviving person involved in the LOOP) named Amano. Amano reveals that LOOP was a project involving 100 supercomputers strung together and aiming to recreate life. Amano tells Kaoru of a lab in New Mexico where another scientist might be alive. Kaoru goes there only to find the scientist dead. Then, he enters the lab and finds a pair of virtual reality goggles and gloves. He tried it, and minutes later he is in the LOOP. In the LOOP, he sees everything, but one event intrigues him, the emergence of the Ring Virus. He sees in detail all the events of the previous novels from different angles. After some discussion with Amano, he knows that the LOOP's creator wanted to recreate Ryuji's death and in so doing could clone him and insert him into someone's womb. The cloned Ryuji, however, had the Ring Virus in him. When Ryuji was born, the virus escaped and mutated into MHC. Kaoru is desperate to find a cure for MHC, but he encounters a storm that leaves him dying. He is saved by an old man named Cristoph Eliot, the leader of the LOOP project. He reveals that Kaoru was Ryuji's clone and so has an exceptional gift, immunity to MHC. Kaoru has to be analyzed so that his immunity can be understood. An analysis machine is created. The analyzed object, however, has to be molecularized in order to be scanned accurately, meaning that Kaoru might die. Heroically, he agrees to this. The old man transfers Kaoru's analyzed molecules into the LOOP. He promises that Reiko, his wife, can see him through the VR Goggles and that she will not be alone. In the LOOP, Kaoru is reborn through Sadako as Ryuji. He creates a vaccine for the Ring virus which he gives to Ando, re-enacting the epilogue of Spiral. The book ends with Kaoru/Ryuji sitting watching the stars, thinking that Reiko is watching over him. = Birthday (1999)= This short story collection consists of stories related to the Ring novels. It is also the conclusion to the Ring series. Floating Coffin ‚Äì These are the final moments of Mai Takano's life within the premises of Spiral. It begins when she watches the tape. She starts ovulating then, and Sadako's DNA is planted in Mai's eggs. After viewing the tape, she feels nausea. Unknown to her, Sadako is being conceived in her womb. Days later, Sadako has total control of Mai since she lacks the will to resist. Exactly seven days after viewing the tape, Mai gives birth to a baby Sadako. When Sadako is reborn, she kills Mai with her psychic powers. Lemon Heart ‚Äì The second story of the collection tells the story of Sadako when she was 19 years old in Tokyo. This is 30 years prior to the Ring. When Sadako graduated from high school, she joined the Hiroshi Acting Troupe as an apprentice. As days go by, she falls in love with Toyama, the soundman. Once, she is caught doing nensha with a turned-off TV. This alienates her from the group. While Sadako and Toyama are intimate, a spiteful member of the troupe records their conversation. When the member plays this recording, everyone who hears it dies five days later. Because of these events, Sadako flees to Hakone to her father, who is in the hospital. At a well, a doctor rapes her, but she defends herself with a psychic attack on the doctor. He retaliates by strangling Sadako, which incapacitates her power. Helpless, she is thrown into the well. As she dies, she has a vision of being reborn inside Mai Takano's womb, which occurs in the first story. Happy Birthday ‚Äì The final story develops the plot of the last novel, Loop, while incorporating new information disclosed in the previous two short stories. It depicts the last events taking place in the Ring universe chronologically and is also the conclusion of the series. Reiko is questioning the worth of giving birth to a child if the only world he'll arrive in is full of death. Her older son has died, and the father of her unborn child still missing. There she goes to a lab and learn the final secrets of the LOOP. = S (2012)= S is a 2012 Koji Suzuki novel and the fifth entry of the series. Following on the story told in the series of novels that began with the runaway bestseller Ring, this work starts with 28-year-old image processing specialist Takanori Ando being handed a USB memory stick by the president of the CG production company where he works. Tasked with analyzing its contents, Ando gasps at the graphic images he sees, and quickly concludes that they cannot have been faked or generated by CG software. Assuming the man in the video did indeed kill himself, what could his purpose have been in leaving this footage behind? Ando saves the file to his PC. When he plays it again the next day, the man's body has shifted to a lower position, and in subsequent viewings, the video undergoes further changes. Meanwhile, Ando's fianc√©e Akane Maruyama, a 24-year-old high- school teacher, learns she is pregnant with his child. When she is at Ando's apartment, she is drawn as if by an irresistible force to watch the suicide video on his PC. After examining the video more closely, Ando manages to identify the apartment building where he believes it was filmed. He also realizes that someone is following him, though intermittently, and that he may in fact be in danger. The man who holds the key to the story is philosophy instructor Ryuji Takayama, who appeared in previous volumes of the series. Twenty-five years ago, Takayama had died after watching a video that transmitted a curse, but, miraculously returning to life, he has been battling the evil villainess Sadako to prevent the Sadako Virus from spreading. Akane is in fact Takayama's child by a woman who carries Sadako's DNA, and the man who kills himself in the suicide is a way of informing Ando about the intervening events. =Tide (2013)= The sixth entry in the series, Tide is linked most directly to Loop. Film adaptations There have been several films made which are either direct adaptations of Suzuki's Ring books, or which create new stories using the same characters and background story of the books. Some adaptions have been made of Suzuki's 1991 book Ring. The first was the Japanese TV film Ring, released in 1995. This remained very close to the book but did not have the success of the later films. In 1998, Hideo Nakata made a new Japanese adaptation of the book in his film Ring. The original sequel to this was Spiral, an adaptation of Suzuki's sequel to his first Ring book. However, due to poor reception, a new sequel, Ring 2, was released in 1999 which continued the storyline of Ring, but was not based on Suzuki's books. This was followed in 2000 by Ring 0: Birthday, which was based on the short story \\"Lemon Heart\\" from Suzuki's 1999 book, Birthday. In 1999, two TV series were made in Japan: Ring: The Final Chapter takes place after the 1998 Japanese film and there were a total of 12 episodes. A sequel TV series called Rasen was made, consisting of 13 episodes. One Ring film has been made in South Korea, the 1999 film The Ring Virus. Three full-length Ring films were made in the United States, plus one short film. In 2002, The Ring was released. This was a remake of Nakata's 1998 film. A short film, Rings, was released in 2005 to fill the gaps between the 2002 film and the second full- length film The Ring Two, also released in 2005. A third full-length film, also titled Rings, was released in 2017. In 2012, Sadako 3D was released, adapted from Suzuki's book S, and in 2013, Sadako 3D 2 was released. In 2016 Sadako vs. Kayako, directed by K≈çji Shiraishi, was released. It is a crossover of the Ju-on and Ring series of horror films. It features Sadakaya, a ghost that resulted from the fusion of Sadako and the Ju-on antagonist Kayako Saeki. On May 24, 2019, Sadako was released in Japan. Ring references in other films The 2003 film Scary Movie 3 significantly parodies the American remake film The Ring. The 2009 season 5 episode of Ghost Whisperer, \\"Head Over Heels\\", contains horses going crazy. The episode makes a direct comparison with Samara driving the horses crazy in her barn with her nensha powers. The 2013 season 5 episode of Castle, \\"Scared to Death\\", contains a haunted DVD so scary that it kills people three days after they watch it.TV.com, \\"Scared to Death\\"BroadwayWorld.com, \\"VIDEO: Sneak Peek - 'Scared to Death' on the Next CASTLE\\", 15 March 2013 The episode makes a direct comparison between the curse and The Ring.Castle episode \\"Scared to Death\\", airdate March 18, 2013  See also  * The Ring (franchise) References * Loopkai Project * the Ring AREA * Vertical, Inc.

Kwakwaka'wakw house, Fort Rupert, 1885 Fort Rupert is the site of a former Hudson's Bay Company fort which was built and first commanded by William Henry McNeill in 1849 and later by John Work. It is located near present-day Port Hardy, British Columbia on Vancouver Island. The community was named after Prince Rupert, the first governor of the Hudson's Bay Company. The company attempted to exploit a local coal seam in 1851 but gave up the attempt the following year and moved its operation to Nanaimo. Robert Dunsmuir, later a coal baron and father of BC Premier James Dunsmuir, began his life in British Columbia as a labourer in Fort Rupert with the Hudson's Bay Company. Cannons On June 6, 1889, the fort burned. Its charred remains were soon overgrown and all that remained was the huge stone chimney. The Nahwitti natives, who lived nearby, salvaged anything useful from the ruins, including metal objects such as knives, nails, hammers. They also took the iron and brass eight-pounder cannons and kept them in their village, Ku-Kultz. In World War II an airforce base was established several miles from Ku-Kultz. Some of the servicemen learned about the cannons and after the war they started to disappear. By the 1960s only three cannons remained at Ku-Kultz and by the end of that decade, only two pieces were left. In 1976 the only cannon left overlooked the bay and it was taken to Vancouver by fishing boat. This cannon is the only authenticated Hudson's Bay Company brass piece in Canada. Later, some scuba divers stumbled across six cannons on a sandy beach of an isolated bay in the region. First Nations The original fort was built near the important Kwakwaka'wakw village and trading site of Nahwitti. The present day village of Fort Rupert is a historic Kwakwaka'wakw village of the Kwagu'≈Ç (Kwagyewlth or Kwakiutl) and the Komoyue subgroup where the opportunity exists to see native carvers working on totem poles or other artwork and traditional crafts. The band government of the Kwagu'≈Ç is the Kwakiutl First Nation. Petroglyphs, though difficult to find, do exist on the sandstone formations in the higher tidal zones below the old Hudson's Bay Fort site.

The DH.3 was designed in 1916 as a long-range day bomber by Geoffrey de Havilland, chief designer at the Aircraft Manufacturing Company. It was a large biplane with wide-span three-bay wings, slender fuselage, and a curved rudder. It was powered by two 120 hp (89 kW) Beardmore engines, mounted as pushers between the wings. In addition to tailskid landing gear, two wheels were placed beneath the nose to prevent bumping. A second prototype, designated DH.3A, was built with more powerful (160 hp/119 kW) Beardmore engines, and the War Office placed a production order for 50. This order was cancelled, however, before any could be completed, because strategic bombing was not thought to be worthwhile, and twin-engined bombers were claimed to be impracticable. The two prototypes were scrapped in 1917.Jackson 1987, p. 51. The DH.10 was a development of the DH.3 which first flew in March 1918, but was too late to see squadron service during the war.

Burre was made a \\"freeman\\" of the Stationers Company -- meaning that he became a full-fledged member of the London guild of booksellers -- in 1596. From 1597 to 1622 he did business in a sequence of three London shops; the most important was at the sign of the Crane in St. Paul's Churchyard (1604 and after). Drama and Literature In the span of a decade, Burre published the first editions of four plays by Ben Jonson:E. K. Chambers, The Elizabethan Stage, 4 Volumes, Oxford, Clarendon Press, 1923; Vol. 3, pp. 359-72. * Every Man in His Humour, 1601 * Cynthia's Revels, 1601 * The Alchemist, 1610 * Catiline: His Conspiracy, 1611. Beyond the confines of the Jonson canon, Burre issued a number of other first quartos of Elizabethan and Jacobean plays -- Thomas Nashe's Summer's Last Will and Testament (1600), Thomas Middleton's A Mad World, My Masters (1608), Thomas Tomkis's Albumazar (1615), George Ruggle's Ignoramus (also 1615), and perhaps most importantly, Francis Beaumont's The Knight of the Burning Pestle (1613).Chambers, Vol. 3, pp. 220-1, 439-40, 451, 498. In the latter volume, Burre wrote the dedicatory letter to Robert Keysar, shareholder and manager of the Queen's Revels Children, the company of boy actors that had premiered the play in 1607; Burre congratulated Keysar on preserving the play after its initial failure, which Burre explained by noting that the audience failed to understand the \\"privy mark of irony\\" in the work. (One scholar, Zachary Lesser, has argued that Burre specialized in publishing plays that had initially failed on the stage. This would certainly apply to Beaumont's play, and to Cynthia's Revels and Catiline.)Zachary Lesser, \\"Walter Burre's \\"The Knight of the Burning Pestle,\\" English Literary Renaissance Vol. 29 No. 1 (Winter 1999), pp. 22-43.Zachary Lesser, Renaissance Drama and the Politics of Publication: Readings in the English Book Trade, Cambridge, Cambridge University Press, 2004; chapter 3. Other works Burre published works of non-dramatic literature too: Pseudo-Martyr (1610), the first printed work of John Donne; a translation of the Pharsalia of Lucan by Sir Arthur Gorges (1614); and Sir Walter Raleigh's The History of the World (also 1614). One story, current throughout the seventeenth century, held that when Burre told Raleigh how poorly that book was selling, Raleigh threw the completed second volume of the work into the nearest fire.Frank Wilson Cheney Hersey, Representative Biographies of English Men of Letters, New York, Macmillan, 1909; p. 365. This story is certainly apocryphal, since The History of the World in fact sold well, going through three editions in its first three years in print. Exploration Burre's link with Raleigh was not an anomaly: Burre was well-connected with both the Virginia Company and the East India Company, and published many volumes on exploration and related sublects, including some involving the early Pilgrims.Edward Arber, The Story of the Pilgrim Fathers, 1606-1623 A.D., Boston, Houghton Mifflin, 1897; pp. 112, 118. When the East India Company's second voyage to the East returned to London in May 1606, Burre issued the anonymously-authored account of the trip, The Last East-India Voyage, within a month. (Burre was the brother-in-law of Sir Henry Middleton, commander of the venture.) Burre similarly published the first law books of the Jamestown colony for the Virginia Company, along with a series of books on surveying, trade, and tobacco growing. (He published An Advice How to Plant Tobacco in England in 1615 -- which somehow failed to lead to a thriving tobacco agriculture in the British Isles.) Miscellaneous Burre also published a wide variety of books on many subjects, works now almost entirely forgotten, ranging from Thomas Wright's The Passions of the Mind in General (1601, 1604) to T. Culpeper's A Tract Against Usury (1621).

Baker's career as an author began when she was about 30 years old. She devoted herself successfully to novels; but after about 15 years, she wrote popular religious literature. Her most famous book, Tim, the Scissors Grinder sold half a million copies, and was translated into several languages. Baker published under the pen-name \\"Mrs. Madeline Leslie,\\" about 200 moral and religious tales. She wrote under her own name or initials, and under that of \\"Aunt Hattie.\\" She wrote chiefly for the young. She was still writing in 1893 when she died. Early life and education Harriette (nickname, \\"Hatty\\") Newell Woods was born in Andover, Massachusetts, August 19, 1815. Her parents were Leonard Woods and Abigail Wheeler. She was one of the many children who were named after Harriet Newell, one of the first American missionaries. She was baptized on December 10, 1815 in Theological Seminary Church, which is now Philips Academy in Andover. Her father was Dr. Leonard Woods, the founder of Andover Theological Seminary and a friend of the polymath poet Oliver Wendell Holmes Sr. She was called \\"Hatty\\" during her younger years. According to an account from her father, she nearly died of typhoid fever when she was about two years old. She had a nervous temperament and a lively imagination; and talents for composition. She also had a habit of walking in her sleep which had followed her from infancy. When she was a child, she had a guest in her house, William Schauffler. He was a German Jew who was sent to her father's care for his theological education. He remained in Andover for several years and most of the time in the Woods' house. Harriette saw that Schauffler had a grey overcoat that was too small for him and that he was shivering in the cold. This incident inspired her to form a sewing society with her Sunday School classmate, Elizabeth Stuart, and earn money to buy a cloak for Schauffler. After the sewing society, she and Stuart formed a literary society, which they named \\"The Fireside\\" with them being the only members. They met on alternate Wednesdays on which occasions they read a composition, a simple story, and discussed the styles with each other. This was before she published her work for the first time when she was eleven years old. She enclosed her short story to Deacon Nathaniel Willis with a note authorizing him to print it in his newspaper, The Youth‚Äôs Companion if he wished. She then received a for a short story to The Youth‚Äôs Companion and The Puritan, the Congregational paper of that time. She provided other contributions, from time to time, without informing the editor of her age. On June 17, 1829, when Baker was nearly fourteen, she, together with four sisters and a cousin, Almira Woods, set off for Abbot Female Seminary, the new academy founded by Mrs. Nehemiah Abbott. Baker attended Abbot Female Seminary during its first year of existence, continuing though age fifteen. She then removed to an academy in Catskill, New York, where her eldest sister, Mrs. Mary G. W. Smith, lived. After this, she studied under the instruction of private tutors in mathematics, history, and philosophy. Career At the age of 20, she married Rev. Abijah Richardson Baker, D. D., who was then a teacher in the Phillips Academy at Andover. She published during her residence in Medford, Massachusetts three small volumes, The String of Pearls, Louise Merton, and Frank Herbert. Of the second of these, the proof-reader in the office where it was printed, said: \\"I become so interested in the story that I forget to make the proper correction of typographical errors.‚Äù her duties as a clergyman's wife and mother of five sons prevented her from realizing ambition further except for occasional articles. In 1850, she removed to the city of Lynn, Massachusetts, where her husband was pastor of the Central Church. There she assisted him several years in editing two monthly journals: The Mother‚Äôs Assistant, and The Happy Home, which were extensively circulated. Many of her contributions to these periodicals were subsequently transferred to her volumes. From that period, she wrote and published constantly, her works being issued by different firms in Boston and New York City. In 1855, she published under the name of \\"Mrs. Madeline Leslie\\", The Courtesies of Wedded Life. About the same time appeared anonymously another large volume, entitled Cora and the Doctor, which was ascribed to many persons of eminence. In plot and literary finish, in power and pathos, this is considered one of her happiest efforts, and called forth flattering notices and reviews from Washington Irving and other distinguished critics. The name of its author was repeatedly called for, and at length the call was answered by its issue with other volumes from her pen in a series entitled, Home Life. Many of her books had a religious or moral theme and her style was considered very true to life, with well drawn characters. Publishers of her books include Lee & Shepard. The wave of evangelical feeling that passed over New England consequent on the preaching of Dr. Finney, the evangelist, powerfully affected Baker, and turned her literary activities in religious channels. In the heyday of her success, the coming out of one of her books was looked upon as an event by her readers, and it was thought nothing remarkable to strike off an edition of 10,000 copies on the first appearance of a story whose title page bore the name of Madeline Leslie. Annual sales varied from 250,000 to 500,000. Most of Baker's books were tales for Sunday-school and general reading. They attained great popularity, and several were republished in England, and were translated into German, French and Bohemian. Included in the list are the Silver Lake, Golden Spring, Brookside, as well as the \\"Tim\\" series and the \\"Leslie\\" stories. Tim: The Scissors Grinder, was her most popular book, and (in the form of a cheap reprint) was sold or given away by thousands in England. Some of these were published over the pseudonyms \\"Mrs. Madeline Leslie\\" and \\"Aunt Hattie\\". Others, such as The Courtesies of Wedded Life (1855; new ed., 1869), and Cora and the Doctor, were published anonymously. In late years, a new generation appeared, which was somewhat out of touch with the spirit of Baker's writings. She was well known in the older literary circle of this country. Her literary tastes and keen zest for the study of human character and action remained with her even in later years. Possessing the Macaulayan faculty of plucking the very heart out of a book in a space of time that for others would hardly more than suffice for turning its pages, she found in reading an unfailing delight. She was reading Victor Hugo's novels this week at the rate of a book a day, and on the evening previous to her death held an animated conversation with her son, Dr. Charles E. Baker, about one of the characters in Les Miserables. Personal life While in Catskill, she had a relationship with John Maynard, whose father, before his death had been a friend to her father's. She ended the relationship when she was fifteen after hearing a sad account of John's behavior in Yale. On October 1, 1835, she married Abijah Richardson Baker (died 1876), who for 15 years was pastor of the Congregational Church at Medford, Massachusetts. He established and built up the Central Congregational Church at Lynn, Massachusetts and was also at one period, minister of the East Street Church in Boston. She was very affected by her husband's death on April 30, 1876, that she wrote about his sickness, which was to quote in her language \\"bound in green in her library in Brooklyn\\". She had since then moved home five times. George Baker, her son, and his wife, Maggie had invited her to stay with them in Batavia. This was her first home and first journey alone. She arrived there around the winter of 1876‚Äì1877. She went east the following summer and stayed with her son William Baker in Northborough before they all returned to Boston. She visited Washington during the following winter before she went to New York. In 1880, she was living with her son, Dr. Charles Baker, her daughter-in-law, Mary, and her granddaughter, Sarah in Brooklyn, New York.Year: 1880; Census Place: Brooklyn, Kings, New York; Roll: 853; Page: 121C;Enumeration District: 198 In Brooklyn, she became greatly interested in a large sewing class in Charles' parish where she taught the class how to knit upon her son's request. Baker died in Brooklyn, at the home of her son, Dr. Charles E. Baker, at 244, Washington avenue, New York City on April 26, 1893. She was survived by five sons, four of whom were Episcopal clergymen. They were Dr. George Baker, rector of St. Luke's Hospital, New York; Dr. Charles E. Baker, of the Church of the Messiah, and Dr. Frank Woods Baker and Dr. Walter A. Baker, of Cincinnati. Another son, William Baker, M.D., was Professor of Gynecology in Harvard University.  Death  Harriette Woods Baker Gravestone According to her letters, on the evening of Tuesday, 11 April, two weeks before her death, she complained of feeling ‚Äúpoorly‚Äù and finding it difficult to sleep. Upon awakening, she coughed so incessantly that to quote in her own language, she ‚Äúsaw stars‚Äù. Becoming anxious, her daughter, Mollie, went over to St Luke's Hospital, New York, and secured a trained nurse. For a week after this bronchial attack, she felt very sick and prepared for death. A day before her death she was in unusually good spirits and felt so well that she left her room to walk with her daughter, Mollie through the hall into a back room to see a sunset. She held an animated conversation with her son, Dr Charles Baker, that evening about one of the characters in ‚ÄúLes Miserables‚Äù. According to the nurse, she slept unusually well that night. In the morning at four, the nurse who was called to her patient's bedside by her heavy breathing, lifted her up, as she had been directed to do at such times, when she said ‚ÄúI believe I am going to have another bad turn.‚Äù Then the nurse gave her some medicine and rubbed her, and at a quarter before five the patient said ‚ÄúThank you. I am relieved. Now I think I can sleep.‚Äù These were her last words before she almost instantly fell asleep. A few minutes later, the nurse who stood watching her was surprised at seeing a sudden change pass over the countenance of the sleeping patient, and almost immediately those signs of death which are so well known to a trained nurse, began to show themselves. Her funeral was conducted by eight clergymen of the Episcopal Church on Friday afternoon, April 28, 1893. Her death was covered in the leading papers of the U.S. and referenced to in Andover academic institutions. She had in her possession which she left for her family.New York, Kings County, Probate Records;Author: New York.

Moreover, her writings were all of moral tone, without mawkish sentimentality, but displaying a keen insight into the spiritual nature of man and woman, and a proper sense of their relations as moral and accountable beings. Baker's books were written in good English, and were remarkably free from catch phrases and harbarisms, from eccentricities and extravagance, from bad grammar and rhetorical faults, which might have depressed the standard of literature and corrupted public taste. Her style was simple, chaste, often elegant; her plan natural and progressive. Reviewers compared her books, for literary execution, moral aim, and influence, with those of Hannah More, Mary Martha Sherwood, and Charlotte Elizabeth. They inculcated high moral and religious sentiments, but were free from the dialectics of the schools, and from all sectarianism; and therefore they were found in the libraries of all Christian denominations. Many of her books were republished in England and other countries. Few, if any of them, were more popular and useful than Tim the Scissors-Grinder, later published in what was called the Tim Series. This volume first appeared as a serial in the Boston Recorder. Long before its completion in that paper, numerous applications were received from different houses for the right to publish it in a book. From all parts of the country, positive testimonials were received of its excellence and usefulness in the conversion and sanctification of very many.

History Taipei Philharmonic Orchestra was founded in 1985 by a group of enthusiastic musicians. It has come a long way under the direction of late American conductor Henry Mazer, who came from Chicago Symphony Orchestra and stayed with TPO for over 18 years. In 1990, TPO undertook their first overseas concert tours to Europe and North America, with performances in France, Belgium, Austria, the United States, and Canada. Franz Endler, one of Vienna's leading music critics, wrote in the https://www.hotnewspapers.com/austria-newspapers/der-kurier/356/, \\"The ensemble plays with precision and unity... the Sinfonietta is of considerable quality... This conductor (Henry Mazer) made Schubert come alive and touch our hearts again.\\"Retrieved from TPO's official intro. In 1995, TPO embarked on yet another tour to the United States. One of the performances was given at one of the United States leading concert halls, the Boston Symphony Hall. The New York and Boston media showed with positive reviews. Among them, Richard Dyer, the editor of the Music Page of the Boston Globe, who wrote, \\"The first sound of the Taipei Philharmonic in Boston Symphony Hall was electrifying. The way the orchestra plays is a real tribute to Mazers musicianship. Mazer has a rare understanding of how Verklarte Nacht is constructed, how it should sound and the wallop it should pack. They play with glowing sound, precision of intonation, absolute unanimity of impulse and rare commitment.\\" In September 2001, TPO, led by conductor Lin Tien-chi, had a tour to Scandinavia to give two concerts in Stockholm, Sweden, and Helsinki, Finland. This event was the first time that a Taiwanese symphonic orchestra has ever been invited to perform in Scandinavia. In the following May 2002, TPO went to Germany and Czech Republic as a guest performer during the Prague Spring International Music Festival with Czech pianist Martin Kasik, followed by concerts at the Braunschweig Classix Festival in Germany, and the Jan√°ƒçek International Music Festival in the Czech Republic.

It was originally recorded by Gene Summers and his Rebels, a rockabilly band from Dallas, Texas and was first released in February 1958 by Jan Records #11-100. On March 8, 1958 Cash Box Magazine picked it as their Sleeper Of The Week. In Billboard Magazine's Reviews Of Pop Records they wrote: \\"The artist is backed by a chorus and cheerful rockabilly support on this blues. The kids might take to this\\". They were right...within a few weeks of its release, Summers and his rockin' band of Rebels had their first big regional hit. \\"Straight Skirt\\" was flipped with \\"School Of Rock 'n Roll\\" an upbeat rockabilly song written by James McClung who was a high school friend of Summers. McClung was also the original guitarist for The Rebels and would continue to work with Summers well into the mid-1960s. Their recording of \\"School Of Rock 'n Roll\\" later became widely recognized as one of the 100 greatest rock 'n roll records. In the 1970s, at the beginning of the rockabilly revival in Europe, \\"School Of Rock 'n Roll\\" and \\"Straight Skirt\\" were re-discovered by a new legion of rockabilly fans and bands. Since that time they have become classic dance floor-fillers and have renewed Gene's career to the extent of worldwide concert appearances from 1980 to the present.

Opened in 1861, it was designed in the rural cemetery style by Calvert Vaux and Frederick Law Olmsted, later noted for their collaboration on Central Park. There are several thousand graves, some with excellent examples of 19th-century funerary art. Many of Middletown's prominent citizens of the late 19th century were buried there, including three Civil War winners of the Medal of Honor and one former congressman. In 1994 it was added to the National Register of Historic Places. Property The cemetery is located in southeastern Middletown, a few blocks from the city's downtown. It is a parcel built on the side of a hill. Mulberry Street is on the east, with woods to the north and west and a residential neighborhood on the north. It is built into a hillside that rises sharply to the north. The slope is cut into a series of undulating bluffs to accommodate the graves and curving roads around the cemetery. There is a pond near the upper end of the property and the remains of a second at the lower end. A tributary of Monhagen Brook runs across the property from the northwest to the east. There are groves of mature shade trees. At the front gate is a Gothic Revival stone office building. It is a contributing resource to the National Register listing, but is no longer used. Instead most administrative functions are handled at a more modern maintenance garage. Scattered throughout the cemetery are various mausolea and other memorials. History New York provided for the creation of rural cemeteries, which followed the model of Mount Auburn Cemetery in Massachusetts by setting graves and monuments in a pastoral natural setting, in 1847. Under that act, the Hillside Cemetery Association was formed in 1860. Later that year it purchased of farmland in Middletown, which had only recently incorporated as a village, for its cemetery. Calvert Vaux and Frederick Law Olmsted were hired to design the landscape soon afterwards. An English immigrant, Vaux had worked for Andrew Jackson Downing of Newburgh, whose ideas about a more naturally sympathetic architecture guided much home construction in mid-19th century America. Two years earlier, Vaux and Olmsted, another Downing disciple, had won New York City's design competition to create Central Park. This fame followed Vaux to Middletown when he began work on the cemetery the next year. It was consecrated on August 8, 1861. Vaux's Picturesque plan was followed exactly, but a planned observation tower was never built. The new cemetery soon gained a representative collection of contemporary funerary art. Monuments and memorials showed the influence of the Egyptian Revival and the sarcophagus of Scipio Barbatus. Decorative motifs such as garlands, angels and urns. Many headstones have carved female figures, symbolizing different things depending on what she holds. Two monuments have carved granite statues of Hope. In 1930 the stone office building at the front entrance was built. It fell into disuse after three decades, and thus the modern garage was built in 1992. Vaux's lower pond has also been mostly drained. Notable burials *Thomas D. Collins, 1847‚Äì1935.

It also forms part of Vallentuna urban area, which is a statistical, non-administrative, unit. The village was originally named T√§by, and has given T√§by Municipality its name. T√§by kyrkby is situated in the northern part of the municipality, close to Vallentuna Municipality and Lake Vallentuna. T√§by kyrkby forms part of the Vallentuna urban area (t√§torten Vallentuna). In June 2020, there were 8334 inhabitants T√§by Municipality Administration Office June 2020, unpublished data in T√§by kyrkby. History T√§by Church The name T√§by stems from T√§, which means bridge or paved road. The T√§ from which T√§by derives its name might have been a bridge that was built in the 11th century and financed by a wealthy Viking named Jarlabanke . \\"Kyrkby\\" derives from T√§by kyrka (T√§by church) which was built in the mid-13th century. The church is well known for its beautiful and colorful paintings by Albertus Pictor, including a motif of Death playing chess. This image provided inspiration for Ingmar Bergman‚Äôs movie The Seventh Seal. Visitors may walk along an ancient path which winds its way through the land south of the priest's house. Along this path, one can see the remains of house terraces, graves, walls and paved roads. These structures were built by farmers who cultivated the land in the Iron Age, almost 2000 years ago. In the beginning of the 20th century, the construction of the Roslagsbanan (the train line of Roslagen) made it popular to build summer houses by the train line. A well- known Swedish opera singer, Adolf Lemon, bought land that he sectioned and sold. In 1950, a new city hall was built in Roslags N√§sby, which, has become a more central part of T√§by in the twentieth century. The administration of the town was moved to the new city hall at this time. In 1968, when the new T√§by center was built, T√§by was renamed T√§by kyrkby, and the town was named T√§by. During the 1960s, as part of the Million Programme (the building of a million new and modern apartments), a series of high-rise apartments was planned for T√§by kyrkby. The plans had to be abandoned after only one eight-story apartment was built, because it was discovered that the ground, which used to be the bottom of a lake, was not suitable for large structures. The one building was sinking as a result of the unstable ground. During the 1960s, several √Ösa-Nisse movies, set in the county of Sm√•land in the southern part of Sweden, were filmed in T√§by kyrkby. T√§by Kyrkby has four schools: Byleskolan, Midg√•rdsskolan, Kyrkskolan and Skolhagenskolan. There is a shopping center with grocery stores, a convenience store, a bank, a few restaurants, and a bakery. There are two golf courses. The southern part of T√§by kyrkby is home to an area of light industries. The train Roslagsbanan is the quickest way to get to Stockholm from T√§by kyrkby.

It can lead to failure by fatigue as described below, and is of particular concern when considering the design of critical fastener joints. Mechanism The mechanism behind embedment is different from creep. When the loading of the joint varies (e.g. due to vibration or thermal expansion) the protruding points of the imperfect surfaces will see local stress concentrations and yield until the stress concentration is relieved. Over time, surfaces can flatten an appreciable amount in the order of thousandths of an inch. Consequences In critical fastener joints, embedment can mean loss of preload. Flattening of a surface allows the strain of a screw to relax, which in turn correlates with a loss in tension and thus preload. In bolted joints with particularly short grip lengths, the loss of preload due to embedment can be especially significant, causing complete loss of preload. Therefore, embedment can lead directly to loosening of a fastener joint and subsequent fatigue failure. In bolted joints, most of the embedment occurs during torquing. Only embedment that occurs after installation can cause a loss of preload, and values of up to 0.0005 inches can be seen at each surface mate, as reported by SAE. Prevention and solutions Embedment can be prevented by designing mating surfaces of a joint to have high surface hardness and very smooth surface finish. Exceptionally hard and smooth surfaces will have less susceptibility to the mechanism that causes embedment. In most cases, some degree of embedment is inevitable. That said, short grip lengths should be avoided. For two bolted joints of identical design and installation, except the second having a longer grip length, the first joint will be more likely to loosen and fail. Since both joints have the same loading, the surfaces will experience the same amount of embedment. However, the relaxation in strain is less significant to the longer grip length and the loss in preload will be minimized. For this reason, bolted joints should always be designed with careful consideration for the grip length. If a short grip length can not be avoided, the use of conical spring washers (Belleville washers or disc springs) can also reduce the loss of bolt pre-load due to embedment.

History  = 1615‚Äì1818 = The monastic community was founded in Paris in 1615 and moved to Douai after the French Revolution taking over the former buildings of the community of St Gregory. The monastery provided educational opportunities from the beginning, but had no formal school in its first decades of existence. A boarding school later emerged in a dependent priory at La Celle. = 1818‚Äì1903 = Following the move to Douai in 1818, and the refoundation of the community by Richard Marsh, a more recognisable school emerged and by 1823, there were 28 boys on the roll. Around that time, the fees for students were being advertised at ¬£32 a year or ¬£30 for church students.'The Catholicon' (1836) 26. Links with the Roman Catholic dioceses in England were crucial to the school's survival. In the 1880s the Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Birmingham was sending seven boys a year to the school.Catholics of Consequence: Transnational Education, Social Mobility, and the Irish Catholic Elite 1850‚Äì1900, Ciaran O'Neill (Oxford, 2014), p.195. . Rather than the vertical house system of English schools, Douai retained the horizontal divisions of 'Rhetoric', 'Poetry', 'Grammar' and 'Syntax' throughout the nineteenth century, and even for a time in its new home in England.

Former pupils lobbied the Irish Parliamentary Party to raise the matter of the expulsion in Parliament. However it was Roman Catholic English Tories who espoused the cause: Lord Edmund Talbot in the House of Commons and 11th Lord Herries of Terregles in the House of Lords.O'Neill, p.194 The merger produced a school of 109 boy boarders, which had fallen to only 63 by 1911. Its long history in France and its monastic influence meant that Douai, although an independent boarding school, had in large part escaped the influence of the public school ethos that had developed in 19th-century England. However, in 1920, Douai was admitted to membership of the Headmasters' Conference. In the 1930s David Matthew, later Apostolic Delegate for Africa, congratulated the headmaster, Ignatius Rice, on the fact that: \\"no Catholic school has been so free from the influence of Arnold of Rugby as Douai has been.\\"The English Benedictine Community of St Edmund King and Martyr.

Masters and staff  The first headmaster was not appointed until 1909, replacing the older system of a Prefect of Studies and a Prefect of Discipline jointly managing the school under the oversight of the Abbot. A series of headmasters followed in quick succession, before stability was provided by Fr Ignatius Rice (headmaster 1915‚Äì1952). Ignatius Rice was a friend of G. K. Chesterton whose Father Brown novels were based on Father O'Connor, a mutual friend, and he was influential in Chesterton's conversion to Roman Catholicism in 1922. In his younger days he played cricket for Warwickshire during the summer holidays and for some years enjoyed the distinction of being the only monk whose cricket performances were chronicled in Wisden.Cricinfo ‚Äì Players and Officials ‚Äì Father Ignatius Rice In 2005, Edmund Power (headmaster 1993‚Äì97) was elected Abbot of the Basilica of Saint Paul Outside the Walls in Rome. = List of Headmasters = * Fr Adrian Coughlin OSB (1909‚Äì1911) * Fr Laurence Powell OSB (1911‚Äì1915) * Fr Antony Richardson OSB (1915) * Fr Ignatius Rice OSB (1915‚Äì1952) * Fr Alphonsus Tierney OSB (1952‚Äì1973) * Fr Brian Murphy OSB (1973‚Äì1975) * Fr Wilfrid Sollom OSB PhD DIC (1975‚Äì1987) * Fr Geoffrey Scott OSB PhD FSA FRHistS (1987‚Äì1993) * Fr Edmund Power OSB PhD (1993‚Äì1997) * Peter McLaughlin PhD (1997‚Äì1999) In November 2017, a former House Master, Father Michael Creagh was found guilty at Reading Crown Court of two counts of child abuse offences committed while he was at the Boarding School.  Buildings  In 1786 the Earl of Fingall, the squire of Woolhampton sold his Woolhampton estate and moved to Ireland. His family had been recusant Roman Catholics and had maintained a chapel and chaplain at Woolhampton House (now Elstree School). On leaving the neighbourhood he left his chaplain to minister to the local Roman Catholics and endowed him with some of lands and some cottages. Three of these cottages stood on the site of the entrance tower, and in one of these, Woolhampton Lodge, the priest lived and had a chapel. The oldest part of the current buildings date from around 1830. The main entrance and tower were constructed in 1888 in the Tudor Gothic style; the architect was Frederick Walters. In 1829 Fr Stephen Dambrine was appointed to Woolhampton. He embarked on a building programme which included a chapel in the Gothic style opened in 1833 to replace the chapel in Woolhampton Lodge, and which itself was replaced by the present St Mary's in 1848. The cricket pavilion was built in 1922 to honour the 56 Old Boys of both Douai and St Mary's College who were killed in the First World War. In the early years at Woolhampton, the school was seen as an appendage to the monastery and it was only with the foundation of a separate abbey church in the 1930s and the creation of distinct school and monastic refectories in 1944 that a degree of separation emerged. The Monastery was greatly expanded in the 1960s with the building of the new monastery designed by Sir Frederick Gibberd. Haydock Hall, the study hall, was briefly converted into a film set for the shooting of the dormitory scenes in the 1990 film Three Men and a Little Lady.The English Benedictine Community of St Edmund King and Martyr, edited by Geoffrey Scott, p. 149.Locations in Three Men and a Little Lady listed on IMDb.com.

After the closure of the School, the site was developed by Bewley Homes. The theatre block, swimming pool, science laboratories and Ditcham house were demolished, and were replaced by new housing. The main school buildings were redeveloped as private housing. The gatehouse, hall and three blocks of buildings are grade II* listed. In July 2017, a clubhouse for Old Boys and a museum was opened on the site of the former cricket pavilion.]  Houses  In 1951, the school was finally divided into houses, each under a monastic housemaster: Samson House, named after Abbot Samson of medieval Bury St Edmunds; Faringdon House, named after the martyred last abbot of Reading Abbey Hugh Faringdon; Walmesley House, after Bishop Charles Walmesley, the eighteenth-century member of the Community who had been a mathematician and astronomer. In 1980, a new house was created Gifford House, to commemorate Archbishop Gabriel Gifford. Faringdon ceased to exist in 1992, again leaving just three Houses.

Sport  Association football was introduced to the \\"old\\" school in the late 1880s. Before this, football was played to particular rules which allowed the use of hands and forbade any kicking backwards. Cricket had been played for many years in the old quad, but in 1885 a new pitch was laid at Douai's country house in Planques.'The Douai Magazine', 1895. External fixtures, which were unknown at old Douai, were soon organized after the move to England. Cricket and hockey were played at the new school from 1905, and from 1918‚Äì19 rugby union replaced soccer as the main winter sport (soccer returned as a minor sport in 1962). In 1920, the Trinidadian Louis Wharton became Douai's first Oxford University cricketer, having won a Blue for soccer the previous year.'The Tablet', 27 December 1919 He went on to play cricket for Somerset.Cricinfo ‚Äì Players and Officials ‚Äì Louis Wharton After the war the Surrey all-rounder Alan Peach was cricket coach, succeeded by Frank Shipston of Nottinghamshire.

Eton collars were worn until the 1920s together with a blue cap surmounted by the arms of St Edmund or a bowler hat. For daily use, boys wore a morning suit. In the summer, the uniform consisted of an Oxford grey suit and a boater. Uniform gradually became more casual and, after 1945, a variety of grey suits was recognised uniform, with blazers worn in the summer. In the early years, members of the Douai cricket XI would wear full ties around the waist and half ties from their collars.Blazers, Badges and Boaters: A Pictorial History of School Uniform, Alexander Davidson (Horndean, 1990), p. 131. .  Junior School  In 1948 a preparatory school (Douai Junior School) was opened at Ditcham Park, in the beautiful South Downs near Petersfield in Hampshire. The house was formerly a convalescent home requisitioned by the Royal Navy during World War II. Boys joined the school at aged 8 and after taking the Common Entrance Examination, aged approximately 13, joined the 'Big School' in Woolhampton. The setting for 'Ditcham' was beautiful in lush forestry on three sides and with views to the south of Hayling Island and the English Channel on clear days. In 1976 the boys from the junior school moved to the Woolhampton site and a new Ditcham House was added to Samson, Walmesley, Faringdon and Gifford Houses. In 1976 a non-denominational school was opened at Ditcham Park.

Early in his career, he was credited as Jack Mitchum.John Mitchum at IMDb  Early years  Mitchum was born in Bridgeport, Connecticut, to Ann Harriet Mitchum (n√©e Gunderson) and James Thomas Mitchum, who was killed in a railyard accident seven months before he was born. He was the younger brother of Julie Mitchum and Robert Mitchum. He served in the United States Army, 361st Harbor Craft Company, in Florida and Hawaii. Career Mitchum initially appeared in only unbilled (e.g., Flying Leathernecks, RKO 1951) and extra roles before gradually receiving bigger character parts. He supported his more famous brother on several occasions, and became known as the friendly, food-loving Inspector Frank DiGiorgio in the first three Dirty Harry films. Mitchum was one of only six actors to appear in more than one film in this series (the others being Clint Eastwood, Harry Guardino, Albert Popwell, Bradford Dillman and Michael Currie), and with Eastwood, Currie, and Guardino, he was one of only four actors to play the same character in each appearance. His character was killed in the third film, The Enforcer. In 1958, Mitchum was cast in two episodes of the crime drama Richard Diamond, Private Detective, starring David Janssen. He played Joe in the episode \\"Short Haul\\" and Jimmy Logan in \\"Bungalow Murder\\". On September 15, 1959, Mitchum appeared in the premiere episode \\"Stage Stop\\" of the Western series Laramie. Mitchum was cast in 1960 as Pickalong in 10 episodes of the Western series Riverboat, starring Darren McGavin. The same year, he appeared in the Western series The Rebel, starring Nick Adams. He also appeared as Hal Swanson in the 1960 episode \\"Silver Killers\\" of the Western series Tombstone Territory. From 1965 to 1967, Mitchum had the recurring role of Trooper Hoffenmueller in 11 episodes of the sitcom F Troop, starring Forrest Tucker, Larry Storch, and Ken Berry. In the 1967 episode of Batman \\"Surf's Up! Joker's Under!\\", he guest-starred as the character Hot Dog Harrigan. Mitchum was a writer, poet, singer, and guitar player. An autobiography/biography about his life and career and that of his brother Robert was published in 1998, called Them Ornery Mitchum Boys. He composed the piece \\"America, Why I Love Her\\", which John Wayne included in his book and album of the same name. The piece and a short film with Wayne's narration were aired at many television stations at sign-off time before stations began broadcasting 24 hours a day in the late 1970s and early 1980s. Wayne is often mistakenly credited with composing the piece. Death Mitchum died on November 29, 2001, after complications of three strokes. He was 82.

Landwehr-Division) was an infantry division of the Imperial German Army during World War I. It was formed on mobilization of the German Army in August 1914 under the \\"Higher Landwehr Commander 4\\" (H√∂herer Landwehr-Kommandeur 4). The Landwehr was the third category of the German Army, after the regular Army and the reserves. Thus Landwehr divisions were made up of older soldiers who had passed from the reserves, and were intended primarily for occupation and security duties rather than heavy combat. The division was primarily raised in the Prussian provinces of Upper and Lower Silesia. It was disbanded in 1919 during the demobilization of the German Army after World War I. Combat chronicle The 4th Landwehr Division fought on the Eastern Front in World War I. It was on the front in Poland from the early days, and participated in the Gorlice-Tarn√≥w Offensive, crossing the Vistula in July and advancing toward the Bug, and eventually reaching the line between the Servech and Shchara rivers near Baranovichi, where the front stabilized. It remained in the line there until the armistice on the Eastern Front in December 1917. Thereafter, the division served in Ukraine and in German occupation forces in Russia. In November 1918, elements of the division were transferred to the Western Front, but had barely arrived in the line by the end of the war. Allied intelligence rated the division as mediocre.Histories of Two Hundred and Fifty-One Divisions of the German Army which Participated in the War (1914-1918), compiled from records of Intelligence section of the General Staff, American Expeditionary Forces, at General Headquarters, Chaumont, France 1919 (1920), pp. 99‚Äì100.

Similarly, the husband of an heiress could become the legal possessor of her lands. For example, married women in England and Wales were legally incapable of owning real estate until the Married Women's Property Act 1882. Kings who ruled jure uxoris were regarded as co-rulers with their wives and are not to be confused with kings consort, who were merely consorts of their wives. Middle Ages During the feudal era, the husband's control over his wife's real property, including titles, was substantial. On marriage, the husband gained the right to possess his wife's land during the marriage, including any acquired after the marriage. Whilst he did not gain the formal legal title to the lands, he was able to spend the rents and profits of the land and sell his right, even if the wife protested. The concept of jure uxoris was standard in the Middle Ages even for queens regnant. In the Kingdom of Jerusalem, Fulk, King of Jerusalem; Guy of Lusignan; Conrad of Montferrat; Henry II, Count of Champagne; and Amalric II of Jerusalem all received their titles as a result of marriage. Another famous instance of jure uxoris occurring was in the case of Richard Neville, Earl of Warwick, who gained said title via his marriage to Anne Beauchamp, 16th Countess of Warwick, herself a daughter of the previous Richard Beauchamp, Earl of Warwick. Sigismund of Luxembourg married Queen Mary of Hungary and obtained the crown through her, retaining it after her death. After the death of Sigismund, Albert II of Austria inherited the throne of Hungary by marrying the king's daughter Elizabeth of Luxembourg. A man who held a title jure uxoris could retain it even after the death or divorce of his wife. When the marriage of Marie I of Boulogne and Matthew of Boulogne was annulled in 1170, Marie ceased to be countess, while Matthew I continued to reign until 1173. In some cases, the kingdom could pass to the husband's heirs, even when they were not issue of the wife in question (e.g. Jogaila, who became king by marrying Jadwiga and passed on the kingdom to his children with Sophia of Halshany). Kings jure uxoris in the medieval era include: *Rudolph of France, whose wife Emma was daughter of King Robert I of France *Philip I of Navarre, who was married to Joan I of Navarre *Frederick II, Holy Roman Emperor, who was named King of Jerusalem by virtue of his marriage to Isabella II of Jerusalem *Louis I of Naples, whose wife was Joanna I of Naples *Philip III of Navarre, who was married to Joan II of Navarre *John I of Castile, who was a claimant to the throne of Portugal by virtue of his marriage to Beatrice of Portugal *Guy of Lusignan, who ruled as King of Jerusalem by right of marriage to Sibylla of Jerusalem *Philip of England, who ruled as King of England by right of his marriage to Mary I of England Renaissance By the time of the Renaissance, laws and customs had changed in some countries: a woman sometimes remained monarch, with only part of her power transferred to her husband. This was usually the case when multiple kingdoms were consolidated, such as when Isabella and Ferdinand shared crowns. The precedent of jure uxoris complicated the lives of Henry VIII's daughters, both of whom inherited the throne in their own right. The marriage of Mary I to King Philip in 1554 was seen as a political act, as an attempt to bring England and Ireland under the influence of Catholic Spain. Parliament passed the Act for the Marriage of Queen Mary to Philip of Spain specifically to prevent Philip from seizing power on the basis of jure uxoris. As it turned out, the marriage produced no children, and Mary died in 1558, ending Philip's jure uxoris claims in England and Ireland, as envisaged by the Act, and was followed by the accession of Elizabeth I. She, in turn, resolved concerns over jus uxoris by never marrying. In Navarre, Jeanne d'Albret had married Antoine of Navarre in 1548, and she became queen regnant at her father's death in 1555. Antoine was crowned co-ruler jure uxoris with Jeanne in August. Partial transference of power In Great Britain, husbands acted on their wives' behalf in the House of Lords, from which women were once barred. These offices were exercised jure uxoris. When Lady Priscilla Bertie inherited the title Baroness Willougby de Eresby in 1780, she also held the position of Lord Great Chamberlain. However, her husband Sir Peter Gwydyr acted on her behalf in that office instead. Conditions In Portugal, a male consort could not become a king jure uxoris until the queen regnant had a child and royal heir. Although Queen Maria II married her second husband in 1836, Ferdinand of Saxe-Coburg-Gotha did not become King Ferdinand II until 1837, when their first child was born. Queen Maria's first husband, Auguste of Beauharnais, never became monarch, because he died before he could father an heir. The queen's child did not have to be born after her accession. For example, Queen Maria I already had children by her husband when she acceded, so he became King Peter III at the moment of his wife's accession. although he is not technically entitled to it under the law. For example, Jaime de Marichalar was often referred to as the Duke of Lugo during his marriage to Infanta Elena, Duchess of Lugo. After their divorce, he ceased to use the title. His brother-in-law I√±aki Urdangarin was referred to as the Duke of Palma before corruption allegations prompted the King to take action. Since 12 June 2015, he is no longer referred to as the Duke of Palma de Mallorca, following the removal of that title from his wife, Infanta Cristina.

The family was established by Georg Ossian Sars in his 1878 study of Mediterranean cumaceans.  Description  Leuconidae retain the original number of free thoracic somites, but do not possess a free telson. Their mandibles are truncated dorsally to the molar. In males, the flagellum of the second antenna reaches beyond the hindmost edge of the carapace. Their gills do not have gill plates or other supports. The endopods (interior branches) of the uropods are present on two (or more rarely one) segments.

Mount Sigena is a hill of the Sierra de Alcubierre located 5 km to the south. Villanueva de Sigena is the birthplace of the physician and heterodox theologian, Michael Servetus (1511?‚Äì1553).

This was largely destroyed by fire in 1936 by anti-clerical Republicans in the Spanish Civil War. It is now in the process of restoration, and has been reoccupied by nuns since 1985. Several royal burials were made in the convent church, including Sancha, who died there, her son Pedro II of Aragon and two of his sisters. The chapter house housed extremely important Romanesque frescos of about 1200 by largely English artists, probably including some of those who produced the Winchester Bible; this was only realized after their destruction. The artists also appear to have visited Palermo before Sigena, as some influence from mosaics there can be seen.

After her parents' divorce, she and her mother, who took a job with a photo-imaging company, moved to a rooming house. Cain first became interested in music through listening to the radio and performing in the chorus at her elementary school. While in high school she performed in an a cappella chorus during the school day and began performing on a children's radio show and with a band organized by a local music store in Milwaukee. At the age of 17, Cain accepted her first full-time job in music as a singer with Jay Burkhart's band. In 1947, at the age of 19, she was introduced to Roy Kral by Bob Anderson, a fellow member of the Burkhart band. The couple soon began performing together in clubs in Chicago, and in 1949 they married. They recorded nearly forty albums for multiple record labels, including Columbia and Verve.

According to the 2018 census (INE), the municipality has a population of 49 inhabitants. It is the southernmost town in Aragon. Sierra de Javalambre rises north of the town and Sierra del Toro to the east. Economy The economy of Abejuela is focused primarily on agriculture and livestock raring. Some crops include wheat, barley, and outstanding quality truffle plantations, one of the best there is in Spain. Livestock raring is also high quality because all livestock are fed almost completely 100% natural. History There is little documentation on Abejuela, because almost all its files were destroyed in the Civil War. It is known from oral tradition, that the first settlers were people exiled to its highest and coldest point called Almansa, where the hermitage of Santa Margarita is located. It is believed that around the fifteenth century the first buildings on what is now Abejuela were built, these are the Church and the military tower in the square. Abejuela, is still one of the few towns that retains almost all of its architecture intact, with renovations remaining faithful to its surroundings and despite the years they have been kept in perfect condition. Location The distance of Abejuela from Teruel is 79 km, 78 km from Valencia. It is within the G√∫dar Javalambre region. Abejuela, has 8000 hectares of forest and farmland between altitudes of 800m and 1610m. The population is located at 1167 m high. For more than 50 years Abejuela maintained communication with its province (Teruel) since at this time it was only accessible from Aragon by a municipal road or a detour of 35 kilometers through the province of Valencia. The municipal district of Abejuela is bounded by Manzanera on the north, south and west by the Yesa, Chelva and Higueruelas and on the east by Andilla and el Toro, all these in the Valencia province except El Toro (Castellon). La Cervera Within the municipality is the hamlet of La Cervera. Unfortunately it is undergoing total abandonment, due to the lack of electricity and water. La Cervera is located about 8 km from the town and in its time was critical to the survival of Abejuela, because the weather there was softer and its lands were used for grazing and other necessities which in times of snow were useful within the district. Feasts The following feasts are celebrated on the following dates: *July 20 the feast of Santa Margarita. On this date the pilgrimage to the Santa Margarita hermitage is celebrated. *August 28 the feast of St. Augustine, Patron saint of Abejuela, and date on which the patron saint's day is celebrated. Monuments * Saint Agust√≠n parish church: Baroque style. Twentieth century. The Abejuela church is one of the few buildings in which its vault was made with the layout of a single arc. * The Santa Margarita Hermitage is a thirteenth-century construction.

Paleontological Discovery Centre The Paleontological Discovery Centre is a very interesting place to learn about Musterian culture, characteristic of the mid-Paleolithic period (between 50,000 and 35,000 BC). The Covacho de Eudoviges archaeological site is found at the top of a ravine which runs into the river Mart√≠n. It was excavated in 1969-70 and 670 flint tools, 50 ferrite cores and nearly 10,000 stone chips and other objects including the waste materials from tool making and ‚ÄúMusterian spearheads‚Äù were found. Unfortunately, the chemical composition of the soil has destroyed most of the fossils and bones which should have been left in the places where the prehistoric settlers ate. Bone remains which have been identified include a rhinoceros from the period mentioned, a prehistoric horse and an animal belonging to the deer family, probably a buck, from the mid to late pleistocene period. Pottery from the nomads in the late Neolithic or early Bronze Age was also found. The town produces olives which are used to make an Olive oil, which has a special guarantee of quality and origin.

According to the 2008 census (INE), the municipality has a population of 217 inhabitants, and covers an area of 34.27 square kilometres. It is situated in the Franja de Ponent.  Municipality  Arens de Lledo is very near neighbours with Horta de San Juan, Catalunya on one side (known for its entrance to the Natural Park El Ports and that it is said that Picasso invented cubism after staying there), and also the cultural capital of Matarra√±a Calaceite, (Aragon) an old favourite for visiting artists from all round the world. The village of Arens de Lled√≥ is located in the most eastern part of the province of Teruel. It is in a hilly area by the river Algars, which marks the border between the Terra Alta (Catalonia) and Aragon. The river Algars has a very popular place where residents and visitors go to bathe \\"El Galero\\". Overlooking the village stands the Church of the Assumption of the Virgin Mary. The church is a Gothic structure (15th and 16th centuries) with an archway which dates from the Middle Ages. In the sanctuary stands a decorative sculpture of two fish, the symbol of this village. On February 8, 1983, the church was declared an \\"object of cultural interest\\". History  =Bronze and Iberian Period= First human settlement. =Islamic Era= Remains of an \\"Azud,\\"Arabic word meaning 'barrier', used with the usual river rise or flow in order to divert a part of this flow to the canals. =Middle Ages= There are remnants of the Middle Ages within the old city wall and 6 km away. At the chapel of St. Hippolytus (Sant Pol), a base of a medieval column can be found. A cross of the Templar can also still be found is there. This holy place is today a centre of pilgrimage and a procession is held every year on the first Saturday in May. Tradition says that this place was visited by women to ask for fertility. The path to the chapel is flanked by ancient cypress trees. =Contemporary era= The Spanish Civil War, (1936 to 1939) also affected this village. In the nearby town of Gandesa (in Catalonia) there is a museum about the Battle of the Ebro. Due to the large post-war chaos and very cold weather temperatures (which affected farming), there was a migration to and around Barcelona and also to Valencia, in order to search for new employment opportunities.  Ermita de San Pol  6 kilometers from Arens de Lledo, but still within municipal boundaries, is the Chapel of St. Hippolytus (Sant Pol), built on a former medieval hermitage. Century old cypresses help to give a mystical feeling to the site of the chapel. This mystical feeling was probably the reason why this used to be a meeting place for well-known artists, in order to talk about their art. On the first Saturday of May each year there is a pilgrimage concluding with Mass held in the chapel. Economy Agriculture is the main source of income. Crops of olives, almonds and grapes are farmed. There is also a rapidly growing sector of Rural Tourism, with a range of accommodation and activities. There is a winery that produces wines of great quality, a few small shops and an agricultural cooperative.  Demography  Probably because of the beautiful landscape of this area the population has increased rapidly in recent years, with people from elsewhere in Spain and even from other European countries and North America immigrating to the area. Indeed, the local school has a half local, half foreign population with the common spoken languages being Spanish and Catalan. Nature =Algars= The river Algars flows between Catalonia and Aragon.

Biography A native of Canandaigua, New York, Zuk attended Rutgers University, graduating summa cum laude with a degree in botany. Following graduate studies at the University of Delaware, she received a master's degree in public garden administration. Prior to accepting the Brooklyn position, she held the post of director of Swarthmore College's Scott Arboretum. The Brooklyn Botanic Garden, founded in 1910, was commemorating its 80th anniversary as Judith Zuk assumed the directorship. Considered one of America's leading institutions of its type, the Garden had just undergone a spate of construction work designed to expand its building area. The space dedicated to nature, however, was still in need of renovation and in the months and years to come, Zuk proved to be a tireless fundraiser, bringing in millions of dollars to refurbish such areas as the fragrance garden, the Cranford rose garden, the Japanese hill-and-pond garden and the children's garden. She was also an ardent conservationist and environmentalist, representing the United States at the Botanic Gardens Conservation International, a worldwide organization created to ensure the survival of plants facing extinction. Another of her projects was a new high school dedicated to environmental issues, which she realized with the help of the administration of adjoining Prospect Park and The New York City Department of Education. Later years Upon her retirement in mid-2005, she was honored with the renaming of the Garden's magnolia plaza as well as a golden yellow variety of magnolia, developed at the Garden, to be known as \\"Judy Zuk\\". Judith Zuk died in Brooklyn of breast cancer in 2007, ten days before her 56th birthday. References *\\"Judith D. Zuk, 55, Horticulturist, Educator, and Botanic Garden Executive, Dies\\".

According to the 2009 census (INE), the municipality has a population of 1,756 inhabitants. Mora de Rubielos has a beautiful 14th-century castle. Mora de Rubielos is the capital of the Comarca of G√∫dar-Javalambre.  Location and climate  The town of Mora de Rubielos is in the region of Alto Mijares, by the Fuen Lozana river, at the foot of the Sierra de G√∫dar. It includes three population types: the farmhouses, whose population is mainly immigrant is dying out; the small towns of Santa Luc√≠a, Troya, The Aliagarico, El Plano, La Cuba and The Masecicos, which retain their population; and the town itself. The town lies at an altitude of 1035 m; it has a mid-mountain climate, dry with cold winters and mild summers. Its average annual temperature is 11.1 ¬∞C and its average rainfall is 550 mm.  History  During the Middle Ages, the territory of Mora was reconquered by the troops of Alfonso II, being until the take of Rubielos in 1204 the most advanced position of the Christian forces against Muslims in the Kingdom of Valencia. It subsequently underwent a series of donations and sales; Pedro Ladr√≥n in 1198 received the town and castle from the hands of Pedro II, but his successor James I included it in the barony of J√©rica, donating it to his natural son Don Jaime. Mora was occupied by the Spanish troops in the War of the Two Peters but returned to Aragonese hands in 1364, receiving the privilege of Pedro IV for which it undertook not to separate it from the crown. Such privilege was not taken into account, being the town and castle sold to the Viscount of Cardona, Don Hugo, who, in turn, sold to Don Blasco Fern√°ndez de Heredia in 1367. Finally, the lineage of the Fern√°ndez de Heredia remained as owner of this population, taking charge of it in 1388 Gil Ruiz de Lihori, who changed his name to Juan Fern√°ndez de Heredia. In this locality there was a customs office for the collection of taxes on trade with Valencia. In the late fifteenth century Mora acquired the title of Marquesado and after the War of Succession, as a supporter of Philip V of Bourbon, received the title of \\"Faithful\\" and the fleur de lis on its shield. Pascual Madoz, in its geographic-statistical-historical Dictionary of Spain, 1845, describes the town divided into two parts, called a new Villa and the other Villa Vieja, which are separated by a small creek or ravine; It consists of about 500 houses of regular construction, being remarkable the city council. As for the economy, it highlights the production of wheat, corn, beans, potatoes, onions and vegetables as well as the existence of sheep. The book also mentions the manufacture of brown cloth and how in the past sackcloth for religious communities was manufactured there, but the extinction of these activitiesd had killed the industry, impoverishing the town. Although the War of Independence and the Carlist Wars left their mark on Mora, the greatest role of the town took place during the Spanish Civil War. In a phase of the Battle of Teruel (1937 - 1938), after the fall of Andorra and Alca√±iz, Mora de Rubielos was the capital of the republican-held area. Previously, an episode of insubordination in this village had resulted in the shooting of More than 50 men of the 84th Mixed Brigade on January 20, 1938.Carlos Engel, Historia de las Brigadas Mixtas del E. P. de la Rep√∫blica, 1999; p. 112 By May 1938, the territory in Republican rule in the province was defended by a set of staggered lines of a hundred kilometers long known as the Grande Arche de Mora Rubielos. As the war progressed, Mora fell into a difficult situation by the advance of the Franco-led army, remaining in the so-called Bolsa de Mora de Rubielos, until finally, on July 16, the troops of General Varela broke the front near the town. The information of the national side said on the front of Teruel our troops have conducted today ... a profound advance in a front of more than thirty-five kilometers, having taken and passed, in addition to many positions of great importance, the town of Mora de Rubielos. For a few days the headquarters of General Franco were in the town.

It was built in 1792, when the settlement was known as Brookfield. It is one of the oldest extant church buildings in the county, and one of the earliest buildings in the settlement that became Slate Hill. In 1976 it was added to the National Register of Historic Places due to its age and architectural interest as a late example of vernacular building techniques much more common in the early 18th century. Although there were no members of the congregation from 1933 until 2004, local preservationists continued holding an annual service presided over by an Old School Baptist pastor from North Carolina, and in recent years the membership has been repopulated. Building Located on a slight rise on the north side of Route 6 just east of the intersection with NY 284 at the center of the hamlet, the church is a tall white two-story clapboard gable-roofed structure. A four-story tower with belfry and spire, added later, stands at the front. The north (rear) and west sides are two bays apiece and still have most of the original sashing on their windows. The east side has three bays, reflecting its onetime status as the church's main entrance, and it still has the classically detailed doorway with sidelights. The cornice's original dentils are still present but difficult to see. Inside there are box pews typical of the era with raised and fielded panels, a late medieval touch. A hexagonal raised pulpit is mounted against the west wall. A three-sided gallery fills the building's second story; it can be reached via the tower stairs. The entire interior is done in unpainted white pine. A cemetery with gravestones dating to the era of the church's founding is located to the east. The only outbuilding is a non-historic outhouse because there is no plumbing in the building. History The meetings of local Baptists that became the church began in 1783 at nearby Woodlawn Farm, the home of member Richard Wood, an early local settler. Eight years later, in 1791, the church was formally incorporated and the following year another member, Joseph Hallock, gave land for the church to be built. It took the Brookfield name from the growing settlement. In 1828 the tower was added, with the stairs inside allowing more seating capacity within. Five years later, the church broke with mainstream Baptists and affiliated itself instead with the Primitive Baptist movement, which the year before had rejected the evangelical directions the denomination was taking in the Second Great Awakening. Believing that eschewing foreign missions and Sunday schools was more in line with early Calvinism, they were also sometimes called the Old School Meetinghouse of Brookfield. They kept Brookfield in their name even after the postal service forced the hamlet to change its name to Slate Hill to avoid confusion with New York's other Brookfield, in Madison County. After the Civil War stoves provided the building's first heat. Over the next few decades, the congregation began dwindling until its last member died in 1933. But trustees continued to hold the required annual meeting and maintain the building. In 2004, two members were added to the empty congregation by vote of the trustees, presiding pastor, and representative members from other Old School Baptist congregations. Aesthetics The minimal, classically inspired ornament on the church's exterior suggests an acknowledgement of the emerging tastes of the time, as the Federal style was taking shape. But the interior's use of heavy, inpainted timber and raised and paneled pews recalls late medieval English building traditions, and the pulpit in particular is of a style found in late 17th- and early 18th-century churches in New England. The Brookfield church is a very late example of a style much more popular long before the Revolution.

Built in 1894, it is a good local example of Romanesque Revival architecture. It served as a public school until 1981, after which it was converted to residential use. The building was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1980. Description and history The former Abbott Street School is located west of downtown Worcester, on the west side of Abbott Street between Pleasant and Chandler Streets. It is a 2-1/2 story brick building with a hip roof and Romanesque Revival styling. Its most prominent feature is a projecting central turret, topped by a conical roof. It has a dentillated cornice, and round-arch windows on the second floor of the turret. Windows have rusticated granite sills, and there is a wide stone water table between the basement and ground floors. The main entrances flank the turret on either side, projecting slightly from the main block and recessed under round-arch openings with a granite keystone. A two-story addition extends to the rear. The school was designed by Boston architect William Forbush and built in 1894. Stylistically it is similar to the 1891 Downing Street School, also designed by Forbush, but with less elaborate trim. It was built by B.C. Jacques at a cost of $20,000. In 1905-06 it was enlarged, with a sympathetic design by Worcester builder J. William Patston. The city operated the school until 1981, after which it was converted to residential use.

(ALV) is an independent not-for-profit animal rights organisation operating in Victoria, Australia. Founded in 1978 by Patty Mark, ALV is located in Melbourne. Its main aims are to abolish the property status of animals, institutionalised animal exploitation and speciesist attitudes and practices; encourage and nurture animal rights education, and endorse the principle of non-violence. Activism ALV was established in 1978 by Patty Mark, an animal rights activist. After reading Peter Singer's Animal Liberation in 1978, Mark put a notice up in the local milk bar that said Help the Hens which attracted 17 people and proved to be the start of ALV. In the early years of their operation, ALV set up information tables in the Bourke Street Mall, presented information discussions at schools and co- ordinated the signing of petitions. In 1993, Mark received a call about the inhumane treatment of hens at a battery hen facility in Victoria, inspiring the birth of ALV's Open Rescue division.

According to the 2018 census (INE), the municipality has a population of 447 inhabitants.  History  It was named Torrijos between 1495 and 1646, later being renamed Torrijo from 1713 to 1797, and adding del Campo from 1834. The placename derives from Latin, and means turret, which could mean that it was a border surveillance post in the various conflicts between the Crown of Aragon and the Crown of Castile. Torrijo belonged to the sesma of the Jiloca river in the Community of Villages of Daroca and it was already recorded in the Archpriesthood of Daroca in 1280. It was assigned to Sobrecullida, Vereda and Corregimiento of Daroca at different times, being a village until 1711, a place in 1785 and a town belonging to the partido judicial of Calamocha since 1834. The archaeological works carried out in the area confirmed the presence of ancient cultures, as in the case of Cerro del Moro,Cerro del Moro an area that was used as an old cemetery and where some pottery has been found. This oval-shaped settlement conserves as its only remnant a hollow in the rock that was possibly used as a cistern. Archaeological remains have also been found in the area of the Eras where fragments of Iberian pottery appeared, in the Masada area where medieval pottery was found or in the Iberian site of La Balseta. In addition, in 1996 a bronze plaque with an Iberian inscription was found on the road to Huertos Altos, which is called the Bronze of Torrijo. This finding was deposited for study at the Teruel Museum. Other archaeological remains are the uninhabited Villaverde, an Iberian town where fragments of Roman and medieval pottery has been found. In addition, between Torrijo and Monreal del Campo there was a medieval town called Villacadima, of which several buildings are preserved including the stone markers that delimited it and in which its name is engraved. Villacadima was a stately place, belonging to the Catalan de Oc√≥n family, which was not subject to royal or community law. For this reason, it often served as a refuge for criminals in the area. In 1311, and after the order of King Jaime II to acquire it, it was incorporated into the Community of Villages of Daroca. There is evidence that in the fourteenth century Villacadima had already disappeared, so its terms passed to the municipality of Monreal.  Economy  After the gradual disappearance of saffron crops, which in Torrijo del Campo had great importance not only economically but also traditionally, its inhabitants mainly focus their activity on rainfed cereal agriculture and in some irrigated orchards, meadows and forest areas. Livestock farming is also relevant, where a large number of pig, sheep, beef and rabbit farms stand out. In addition, the nearby towns of Calamocha and Monreal del Campo are the job destination for Torrijanos and Torrijanas, who thus complement the family economy.  Municipal symbols  As Mayor Miguel √Ångel Mel√©ndez, the Torrijo City Council initiated a file for the adoption of a municipal coat of arms and flag that ended with the authorization by the Government of Aragon through Decree 100/1997, of June 10, to adopt them. According to this Decree, the coat of arms should have the following form: ¬´a rectangular coat of arms in vert, bearing a golden tower with a circular base, embattled in sable and clarified in azure; a silver base, bearing two escutcheons with the Royal Sign of Aragon and on the bottom two others, full azure.

Illustrious Neighbors  Among its neighbors we find illustrious figures such as Francisco Cabello Rubio, Aragonese politician and jurist who held the position of Civil Governor in the provinces of Teruel, Castell√≥n and Valencia until in 1840 he was appointed Minister of the Interior. Also in the political area stand out Gabriel Campo Arpa, whose son Jos√© Campo P√©rez was Mayor of Valencia. Jos√© was named Marqu√©s de Campo by Alfonso XIII in 1875. Gabriel Campo Arpa's brother, Pedro Campo Arpa, was a military man who participated with the rank of Colonel in the signing of the final act of the War of Independence of El Salvador. His son Rafael Campo Pomar became president of El Salvador. Another illustrious neighbor of Torrijo del Campo is Fray Le√≥n Villuendas Polo who was a professor in Rome of Exegesis, Attorney General in the Holy Land, Definitor General and President of the Pontifical Athenaeum of Rome. In 1944 he was appointed Bishop of Teruel. Juli√°n Torrijo S√°nchez, another neighbor of Torrijo, was beatified in 2001 by Pope Juan Pablo II. We also find singers like Jos√© Mar√≠a Julve Terrado and Jes√∫s Benito Rubio, or the blacksmith Antonio Edo Mart√≠n whose handicrafts have been exhibited in various exhibitions held at the Museum of the Teruel in addition to being chosen in Barcelona for the exhibition of \\"Catalan Artists in Forge\\". Also a descendant of Torrijo del Campo is the swimmer Teo Edo Farr√©, who participated in the Olympic Games of Sydney 2000 where he got 24th place in the 1500 meters freestyle. Within the academic world, we find Calixto Plumed Moreno, professor at the University School of Nursing and Physiotherapy \\"San Juan de Dios\\"; Julio Palacios Mart√≠nez, prominent scientist member of the Royal Spanish Society of Physics and Chemistry and the Royal Spanish Academy; Pascual Rubio, professor at the Department of Geography and Spatial Planning at the University of Zaragoza; and Francisco Gasc√≥n Latasa, professor of Physics at the University of Seville.

It was inhabited by tribes of iberized sedentanos. Later there was the Roman occupation with a wide network of agricultural settlements (fundus) in the form of villas. A long Muslim occupation and residence (from the eighth century to 1610) left its mark in the local architecture in the Moorish styling of the village. The area was occupied by the Aragonese from the twelfth century, at the time of Ramon Berenguer IV and Petronila, becoming part of the Aragon defensive system. After multiple marriages, lawsuits and swaps, in 1268 King James I created the Lordship of H√≠jar for his natural son Pedro Fernandez de Hijar. Thereafter the town was always under the dominicatura of H√≠jar's house, until the abolition of the old regime, well into the nineteenth century.  Monuments  The village in rich in architecture, history and art. Some of the more notable structures are: * Iglesia de San Pedro Martir from the eighteenth century. Built in the baroque- style neoclassic of stone and brick. By the architect Agust√≠n Sanz in 1782. It had a Bayeu Ramon altarpiece, a painting of St. Augustine of Jose Castillo, and another painting by Francisco de Goya, \\"Apparitions of the Virgin to Santiago\\", all missing today. The main altarpiece is the work of painter Alejandro Ca√±ada, and there is a reproduction of Goya's painting on the altar of the Virgen del Pilar. * The Town Hall Facade of the same period, in civil baroque style, built with brick. The bottom four arches, two of them below street level give way to the old Moorish and Jewish quarter (La Muela) and the New District.

For the sake of publicity, he rode one lap around the course of the first stage on his mountain bicycle. Tour de Korea is the only international cycling competition in South Korea.

Tour de Korea is divided into two divisions: Elite for invitees and competitive cyclists, and a \\"Special race\\" for cycling club teams. The prize money for the 2011 tour totaled 200 million Won.

History Winchester introduced the .351 SL in the Winchester Model 1907 self-loading rifle as a replacement for the Winchester Model 1905 and the .35 SL. The .351 SL proved popular with police and security forces as the only chambering available in the model 1907, and was used by France in both world wars.Barnes & Amber, Cartridges of the World, p. 86. An experimental Thompson submachine gun was also made to fire .351 SL in 1919, but was never produced commercially.Sharpe, Journal of Criminal Law and Criminology Vol. 23, No. 6. (March‚ÄìApril 1933), p. 1106. The modern day While a few gun writers in the 1960s criticized the .351 SL for being inadequate as a deer round, and while the round's power has sometimes been compared to a .357 Magnum carbine load, the .351 SL's killing power falls somewhere between the .30-30 and the .35 Remington. Townsend Whelen praised it as a \\"good cartridge for deer and similar game in close timber.\\"Whelen, Townsend (1918). The American Rifle. Century Co. p. 266. Most commercially available loads for the .351 SL launched a 180 grain .351 caliber bullet at between 1,850 and 1,925 fps from a 20-inch barrel, yielding identical muzzle energy to the .30-30 when fired from a 20-inch barrel (rather than a manufacturer's long test barrel).http://www.ballisticstudies.com/Knowledgebase/.30-30+Winchester++.30+WCF.html When compared to other medium bore rounds, the .351 SL is closer in power to the .35 Remington (200 grain .358 bullet at 1,950 to 2,000 fps from a 20-inch barrel) than it is to the .357 Magnum carbine (180 grain bullet at about 1,600 fps). The .351 SL cartridge used an unusual bullet diameter of .351 instead of the .357 or .358 more commonly used in .35-caliber rifle cartridges.http://www.chuckhawks.com/351_WSL.htm Most ammunition available today for the .351 SL is produced by a few boutique manufacturers, often using either cast lead bullets or copper-plated bullets or, occasionally, .358 jacketed bullets resized to .351 or .352 caliber. This ammunition is often loaded to lower velocities in consideration of older firearms which have not been properly maintained, and large differences are seen over the chronograph relative to vintage .351 SL ammunition.\\"Winchester Model 07 Self-Loading .351 Caliber: Its Past and Its Future with Modern Brass, Bullets and Powders\\" (2011) Speckin, Leonard pp 68-70 But for the handloader who has taken the time to replace the recoil spring and buffer in the Winchester Model 1907, the .351 SL can be loaded to its original velocities.

According to the 2004 census (INE), the municipality has a population of 1,150 inhabitants. Principal industries are the balnearios (spa hotels) and a lighting factory. There are extensive fruit farms and some wine-making in the area. The town is served by railway services to Arcos de Jal√≥n and Calatayud, where there is a connection to the high speed AVE trains between Madrid and Barcelona. The 1957 film Los jueves, milagro (Every Thursday a Miracle), by Luis Garc√≠a Berlanga, starring Richard Basehart was filmed in the pueblo. Set in the fictional village of Fuentecilla, the story concerns a plot by local business men to revive the business of the spas by staging a miraculous appearance by San Dimas every Thursday evening. History The town has been known for over two thousand years, primarily because of the hot springs of the area. The Roman poet Martial refers to its pre-Roman name as Congedus. > O you, whose name must not be left untold by Celtiberian nations, you the > honour of our common country, Spain, you, Licinianus, will behold the lofty > Bilbilis, renowned for horses and arms, and Catus venerable with his locks > of snow, and eased Vadavero with ita broken cliffs, and the sweet grove of > delicious Botrodus, which the happy Pomona loves. You will breast the > gently-flowing water of the warm Congedus and the calm lakes of the Nymphs. In the Roman era, it became known as Aquae Bilbilitanorum, a reference to the waters of Augusta Bilbilis, the Latin name for Calatayud. The modern name derives from the Arabic Al-Hammam, meaning \\"the baths\\". An Arab fortress was captured by El Cid in 1070, but it then reverted to Moorish control until re- captured by king Alfonso I of Arag√≥n in 1122. In the ensuing three centuries the town was disputed by the rulers of Castille and Aragon, finally becoming part of the latter in 1457. In the nineteenth century, the hot springs were exploited and several balnearios were built, four remaining in operation and popular with visitors today. During the Spanish Civil War, Alhama was quickly occupied by the Nationalists. During World War II, some escaped Allied prisoners or war were interned in the town, along with airmen who crashed in or near Spain. Attractions A unique thermal lake of nearly two hectares is open throughout the year in the grounds of Balneario Termas Pallar√©s. The water is a constant temperature of 34 ¬∞C. The famous Cistercian abbey of Monasterio de Piedra with its water gardens lies approximately 25 kilometres to the south-west. The city of Calatayud which has famous mud√©jar church towers is about 35 kilometres to the north east. Other examples of mud√©jar art can be found in neighbouring villages.

According to the 2004 census (INE), the municipality has a population of 395 inhabitants. This town is located between the Ebro and the Matarranya rivers in La Franja area; the local dialect is a variant of Catalan. History Historically this town and its municipal term were considered part of the Matarranya, but presently it is included in the Bajo Arag√≥n-Caspe/Baix Arag√≥-Casp comarca. During the Battle of the Ebro some of the most bloody battles in the Spanish Civil War were fought in the Auts area, about 8 km north of Fai√≥. On 25 July 1938 the 42 division of the Spanish Republican Army successfully crossed the river in this area but was surrounded and massacred in the Auts hills by the rebels.La Batalla del Ebre Traditionally Fay√≥n was part of the Roman Catholic Diocese of Lleida. In 1955 the Cesaraugustanae et aliarum decree of the Consistorial Congregation was published and on the 2d September of the same year, Fay√≥n, along with Mequinensa was segregated from Lleida and merged with the Archdiocese of Zaragoza. The ancestral village was submerged by the waters of the Riba-roja Reservoir in 1967 and the present-day village was built by ENHER, the state- owned company that built the dam. After the closure of the nearby coal mines, Fay√≥n has lost about 50% of its population.
