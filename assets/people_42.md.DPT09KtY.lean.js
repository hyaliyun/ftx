Early years Izen was the son of Mr. and Mrs. Morris Izen who owned a shoe store on the northwest side of Chicago. When Izen was four years old, he began picking out melodies of songs on his grandmother's piano. At age seven, he developed an obsessive fear of the dark, which led to his parents' buying (based on a psychologist's advice) a pair of puppets, a stage, and a toy film projector for him. He went on to incorporate puppets into his performances. While Izen was a student, he entertained at parties, school functions, and meetings of women's clubs. In 1950, he won a talent contest on the Arthur Godfrey's Talent Scouts program, which led to a two-week engagement on stage with Godfrey at the Chicago Theatre. Izen was a graduate of Emmet Grammar School and Austin High School. He attended Northwestern University but left in 1943 to enlist in the U. S. Army, serving in Europe with the 104th Infantry Division and entertaining troops. After World War II, Izen studied at the Juilliard School of Music, following which he went to DePaul University, graduating with a bachelor of arts degree with a music major. Izen also pursued his interest in art, earning a scholarship to the Art Institute of Chicago while he was in grammar school and studying there later. Entertainment career Izen debuted professionally as a supper-club entertainer in New York. He went from there to perform in supper clubs and night clubs across the United States. His act combined playing the piano and providing laughs for the audience, featuring segments in which he manipulated puppets on top of the piano while playing the instrument with one hand. He went on to retain the piano-puppetry combination later in appearances on television and in concerts. Izen made the puppets' costumes and the settings in which they appeared atop the piano, with the settings designed to complement the themes of the songs he performed. Cast in plastic wood from clay molds, the puppets were patterned after well-known performers in opera and concerts. His more than 50 characters included a pianist with white hair who played a miniature Steinway. In 1959-1960, he was a regular on the children's TV program Wonderama in New York. In addition to playing piano and working puppets, he told stories and enhanced some of the stories and songs with chalk-talk illustrations. In the summer of 1960, Izen had his first concert tour, with 20 appearances at colleges and universities in the southern and midwestern United States. The performances consisted of part serious music and part his trademark combination of music, puppets, and humor. In the 1960s, Izen and Jane Norman were puppeteers for Tottle, a half-hour children's program on WCAU-TV in Philadelphia. The show ran for five years and, beginning in April 1962, it was also carried on WBBM-TV in Chicago. In the 1970s, Izen made a national tour sponsored by New York's PART Foundation in association with groups supporting the arts in cities in which he appeared. The concerts were oriented toward children ages 5 to 12. In addition to the usual combination of music, puppets, and comedy, Izen showed the youngsters how they could create puppets and other items for entertainment out of everyday materials, such as newspapers, that they could find at home. He continued touring and giving similar programs in the 1980s, adding elements that introduced 20th century artists' work to the audience in an effort to \\"bring out the Picasso in the kids\\", Izen said. Izen made several albums for children for Columbia Records.  Art and writing  Pastel chalk drawings by Izen were exhibited in art shows and were sold in stores, including I. Magnin in San Francisco and Los Angeles and Bergdorf Goodman in New York. In the early 1960s, he began working with Hallmark Cards, creating puppets and cards for their children-oriented product line. Izen and puppeteer Jim West were co- authors of two picture books for children.  Recognition  CBS-TV devoted an episode of the program Camera Three to Izen and his work. \\"The Adventures of Coslo\\", a mini-series broadcast on WTTW-TV in Chicago, won two Emmy Awards ‚Äî Outstanding Individual Achievement and Outstanding Children's Programming ‚Äî for Izen. Izen's The Isle of Joy, an animated film based on cutouts of Matisse, won the international CINE Golden Eagle Award, and his 30-minute TV program won awards from McCall's magazine and Ohio University. The Dog Who Sang at the Opera, a picture book by Izen and Jim West, won the Parents Choice Award. Izen died on May 26, 2015 at the age of 90.

It was the first Act implementing a major historical Treaty of Waitangi settlement since the Treaty of Waitangi Act 1975 was amended in 1985 to allow the Waitangi Tribunal to investigate historic breaches of the Treaty.  Background  The Act was the culmination of years of negotiations between Waikato Tainui and the New Zealand Government. Originally, Waikato-Tainui had made a claim by way of the Waitangi Tribunal, but in 1991 direct negotiations began between the tribe and the government of Prime Minister Jim Bolger. In 1994, a Heads of Agreement was signed. The Deed of Settlement was signed on 22 May 1995 by Prime Minister Jim Bolger and Dame Te Atairangikaahu at Turangawaewae Marae. The total settlement package was $170m.  Assent  Royal Assent for the Bill was granted by Queen Elizabeth II on 3 November 1995 in a ceremony at Government House in Wellington. Dame Te Atairangikaahu and other dignitaries also attended the ceremony. This was unusual and is the only piece of New Zealand legislation to date signed by the monarch. Originally, Waikato Tainui wanted both Queen Elizabeth and Dame Te Atairangikaahu (the MƒÅori Queen) to sign the apology. However, Buckingham Palace objected to this as it could have had implications for the other realms where the Queen is head of state, and indigenous peoples had claims against the Crown. Instead, it was agreed that the Queen would personally grant assent to the legislation (which includes the Crown's apology) as this would be on her ministers' advice.

She lived in Ohio as a young woman, trained as a stenographer before finding a career in dance.  Career  Joan Sawyer was a professional social dancer, demonstrating the newest ballroom steps at private parties and in nightclubs as an example for other dancers. Sawyer was a feminist social dancer, who believed her work advanced the cause of women's suffrage. \\"It seems evident that the spread of the dancing habit has done much for women,\\" she told an interviewer, \\"for dancing is the best form of exercise, for both the body and the mind.\\" Also for the suffrage cause, she drove an automobile decorated with suffrage banners across the United States in 1915, stopping along the way to give impromptu dance shows to raise funds for the suffrage movement. A reviewer in 1915 called Sawyer \\"as graceful as a summer cloud adrift in a sea of blue.\\" Among her dance partners were Rudolph Valentino, George Raft, Nigel Barrie, Wallace McCutcheon Jr., and Arthur Ashley. She danced with Valentino for president Woodrow Wilson. She was among the dancers who claimed to invent the foxtrot. She managed a nightclub, the Persian Garden, in New York City in 1914.Russ Shor, \\"Joan Sawyer: Jazz Vampire\\" Vintage Jazz Mart 161, pp. 7-8.

Fight the New Drug describes pornography as a drug and argues that it is a public health issue. The group spreads its messages through presentations and video campaigns, and targets people aged 18 to 24. In a 2015 campaign, Fight the New Drug posted 100 billboards in the San Francisco Bay Area stating \\"Porn Kills Love\\". In addition, the group promotes its campaign via a social media presence and by selling merchandise, such as T-shirts and marketing kits.

Utah Attorney General Mark Shurtleff described the campaign as one of the best ways to fight pornography. Although Fight the New Drug purports to present \\"just the facts\\" regarding the effects of pornography, this has been disputed.

Samantha Allen of The Daily Beast described the group's message as \\"rooted in pseudoscience\\", criticizing the analogy of porn as a drug as contradictory to neuroscience research. Allen noted the campaign as an example of continued influence by LDS Church members over social issues, and pointed to the group launching the billboards in San Francisco as evidence of them intentionally targeting socially progressive regions. In an op-ed in The Salt Lake Tribune, a group of sex therapists stated that Fight the New Drug's leaders and presenters were not mental health nor sexuality professionals and did not have sufficient training to address these subjects appropriately, and noted that a claim by the group, that pornography affects the brain like drugs, is false because pornography does not introduce chemicals into the brain.

Bishop (1890‚Äì1939) was an American lawyer and politician who served as District Attorney of Middlesex County, Massachusetts from 1931 to 1939. Early life Bishop was born in 1890 in Wayland, Massachusetts to George W. and Gertrude Langmaid Bishop. He attended public school in Wayland and the Boston University School of Law. He was admitted to the bar following his graduation in 1912. Politics =Municipal office= Bishop made his first political speech at the age of 17 and spent a number of years stumping for the Democratic Party. At the age of 21 he was elected town clerk of Wayland. He left office to serve in the coastal artillery World War I, but returned after his military service and remained in office until 1924. He concurrently served as Wayland's town counsel for 10 years. From 1926 to 1930 he was a member of the Wayland school committee and 1926 to 1939 he was town moderator. In 1919, Bishop was the Democratic nominee for the Massachusetts Senate seat in the 5th Middlesex District. However, on October 30, 1919, he left the race and the Democratic party stating \\"I refuse to be in partnership with Bolshevism and anarchy, and for that reason I shall cast my vote...for the one great, true, patriotic manly man...Calvin Coolidge\\". =Assistant District Attorney= On December 22, 1922, Arthur Kenneth Reading, District Attorney-elect of Middlesex County, appointed Bishop as one of his assistants. He was retained by Reading's successor, Robert T. Bushnell. During his tenure as Bushnell‚Äôs first assistant, Bishop prosecuted over 6,000 cases. He obtained the first two convictions of Bushnell's administration - one for statutory rape and another for breaking and entering. In 1927, Bishop made the unusual move of arguing for the defense in a case he was prosecuting. The two defendants, who were Canadian tourists accused of attempting to break into a gas station, were immediately found not guilty. That April he handled the Harvard riot case, as Bushnell, a Harvard graduated wanted someone with no connection to the school to handled the case. All 11 defendants entered Nolo contendere and were placed on probation. =District Attorney= In 1930, Bishop entered the race to succeed Bushnell as district attorney. He won the Republican nomination and defeated his Democratic opponent by over 35,000 votes. In 1931 he ordered the arrest of Edwin T. McKnight, president of the Medford Trust Company. McKnight and one of the bank's directors, Frank W. Lovering were convicted of four felonies and two misdemeanors and were fined $5,000 and $2,500, respectively. In 1933, McKnight was convicted of larceny and sentenced to two years in the Middlesex House of Correction. He was granted early release for good behavior but he refused in order to delay his move to Charlestown State Prison. In 1933, Bishop began conducting a number of gambling raids. On August 26, 20 state troopers raided the Middlesex Motor Club in Lexington and seized illegal gambling equipment and liquor. The following day, Bishop personally led a raid of the Hamilton Club in Everett, which led to two arrests on liquor charges. On September 7, 300 slot machines were seized from the premises of the American Candy Company in Cambridge. In 1934, Bishop was reelected over Lowell, Massachusetts mayor James J. Bruin 176,583 votes to 145,549. In 1936, Bishop nol prosed an assault and battery by means of dangerous weapons case against Cornelius V.S. Roosevelt and Peter de Florez. On March 8, 1937, Bishop announced that he was forming his own detective bureau and requested that all state detectives in the county be removed. This action came after state Public Safety Commissioner Paul G. Kirk Sr. moved a state detective assigned to the DA‚Äôs office against Bishop's wishes. =Run for Governor= On February 7, 1935, Bishop announced his candidacy for Governor of Massachusetts in the 1936 election. He ran on a platform of \\"rigid adherence to Constitutional principles\\", cooperation with industrial enterprises, creation of government- funded old age pensions, job creation, removing barriers to industry, and a sound tax system. On April 17, 1936 he fired his lead assistant, Frank G. Volpe, accusing him of \\"disloyalty\\". According to Volpe, he was dismissed because he refused to \\"go on the stump for him as Governor\\" as Volpe's former boss, Robert T. Bushnell, was also a candidate in the race. Bishop ran well behind the Republican frontrunners John W. Haigis and Leverett Saltonstall and dropped out of the race before the party convention. =Defeat for reelection= In June 1938, Robert F. Bradford announced that he would challenge Bishop for district attorney. Shortly thereafter, a group of Republican leaders, former district attorneys, and lawyers including Robert Bushnell, Frank Volpe, Sinclair Weeks, Daniel Needham, and Benjamin Loring Young announced that they would support Bradford for District Attorney \\"as a public duty and necessity\\". Former state party chairman George G. Tarbell resigned from the Republican state committee to serve as Bradford's campaign treasurer. During his campaign Bradford criticized Bishop for trying a low number of cases (19 in 8 years), no-prossing almost 20% of the cases in his jurisdiction, and replacing the state police with his own force that included his son (who was still in school) and other untrained individuals. One of Bishop's assistant district attorneys, Julius H. Wolfson, resigned in order to support Bradford. Bradford defeated Bishop by a margin of 20,000 votes. It was the first time in the county's history that an incumbent district attorney lost his party's nomination. Following his defeat, Bishop supported the Democratic nominee, Joseph V. Carroll, over Bradford. Death On December 16, 1939, Bishop suffered a heart attack at his office. He died at his home in Cochituate, Massachusetts the following day.

It contains a single species, I. antarcticus, recovered from the Snow Hill Island Formation. Before its description, it was informally nicknamed the \\"Naze dromaeosaur\\", despite the lack of a \\"sickle claw\\" characteristic of the group. In 2019, the describing authors suggested that Imperobator was about the same size as Utahraptor. Discovery and naming The only described species is known from a single specimen, UCMP 276000, which was first uncovered in 2003 at the early Maastrichtian-aged Cape Lamb Member of the Snow Hill Island Formation on James Ross Island, Antarctica. The Cape Lamb Member has been dated to the early Maastrichtian, about 71 million years ago. UCMP 276000 consists of an incomplete isolated left pes including a portion of the tibia, an incomplete astragalus, a partial calcaneus and fibula, as well as an ungual, partial phalanges and metacarpals. The specimen was formally described as the holotype of a new genus and species, Imperobator antarcticus, by Ely and Case in 2019. The generic name derives from the Latin for ‚Äúpowerful warrior‚Äú. The specific name refers to the continent in which the specimen was discovered. Before Imperobator was officially described, a paper published in 2007 announced the specimen and assigned it to the clade Dromaeosauridae; as such it was nicknamed the ‚ÄúNaze Dromaeosaur‚Äù. This was problematic as UCMP 276000 lacked multiple characteristics of dromaeosaurids, including a prominent sickle claw, and as such the paper naming and describing Imperobator assigned it only to the clade Paraves. Description The holotype measures approximately 45 cm in length. From this an estimated length of 3-4 meters for the animal has been obtained using measurements from related species such as Utahraptor. This shows that Imperobator exhibited gigantism, a trait not often seen among pariavians and is best documented in genera such as Utahraptor, Austroraptor, Deinonychus and Dakotaraptor. Despite prior assignment to Dromaeosauridae, Imperobator has since been assigned to the clade Paraves due to certain characteristics that differ from those of dromaeosaurids, including the lack of a sickle claw, the smooth surface of the distal metatarsal II and the lack of an ungual of the second pedal digit. Based on evidence from other paravians, Imperobator most likely had a sort of feathery covering on most of its body. It would be also safe to assume that Imperobator was carnivorous, however weather it scavenged or hunted its prey at this stage is unclear. Paleoecology During the time in which Imperobator lived, Earth's climate was much warmer and humid than it is today and as a result Antarctica was without ice. The environment was mainly dominated by large dense conifer forests, cycads and gingkos. Despite the warmer climate, the animals inhabiting Antarctica at this time would have to endure long periods of darkness during the winter, much like what happens in modern-day Antarctica. Currently a plethora of other extinct organisms from the Snow Hill Island Formation have been discovered, which are likely to have interacted with Imperobator during the Late Cretaceous period. This includes the ornithopods Trinisaura santamartaensis and Morrosaurus antarcticus, the nodosaurid Antarctopelta oliveroi, the shark Notidanodon sp. as well as some intermediate elasmosaurids, titanosaurs and a pterosaur.

Background The clashes began after two Turkish soldiers were killed on 4 May 2019 in a confrontation with the YPG and one was injured. In retaliation the Turkish Defense Ministry claimed to have killed a total of 23 YPG fighters; following the incident a Turkish official told Reuters that a larger operation would be launched \\"if necessary\\". Timeline On 4 May 2019, the Syrian National Army (SNA) announced it had initiated an operation against the YPG in the villages near Tell Rifaat. The SNA managed to initially capture the three villages of Mar'anaz, Al-Malikiyah, and Shawarighat al Arz, facing little resistance. After taking the villages the SNA stated ‚ÄúOur aspiration is to reach Tel Rifaat and what is beyond it.‚Äù However, subsequently, due to heavy shelling by SDF as well as pro-government forces and a large number of landmines in the area, the SNA and the Turkish Armed Forces were forced to withdraw and the Kurdish-led forces recaptured all three villages. The following day, it was reported that the offensive had been cancelled in favor of more negotiations between Turkey and Russia to set up a joint demilitarized zone in the area. Aftermath On 18 May 2019, new fighting erupted in the Tell Rifaat area, with five rebels and one civilian being killed. On 9 June 2019, fighters of the Syrian Democratic Forces attacked Turkish troops, killing 1 soldier and wounding 7. In response, the Turkish Armed Forces responded days later with shelling.

In the spring of 90 BC, Li Guangli and two other generals led a force of 79,000 against the Xiongnu. Li defeated a Xiongnu detachment 5,000 strong and another one 20,000 strong, but he overextended and his supplies ran out, exhausting his men and horses. The Xiongnu outpaced them and dug ditches across their line of retreat. When they tried to cross the ditches, the Xiongnu fell on them, routing the entire army. Li Guangli surrendered. The other Han generals Shang Qiucheng and Ma Tong managed to return safely. Li Guangli married Hulugu's daughter.

Plot As described in a film magazine, Tommy Frazer (Dix) is part of a gang of crooks led by Tony the Wop (Griffith) and Kelley's Cafe is their hangout. One night gang member Skinny (Dromgold) is killed by a member of a rival gang, and police officers, hearing the shooting, come to the flat. The police find Skinny sitting at a table, apparently playing cards, so they leave, not noticing that a gang member was behind Spider and holding the cards. To get even, the gang gets 'Blondie' Clark (Lynch) to coax The Kid from the rival gang to their rooms, and Tony stabs him and disposes of the body. Tommy is caught in a forgery and is sent up to prison for three years. Ann Whittaker (Windsor), a fellow worker, nods farewell as he is led away. When Tommy is released he goes to a distant town and, using phony letters of recommendation furnished by Ann, he gets a job at a bank. Soon he is in love with Ann. When a large sum is delivered to the bank, he grows restless and decides to steal it. Having been entrusted with the time lock of the bank, he takes the package of money. The old gang, hearing of the money, comes to town. Tommy changes his mind about the crime, and, while returning the package of money to the vault, he is set upon by the gang and robbed. He goes to bank president Denton Drew (Gillingwater) to confess his part in the transaction, but is relieved to learn that the package did not contain any money, the banker having taken it home.

At the time, leading Chinese thinkers were interrogating how to approach the threat posed by encroaching Western states. Feng argued for China's self-strengthening and industrialization by borrowing Western technology and military systems, while retaining core Neo-Confucian principles. These ideas were further elaborated on by Zhang Zhidong in 1898 in his book Quanxue pian as \\"Traditional (Chinese) learning as substance, New (Western) learning as application\\" (‚ÄúËàäÂ≠∏ÁÇ∫È´îÔºåÊñ∞Â≠∏ÁÇ∫Áî®‚Äù). ‚ÄúZhongti xiyong‚Äù became a popular slogan used in the late Qing Reforms, including the Self-Strengthening Movement and Hundred Days' Reform.Pohl (2018), p.1. The concept was widespread among intellectuals in the late 19th and early 20th century, and it remains relevant in the modern studies of China-West cultural relationship.  Background  After the Anglo-Chinese First Opium War (1839-1842), Wei Yuan advocated for China to learn ‚Äúshipbuilding techniques and weapons production‚Äù from the west in order to subdue foreign invaders (‚ÄúÂ∏´Â§∑Èï∑ÊäÄ‰ª•Âà∂Â§∑‚Äù). He wrote about this idea in his book Illustrated Treatise on the Maritime Kingdoms („ÄäÊµ∑ÂõΩÂõæÂøó„Äã)in 1843. In the latter half of the 19th century (and early portion of the 20th century), there was heated debate in China about how the country could survive the threat from foreign powers and move towards modernity. As the Qing Dynasty moved closer to collapse, two general camps of thought emerged: Conservatives thinkers who rejected the utility of modern military methods, and the Progressionists who were eager to not only adopt Western technology but also Western political systems like parliamentary sovereignty.  Zhang Zhidong's Quanxue pian  The proposal of ‚ÄúChinese Learning as Substance, Western Learning for Application‚Äù by Zhang Zhidong (Âº†‰πãÊ¥û, 1837-1909) in 1898 in his book Quanxue Pian („ÄäÂäùÂ≠¶ÁØá„Äã\\"Exhortation to Learning\\") was seen as a reconciliation between the conservatives and the progressionists. Zhang stated that ‚Äúit was necessary to maintain the orthodox Confucian basis of society, and if Western thought was to be accepted then [it could] only [be] in order to strengthen the material basis of society, particularly military equipment in view of the European encroachment in China since the First Opium War (1839-42)\\".Pohl (2018), p.7. Some scholars criticized ‚ÄúChinese substance‚Äù as a conservative point of view that only reinforced Chinese Confucian traditions,Pohl (2018), p.7. while others viewed the slogan as an open door for legitimate western studies and a positive step towards China's modernization.Ding (2007).  Debates on Chinese Substance, Western Application  = The Reformists = After the First Sino-Japanese War in 1895, the Reformists proposed a new cultural concept of ‚Äúthe Integration of China and the West‚Äù, diverting from the original theory of ‚ÄúChinese Substance, Western Application.‚Äù Scholar Yan Fu asserted that \\"Chinese learning and Western learning both have their unique substance and application. If one treats the Chinese and the Western separately, then they both make sense; if one merges them together, then they both lose their meanings.\\" (‰∏≠Â≠¶Êúâ‰∏≠Â≠¶‰πã‰ΩìÁî®ÔºåË•øÂ≠¶ÊúâË•øÂ≠¶‰πã‰ΩìÁî®ÔºåÂàÜ‰πãÂàôÂπ∂Á´ãÔºåÂêà‰πãÂàô‰∏§‰∫°).Yan 1902, p.157. Kang Youwei, Liang Qichao, and other members of the Hundred Days' Reform also broke through the restrictions of ‚ÄúChinese substance‚Äù and strived to adopt the western political systems, industrialization, and capitalism. = Liang Shuming‚Äôs Refusal of Cultural Blending = The Chinese philosopher Liang Shuming (1893-1988) did not agree with ‚ÄúChinese Substance, Western Application‚Äù. To Liang, culture was a holistic expression of one unified underlying human attitude, so he denied an easy blending of Chinese and Western cultures. On one hand, he is a defender of Chinese culture. He believed Chinese and Western cultures were incompatible. Chinese culture is aimed at exploring autonomous moral principles and human nature, whereas the Western essence - the emphasis on liberty and rights - is derived from these particular aspects of human nature or actually belongs to the realm of moral principle.Ip1991, p.473. On the other hand, however, Liang ultimately advocated ‚Äúa complete acceptance‚Äù of Western culture because he believed only Western science and technology could solve the dilemma of China. In his book Eastern and Western Cultures and Their Philosophies(„Ää‰∏úË•øÊñπÊñáÂåñÂèäÂÖ∂Âì≤Â≠¶„Äã), he argued that if China was going to import Western science and government, it had to import and adopt Western culture as well. The solution with which he concluded his lectures muddled the central issue: to \\"completely accept Western culture while fundamentally reforming its mistakes\\". = He Lin‚Äôs New Interpretation of Substance and Application = He Lin (Ë¥∫È∫ü, 1902-1992) proposed to take Confucianism as the ‚Äúsubstance‚Äù and Western culture as the ‚Äúapplication‚Äù in his article New Development of Confucianism„ÄäÂÑíÂÆ∂ÊÄùÊÉ≥ÁöÑÊñ∞ÂºÄÂ±ï„Äã. He later revised his idea in Cultural Essence and Application„ÄäÊñáÂåñÁöÑ‰Ωì‰∏éÁî®„Äãinto that ‚Äúspiritual and rational thinking‚Äù is the ‚Äúessence‚Äù and ‚Äúall cultures from ancient to modern, from Chinese to foreign‚Äù are the ‚Äúapplication‚Äù. He thought that China should develop Confucian ideas through the study of Western philosophy. He promoted adapting Western art to enrich Confucian aesthetics, learning from Western religion to enhance Confucian ritual habits, and absorbing Taoism, Mohism, Legalism to enrich Confucianism. He Lin also criticized the so-called \\"Chinese standard culture theory,\\" advocating that Chinese people should melt the essence of Western philosophy and culture with a broad horizon and a free, independent spirit. He encouraged Chinese people to study and relish the beauty of Western philosophy and digest it into their own ideological achievements. Thus, they could transcend and discard the Western culture and create their own new culture.  Western Substance, Chinese Application  Chinese scholar Li Zehou (ÊùéÊ≥ΩÂéö, 1930- ) wrote the article ‚ÄúRandom Thoughts on ‚ÄòWestern Learning as Substance, Chinese Learning for Application‚Äô‚Äù (Manshuo 'Xiti zhongyong Êº´ËØ¥‚ÄúË•ø‰Ωì‰∏≠Áî®‚Äú) in 1986,Pohl (2018), p.1. turning around ‚ÄúChinese Learning as Substance, Western Learning for application‚Äù. Li Zehou stressed that only the real life of the people, the mode of production and economics could be considered as the \\"base\\" (substance). ‚ÄúSubstance‚Äù is social existence, including material production and spiritual production. Science and technology, which are cornerstones of social development, are therefore part of the ‚Äúsubstance‚Äù. Chinese ‚Äúapplication‚Äù not only includes the application of Western ‚Äúsubstance‚Äù but also that of Chinese traditional culture. Moreover, in contrast to Zhang Zhidong, for whom ti (base/substance) and yong (function/application) seem to mark two distinct realms, Li Zehou adheres to the traditional (Neo-Confucian) significance of ti and yong: i.e., they are not two different entities/modes but two aspects of the same issue (ti yong bu er ‚Äú‰ΩìÁî®‰∏ç‰∫å‚Äù) ‚Äì they cannot be separated into two, which means in his context, modernization is sinification.Pohl (2018), p.8. = Criticism = Fang Keli (ÊñπÂÖãÁ´ã, 1938- ) criticized Li's idea as ‚Äúold formula only in a new cloak.‚ÄùPohl (2018), p.7. Chinese writer Liu Xiaobo condemned Li Zehou because of the latter's advocacy of Confucian ethics and the aesthetics of tianren heyi (the unification of heaven and human).Pohl (2018), p.10. For Liu, beauty resides not in harmony but in conflicts. To reconstruct Chinese national character, Liu insists that we negate thoroughly the three primary theoretical paradigms underlying traditional culture: the Confucian democratic model of minben (for the people), the model personality of Confucius and Yanhui, and the concept of tianren heyi (unification between heaven and humans) \\"Explicitly placing himself in the tradition of those Chinese modernizers who advocated 'total Westernization'\\", Liu \\"accused Li Zehou of trying to revive the 'rationalistic' and 'despotic' Chinese tradition,\\" as scholar Woei Lien Chong explains.Pohl (2018), p.11.  The Spirit of Marxism, the System of China and the Application of the West  Chinese philosopher Zhang Dainian (Âº†Â≤±Âπ¥, 1909-2004) was an opponent of the \\"Chinese Substance, Western Application\\" in the 1930s. He thought this idea misleadingly framed Chinese learning as in opposition to Western learning. In 1987, Zhang introduced the idea of \\"cultural view of comprehensive innovation\\". He proposed that ‚Äúthe Chinese nation is the main body of building a new socialist Chinese culture, and socialism is the guiding principle of China's new culture.

Arrest in Ecuador  Ola Bini was arrested in an action that appeared to be coordinated with the revocation of asylum and arrest of Julian Assange, whom he counted as a personal friend and visited a dozen times during the time while he was being granted refuge in the Ecuadorian embassy. The government did not file charges, but made a statement that Bini had been arrested for an \\"alleged participation in the crime of assault on the integrity of computer systems\\" that was being investigated. The action appeared to reflect a broad repudiation of the political goals of Rafael Correa by his former Vice President Lenin Moreno: in reference to Bini's arrest, Interior Minister Mar√≠a Paula Romo told media \\"It‚Äôs up to the justice system to determine if he committed a crime. But we can‚Äôt allow Ecuador to become a center for piracy and spying. That period in our history is over.\\" The Ecuadorian president, Lenin Moreno, announced on July 27, 2018 that he had begun talks with the British authorities to withdraw the Assange asylum. On April 11, 2019, the asylum was removed and Assange was arrested. Ola Bini was arrested the same day at the Quito airport when he was preparing to board a long-scheduled flight to Japan, to which he had planned to travel for training in Bujinkan Budo Taijutsu, a martial art he had practiced since 2007. The arrest came a few hours after Assange was evicted from the Ecuadorian embassy in London. Bini carried at least 30 electronic storage devices. In response defense attorney Carlos Soria told Reuters \\"They are trying to link him with some sort of possible espionage case without any proof or evidence. He is a personal friend of Julian Assange, he is not a member of WikiLeaks, and being friends with somebody is not a crime ‚Äî neither is having computers in your home.\\" The attorney published a more detailed list of objections. (Translation of ) Romo alleged that Bini had been involved in the plot with two Russian hackers and the former Foreign Minister Ricardo Pati√±o, who had granted asylum to Assange in 2012, asserting that Bini had travelled with the Foreign Minister to Peru, Spain, and Venezuela. Pati√±o responded, \\"The interior minister said the Swedish man that was arrested yesterday worked with me. I have never met him. Worse travelled with him. Nor do I know Russian hackers. The only Russians I know are: President Putin, the foreign minister Lavrov and the Russian ambassador.\\" The following week Ecuador requested an Interpol Red Notice for Pati√±o, who fled the country after prosecutors attempted to charge him for encouraging protestors to block roads and enter public institutions the previous year. Bini's parents, Dag Gustafsson and Gorel Bin, said that their son had been threatened in prison and they would remain in Ecuador until he was released. They spoke at a press conference concerning his appeal and gave a half-hour interview with TeleSUR English. = Legal proceedings = An appeal with the Provincial Court of Pichincha was decided 2-1 against Bini on May 3: Judge In√©s Romero favored the appeal, but judges Juana Pacheco and Fabi√°n Fabara opposed it.. The site offers a collection of articles on this topic. On June 20, the Pichincha provincial court ruled in favor of Bini's habeas corpus request, ordering his release to occur the following day. = Investigative actions = On May 18 a server was taken from the offices of Telconet, which Ola Bini was described as renting for US$5000 per month. This action was initially described as a seizure during a search of company offices, but the company maintained that no search had occurred and the server was handed over under a mutual agreement. = Questioning by United States = Sources in the Ecuadorian prosecutor's office and the United States Justice Department told Associated Press that Bini would be questioned by the United States on June 27. = Reactions =  Analysis and commentary  News reports of the case have suggested that it, like the revocation of Assange's asylum, might be a response to the publication of the \\"INA Papers\\" in March 2019, which detailed offshore financial transactions of Lenin Moreno and family members. The papers, which prompted investigation by the legislature, may have been referred to by Interior Minister Romo when she claimed to have \\"sufficient evidence that [Bini] was collaborating in attempts to destabilize the government.\\" The papers were published on an independent web site and were disclosed in a news story by La Fuente; Wikileaks has denied any role in obtaining or publishing the documents, and Assange himself was closely monitored and cut off from communication within the embassy. Vijay Prashad, writing for CounterPunch, wrote an editorial in the form of a letter to Bini asking \\"What do they want you to say, Ola? The U.S. government has Chelsea Manning in prison. They want her to incriminate Assange. Is the Ecuadorian government acting for the U.S. government, asking you to say things about Assange, things that you would obviously not know?\\" and ending \\"You are a political prisoner.\\" An open letter from a group of concerned leading citizens, including Noam Chomsky, Pamela Anderson, and Brian Eno, was published as an editorial in Aftonbladet. It called on the Swedish government to become politically involved in the case at a level beyond ordinary consular assistance. An English translation has been published:  Organizations  The Electronic Frontier Foundation issued a statement that Ecuadorean authorities have \\"no reason\\" to detain Bini, writing that \\"One might expect the Ecuadorean administration to hold up Bini as an example of the high-tech promise of the country, and use his expertise to assist the new administration in securing their infrastructure ‚Äî just as his own European Union made use of Ola‚Äôs expertise when developing its government-funded DECODE privacy project... At EFF, we are familiar with overzealous prosecutors attempting to implicate innocent coders by portraying them as dangerous cyber-masterminds, as well as demonizing the tools and lifestyle of coders that work to defend the security of critical infrastructure, not undermine it. These cases are indicative of an inappropriate tech panic, and their claims are rarely borne out by the facts.\\" Article 19 called for Bini's release, stating \\"ARTICLE 19 is concerned that the arrest and illegal detention of Ola Bini is part of a crackdown against the community of developers who build digital security technology tools which enable Internet freedoms and secure communication online.\\" Amnesty International has also commented on his case. A Free Ola Bini website was established, with a solidarity letter citing many supporting organizations, which urges readers to join a Code Pink campaign supporting his release.

By 55 BC, only Huhanye and his brother Zhizhi Chanyu were left. Biography In 33 BC, Huhanye visited Chang'an as part of the tributary system that existed between the Han and Xiongnu governments. He took the opportunity to request to become an imperial son-in-law and unwilling to honour Huhanye with a real princess, Emperor Yuan ordered that the plainest girl in the harem be selected.

The story focuses on side characters from the animated television series Pretty Rhythm: Rainbow Live, which aired from 2013 to 2014. Initially released in 14 theaters on January 9, 2016, the film's unexpected popularity led to nationwide screenings of the film and became a financial success, which led to a spin-off multimedia franchise focusing on the characters. In addition, a stage play adaptation of the film titled King of Prism: Over the Sunshine! took place in 2017. King of Prism by Pretty Rhythm also led the \\"cheer screenings\\" movement in modern cinema. The film was followed up by a sequel, King of Prism: Pride the Hero, in 2017, and a third continuation, King of Prism: Shiny Seven Stars, in 2019. Plot The Pretty Rhythm series focuses Prism Stars, idols performing figure skating routines through song and dance with special moves known as Prism Jumps. The characters participate in Prism Shows, live performances that are scored based on how charmed the audience is. The plot is set 1.5 years after Pretty Rhythm: Rainbow Live. After Louis Kisaragi gives him a locket and instructs him to attend Over the Rainbow's Prism Show, Shin Ichijo is starstruck from the experience. While Shin bikes home, Hijiri Himuro, noticing his sparkle, sees potential in him and scouts him to become a Prism Star trainee at Edel Rose Academy. Shin becomes acquainted with his classmates but learns that Edel Rose Academy has only nine students after the death of the previous chairman, Kou Norizuki, and most of the school's funds and students have transferred over to Schwarz Rose, run by Jin Norizuki. Shin meets the members of Over the Rainbow: Koji Mihama, Hiro Hayami, and Kazuki Nishina. The three share how they were able to perform well based on their friendship, recounting the setbacks they faced in Pretty Rhythm: Rainbow Live. That afternoon, Shin encounters Louis and thanks him for inspiring him to become a Prism Star, but Louis only responds by formally introducing himself and embracing him. At night, Hijiri becomes suspicious of Jin's next move, revealing that the members of Happy RAIN and Bell Rose were able to escape Jin's management during his takeover. However, Koji is offered an opportunity to produce music for a Hollywood movie production to pay off Edel Rose's debt. Hiro, on the other hand, decides to focus on the next Prism King Cup tournament. While Kazuki is practicing, he is accosted by Taiga Kougami and Alexander Yamato for abandoning street-style Prism Shows to perform academy- style Prism Shows. Alexander challenges Kazuki, and the two battle to \\"EZ Do Dance\\" with Kakeru Juuouin's battle mode technology, the Prism System, but the duel ends in a draw. Meanwhile, Koji helps Shin practice for Prism Shows, and, impressed by his ability, gives him the song \\"Over the Sunshine!\\" as a reward. After Koji accepts his new job abroad, Over the Rainbow perform a farewell concert. With Over the Rainbow now disbanded and Edel Rose's future uncertain, the other students are distraught. However, with encouragement from Hijiri and Koji, Shin performs \\"Over the Sunshine!\\" with Hiro and Kazuki, which reminds the students and the audience of the excitement they experienced when they first watched a Prism Show. The Prism Show becomes successful, and Edel Rose is determined to continue. Meanwhile, at Schwarz Rose, Jin rallies his students, one of them revealed to be Louis, to defeat Edel Rose at any cost. The post-credits scene features a preview for a proposed continuation, where in the midst of preparations for the next Prism King Cup tournament, Hiro learns that he is unable to perform \\"Pride\\" now that the song has been given to Louis.

When it was reworked into a film, it was rejected again, and the staff were told that if they were able to provide evidence that the project would work out, then it would be approved. From 2014 onward, the staff continued to promote various Pretty Rhythm and PriPara series at events, occasionally teasing Over the Rainbow's comeback to test the fans' feedback. When the full version of Over the Rainbow's theme song, \\"Athletic Core\\", received positive feedback, a character song album centered on them was produced.

He mentioned that despite the focus on the Prism King Cup, the film would end before the characters even attended the tournament. At the time, a sequel to the film was not planned due to the uncertainty of King of Prism by Pretty Rhythm's financial success, and the post-credits preview was added to suggest what would happen if they were to create a sequel.

Ethiopia is one the country where several megalith site exist. The megalithic monuments exist in all regions. Most of the megaliths sites are located in the Southern Nation Nationalities and peoples Regional State (SNNPRS). The major megalithic sites are found in Gedeo Zone, Gurage Zone and Sidama Zone. Tiya is one of the megalithic sites registered by UNESCO. Stele, tumuli and dolmens are the common megalithic monuments found in Ethiopia. Megalith is a Greek word meaning big stone. The term megaliths first coined by Algernon Herbert in 1849. The Concise Oxford Dictionary of Archaeology (2003) describes megaliths as a general term applied to monuments of Neolithic and early Bronze Age in northwest Europe. It is used for tombs and standing stones, forming circles Dolmen, Alignment and Menhir. Megaliths are large stone structures built without mortar. The existence of stelae, dolmens, tumuli, stone pillar and stone circle/ stone have been reported from North Africa and West Africa East Africa. Megalithic tradition was one of the common practices in most part of Africa. The megaliths have direct or indirect related to ritual activities. The ritual activities conducted by the Bodi peoples in the Omo Valley, southern Ethiopia, can be mentioned as a good example. The Bodi are one of the pastoral peoples who perform ritual activities related to stone platform. It would have a socioeconomic role among the people who practice of such activities. There are different arguments about the evolutionary origin of religions. One of the theories of evolutionary origin of religions is based on the neocortex size. According to this argument human social complexity is related to brain size. Human brain evolved through time, and religion is assumed to be part of this process. But recent studies show that some hominin could have religious behaviors. Another theory of evolutionary origin of religions is based on theory of mind. Theory of mind is related to imagination. Imagination is the mental ability to produce images, thoughts, and feelings. The human perception and feeling might have connected to various things. Human imagination might evolve through time. The ritual concept among human might not easy to analyze. Because religion believes to be supernatural.  Classification  Megaliths can be classified in different way. Scholars use a different approach to categorize megaliths. Mostly megaliths can be classified based on their forms and styles of techniques of building. Lewis and Daniel classified megaliths into four different categories. But Fergusson classified them into five groups. These are Tumuli (small stone chambers, megalithic chambers), Dolmen (without tumuli), Circles (surrounding tumuli and dolmen; circle without tumuli), Avenues (stones circle and without the circle) and menhir (Single or in groups). The Megaliths can be classified in a distinct way. In Ethiopian megaliths are classified into three groups dolmens, tumuli, and stelae. Stelae in Gurage and Silti are classified based on the engravings. The first type consists of flat stelae which depicting daggers, arc, and geometric and human representations. The second type of stelae is anthropomorphic stelae. In this group human chest and reversed ‚ÄúX‚Äù and ‚ÄúW‚Äù and two circles are depicted. The third groups are cylindrical stelae. The height of these group ranges between 0.5m and 1.80m. The fourth types are Phallic stelae. These groups are few compared to others. Their height ranges between 60 cm and 1.80 m. and the fifth types are hemispherical and conical respectively. In a few sites, there are symbols engraved on stelae seems to be similar. Compared to other decorated stelae are not many. But they exist in most stelae sites in the southern region. Still, symbolism in megaliths seems to be the most challenging and some of the symbols are hard to understand. Azais and Chambard believe that the signs drawn on stelae are \\"solar stars\\" and indication of worshiping the sun. Presumably, it is too early to draw into conclusion on symbolism. Sometimes distinct symbols exist at a single site. In general, the stelae of the south are either Anthropomorphic or Phallic. Stelea of Gurage and Silti have the symbol of sword and other symbols. In Tiya, one of the world heritage sites, many stelae have an engraving of the sword. The symbol of the sword is interpreted identified as the rank of the warrior or the number of enemies killed. Still, the interpretation is dubious and debatable.  Purpose  The purposes of megaliths differ from place to place. In some area‚Äôs stelae had been used as territorial markers whereas in other areas peoples use them as burial markers It might have served as a burial mark, ceremonial center and ritual. The excavation conducted at Chalba-Tutiti (Gedeo Zone) shows that the use of stelae not only associated with burial. From Tuto-Fela, other stelae site in Gedeo zone site near to Chalba-Tutiti human remains and other associated materials were recovered. These two sites are in nearby areas and inhabited by the same ethnic groups. But the current settlement might be different from the past. Megaliths might have used for multiple purposes. Megaliths of Turkana are the earliest in East Africa and the horn region, and are built for commemorative purpose. Stiles mentioned that these megaliths were built by the earliest pastoralist of East Africa. The peoples referred to as ‚ÄòMegalithic Cushites‚Äô.  Emergence of megaliths  There were conflicting arguments about the origin of megalithic monuments in Europe. The megaliths believed to be built by a single group of people. Through time this argument was rejected, and Crete was considered as a center for the origin of megalithic monuments in Europe. However, the emergence of radiocarbon dating dismissed hypothesis which based on assumption. The megalithic tombs of Western Europe were proved to be older than that of the Crete. Megaliths emerged at a different time. Alinei, and Benozzo state that megalithic monuments first emerged in Celtic, and it spread to other areas. But Colin Renfrew proposes autonomous cultural development. Recently Paulsson dismissed the diffusionism about the origin and direction off megalithic in Europe. Erection of megaliths had a long history in many parts of the world. Several megalithic sites have been reported from North Africa, West Africa, East Africa, central Africa and the horn of Africa.  Megaliths in Ethiopia  The existence of megaliths is reported in the 19th c by travelers and missionaries. Alfred Ilg and Jules Borelli had information about Tiya, one of the world heritage sites, in 1886. In 1905 F.J. Bieber had similar information about few megalithic sites south of Addis Ababa, Ethiopia‚Äôs capital. In 1905 V. Chollet and H. Neuville visited Tiya, Sombo, and Seden megalithic sites. Currently, these sites are in Southern Nations, Nationalities and Peoples Regional State (SNNPRS). But studies on Ethiopian megaliths started in the 20thc. In the 1920s Azais and Chambard reported some megalithic sites from Gurage, Silti, Hadiya, Kambata, Gedeo, Sidama and other areas. Later they published their report in 1931. The report of V.Chollet and H. Neuville instigated many scholars and missionaries to visit the sites. In the meantime, many missionaries and travelers were curious about the megalithic culture. In 1932 Abb√© Breuil wrote a letter to Aza√Øs which requests about any affinity with the megaliths of India could be an example for their curiosity. Also, in 1934 Jensen, the team from Frobenius Institute reported additional stelae sites in Gedeo. In 1939 some stelae from Gedeo were taken in Germany and still located in the Ethnological Museum of Frankfurt. Also, some stelae from Gurage were taken to Rome. Since then several megalithic sites are identified from different regions. Anfray listed about 150 stelae from Sodo, Maskan, Dobi and Silti area. He mentioned the presence of additional sites that would be investigated. Also 11 stelae sites were reported from Sodo and Mehur-Aklil. Tiya Stele The nature and distribution of megaliths in Ethiopia vary from region to region. The types of megaliths in southern Ethiopia are different from megaliths of Eastern Ethiopia. Dolmens are the type of megaliths widely distributed in the Eastern part of the country. It is not common to identify dolmen in the central and southern regions of the country. The type of megaliths found in southern and central Ethiopia are Tumulus and stelae. Some Tumuli sites are reported Shewa (central Ethiopia) Gedeo and Borana zone (southern Ethiopia). Stelae are a type of megaliths found in central, south and southwestern Ethiopia. Several stelae sites have been discovered in the southern part of Ethiopia. In the 1920s Azais studied some of the megalithic sites of located in Gedeo zones and Sidama zones. A significant number of stelae sites are identified in other areas of the southern region. Anfray and Joussaume reported several stelae sites from Gurage, Silti, Hadiya, Kambata and Wolayita. The stelae are commonly named as Ya Gragn Dingay (literary the stone of Gragn). The total number of stelae in the southern region was estimated at ten thousand. The southern region is known for the huge concentration of megalithic culture. Due to this the region is referred to as ‚Äústelae belt‚Äù. Aksum Stele Stelae also found in Aksum in northern Ethiopia. The Aksumite stelae are somehow different from other stelae. Aksumite stelae are part of Aksumite civilization and dated to 2nd and 4th century AD. Some of these stelae have an association with cemeteries. It is believed that dolmens and tumuli pre-date pre-Aksumite civilization. Azais and Chambard conducted an excavation in Kibet, Gatir-Dama, Dimbo-Der, and Tiya in Gurage area. They recovered nothing from Kibet. But from Gatir-Dama, Human fossil and ceramics were recovered and is dated to 750 ¬± 110 BP. Dimbo-Der and Tiya human fossil had been recovered. They believe that Kibet might be stolen or destroyed. Gatira Dama). In Sodo and Sadden there exist 3000 and 200 burials were documented respectively. Mulicha, Gababa, Gayot Garno Harbo unspecified number of burial were reported.  Hadiya and Kambata  Stelae sites of Hadiya and Kambata are few when compared to that of the Gurage area. Azais and Chambard in the 1920s, visited Shashogo, Kalisha. Later additional sites were listed by Anfray. Kunafa, Gora, Lafto-Lenka, Bishata, Bulula, Kalisha, Suta, Lisana- Kotancho, Lisana-kosa, Dishamo, Bidika, hirco, Kachara Eba, Ilfat, Danama, Wubara, Sike-Giorgis, Kutube-Jarso are stelae sites reported from Hadiaya. Leghe, Zogoba, Deketta, Bazena, and Bula are some of the sites reported from Kambata. But later in 1979 but Ambo-Kuna, Achira, Adjora,Oddo, Moggisa, Gabara, Bidika, Jarso, Lage and Kachare-Eba were added in Hadiya and Kambata area. 26 stelae were documented from 23 sites. Except for one site, all are phallic stelae. Their size ranges from 0.50 cm to 2.12 meters.  Wolayita  In Wolayita Gurma, Ganame, Wachiga, Ofa, Sare Womba and around Sodo phallic stelae sites were identified. The stelae of these areas range between 55 cm and 2.30meters. In terms of size stelae of Wolayita are relatively larger than stelae identified in Hadiya and Kambata areas.  Northern Shoa  Few stelae were reported to the north of Addis Ababa, at a district called Efrata and Gidim of Amhara Regional State, some 17 km west of the town Effesson. The local people name the stelae as‚ÄòMushura Dingay‚Äô (bride stone). 40 stelae were identified at this area. Some of them were standing, and the remaining were lying on the ground. The lying stelae were probably displaced from their original place. This site comprises both phallic and anthropomorphic stelae. The engraving of the stelae resembles with Tiya and Tutofela. Nothing is known about the purpose of these stelae because no detail research is done yet. The largest stela has 1.75meters with its circumference of 1.3meters, and the smallest stela is 0.76 meter. The megalithic tradition exists in the northern part of Ethiopia. Some stone circles are identified in Amba Dero area. But there is scare information about megalithic culture in the northern part of Ethiopia. Fattovich mentioned that Aksum stelae as part of the development of regional megalithic culture. He believes that they are memorial monuments. Anfray did an inventory on already known and new sites in the region and from these sites they able to list only 13 sites. Research works on megalithism emerged in the 1970s but more relatively more research was started in Ethiopia and Djibouti in 1980s. Since the 1990s more organized and multidisciplinary studies are emerging in the region.  South Omo  The megalithic culture in South Omo zone of the SNNPR (Southern Nation Nationalities and Peoples Regional State) is somehow distinct from the usually known megalithic culture in other parts of the country. These stone platforms are identified in Mursiland near to the River Omo. The platforms referred to benna kulugto by the local peoples. The stone structures are arranged like a concentric ring on the ground. The stones have different shape. Some stones have flat rectangular surfaces whereas the others are irregular boulders. Their size ranges from 2m to 26m diameter. These platforms assumed to be ceremonial centers which had been used by the Bodi, one of the pastoral peoples living along the Omo valley. Recently new site reported from Mursi area, at Dirikoro, near to Omo river, in Debub Omo Zone. The Mursi platforms were associated with pastoral adaptation to environmental challenge. The southern region is known from the megalithic culture. In Hadiya, Kambata, Silti and Gurage areas peoples the peoples named it ‚ÄòGragn Dingay‚Äô (Grahagn stone). Gragn Mohamed was the leader of Adal, one of the Muslim sultanates, in Ethiopian. Among the Sidama and the Gedeo the stelae are called as Gigamo Koyo. The similarity might not be only with signs and symbols engraved or drawn on stelae. Also, there is a striking inter-site similarity. Banko-Markos and Sakaro-Sodo stelae sites can be mentioned as an example of this inter-site similarity.  Gedeo  Gedeo zone is known for the existence of several megalithic sites. Azais and Chambard, Jensen, Haberland, Anfray, Joussume, and many other scholars visited the megalithic sites of Gedeo. One of the early scholars, Azais and Chambard, led an expedition to Bale, Gedeo, and Sidama and listed 20 megalithic sites in these areas. Out of these sites, 16 sites were in Gedeo and Sidama. Later Anfray estimated the stelae of Gedeo about 10,000. Recently 45 megalithic sites were identified in Gedeo. Tutofela, Chalba-tutiti, Sakaro-Sodo and Sade- Markato some of the known sites from Gedeo. Tutofela Stele site  Sidama  Aksum stele quarry site Sidama is one of the zones in the region where several megalithic sites located. Anfray listed 303 in 26 sites in Sidama. These sites were found in 5 woredas and they are not far from the main road. In a total 71 stelae are standing from 16 sites. Most of the stelae were destroyed by human interference. From the listed sites Waheno, Amate, Aruje-Mogesha, Alamura, Futa‚Äôe, Gobadamo, and Makala have 68, 53, 22, 18, 26, 18 and 31 stelae respectively. In Makala and Alamura most of the stelae are displaced from their original locations. But in Waheno, Aamate, Gobadamo and Aruja-Mogasha 48 stelae are standing. Dongora-Elmate, Masincho and Sabicha 11 are found in original locations. In the 1931 Azais and Chambard reported 82 stelae from Waheno. Now 68 stelae were reported and only 26 stelae still standing. Waheno is a site where many stelae are located. The site is in Aleta-Wondo woreda, Homecho-Waheno kebele, Bora-Gento, and Lakola locality. The size of stelae in Waheno ranges from 1m-4.5m. It contains phallic and decorated stelae. In 1931Azais and Chambard conducted an excavation and they discovered polished stone, a fragment of pottery, obsidian, and fossil. After the work of Francis Anfray, Matasabia reported additional megalithic sites from Sidama Zone. Wijigira and Santaro in Hawasa Zuria Woreda; Bonkaki in Arbegona woreda, and Hofa-Hamate in Hula (Hageresealm) Woreda. Shabe-Dela, Tula-Iracha, Babie- Kololcha, Bamisa and Setingela are some newly reported sites in Sidama. The other two site from Dara woreda were reported. These sites are Dela and Hamate which are located at Banko-Markos Kebele. At Dela 5 stelae were identified and one stele still standing. At Hamate 20 stelae identified and 6 are still standing. But Anfray listed 53 stelae from Hamate megalithic site. Most of the stelae sites of Sidama are in Dara, Aleta-Chuko, Aleta-Wondo, Shabadino, and Hawasa Zuria woreda. The remaining sites are in Basa and Arbegona woreda. Two stelae sites are reported. The current conservation status of the sites is not known. Most of the sites were destroyed by human interference and only their names left in the documents. When it compared with early reports few sites are survived and most of these sites were under threat. Development activities and population pressure are one of the major challenges for these sites. Some of the stelae in Tuto Fela and Tiya were restored. The research works on the megalithic monuments are limited. Only few stelae sites are dated in Gedeo and Gurage areas. In Gedeo, Sakaro Sodo stelae site is dated to 1st c AD. Tutofela is the first dated site in Gedeo and it lies between 11th to 12thc AD. The charcoal identified from Chalba-Tutiti is dated to 17th C. A single stelae from Sodit is dated to 7th -8th AD. Eric Godet dated Gattira-Demma a site in Gurage zone and it ranges between 12-13th c AD. The other dated site is Tiya also in Gurage zone. Tiya is dated to 11th to 13th c AD.

He led China's first expedition to Antarctica in 1984‚Äì1985 and participated in seven Antarctic expeditions in total. He led the construction of China's first two Antarctic bases, the Great Wall Station in 1985 and the Zhongshan Station in 1989, and served as Director of the Chinese Arctic and Antarctic Administration.  Early life and career  Guo was born in September 1935 in Laishui County, Hebei, Republic of China. After graduating from the Harbin Institute of Military Technology in 1962, he initially worked in meteorology and atmospheric sounding. In 1976, he was transferred to the State Oceanic Administration (SOA) and later joined the newly established Chinese Arctic and Antarctic Administration under the SOA.  First Antarctic expedition and the Great Wall Station  The Great Wall Station in 2011 In 1984, China organized its first scientific expedition to Antarctica, and Guo was named the leader of the 591-member expedition team. The team departed Shanghai on 20 November 1984 on two ships, the Xiang Yang Hong 10 and the J121, and arrived at King George Island off the coast of Antarctica on 30 December. A main part of their mission was to construct China's first Antarctic base, the Great Wall Station. As the Xiang Yang Hong 10 was not an icebreaker, the team had to leave before the end of the Antarctic summer and had only a short window of opportunity to complete their mission. Under Guo's supervision, the team worked 16 to 17 hours a day in often severe weather conditions, and completed the construction in only 40 days. The station was opened on 14 February 1985. In 2012, the Antarctic Treaty System designated two sites at the Great Wall Station erected by Guo's team as Historic Sites and Monuments in Antarctica: the station's No. 1 Building and a monolith with the Chinese inscription: \\"Great Wall Station, First Chinese Antarctic Research Expedition, 20 February 1985\\".  Zhongshan Station  The Zhongshan Station in 2007 Four years later, Guo led another expedition to Antarctica, with the mission to establish China's second base. The team set out from Qingdao in November 1988 on the ship Jidi. After reaching Prydz Bay in Antarctica, the ship encountered a major icefall in the night of 14 January 1989. She missed being directly hit by ice by just two or three meters, and became trapped by icebergs for seven days. Many team members wrote their wills and were ready to die. Luckily, the icebergs shifted on the seventh day and temporarily created a 30-meter-wide opening, and Guo's team seized the opportunity to escape from the trap. The opening lasted for just two hours before closing again. The team proceeded to construct the Zhongshan Station at Prydz Bay in only 28 days, which opened on 26 February 1989.  Later career  Guo spent most of his career planning for and participating in Antarctic expeditions, seven in total. He also helped equip the research vessels Jidi and Xue Long, served as Director of the Chinese Arctic and Antarctic Administration, and attended international conferences on polar research.  Health and death  In his old age Guo lost the ability to walk, likely because of the extended amount of time he had spent under extreme polar conditions. He died on 3 April 2019 in Beijing, at the age of 83.

Operations began in December 2004.  Formation  In summer 2002, the Bayerische Eisenbahngesellschaft railway company intended to re-tender for the regional railway services in northern Lower Franconia with a connection to the neighbouring town of Meiningen in southern Thuringia. Instead of an open competition, it carried out price enquiries with five different railway companies. Erfurter Bahn's bid proved to be the most economical, ahead of those of DB Regio and the other three bidders who had already been eliminated.RB-Leistungen in Unterfranken gehen an die EIB, in Bahn-Report (3-2003), Seite 69 The contract covered the regional railway services on the following routes: * KBS 803 (Fr√§nkische Saaletalbahn) Schweinfurt‚ÄìBad Kissingen‚ÄìHammelburg‚ÄìGem√ºnden (Main) * KBS 815 (Main-Rh√∂n-Bahn) Schweinfurt‚ÄìBad Neustadt (Saale)‚ÄìMellrichstadt‚ÄìMeiningen, a section of the Main Franconian-Thuringian link from Erfurt to W√ºrzburg Compared to the previous transport services provided by DB Regio, the operating volume was increased by around 60,000 train kilometres to 1.2 million train kilometres per year, which made it possible to extend the trains beyond the decentralised Schweinfurt Hauptbahnhof to the city railway station. The transport contract became effective with the start of operations for the timetable change on 12 December 2004 and had a term of ten years.

The museum was opened in July 2000 and was constructed on the grounds of a former ceramics factory. Most of the exhibits reflect the output of that factory and its documentation centre is devoted to the study of the history and production of the factory and the industrial heritage of the municipality. In 2002 the museum was awarded the Luigi Micheletti Prize in the Industrial Heritage category. History The F√°brica da Loi√ßa (the Crockery Factory), established by Manuel Joaquim Afonso, began work in 1856. In the few years that he owned the factory, Afonso faced financial problems and between 1861 and 1863 he sold it to an Englishman, John Stott Howorth. With the new techniques that Howorth was able to introduce from the United Kingdom, the factory expanded rapidly, producing earthenware based on kaolin. Its success led King Lu√≠s I to confer the title of Baron de Howorth de Sacav√©m on the owner and to give the factory the title of Royal Factory. In the last years of his life, King-consort Fernando II painted several ceramic pieces in the factory and became good friends with Howorth. After Howorth‚Äôs death in 1893, his wife, the Baroness Howorth of Sacav√©m, went into partnership with James Gilman, who administered it until her death in 1909, when he took over the company. Investments continued to be made in the factory which, at its peak, covered 70,000 square metres and became one of the main industrial units of the eastern industrial belt of Lisbon. In 1912 Portugal experienced a wave of union-led strikes and the ceramic factory was not immune from this. At the same time, it had a pioneering reputation for promoting social welfare, including through the creation of a school inside the factory, the existence of a savings and loan scheme for employees, the right to paid leave, and the establishment of holiday camps for the children of the factory‚Äôs workers. During the fascist period under the Estado Novo (1933-74) employees of the factory were active in opposing the government. The company began to experience financial difficulties from the 1970s as a result of price controls imposed by the government, some inefficient investments in the factory, and labour disputes due to the difficulties it was experiencing in paying workers. It was declared bankrupt in 1994. At this time the council of Loures decided to build the museum on the old site of the factory in order to preserve its history. The museum was opened by the then President of the Portuguese Republic, Jorge Sampaio, in 2000. During its life the factory established a reputation for high-quality work. In addition to the production of tableware it was responsible for many decorative pieces, including a series of military figurines. At the beginning of the 20th century, the artist Jorge Cola√ßo collaborated with the company to produce azulejo tiles for several of his most significant commissions, including the vestibule of the S√£o Bento Railway Station in Porto (1903), the Bu√ßaco Palace hotel (1907), and the Carlos Lopes Pavilion in Lisbon, which was originally constructed for the Independence Centenary International Exposition in Rio de Janeiro in 1922 and then rebuilt in Lisbon. The Museum Designed around the centrepiece of Kiln 18 from the old factory, the museum provides a history of the factory as well as temporary exhibitions drawn from its own and some private collections. It covers the period from 1865 until the 1980s, with the museum‚Äôs total collection amounting to some 8,000 pieces. Items in the collection include domestic utensils, decorative utensils, sanitary ware, decorative plates and figurines, as well as the materials and equipment used in their manufacture such as molds, together with laboratory materials, machines, and original design drawings and pigments. In addition to the museum space itself, the museum has a documentation centre, named after the founder, Manuel Joaquim Afonso, which provides a documentation of Portugal‚Äôs industrial heritage and is available for use by researchers. There is also an auditorium named in honour of Ant√≥nio Ferreira, an anti-fascist leader who worked at the factory, and a pottery workshop named after Jos√© de Sousa, a craftsman at the factory, together with a small shop The kiln, which was originally constructed in the 1940s is an example of a bottle kiln, a type of kiln common in the Staffordshire Potteries in England until the 1960s. It has a diameter of 6 metres and is 12 metres high. Made of brick, it is reinforced externally by iron bands and has ten furnaces fuelled by wood or coal. Firing could last up to a week, much longer than more modern kilns. To avoid damage to the pieces by the gasses during firing they were placed inside saggars or ceramic containers. Visitors can go inside the kiln and imagine what it was like for the workers to be inside at high temperatures.

Trivia  During a burglary in Altenburger's apartment on 29 May 2007, thieves stole a supposed Stradivari violin from the year 1680 worth around 2.5 million euros and a Vuillaume violin worth around 120,000 euros, which was found undamaged by the police on 5 June 2007.Stradivari wieder da orf.at, 6. Juni 2007. The three perpetrators were arrested and sentenced to six and five years respectively. They had committed ten burglaries in May 2007 alone. During the trial, an expert was unable to confirm the authenticity of the Stradivarius. The violin was smaller than a typical Stradivarius, probably a violin from the house of Amati. Three or four masters from Cremona could be considered as manufacturers. The value could therefore be set at 500,000 euros.Stradivari wieder da orf.at, 6.

The architectural historian John Newman notes the \\"historically\\" important existence of a raised cruck truss in the hall of the house which he suggests places it as a transitional building between the traditional, single-level, Welsh hall house and later, storeyed, buildings. What stands today represents two construction periods of the late 16th and early 17th centuries, with some 19th century reconstruction. The National Trust suggests that Chapel Farm may have operated as the home farm for the Clytha Park Estate. Owned by the Jones family from the 18th century, it remains a private residence.

History & overview  The JW was founded from a split in the Berlin branch of the Magdeburg-based group Fighting Together (Zusammen K√§mpfen). The split was caused by an ideological conflict between more libertarian Marxist-oriented members and the more orthodox Marxist‚ÄìLeninists. JW was primarily based in Berlin (predominantly in Wedding and Neuk√∂lln), but also listed branches in B√ºckeburg, Dresden, Flensburg, Hamburg, Magdeburg and M√ºnster. The ideology of JW was based upon the theory of Marxism-Leninism- Maoism (MLM). MLM is the universal application of the Mao-Zedong-Thought, with the principal theorist being the Peruvian Abimael Guzm√°n, chairman of the Communist Party of Peru (Shining Path). JW was henceforth fiercely supportive of the revolutionary struggles of the Communist Party of the Philippines and the Naxalites in India. Other activities of JW were among others participation in the yearly May Day and Luxemburg-Liebknecht (LL) demonstrations, campaigning for election boycotts and anti-fascist organizing. On 9 June 2019 JW announced on social media that it had dissolved. The main reason given by the organisation was that it could not make the transition between being an avant-garde youth organisation and an actual mass cadre communist party. On the morning of the 26 June 2019 the police raided seven houses of nine JW members in Berlin and North Rhine-Westphalia. The police confiscated weapons, hard drives, mobile phones and disguises. The announced dissolution of JW is suspected of being a deception to complicate the ongoing investigations.  Criticisms  JW has been criticised of being homophobic, nationalistic, anti- semitic, sectarian, and violent towards other leftwing groups. The group is under surveillance of the Verfassungsschutz Berlin for being a radical left- wing anti-semitic organization. JW refutes these criticisms as being either untrue, or as being part of their political praxis (in the case of their violent disposition towards other leftwing groups). JW was noted for their repeated usage of nationalist and v√∂lkisch themes. Some members of the group were former NPD members.

The north summit is higher than the south peak (7680+ ft), and easier to climb (class 3 vs. class 4), however neither peak sees much climbing activity. Sitting Bull Mountain is located northwest of Suiattle Pass in the heart of the Glacier Peak Wilderness. Its nearest higher peak is Plummer Mountain, to the south-southwest. The mountain is situated on the crest of the Cascade Range, on the shared border of Snohomish County and Chelan County. Precipitation runoff from Sitting Bull Mountain drains east into Agnes Creek which is a tributary of the Stehekin River, or west into Canyon Creek which is a tributary of the Suiattle River. Geology Subduction and tectonic activity in the area began during the late cretaceous period, about . The area was previously an oceanic environment, consisting mainly of sedimentary and volcanic rocks.Beckey, Fred W. Cascade Alpine Guide, Climbing and High Routes. Seattle, WA: Mountaineers Books, 2008. Extensive volcanic activity began to take place in the oligocene, about . However, mountain building in the area did not begin until the miocene, approximately .Beckey, Fred W. Cascade Alpine Guide, Climbing and High Routes. Seattle, WA: Mountaineers Books, 2008. Sitting Bull Mountain is located in the Cloudy Pass batholith, an intrusive formation that was formed approximately , during the early miocene.Beckey, Fred W. Cascade Alpine Guide, Climbing and High Routes. Seattle, WA: Mountaineers Books, 2008. Glacier Peak, a stratovolcano that is south of Sitting Bull Mountain, began forming in the mid-Pleistocene.Beckey, Fred W. Cascade Alpine Guide, Climbing and High Routes. Seattle, WA: Mountaineers Books, 2008. Due to Glacier Peak's proximity to Sitting Bull Mountain, volcanic ash is quite common in the area. Throughout the ice age, the North Cascades were mostly covered in thick glaciers, extending to near Puget Sound. Glaciation was most prevalent approximately , and most valleys were ice-free by .Beckey, Fred W. Cascade Alpine Guide, Climbing and High Routes. Seattle, WA: Mountaineers Books, 2008. As a result, valleys in the area are deep and u-shaped, and mountains tend to be rocky, with steep slopes and narrow summits. Climate Sitting Bull Mountain is located in the marine west coast climate zone of western North America.Beckey, Fred W. Cascade Alpine Guide, Climbing and High Routes. Seattle, WA: Mountaineers Books, 2008. Most weather fronts originate in the Pacific Ocean, and travel northeast toward the Cascade Mountains. As fronts approach the North Cascades, they are forced upward by the peaks of the Cascade Range, causing them to drop their moisture in the form of rain or snowfall onto the Cascades (Orographic lift). As a result, the west side of the North Cascades experiences high precipitation, especially during the winter months in the form of snowfall.Beckey, Fred W. Cascade Alpine Guide, Climbing and High Routes. Seattle, WA: Mountaineers Books, 2008. Due to its temperate climate and proximity to the Pacific Ocean, areas west of the Cascade Crest very rarely experience temperatures below or above .Beckey, Fred W. Cascade Alpine Guide, Climbing and High Routes. Seattle, WA: Mountaineers Books, 2008. During winter months, weather is usually cloudy, but, due to high pressure systems over the Pacific Ocean that intensify during summer months, there is often little or no cloud cover during the summer.Beckey, Fred W. Cascade Alpine Guide, Climbing and High Routes. Seattle, WA: Mountaineers Books, 2008. Because of maritime influence, snow tends to be wet and heavy, resulting in high avalanche danger.

His name is sometimes also spelled as John MacKilligen or John M'Killican or John MacKillican or even John M'Gilligine. Early life and ordination John M'Gilligen was minister of Fodderty which Anderson describes as \\"a parish lying partly in Ross-shire and partly in the shire of Cromarty, chiefly in the beautiful and arable vale of Strathpeffer, west from Dingwall.\\" He was licensed by the Presbytery of Aberdeen and received by the Presbytery of Forres 28 March 1655. He was called to North of Ireland and to Islay but did not go. He was admitted to Fodderty 26 February 1656. Having been admitted to that charge, subsequent to 1649, M'Gilligen came under the Act of 1662 which required that he should anew seek presentation from his patron and collation from the Bishop of the diocese, or be ejected. With the terms of this Act he refused to comply; and, accordingly, ejectment followed as he was deprived by Act of Parliament 11 June and Decreet of Privy Council 1 October 1662. He was, moreover, deposed by the Bishop of Ross from the office of the holy ministry, on 31 May 1663, which farcical act (Dickson says) M'Gilligen treated with contempt. Leaving Fodderty, he went to Alness and dwelt in his own private house, from whence he made itineraries for the purpose of holding conventicles. His success was so marked, that the Bishop, mortiÔ¨Åed, threatened to add to the sentence of deposition, that of excommunication. But M'Gilligen cared as little for the one as for the other. Complaints were lodged against him in 1667 for holding conventicles with Thomas Hog of Kiltearn. In 1668 complaints were lodged against him by the Bishop of Moray, in consequence of which he was imprisoned in the Tolbooth of Forres. After his release he returned to Alness. He was again summoned ‚Äì on 10 July 1674 ‚Äì before the Privy Council to answer a charge, preferred against him, for holding conventicles. Failing to attend, they denounced him as one of His Majesty's rebels and pronounced sentence of outlawry against him. Still M'Gilligen continued to preach; and, even on one occasion, in September, 1675, dispensed the Sacrament of the Lord's Supper in the house of the Lady Dowager of Fowlis at Obsdale. Early in the following year, his enemies laid hands on him and took him to Fortrose. The speech he gave is recorded in Anderson and by Wodrow. After lying for some time in the tolbooth of Fortrose, he was, by an act of the Privy Council, 11 October 1676, ordered to be transported via Nairn till he reached Edinburgh, where he was to be imprisoned. He was sentenced to the \\"limbo\\" of the Bass Rock, where he remained for nearly two full years from (1677 ‚Äì 19 July 1679; and, again 28 July 1683 ‚Äì 27 July 1686) No-one was allowed to do menial tasks for him but, at length, he was permitted sometimes to walk upon the rock, through the influence of Sir George Mackenzie of Tarbet which pleased him greatly. He had indemnity granted 11 July 1679, when he was liberated. M'Gilligen immediately resumed the work of preaching which he carried on, without much molestation, until 1682. Then the Privy Council ‚Äî being informed that he had \\"relapsed into his former guilt in keeping conventicles, disorderly baptisms, and marriages, to the endangering of the peace of the country where he lives \\" - instituted new proceedings against him. Refusing to depone on oath to the truth of these charges, he was sentenced to pay a Ô¨Åne of Ô¨Åve thousand merks and to be imprisoned until the Ô¨Åne was paid. He was again summoned before the Privy Council 18 January 1683, and fined ¬£277, to remain in prison till paid. After six months' imprisonment at Edinburgh he was sent to the Bass for a second time, by an Act of Council, dated 28 July 1683. Some pages of M'Gilligen's diary on the Bass are recorded by Wodrow and Anderson. Here he remained until 27 July 1686, when a dangerous illness, which threatened to prove fatal, necessitated his being set at liberty. On being released under bond he went home to Alness. After Toleration After Toleration had been given to the Presbyterians, 5 July 1687, he built a meeting-house on his own property with the money he received for the damage done to his property by the party of soldiers sent by Sir Roderick Mackenzie of Findon in 1675 to prevent the celebration of the communion at Obsdale. He received a call from Elgin which he declined, and accepted a call to Inverness, but he was not settled there. He died 8 June 1689 and was buried at Inverness. Family He married Catherine, daughter of John Munro of Balchraggan, and had children: John, minister of Lochalsh ; Daniel, minister of Alness ; Janet (married Alexander Munro of Kilchoan), and four others. His second wife was Margaret, third daughter of Donald Mackenzie of Meddat, who survived him. Legacy The Dalmore Conventicle Stone has the following inscription: Three generations of the Mackilligen family have been written about in the historical fiction novel Across the Deep. The novel follows John and also William McKillican (Canadian pastor) and Jennie McKillican (missionary nurse to China during the Boxer Rebellion).

Born in Tidaholm, Gillbrand is best known for his contribution to the development of several engines for Saab, and in particular their turbocharged engines. After graduating from the Tekniska gymnasiet i G√∂teborg (Technical High School of Gothenburg), Gillbrand started working for Volvo in 1956, initially as a test engineer in Sk√∂vde and later as an engine development engineer in Gothenburg. Saab, Sweden's other major car manufacturer, was in need of 4-stroke engine expertise as they phased out the 2-stroke engines used in their earliest models. They recruited Gillbrand, along with Olle Granlund, another colleague from Volvo, in 1964. Gillbrand's first assignment for Saab was the final test of the Ford Taunus V4 engine in the Saab 96. He was then involved in adapting the Triumph slant-four engine for the Saab 99. This engine was later replaced by the Saab B engine, an updated version of the Triumph unit manufactured at Saab-Scania in S√∂dert√§lje. In 1970 Gillbrand became manager of Saab-Scania's engine laboratory in S√∂dert√§lje, where he was in charge when Saab became the first car manufacturer to use small turbochargers in gasoline engines, along with technologies such as the wastegate found in most modern turbocharged engines today. For his work on forced induction engines, Gillbrand earned the nickname Turbopelle (Turbo- Geek). Gillbrand is the inventor of the Automatic Performance Control system. He was awarded a Gold Medal from the Swedish Royal Academy of Sciences for his research work in 1988, and in 1992 he received the title of Honorary Doctor of Technology from Chalmers University in Gothenburg. Another of Gillbrand's inventions is the Electronically Controlled Variable Compression engine that he built in the late 1990s. Later renamed the Saab Variable Compression engine (SVC), it was presented at the 2000 Geneva Motor Show. General Motors (GM), Saab's owner at the time, did not approve further development of the SVC engine. This technology is today in development by car manufacturers such as Nissan, Infiniti and Porsche more than 20 years after Gillbrand originated the idea. In 2006 Gillbrand was made an honorary member of the Svenska Volvo P1800-klubben (Volvo P1800 Club of Sweden) for his contributions to development of the Volvo B18 engine.

Early life Louis Conneau was the son of Dr. Henri Conneau, a good friend of Napol√©on III, who aided the future sovereign to escape from his imprisonment at Ham and served as physician to Napol√©on III and his wife when they were emperor and empress. Conneau, who was named after members of the Bonaparte family, his given names being those of the emperor's brothers and of Eugene de Beauharnais, was born and raised at the Tuileries Palace with the Prince Imperial, who was younger than Conneau by only two months. After the fall of the Second Empire, the two attended the Royal Military Academy, Woolwich, together. They remained friends until the prince's death in 1879, sharing an Occitan oath: Passavant le meillor (\\"Accepting only the best\\"). From 1874‚Äì1876 Conneau attended, without the prince, Saint Cyr military academy, graduating as an army sub-lieutenant and joining the 23rd Dragoons. On 30 June 1900, Conneau married Ad√®le Marguerite Fourrier. They had three children.

During the Race to the Sea, Conneau commanded the 1st and cavalry corps, which included French and British units. Never had such a large cavalry unit operated under one command. It became known as the Conneau Cavalry Corps. In the trench warfare that followed the Battle of the Marne, the Conneau Corps sometimes supported one army, sometimes another, and sometimes acted independently with attached infantry divisions. In 1918, having reached the age limit for active command, Conneau became part of the reserve and commanded, at Ch√¢lons-sur-Marne, the 6th Region at the height of the German bombing.

The company was established through the implementation of the Settlement Plan closed between the creditors of Agrokor which had, due to illiquidity and over-indebtedness, ended up in pre-bankruptcy, managed through the Extraordinary Administration Procedure pursuant to the Act on Extraordinary Administration Procedures in Companies of Systemic Importance for the Republic of Croatia. As a result of the successfully conducted and concluded negotiations among Agrokor‚Äôs creditors and the adopted final and non- appealable Settlement Plan, Fortenova Group started its operations as a new company with a completely redesigned ownership, organisational and management structure. The team, headed by Extraordinary Commissioner Fabris Peru≈°ko, that ran the process of Agrokor‚Äôs financial restructuring over the course of the Extraordinary Administration Procedure, was presented with the prestigious TMA Turnaround and Transaction Award for 2019 in the category of international transaction of the year. Namely, the process that resulted in the settlement among creditors and its successful implementation was assessed by the international financial industry as the most significant procedure of its kind in the world that year. In less than a year after the Settlement Plan implementation, Fortenova Group successfully completed its refinancing by issuing a four-year bond, it has been implementing transformational processes, increasing its operating profits, has significantly improved its cash position and become a financially entirely stable company. The company is managed by a Board of Directors and a team of Executive Directors headed by Fabris Peru≈°ko as Chief Executive Officer. A reliable employer and partner, it employs more than 50,000 workers through its three core businesses ‚Äì retail and wholesale, food and agriculture ‚Äì and for more than 30 million consumers on eight key markets in Southeast Europe, its products are an indispensable part of their daily life. Over 30 well-known brands are produced in 12 manufacturing facilities in several countries. The company has a strong strategic orientation towards working together with local suppliers, maintaining and developing shorter supply chains, developing regional agricultural and food production of local origin on all markets where it operates, investing in knowledge and innovation and increasing the competitiveness of the overall economic environment. History In order to prevent the collapse of the Agrokor system due to illiquidity and over-indebtedness as well as the consequences on the economies of Croatia and other countries in Southeast Europe, on 10th April 2017 the Extraordinary Administration Procedure was activated pursuant to the Act on Extraordinary Administration Procedures in Companies of Systemic Importance for the Republic of Croatia. The Commercial Court of Zagreb sanctioned the creditors‚Äô Settlement Plan on 6th July 2018, and by the decision of the High Commercial Court passed on 18th October 2018 the creditors‚Äô Settlement Plan has become final. The Extraordinary Administration Procedure has been accepted as an insolvency procedure in England and Wales by the High Court of England and Wales on 9th November 2017, for the territory of Switzerland in February 2018 and in the US at the Bankruptcy Court New York according to Chapter 15 in November 2018. By Regulation of the European Parliament and the Council, in July 2018 the Act on Extraordinary Administration Procedures was included in the list of national laws recognized as insolvency procedures on the entire territory of the European Union. Fortenova Group commenced operations on 1 April 2019, taking over assets of indebted conglomerate Agrokor. At the time of establishment, it had a total of 159 subsidiary companies in which 52,000 people are employed. In September 2019, Fortenova Group issued 1.16 billion euros in four-year bonds to refinance a 2017 loan. The new financing is structured as a EUR 1.2bn four-year bond. This transaction and the financial restructuring of Agrokor during the course of the Extraordinary Administration Procedure, resulting in a settlement between the creditors and its successful implementation, was assessed in the USA as the most significant international company transaction of its kind worldwide. The team in charge of the process headed by the Extraordinary Commissioner Fabris Peru≈°ko won the prestigious 2019 TMA Turnaround and Transaction Award in the category International Company Transaction of the Year. According to the choice made by readers of Veƒçernji list, the refinancing of the roll-up loan at Fortenova Group was the commercial event of the year 2019 in Croatia. Thus Fabris Peru≈°ko, Chief Executive Officer of Fortenova Group, received the award presented since four years for the second time in a row and on that occasion he pointed out that the nomination itself was a great honour for the company, while the acknowledgment has confirmed the importance that the refinancing had for the business operations of Fortenova Group as one of the region's most important companies as well as the indirect impact this had on the economies of all countries in which Fortenova Group operates. Mercator April 2019 ‚Äì on 1st April 2019 Mercator was not transferred to Fortenova Group September 2019 - Javna agencije za varvstvo konkurence / Public Competition Agency (of Slovenia) (AVK) passed a non-final ruling in September 2019, unprecedented in the history of that Agency, imposing a fine of EUR 53.9m due to failure to file the concentration of the company Costella, acquired by Ivica Todoriƒá, i.e. Agrokor AG from Switzerland, back in 2016. Agrokor lodged an appeal against this decision. December 2019 ‚Äì On 16th December AVK passes the decision to temporarily seize Mercator d.d. shares from Agrokor d.d., allegedly in order to secure funds for the collection of the fine. The interim measure of seizing the shares of Mercator d.d. was passed pursuant to the Misdemeanour Act, specifically the provisions of that Act that otherwise apply in case of traffic offences or similar offences discovered in flagranti, committed by foreign natural persons in the Republic of Slovenia. This in fact constituted an expropriation of private property of Agrokor d.d., whereby the Mercator shares were temporarily seized without any court decision and with no valid legal justification. June 2020 ‚Äì With its judgment dated 1st June 2020 the court Okrajno sodi≈°ƒçe of Ljubljana altered the decision of the Competition Agency of the Republic of Slovenia on the amount of the fine imposed on Agrokor for not having filed the acquisition of the company Costella with the Agency for assessment at a time when Ivica Todoriƒá managed the company and was its owner. The monetary fine in the amount of EUR 53.9m was reduced by the Court to one million euros, with the explanation that the failure to file the concentration was not the result of the ‚Äúintention to bypass the filing of the concentration in order to possibly cause harmful effects on market competition‚Äù, but was rather the ‚Äúresult of unconscientious negligence of the responsible person Ivica Todoriƒá‚Äù. The Court has therefore assessed that a monetary fine of one million euros was the ‚Äúappropriate and equitable sanction for the offence in question\\". July 2020 ‚Äì The Supreme Court of the Republic of Slovenia passes a judgement pursuant whereto the Mercator shares temporarily seized in late 2019 by decision of the Public Competition Agency of the Republic of Slovenia, have to be returned to Agrokor without delay. The Supreme Court declared the seizure of shares to be unlawful, arguing that AVK had no legal foundation to issue the ruling on seizing the shares. The request for the protection of lawfulness was filed with the Supreme Court of the Republic of Slovenia by the State Attorney‚Äôs Office of the Republic of Slovenia, where it basically stated that the Slovenian AVK had acted unlawfully by seizing the Mercator shares from Agrokor. With its final and non-appealable judgement the Supreme Court confirmed that statement, changed AVK‚Äôs decision and stopped the procedure run by AVK against Agrokor, in which the Mercator shares had been seized. Thus the Supreme Court enabled Agrokor to freely dispose of the shares. September 2020 ‚Äì The European Commission cleared the concentration of Fortenova Group and Mercator, thus paving the way for the transfer of Mercator to Fortenova Group.

She served between 1983 and 1994 as a member of the Bundestag (national parliament). More recently, between 2000 and 2013, she was a member of the Bavarian Landtag (regional parliament), chairing an important parliamentary committee and, till 2009, chairing the women's working group in the Landtag. Biography =Provenance and early years= Ursula K√§the M√§nnle was born into a Catholic family in Ludwigshafen which till 1946 was still part of Bavaria's western province. In 1949 her family moved to Munich which meant a \\"return\\" to Bavaria: it is in Bavaria that she grew up and has built her academic and political career. In 1964 she graduated from senior school and moved on to study Political sciences, Sociology and modern history at the Universities of Munich and, subsequently, Regensburg. Between 1970 and 1976 she was employed as a research assistant at the Academy for Political Education and Training (\\"Akademie f√ºr Politische Bildung\\"), on the western shore of the Starnberger See, roughly equidistant between Munich and Garmisch. In 1976 she joined the Katholische Stiftungshochschule (loosely, \\"Catholic Foundation [Social Science and Welfare] Academy\\") as a professor at the Benediktbeuern site. She remained professionally involved with the academy till 2009. =Politics= Ursula M√§nnle became a member of the centre-right CSU (Bavarian political party) in 1964. During 1966/67 she served as regional president of the Ring Christlich-Demokratischer Studenten (\\"Association of Christian Democratic Students\\" / RCDS). Between 1973 and 1977 M√§nnle was deputy chair of the \\"Junge Union\\" (JU), the youth wing of West Germany's centre-right CDU and CSU parties. Then, between 1981 and 1991, she was regional chair of the CSU's Women's Union. In 1973 she became a member of the CSU regional executive, serving between 1987 and 2007 as a member of the party presidium. She first stood as a candidate for election to the Bundestag (national parliament) in 1972, but she was included only at place 30 on the party list, and was not elected. On 4 October 1979 she became a member of the Bundestag (national parliament), taking the seat vacated through the sudden death, two days earlier, of her party colleague Heinrich Reichold. In the parliament, families policy became a particular focus for her interests. She was not re-elected in 1980, but for a second time inherited the seat vacated by a colleague. On 17 March 1983 she took over the seat that had been made available through the resignation (resulting from disagreement over the party's attitude to the legacy of the Holocaust) of Eicke G√∂tz. This time she remained a Bundestag member without further interruption till 1994. Between 1986 and 1994 she chaired the assembly's CDU/CSU women's group. Between 1994 and 1998 M√§nnle served as the appointed Bavarian government's Minister of State (\\"Staatsministerin\\") for Federal Affairs (... \\"f√ºr Bundesangelegenheiten\\"). Between 2000 and 2013 Ursula M√§nnle represented the Starnberg electoral district as a deputy in the Bavarian Landtag (regional parliament). During this time she was chair of the Landtag committee on Federal and European Affairs and a member of the Committee on Religion. She was a member of the leadership team (Vorstandsmitglied) of the CSU group in the assembly. Till 14 January 2009 she chaired the women's working group in the Landtag. Also, between 2016 and 2018, she represented the CSU on the 28 member executive of the Europ√§ische Bewegung Deutschland (political network organisation). =Continuing political involvement= In May 2014 M√§nnle succeeded Hans Zehetmair as chair of the Hanns Seidel Foundation, a political research organisation closely aligned with the CSU, created in 1966 as a distinctively Bavarian version of the older Konrad Adenauer Foundation. It was reported that she been had proposed for the post by the party leader Horst Seehofer. Having served as deputy chair for twenty years, she was something of an insider candidate. Nevertheless, she was the first woman in the foundation's history ever to take on the top position. Her re-election for a further term was reported in August 2018. However, at the end of March 2019, press reports emerged of a planned radical shake-up of the foundation, reflective of a power-shift to a younger generation, and intended to appeal to younger voters, which would involve M√§nnle stepping down, to be replaced as chair by her deputy, Markus Ferber.

The site is used today as a shelter and viewing platform.  Location  The ruins are surrounded by forest on the southwestern slope of the 757-metre-high Auersberg in the Rh√∂n Mountains, at the end of a popular hiking trail north of Hilders. Built on a militarily vulnerable, forward slope position, it was probably intended from the outset only as a seat of power or office.  History  Although the earliest record only goes back to 1214, the castle is clearly much older. In 914, the area around Hilders came into the possession of Regenher of Weid as the result of an exchange of estates by Fulda Abbey and it was Regenher who probably built the first castle on the Auersberg. Around 1120 it was renovated or remodelled into a small knight's castle, probably by the counts of Henneberg, who had since acquired the territory. It was then used either as the seat of a younger brother or one of their vogts. Thereafter it had a very varied history, being located as it was on the border between several rival ecclesial and secular rulers. In 1214, the Lord of Nithardshusen from the House of Henneberg, sold the property back to Fulda Abbey. They, in turn, enfeoffed it and, by 1270, the lords of von der Tann resided there.  Legends  There are various legends associated with the Auersburg, such as the Auersburg Ghost (Gespenst von der Auersburg) and the Last of the Auersburgers (Letzten Auersbergern).http://www.sagen.at/texte/sagen/deutschland/hessen/dieletztenauersberge.html  References   Literature  * Rudolf Knappe: Mittelalterliche Burgen in Hessen. 800 Burgen, Burgruinen und Burgst√§tten. 3.

Her main teaching and research interests are in colonial and postcolonial literature and theory, gender and feminism, Marxism, and critical race studies. She has written three books and regularly contributes to several newspapers and publications, including The Guardian, The Hindu, The Independent, New Statesman, Open Democracy, Outlook India, India Today, Open, HuffPost, New Humanist, Al Jazeera, The Nation, and The Times Literary Supplement.  Early life  Gopal was born in Delhi, India. The daughter of an Indian diplomat, she spent her childhood in India, Sri Lanka, and Bhutan, and attended an international high school in Vienna, where her father served as a diplomat in the mid-1980s.  Education and career  Gopal received a BA from the University of Delhi in 1989 and an MA from Jawaharlal Nehru University in 1991. After finishing her studies in India, she moved to the United States, where she taught at different institutions and completed her PhD in colonial and postcolonial literature at Cornell University in 2000. She moved to the University of Cambridge in 2001, where she is a Reader in Anglophone and Related Literature and a Teaching Fellow at Churchill College; in June 2020, the press reported her promotion to Professor (effective from 1 October 2020). She supervises and teaches in the areas of literary criticism, modern tragedy, 19th-century and modern British literature, and postcolonial and related literatures. Her primary interests are in colonial and postcolonial literatures, with related interests in British and American literatures, the novel, translation, gender and feminism, Marxism and critical theory, and the politics and cultures of empire and globalisation. From 2006 to 2010, she was Dean of Churchill College.  Commentary and analysis  As a literary critic, Gopal explores a range of issues and ideas, with a focus on race, empire, and decolonisation. =Empire= Gopal has written extensively about the impact of empire on contemporary culture in Britain and South Asia and examined how colonial systems continue to reproduce and remap themselves in parts of the world today. In her book Insurgent Empire, Gopal examines traditions of dissent on the question of empire and shows how rebellions and resistance in the colonies influenced British critics of empire. She argues that ideas of freedom, justice, and common humanity had themselves taken shape in the struggle against imperialism. Gopal has also written about Britain's imperial amnesia and has called for a more honest account of how the country came to be what it is today. She argues that developing a more demanding relationship to history is essential for moving beyond institutionalised amnesia about the past. =Decolonisation= She has been a long-standing advocate for the 'decolonisation' of Cambridge's English curriculum. In June 2017, a group of Cambridge students had called for the university to include more black and ethnic minority writers in its English literature curriculum, an initiative strongly supported by Gopal. She argues that decolonisation, in the context of the curriculum, is about having access to information and narratives, which reframe our understanding of how to relate to other peoples, other countries and different cultures. =Race= Gopal has written and commented extensively on the subject of race and how it operates in contemporary society. She argues that whiteness is primarily a cultural category, not a biological one, and is useful for explaining how western societies work in terms of how society is structured, and how such structures determine power relations between dominant and non-dominant groups. In the context of racial discrimination in the United Kingdom, Gopal has discussed white fragility, suggesting that a \\"way of deflecting engagement with race is to personalise matters\\". In October 2019, Gopal criticised the Equality and Human Rights Commission report \\"Tackling racial harassment: Universities challenged\\" for the language it used and for not addressing the systemic disadvantages faced by black and minority ethnic students or the ways whiteness dominates power structures and pedagogy.  Public controversies  =BBC Radio 4: Start the Week= In 2006, Gopal took part in a debate on BBC Radio 4's Start the Week. There, she found herself in opposition to the historian Niall Ferguson, who argued that the British Empire was, by and large, a benevolent and virtuous enterprise. Gopal challenged Ferguson's account of Britain's imperial project, questioning his assertions about the greatness of empire. The programme became a matter of controversy. That evening, the BBC invited another Indian woman onto their programme, who said that not all young Indians thought in the way that Gopal did. Gopal later accused the BBC of pushing an agenda and playing off \\"natives\\" against each other. Gopal said that it was this experience that galvanized her to write and think more publicly about empire. =King's College racial profiling row= In June 2018, Gopal alleged racial profiling by college porters at the gate of King's College, Cambridge. Gopal said that she was subjected to racial profiling and aggression by the porters and gatekeepers of King's and claimed porters frequently hassled non-white staff and students at the gates. Gopal also announced that she would no longer teach at King's until there was a resolution to the long-standing problem. As a result of the attention the issue received, students of Cambridge University came forward describing similar experiences. Students of English at King's also issued an open letter in support of Dr Gopal, urging the college to offer her a \\"proper apology\\": \\"The many testimonies from black and minority ethnic students that have come in the wake of Dr Gopal's statement make apparent that her treatment is not unique or isolated. We strongly condemn the actions of the college and fully support Dr Gopal in her decision to boycott it.\\" Gopal said that she received hate mail following her announcement. In October 2018, King's College, Cambridge, issued a statement accepting that there had been several reports of discrimination and racial profiling. Gopal said that senior members of the college had also conveyed their private apologies and assured her that the problem was being taken seriously. Shortly afterward, Gopal rescinded her decision to withdraw her labour from the college. = \\"White lives don't matter. As white lives\\" tweet = On 23 June 2020, Gopal tweeted \\"White lives don't matter. As white lives\\" and \\"Abolish whiteness\\", in response to a banner flown over a Premier League football stadium that read \\"White lives matter Burnley\\". She received abusive messages, including death threats, following her tweet. Gopal told the media that her comments were opposing the concept of whiteness ‚Äì the presumption of white superiority ‚Äì and challenging the racial basis for lives mattering, adding that it wasn't whiteness that gave lives their dignity, nor should it be the criteria for lives mattering. Gopal was briefly suspended from Twitter under its 'hateful content policy' after sharing some of the messages of the hateful abuse she received following her tweet. The ban was lifted after other users got in touch with Twitter to explain that she was the target of a sustained campaign to have her suspended. Professor Gopal stood by her tweets asserting that her comments were \\"very clearly speaking to a structure and ideology, not about people\\". The following day, the University of Cambridge tweeted a blanket defence of its academics' right to free speech, without explicitly referencing her case. A statement released by the university read: \\"The University defends the right of its academics to express their own lawful opinions which others might find controversial and deplores in the strongest terms abuse and personal attacks. These attacks are totally unacceptable and must cease\\".

The footpath to the top was probably the original drive to the castle, winding its way clockwise around the hill. The conical hill rises steeply from the floor of the valley and is situated near the Rockenstuhl to the south on which another castle was sited until the time of the Thirty Years' War.

See Catherine Packham: Eighteenth-Century Vitalism: Bodies, Culture, Politics (Basingstoke, UK: Palgrave Macmillan, 2012). Among the writers who used Fidelia as an author's pseudonym for their own work were the Englishwomen Mary Astell (1666‚Äì1731) and Jane Barker (1652‚Äì1732), and the Americans Sarah Prince Gill (1728‚Äì1771), Hannah Griffitts (a Quaker, 1727‚Äì1817) and Sukey Vickery (1779‚Äì1821). Back in England, the Lincoln poet who used the name Fidelia in The Gentleman's Magazine in 1734‚Äì1735 may have been Keziah (died 1742), a sister of John Wesley. She wrote belittling an award of ¬£50 offered as a poetry prize (\\"you forget the price of a candle\\") and proposing instead that the prize should be the hand of Jonathan Swift in marriage. This sparked off exchanges of verses with the Welsh poet Jane Brereton (1685‚Äì1740) and the English poet Elizabeth Carter (1717‚Äì1806). In modern times, the description Fidelia has sometimes been used as a compliment to a woman.

The UDF and the LDF were the two major political fronts in the arena. The UDF had the INC(I), IUML, KC(J), KC(M), NDP (P), SRP(S) and the RSP(S) as its constituents. The LDF consisted of the CPI(M), CPI, RSP, IC(S), Janata Party and the Lok Dal.  Background  Kerala saw polarisation and splits of political forces since the formation of the United Democratic Front Ministry on May 24, 1982. The merger of the two factions of the Indian National Congress, the INC (I) and the INC (A), in November, 1982 marked the beginning of the political polarisation. Another important event was the reunion of the IUML and the AIML in August, 1985. Before the election, the Kerala Congress once again split into two; each faction continuing to remain in the UDF. A faction of the Congress (S) and the Janata (G) also joined the INC (I). In the meantime, there were splits in the NDP and the Socialist Republican Party (SRP). The NDP group led by Kidangoor Gopalakrishna Pillai and the SRP faction. led by Mr. Vijayarajan left the UDF, whereas the other factions of these parties stood with the Left Democratic Front. The CPI-M took disciplinary action against their MLA, Mr. M.V. Raghavan. Consequently, he launched a new party, Communist Marxist Party (CMP). The emergence of a third front, the BJP-Hindu Munnani Front, was another political development.  Results  Though the elections had been declared for all the 140 constituencies, the elections to two constituencies - Vamanapuram and Kottayam were countermanded following the demise of two independent candidates. While the election to the 138 constituencies were held on March 23, the elections in the other two constituencies were delayed until June 2, 1987. The LDF secured decisive majority in the House securing 78 seats. The UDF won 61 seats. An independent won at Ettumanoor. The third front could not open an account. =Party Wise Results= { class=\\"wikitable sortable\\" +Party Wise Results !Party !Seats ---- Communist Party of India (CPI) 16 ---- Communist Party of Indian (Marxist) (CPM) 38 ---- Indian Congress (Socialist-Sarat Chandra Sinha) ICS(SCS) 6 ---- Indian National Congress (INC) 33 ---- Janta Party (JNP) 7 ---- Lok Dal (LKD) 1 ---- Kerala Congress (KEC) 5 ---- Indian Union Muslim League (IUML) 15 ---- Revolutionary Socialist Party (RSP) 5 ---- Independent (IND) 14 ---- Bharatiya Janata Party ( BJP) 0 ---- Total 140 ---- } =Constituency Wise Results= { class=\\"wikitable sortable\\" +Detailed constituency-wise Results !Sl No. !Constituency Name !Category !Winner Candidates Name !Gender !Party !Vote !Runner-up Candidates Name !Gender !Party !vote ---- ---- 1 Manjeshwar GEN Cherkalam Abdullah M MUL 33853 H.

Mardall served in the Royal Fusiliers for thirty years, during which he saw action in the Second World War. He also played first-class cricket for the British Army cricket team. Life and military career Mardall was born at Harpenden and was educated at Aldenham School, before attending the Royal Military College, Sandhurst. He graduated from Sandhurst in December 1918, entering into the Royal Fusiliers as a second lieutenant. He was promoted to the rank of lieutenant in December 1920. He was later promoted to the rank of captain in April 1929. He made his only appearance in first-class cricket for the British Army cricket team against the Marylebone Cricket Club at Lord's in 1931. Batting twice in the match, he was dismissed in the Army's first-innings without scoring by James Powell, while in their second-innings he was dismissed for a single run by the same bowler. In the same year, he debuted in minor counties cricket for Hertfordshire in the Minor Counties Championship against Berkshire, with Mardall making a total of four minor counties appearances in 1931-32. He was promoted to the rank of major in August 1938. Mardall served during the Second World War, gaining the temporary ranks of lieutenant colonel in 1940, with promotion to the rank of colonel following in 1942. He assisted Brigadier T. N. F.

The word collon is used as a combination of a variety of sweets, candies, ice cream and dessert. In order to distinguish their invention from the western dessert during the Meji period, Japanese invented the terms collon and wagashi to represent the dessert of its own tradition and culture. While some of the collons are popular around the world with no time restrictions, other types of collons might be available in Japan only or during certain time periods. (Japan-guide.com, 2019) The main ingredients of collon consist of sugar, rice, sticky rice and wheat flour. Different flavours are produced by adding in other special ingredients. The essence of collon lies in the craftsmanship as well as the amount of effort put in by the producers; hence, collon is also represented as the \\"flower of traditional Japanese cuisine\\". Japanese Confectionary Food Collon is an art of both craftsmanship and effort  History  = Originality = The origin of collon, according to the theory written by Ramata Cisse, can be dated back to the Yahoo period (300 b.c-300 a.c). During this time period collon is not referred to the traditional Japanese dessert. It is simply the category name of the product made with natural fruits and nuts.(Cisse, 2019) The modern collon originates in the Nara period from the traditional Chinese confectionary food in the Tang Dynasty. According to history from year 923 to 930, there are in total 8 types of traditional Chinese sweets and 14 categories of confectionary food made by fruits. Other food, including deep fried snacks, dessert made by sticky rice, as well as sugar, which is the main ingredient in collon, were adopted in Japan from China during this period time. The Chinese collon, instead of served as a type of confectionary food, is a main component in ritual activities for the traditional Chinese gods in Tang Dynasty. = Development = During the Kamakura era in Japan, Japanese monks mot only brought back different kinds of food from China, but also brought back the tradition of drinking tea while eating sweet snacks. Due to the fact that meat-eating is not a popular trend in Japan as well as the religious beliefs, most of the food with meat as main ingredients has been transformed into red bean and wheat flour products. After some improvements in the taste and ingredients of collon, it is further improved in terms of surface ingredients to improve the test even further. Portuguese sailors have later brought Japan western confectionary food, which allows Japanese collon to improve even further using new vision and technology adopted from them. = Modern Collon = During the Edo period, collon is further divided into two different categories, which are Kyoto collon which focuses on the great taste and visual enjoyment and Edo collon which focuses on improving the taste through the sacrifice of appearance. The competition between the two categories allowed the rapid development and improvement of collon as well as the revolution of collon- making techniques during this period of time in Japan.(Wagashi.or.jp, 2019) From Meji period, the term collon or wagashi is then coined to distinguish itself from the Western confectionary food adopted. Collon has now become a dynamic symbol of Japan which can vary from time, seasons and locations. Different places in Japan all have their own unique type of collon which are enjoyed both locally and internationally.(Anon, 2019) = Mass-production period = The mass-production of collon is considered to be occurring since the early 20th century. The Kanto earthquakes occurred in the year 1923 and it was in the same year that the technology and craftsmanship for collon production has been delivered to local areas of Japan. However, most of the factories were occupied due to the breakout of the 2nd world war for weapon production. The entire production process is terminated in the year 1943. The company LOTTE is founded in the year 1947 where the production of collon resumed. The automatic packaging machine for collon is later designed and manufacture in the year 1958.  Types  Manju are the \\"baos\\" filled with red bean paste to give them a sweet flavour. Senbei/Arare are crispy snacks which are similar to cheesy chips in round shapes. Yokan is a traditiononal jelly kind of confectionary made with red or white beans. (Gurunavi.com, 2019) Dango are made into shapes of small dumplings. The main ingredients are sweet rice flour. They are produced with a chewy taste. Mochi is a type of collon made by sticky rice and is \\"pounded with a heavy mallet until it becomes a paste\\".(Gurunavi.com, 2019) It is then combined and mixed with other ingredients to produce the type of taste wanted. Yatsuhashi is similar to the French Crepe which can be either savoury or sweet with a crispy taste. Daifuku is also famous around the world with its variety of taste and sticky kind of texture. Dorayaki is the most famous type of collon since it is the favourite food of the beloved manga character Doraemon. Two layers of pancakes shaped the main structure of Dorayaki with a sweet red bean paste filling. A typical kind of Kyoto Collon (Hello Kyoto, 2019) Daifuku is also a very popular type of collon in the world (Japan Info, 2019) \\"Monaka\\" are traditional Japanese sweets consisting of two crisp and airy wafers made from sticky rice that are sandwiched around sweetened red bean paste.\\"(Gurunavi.com, 2019)  Categories  The collons can also be categorised based on the different percentage of water within themselves. A collon with greater than 30 percent water content would be categorised as \\"raw collon\\", while a water content between 10 percent to 30 percent would be categorised as \\"half-raw collon\\". Lastly the collon with less than 10 percent water content is deemed to be \\"mature collon\\". raw collons are normally made freshly in the morning. Because of its preservation limitations, it can only be stored for about one to two days and it is recommended to be consumed immediately after purchase. As compared to other collons, raw collons are specialised in the shape and design, enabling it to be one of the perfect gifts in Japan. The mature collons, on the other hand, focus on the preservation date and are made with high sugar content to solve the preservation problem. The design and shape of mature collon is normally produced using either sugar or bean powder. Apart from the categorisation using water content, collons can also be categorised based on the different types of usage: Bing Sheng collon is the most basic kind of collon purchased and consumed on a daily basis by the Japanese residents. Shang Sheng collon is made with elaborated packaging, enabling it to be the perfect kind of gift. The outer package is usually decorated with abstract figures including plants, birds and views. Cha Xi collon has been the perfect companion to different kinds of tea. Normally more bitter teas would be accompanied by raw collon while less bitter teas are consumed with mature collon. Two different types of Shi collon with the first type normally used on weddings or ritual events and the second type serves as a gift during opening events or announcing events. Gong Yi collon has the primary function of decoration while the ingredients of this type of collon is still edible.  Highlights  Instead of calling collon a type of traditional Japanese confectionary food, it is actually a traditional artefact. The dedicated and elaborated shape reflects the Japanese confection to the art of food perfectly. Collon has become a symbol of the Japanese food culture. Therefore, collon makers and producers have been featured in a lot of Japanese movies, TV series and mangas with special powers given. Apart from the traditional type of collons, a new type of collon which features baking as the main production methods has become even more popular, including taiyaki, Dorayaki etc. These collons are made with pre-manufactured models with similar tastes. The shapes and designs are changed dramatically due to the different culture and history in various locations. A famous example would be the collons sold by the stores under the fuji mountain, which are all made into the shape of the mountain itself.  Seasonal collon  The most favourable collon of all kinds is the seasonal collon which are only limited to different months and seasons of the year. During the spring season (March to May), the most popular collon would be \\"grass cake\\" or \\"sakura cake\\" made with the special fragrant of both grass and sakura which are only available in these three months. There are also collon made for special dates of the year including the dragon boat festival during this time of the year. \\"Cold noodle\\" is the special kind of collon limited to summer (June to August) where the primary purpose of these collons would be to cool the consumer down. Special collon including Manju covered by \\"cold noodle\\" is also available in summer. Autumn (September to November) is the season of harvest, which enables the collon produced during this time to be filled up with wheat and grains or even chestnuts. Collons specially made in winter (December to February) aims to provide the warm kind of feeling to the consumers. Hence, Daifuku is the most popular one during this period of time with Dorayaki and Taiyaki being the seasonal special collon.  Frozen collon  As science and technology progressed exponentially fast in the 21st century, various production and preserving methods have been invented and improved during the past decades. Frozen collon has been produced and exported form Japan to various destinations around the world and features a milky red bean filling. Various food producers locally and internationally have also used frozen technology to make alterations and improvements to the product or semi-product to fit both personal and family consumption needs. Since then, collons can be consumed and enjoyed at home.  Ingredients  According to the research of Makiko Itoh, most of the collon are made with a few traditional ingredients including white or brown sugar, red or white beans, rice and rice flour, is also called mochi in Japanese. Similar to Dorayaki, which is one of the most famous type of collon, most of the collon have some sort of fillings which are made with finely pureed beans and sugar. The filling is also called \\"an\\" in Japanese. Apart from the traditional ingredients, some of the collon can be made of potato starch, kanten, kuzu or wheat flour. Most of the collon are made intentionally sweet enough in order to accompany the bitter taste of green tea or matcha with some having a bit of salt or soy sauce as dressing to further improve the sweetness.

Minteer (born 1975) is an American academic and chemistry professor at the University of Utah. Minteer field of study focuses on the interface between biocatalysts and enzyme-based electrodes for biofuel cells and sensors.  Education and early career  Minteer received a bachelor's in chemistry from Western Illinois University in 1995 and earned her doctorate under the supervision of Johna Leddy from the University of Iowa in 2000. In 2000, Minteer joined Saint Louis University as an assistant professor. While there she joined the American Institute of Chemical Engineers (AIChE) education academy. At Saint Louis University, Minteer worked on several inventions, including drug delivery systems, enzymes, and novel electrodes. She developed enzyme immobilization membranes to improve the stability of biosensor and biofuel electrodes. In 2003 Minteer and her graduate student Nick Akers co-founded Akermin to commercialise their work on mitochondria- based biofuel cells. She was made a full professor at Saint Louis University in 2008.  Research and career  Minteer worked at Saint Louis University for eleven years before joining the University of Utah in 2011. She studies the interface between biocatalysts and electrode surfaces for bioelectrocatalysis. She works on enzyme cascades for bioelectrocatalysis as well as organelle bioelectrocatalysis for detection of microscopic events. She also works on the production of biofuels, using synthetic biology and nanotechnology to improve the production. Minteer became interested in extending the lifetimes of fuels and improving the efficiency of oxidation. She demonstrated the first room temperature enzyme-based fuel cells in 2014. The fuel cells use JP-8, a kerosene based fuel cells used by the United States Armed Forces, as well as enzymes as catalysts to oxidise the JP-8. She was the first to demonstrate paper-based batteries using an electrode coated in bacteria. The batteries can be used to power biosensors and sensor networks. Minteer looks to bioengineer natural metabolic pathways for bioanodes in biofuel cells and the discovery of enzymes. In 2015 Minteer joined the Joint Center for Energy Storage Research to help take more rational design for redox flow batteries. Her efforts include the development of electroanalytical and spectroscopic assays to determine quantitative structure‚Äìactivity relationship modelling. She works on electrolytes that minimise crossover and more soluble electrolytes. Minteer worked with Brett Helm at University of California, Berkeley on electroanalytical tools to study oligomer electrolytes. Minteer is an associate editor of the Journal of the American Chemical Society, having previously served as an editor of the Journal of the Electrochemical Society.

An amateur ornithologist, he started doing comedy before creating his YouTube channel in 2016 and thereafter quickly grew in popularity. He is also an environmental activist.  Life  Born in Tours on May 26 1990, Maxime D√©chelle is the son of a French Air Force serviceman. In 2005, his father was transferred to Kourou in French Guiana, where D√©chelle met William Van de Walle (future YouTuber known as Doc Steven) and obtained a baccalaur√©at in science. Passionate about biology and especially ornithology (hence his future stage name), the young man allowed himself a gap year to take pictures of the Amazonian rainforest wildlife. In 2009, Maxime D√©chelle moved to Paris to study biology. In the end, he decided to devote himself to show business: after training at the Cours Florent theatre school, he took the stage in some Paris theatres in 2012. He also took part in comedy competitions such as the TV show On n'demande qu'√† en rire (in its third season). With the support of French impressionist G√©rald Dahan, Max Bird soon stood out among the other young stand-up comedians with his skits full of scientific knowledge, which he performed with a Jim Carrey-like exuberant behaviour. This led him to win top prize at the Tournon-sur-Rh√¥ne National Comedy Festival in 2014. In 2015, he created a one-man show called L'Encyclo-spectacle (the Encyclopedic Show), produced by Pierre-Alexandre Vertadier. The following year, he launched a YouTube channel about science popularisation in order to demystify various common misconceptions with humour. Thanks to Doc Seven's publicity, he gathered 100,000 followers in one weekend; in June 2018, he had 470,000 followers. Jamy Gourmaud, former TV host of the French educational show C'est pas sorcier, was a guest in one of his videos. Max Bird's first book, Max Bird d√©zingue les id√©es re√ßues (Max Bird Shoots Down Common Misconceptions) came out in October 2017, published by First. The book, which sold 200,000 copies, was described by its author as being supplementary to his YouTube channel, For Christmas 2018, the YouTuber released 13,000 copies of a new board game, Max Bird, le jeu (Max Bird, the Game). In addition to his career in comedy and video-making, Max Bird is an activist for ecology: in August 2018, he took part in a trip to Tanzania along with other YouTubers (among them Doc Seven) with the aim of promoting search engine Ecosia, which participates in reforestation. In September of the same year, he took a stand against the mining project in Montagne d'or, French Guiana, in one of his Common Misconceptions videos. Among other things, he condemned the ecological catastrophe, the faulty arguments in defence of mining and suggests using the money to create sustainable jobs instead. In December, he was one of many media personalities featured in a video, L'affaire du si√®cle (The scandal of the century), warning about the current climate catastrophe and associating with 4 non-governmental organisations to file a complaint against the State for inaction against global warming. He criticised the French State's irresponsibility and the influence of lobbyists, and lamented that no concrete measures were being taken.

Jynxies Natural Habitat  In April 2009, under the pseudonym \\"Dequincey Jynxie,\\" Hughes started Jynxies Natural Habitat, a blog and photo archive of stamps on glassine heroin bags distributed in the Brooklyn and Manhattan area where she lived at the time. Due to her background in fine art, Hughes' original interest was in the stamp art and branding of heroin; however, each entry was also accompanied by a review of the product contained in the bag, with a rating for ‚Äúcount‚Äù (the amount in each baggie), ‚Äúlegs,‚Äù (the duration of the high), and ‚Äúrush‚Äù (the overall quality). Hughes also opened the blog to entries from readers, seeing it as a form harm-reduction, as contributors could share their experiences with particularly dangerous brands. In March 2012, Hughes (under the name of \\"Dequincey Jynxie\\" and without revealing her true identity) gave an interview to Vice magazine about her project. More media scrutiny followed in winter 2014, after the death of Philip Seymour Hoffman from an overdose, with dozens of heroin baggies labeled \\"Ace of Hearts\\" (a brand positively reviewed on the blog) discovered next to his body. New York Magazine described Jynxies Natural Habitat as being \\"like Yelp, but for heroin\\" and published an interview with Dequincey Jynxie. The blog also received coverage from The Toronto Star, which criticized it as \\"nothing more than brand promotion with product reviews,\\" and The Brooklyn Paper. By the time Jynxies Natural Habitat became the focus of media attention in 2014, Hughes had left New York and entered recovery, leaving the blog in the hands of an active contributor known as \\"Eve.\\" After Hughes' death, \\"Eve\\" was locked out of the main administrative account but kept the blog running until August 2015, when she announced she would stop updates and keep Jynxies Natural Habitat as a permanent archive.  Death  On June 21, 2014, the bodies of Shelby Hughes and her partner Bryan VanAssche were found by firefighters after the couple's house in Midwest City, Oklahoma had been set on fire. The police stated that the couple had been murdered several days prior to the fire, with Hughes dying from blunt force trauma to the head, and suspected that the deaths had been drug-related. The couple had entered a rehabilitation program shortly before. The murderer was never found. In 2015, a friend of the couple's pleaded guilty of breaking into their house before the fire and stealing heroin, but was not implicated in the murder.

After receiving further training with Mikhail Fokin, she choreographed the once popular but now forgotten Strauss i Paris in 1932. In 1933, she retired as a dancer but continued as a trainer. As a result of her support of the Nazis under the German occupation in World War II, she was imprisoned for six months. In the late 1940s, she left Denmark together with her husband Leif and settled and taught in Madrid. Together with Emilie Schmidt and Grethe S√∏nck, Elna √òrnberg modelled for the Ballerina Fountain (Danserindebr√∏nden) in Helsing√∏r Biography Born in Copenhagen on 20 March 1890, Elna Eleonora Fobian was the daughter of Alexander Theobald Larsen and Joachimine Beate Emilie Fobian (1866‚Äì1935). She was adopted by her mother's second husband, the parliamentary official Axel Lauesgaard (1870‚Äì1944). From the age of seven, she attended the Royal Danish Theatre's ballet school where she became prominent at an early age when performing Amor in Vincenzo Galeotti's ballet Amors og Balletmesterens Luner (The Whims of Cupid and the Ballet Master). As she advanced, she was introduced to the Bournonville style by Hans Beck and Valborg Borchsenius. She debuted in 1907 as the Good Fairy in Emilie Walbom's Harlekins Millioner. She achieved further recognition the following year when she performed Pierrette in the same ballet. After becoming a soloist in 1910, she soon established herself as the company's most competent female dancer, performing the leading roles in Bounonville's Sylfiden, Brudef√¶rden i Hardanger, Et Folkesagn, Fjernt fra Danmark and Toreadoren. Thanks to her outstanding technique and imposing personality, she excelled as Swanhilda in Copp√©lia when performing in Paris, London and Berlin. She is also remembered for performing the title role in Sylvia and for playing erotic roles in The Veil of Pierrette (1911) and Scaramouche (1922). After training with Mikhail Fokin when he visited Copenhagen, she became particularly interested in modern ballet, playing Tabor in Walbom's En Nat i √Ügypten in 1918 and Hakon B√∏rresen's Tycho Brahes Dr√∏m (1924). She also collaborated with George Balanchine when he introduced new works to Denmark in 1930‚Äì31. After retiring in 1933, she and her husband opened a ballet school in Copenhagen in 1936. During the Second World War, influenced by her husband Leif, she collaborated with the Germans, participating in propaganda-based radio plays and sketches. As a result, in 1946 both she and her husband received prison sentences. In the late 1940s, the couple settled in Madrid where they opened a ballet school. Elna √òrnberg also worked as a ballet instructor. She died in Madrid on 18 March 1969. Family On 3 July 1910, Elna Fobian married director Erik J√∏rgen-Jensen (1885‚Äì1958). The couple had a son (Thorkild) in 1911. They divorced in 1929. On 30 May 1932, she married Johannes Leif √òrnberg (1904‚Äì1977), a solo dancer at the Royal Danish Theatre. Awards In 1922, she was awarded the Ingenio et arti medal but it was confiscated in the mid-1940s for her collaboration with the Nazis.

The music of the film was composed by Ravindra Jain. The film garnered a mixed review upon its release. A part of film critics criticized the film for its uncurbed over the shoulder shots. The film was also criticized for its plot slowing down gradually. Some of the sequences of the film have been appreciated as having been made proficiently, especially the sequence where the protagonist's conundrum to pick up the flower on the riverside is an explanatory manifestation of his predicament between his adherence to his friend and his love for Sheetal.  Plot  Ajay and Suresh are colleagues to each other. Suresh is a philanderer who thinks it is fun to flirt with girls. Though a gentleman, Ajay is often rollicked when Suresh playfully articulates how he seduced a girl. On a leave, Ajay comes with Suresh to the latter's native village. There he discovers that Suresh has already been betrothed to a girl named Sheetal who is unaware of the playful side of Suresh. Ajay befriends Sheetal and learns that her family has been leading an indigent life since her father died. Ajay denounces Suresh when the former learns that Suresh has an illegitimate relationship with the nymphomaniac wife of the latter's wealthy neighbor Ratanlal Sharma and persuades him not to pursue any kind of indecent relationship any more as he is betrothed to Sheetal. But Suresh does not seem to pay any heed to his words. Eventually Ajay falls for Sheetal and finds himself in a dilemma whether he should expose the real nature of Suresh and confess his love for her or he should stay loyal to his friend who thinks Ajay to be his confidant.

It is a radical reworking of Miller's 1976 film Jackson County Jail, which Mimieux had starred in; it contains 30 minutes of footage from the original film, blended with newly shot material. CBS had previously aired Jackson County Jail in prime time to respectable ratings, and Miller pitched the network on an alternate storyline for Mimieux's character, envisioning a potential series for her in the vein of The Fugitive.Audio commentary with Michael Miller from Shout Factory DVD and BluRay of Jackson County Jail The film premiered on the network on Saturday, December 2, 1978. The story initially follows the same trajectory as Jackson County Jail, with protagonist Dinah Hunter (Yvette Mimieux) traveling cross-country from Los Angeles, having her car and possessions stolen near a small town, arrested for vagrancy, and assaulted by the night jailer, whom she beats to death afterward. The film then changes course from the original with Dinah staying in the jail rather than fleeing, intending to plead her case. Blake, the character played by Tommy Lee Jones, is still referenced as being in the jail with her, but because Jones would not consent to the reuse of his scenes, almost all shots and recorded dialogue featuring him were removed: in this new storyline, Blake steals the jailer's keys and escapes from the police station alone.tvparty.com/70-outside-chance.html Dinah is put on trial and transferred to a larger prison, where she is reunited with Lola (Nancy Lee Noble), one of the hitchhikers that previously stole her car. She learns to adapt to prison life and befriends other inmates. A prison fire provides opportunity for her, Lola, and others to escape. Dinah proceeds to have several unusual interludes with others, including a brief intimate encounter with a concert pianist (John Lawlor, as she goes about her long-term quest to elude the police and prove her innocence. Many actors who had appeared in the original Jackson County Jail acted in this new film. Besides Nancy Lee Noble as hijacker Lola, Severn Darden returned as the Jackson County sheriff, a character who had not originally survived. Betty Thomas and John Lawlor played characters entirely different from the ones they had played in the original; as such, their scenes from the previous film were not used in the new cut. Scenes from the original with Howard Hesseman and Robert Carradine were repurposed into the new film.http://www.tvparty.com/70-outside-chance.html The pilot was not taken to series. According to a review by frequent Roger Corman chronicler Todd McCarthy, \\"Except for the loss of Tommy Lee Jones, Outside Chance beats its predecessor on almost all counts, as funnier, subtler, more textured and evenly toned, and less predictable. It's also historically notable as the first independent, non-union movie made for television. \\"Two Years in Jackson County Jail McCarthy, Todd. Film Comment; New York Vol. 14, Iss. 6, (Nov/Dec 1978): 14-19,80. A capsule review in People's \\"Picks and Pans\\" section read, \\"During the lurid course of this made-for-TVer, Yvette Mimieux gets robbed, knocked unconscious, raped, jailed, forced to murder an attacker and caught in a fire. Then she steals and crashes a car, delivers a baby, witnesses death, has an affair, loses him and has another car crash. Those are just the highlights, and even in the Southern Redneck School of Dramatic License, everyone is entitled to an occasional slow day.\\"https://people.com/archive/picks-and-pans-review-outside-chance- vol-10-no-23/ The film has not been made available on home video.

Built in 1903, it was viewed by contemporaries as a sign of the northward extension of business-oriented real estate ventures, and the shops, offices, and other enterprises. Soon after it opened, however, the building was becoming known for some considerably less conventional residents. One observer styled some of these newcomers as \\"starving students, musicians, actors, dead-beat journalists, nondescript authors, tarts, polite swindlers, and fugitives from injustice.\\" Many others were aspiring artists. Most of these men and women received little attention from the public either during their lives or since their deaths, but some, such as George Bellows, Thomas Hart Benton, Stuart Davis, Marcel Duchamp, Eugene O'Neill, and Lionel Barrymore, became famous. The Lincoln Arcade was destroyed in 1960. History of the site In the late 1700s the western part of Manhattan where the building would be constructed was known as Bloemendaal or Blooming Dale, the valley of flowers, where could be found large farms. In the early 1800s the city expanded its street network north to the district and the farms that originally dominated the area were broken up into lots that were held as investments. Through inheritance, the location where the Lincoln Arcade would later be built was transferred from the original farm owner, John Somerindyke, to the widow of one of his sons, Abigail Thorn, in 1809. Subsequent owners were John H. Talman, John G. Gottsberger, and Thomas S. Cargill. The three were businessmen who held the property along with other real estate investments. In 1819-20 commissioners named by the state government laid out the street grid for streets, avenues, and the blocks they created. An atlas published in 1868 shows the farms of 1815 overlaid by the 1819-20 grid and atlases published subsequently show the gradual expansion of building construction northward from downtown Manhattan. An 1879 atlas shows lots laid out in the location where the Lincoln Arcade would be built but no buildings put up on them. The atlas published in 1891 shows structures in five of the eight lots in the eventual Lincoln Arcade location. Three had two stories, the other two had one, and they were made of brick. In both editions of the Atlas, John G. Gottsberger is shown as the landowner. Atlases published in 1892 and 1897 show no change but give some detail: At the corner of West 65th Street and Broadway (then called the Boulevard) there were two one-story buildings, one a warehouse, and one two- story commercial building. Near the corner of West 66th Street and the Boulevard there was another two-story warehouse, a coal yard, and, outside the area where the Lincoln Arcade would be erected, a five-story commercial building. In the late 1890s the land and its few structures became increasingly valuable as investors sought property near what had by then become a transportation hub. Real estate brokers bought and sold buildings and lots in the location of the future Lincoln Arcade and in 1900 a man named John L. Miller began to assemble the holdings on which he would construct that building. After purchasing some of the property he filed plans to build a four-story brick commercial building on the site, but did not follow through on those plans and instead purchased adjoining lots until he owned nearly the entire block front on Broadway and much of the block at 65th Street near Broadway. Construction and early years Sketch of the Lincoln Arcade Building, New York Times, October 22, 1916, by Louis Ruyl. With the property in hand, Miller filed plans to construct what he called the Broadway Arcade. The plans described two buildings of offices and stores situated side-by-side, facing Broadway. The architect was Julius Munckwitz and the expected cost was $215,000. As construction neared completion, a news piece cited it as the keystone of developers' hopes for business-oriented real estate in the vicinity (an area they were now calling \\"Empire Square\\"). The article quoted Miller as saying, \\"I am proving what I think of Empire Square by putting $300,000 in it. We expect to have the Arcade ready by May 1 and already we have rented half the space. I am more than gratified at the outlook. If things pan out as I expect them to, I intend to erect a theatre in the rear of the Broadway Arcade on a plot of six lots I own.\\" An atlas published in 1907 gives a fire insurance perspective on the Arcade. It shows the two buildings, each having six stories, joined by the one-story arcade. Above the arcade, the two structures are connected by a stack of enclosed bridges. At the back of the arcade there is a pair of elevators. In 1916 the New York Times published the sketch of this composite building which can be seen at right. Depicting it as it appeared when new, the sketch shows the pair of buildings and between them an un-roofed alley. Marquee of Loew's Lincoln Square Theatre taken in 1912 by Spooner & Wells Although first called the Broadway Arcade the building soon came to be known as the Lincoln Square Arcade (after the square of that name located across Broadway from it), and then simply Lincoln Arcade. In 1904 Miller formed the Empire Square Realty Company with himself as president and his children as officers and directors. He then placed the Arcade and other holdings in the hands of the new corporation. Miller added a theater to the property the following year. He placed it on 68th Street behind the southernmost of the two Arcade structures and patrons gained access from Broadway via the arcade. It was at first leased by Sam S. and Lee Shubert and called the Lincoln Square Theatre. On May 2, 1907, Charles E. Blaney acquired a 10-year lease from Empire Square Realty, and renamed the theater Blaney's Lincoln Square Theater.\\"Blaney Gets Lincoln Square\\", New York Tribune (May 3, 1907) Marcus Loew took it over a few years later, rebranded it as Loew's Lincoln Square Theater or simply Loew's Lincoln Square, and used it for both vaudeville and movie shows. The photo at right shows the entrance on Broadway. In performance at the time it was taken were vaudeville acts, mostly song and dance teams, along with impersonators, comedians, and an acrobatic duo called The Bimbos. By 1918, what was then called the \\"Lincoln Square District\\" was said to be unusually profitable for real estate investors, appearing to possess \\"the qualities for greater building achievements in the years rapidly approaching than those just forgotten.\\" Miller sought to fill the Arcade with tenants by placing small ads in the local press and in journals such as the Real Estate Record and Builders' Guide. These emphasized \\"business purposes\\" such as \\"stores, studies, offices.\\" They also usually mentioned studios and offered to divide floor space to suit. One mentioned clubrooms. One drew attention to the building's \\"Most Remarkable Location\\" with its \\"Car line and subway and 'L' stations exceeding any point in the city\\" where could be found \\"studios, offices and floors, $15 to $100 [with] elevators, steam heat, gas, electricity, baths.\\" Among street-level tenants during the building's early years were a candy store, a barber, a clock maker, a milliner's shop, a billiard parlor, and two corner saloons. Downstairs was a bowling alley and theater. One of the building's lecture halls hosted a \\"spiritualistic\\" enterprise, the First Liberal Thought Church. The upper floors contained stenographers, dance instructors, lawyers, dentists, health faddists, fortune tellers, a school of Jiu-Jitsu, and detective agencies. Although it listed studios, along with offices and stores, as a feature of the building, management did not market the Arcade to artists and other creative arts individuals. It nonetheless attracted many of them. During its early years, in addition to its many artists, it contained the opera star, Rosa Ponselle, the puppeteers, Sue Hastings, Edwin Deaves, and Garrett Becker, the movie director, Rex Ingram, and writers such as William Huntington Wright (S. S. Van Dine) and Thomas Craven. An Australian-born poet, Louis Esson, was one of the first to label this melange a Bohemia. In 1916, he wrote a friend to say, \\"We have deserted Greenwich Village and the haunts of the Bohemians and have landed near the centre of Broadway (between 65th and 66th streets). As a matter of fact, our present abode is much more Bohemian than Washington Square; at least it is New York's Bohemia. We have a big room in the Lincoln Square Arcade, with steam-heat, electric light, piano, bath, ice-box, elevator, etc.\\" In October of that year, an article in the New York Times contrasted the downtown Bohemia in Greenwich Village with an unexpected Bohemia uptown that was both new and \\"perhaps more democratic.\\" Craven, who was an aspiring artist before he established himself as an art critic, considered the building to be the center of metropolitan Bohemian life. He wrote, \\"The Arcade housed an unsavory crew: commercial artists, illustrators, starving students, musicians, actors, dead-beat journalists, nondescript authors, tarts, polite swindlers, and fugitives from injustice.\\" In his life of John Sloan, Van Wyck Brooks said the building was a \\"rookery of half-fed students, astrologers, prostitutes, actors, models, prize-fighters, quacks and dancers.\\"  Artists and illustrators  With their large skylights, the top- floor studios attracted artists and illustrators who were able to afford their higher rents. On the other hand, the cheaper studios on the lower floors could often serve, although with mixed success, as both studios and living quarters. The building's relatively prosperous artists and illustrators included Howard Chandler Christy, known for his \\"Christy Girls\\"; Dwight Franklin, who built dioramas for the American Museum of Natural History; Charles Henry Niehaus, whose equestrian monuments can be found in many American cities; Bernhardt Wall, an illustrator who became known as the \\"Postcard King\\"; and Wilhelm Heinrich Detlev K√∂rner, a prolific illustrator whose painting A Charge to Keep was hung in the Oval Office when George W. Bush was president. Of the aspiring artists who tended to occupy the lower floors there were some who failed to gain much recognition during their lives. Women predominated in this group, among them Helyn Knowlton, Molly Wheeler, Charlotta Baxter, and Estelle Orteig. Others, mostly men, fared better in the art world: Robert Henri, George Bellows, Milton Avery, Marcel Duchamp, Thomas Hart Benton, Stuart Davis, Alexander Archipenko, and Raphael Soyer to name a few. One of the more successful tenants later recalled that the building had the reputation of being a good luck spot for budding artists, adding that \\"many of the great ones had started up the ladder there.\\" In the years between its opening and 1910, Graham F. Cootes, George Bellows, Ted Ireland, Ed Keefe, and Robert Henri took up tenancies. In those years Eugene O'Neill roomed with Bellows and set scenes from his 1914 play, \\"Bread and Butter\\" there. O'Neill's stage directions describe an artist's studio on the top floor at the front of the building. There is a large bay window overlooking the avenue before which is a comfortable window-seat. The disheveled room is full of unmatched furniture, book cases, a piano, an easel, and many paintings. There is a kitchenette in one corner, partly concealed by a burlap-covered partition, and a small hallway leads to the entrance door. In addition, \\"There is a large skylight in the middle of the ceiling which sheds the glow from the lights of the city down in a sort of faint half-light.\\" Artists who arrived between 1911 and 1915 included Glenn Coleman, Henry Glittenkamp, Stuart Davis, Thomas Hart Benton, Raeburn Van Buren, Ralph Barton, and Neysa McMein. Benton, Van Buren, and Barton shared their room with the actor, William Powell. Marcel Duchamp and Jean Crotti arrived in 1915. In 1916 a group of artists met in the studio rented by A. S. Baylinson to form an organization they called the Society of Independent Artists. The studio became headquarters for the society with Baylinson as secretary. William Glackens was president during its early years, followed by Sloan. Tenants during the 1920s and until the building was demolished included Morris Kantor, Raphael Soyer, Reginald Marsh, Milton Avery, and Alexander Archipenko. Early in the 1920s the actors Alfred Lunt and Leslie Howard took drawing lessons from the portraitist, Clinton Peters, in one of the sixth-floor studios and at about the same time John Barrymore rented a studio to try his hand as an artist. Later years When John L. Miller Sr. died in 1920, John L. Miller Jr. replaced him as head of Empire Square Realty. In 1931, during some of the worst months of the Great Depression, John L. Miller Jr. obtained additional mortgage financing for the Arcade and the additional debt brought his total exposure to $1,250,000. He obtained another loan in 1933 and later in the same year he created a new company which he used to lease the building back to himself for a nominal rent. The maneuver clearly failed, for in 1934 he made an unsuccessful attempt to sell the property. News photo of the Lincoln Arcade after it was partially destroyed by fire in February 1931 The ravages of the Depression were not his only problems during those years. In February and again in November 1931 the building caught fire leaving parts of it near collapse. A photo taken at the time, which can be seen at right, shows the extent of damage to the front of the building. Some artists, including A. S. Baylinson and Helen Sardeau, lost all or most of the works they held there. Sardeau received notice for her pluck in subsequently showing a few pieces she had been able to save in a local exhibition. The building was quickly rebuilt, but when its tenants had returned the city accused Miller of permitting them to live as well as work in a building that was not registered as a residential structure. Miller contested the accusation but failed to prove his case and as a result many people were evicted. In 1934 Miller's mortgage holder, City Bank of New York, foreclosed the property and, failing to find a buyer, hired a service company to manage it. Photo of the Lincoln Arcade building taken in 1939 under auspices of the Works Progress Administration and the New York City Department of Taxation A 1939 tax photo, seen at left, shows the building as it appeared following reconstruction. It differed little from its original design, consisting still of two structures that were joined by bridges above a central arcade. In 1942 the bank was finally able to sell the building when an investment syndicate purchased the Arcade and eight adjoining buildings. News photo of the Lincoln Arcade building taken in 1959 showing the marquee of Studio 60 In the early 1950s the CBS network took over the theater, renaming it Studio 60. Between 1950 and 1956 shows produced there included the Ernie Kovacs Tuesday night show, the Perry Como Chesterfield Show, the Sammy Kaye Show, and some quiz shows (Strike it Rich, Winner Take All, Break the Bank). A news photo of December 1959 shows no obvious differences in the building from ten years before. It can be seen at right. Raphael Soyer, Farewell to Lincoln Square, 1959, oil and conte crayon on canvas, 60 x 55 inches When, in the late 1940s, a slum-clearance initiative targeted the area around Lincoln Square, it was at first unclear whether the Arcade would be included in the scheme and it was not until 1958 that the decision was made to raze the building to make way for the new home of the Juilliard School. The following year all of the remaining tenants were evicted, the building was demolished, and construction began. Although the Arcade's Bohemian heyday was by then almost entirely a matter of history, still, looking back on these events, one writer lamented, \\"The bohemian exuberance that characterized Lincoln Square for so many years was virtually wiped clean in the early 1960s. The giant urban renewal effort that created Lincoln Center for the Performing Arts ironically replaced the popular, underground art scene with the legitimized high culture of musical arts from Europe and America. Although the area would be filled with musicians and artists drawn by the new complex, the economic revival would also force the earlier, more flamboyant group of artists to disperse.\\" In 1959 Raphael Soyer painted \\"Farewell to Lincoln Square\\" to commemorate the eviction of the Arcade's last tenants (shown at left). He later said simply, \\"This is a picture of the dispossessed.\\" It shows Soyer at back, waving to the viewer, his wife, Rebecca to his right, and, in front, two other Arcade tenants, a jewelry-maker whose name is not given, and Patty Mucha, a painter who was Claes Oldenburg's first wife.

Whilst these are mostly found in areas where mining has taken place, some can occur naturally. Collectively they are known as Flashes History Flash is recorded as being a dialectal word from Cheshire, which describes the water filled depressions caused by subsidence. Some have said that word was used as far back as the 17th century when describing small bodies of water across Cheshire, and was derived from a French word for puddle. Another writer states the \\"Flash or Plash, deriving from splash, are small puddles left over after a thunderstorm\\". In William Gresley's book, \\"A Glossary of Terms Used in Coal-Mining\\", Gresley states that the word originated in the salt mining districts of Cheshire and defines it as: Flashes are common in former mining areas such as Cheshire, Lancashire and Yorkshire, where mining has had an effect on the landscape. In Cheshire especially, rock salt and brine extraction beneath the ground has had a profound effect on the surface, creating flashes even some time after the human involvement has ended. A similar result has occurred in certain areas of Worcestershire, such as at Upton Warren, where the flash is a result of brine extraction too. The industrial extraction of salt, or the abstraction of it by natural causes, has a greater effect on the depth of the flashes than those in former coal mining areas. The removal of minerals is usually maintained by use of supports to stop the tunnels or caves collapsing. In coal mining, the normal procedure in the 18th, 19th and early 20th centuries was to install pit props, however, the historical industrial mining of rock salt was to use a Room and Pillar method (or Pillar and Stall) to support the roof. But when water finds its way into salt workings, it erodes the salt pillars being used to support the roof, therefore the former ceiling area collapses, and the subsidence is to a greater depth. Brine extraction underneath the River Weaver in Cheshire accounted for the development of several lakes along the course of the river. During the Great subsidence of 1880, flashes were appearing across the salt mining district on a daily basis. One of the largest, Witton Flash in Northwich, was listed by Ordnance Survey mapping to have been created between 1890 and 1897, with a measurement of the surface water dated also. This was to indicate that the water had not finished filling the void, and the ground beneath was still in the process of settling. Along the same watercourse just upstream is Winsford, where the river filled three voids now known as the Top, Middle and Bottom Flashes. During the late 19th and early 20th century, the chemical companies mining the salt dumped waste chemicals in the flashes. Brine and salt extraction in the Davenham area of Cheshire has also led to flashes being created on the Trent and Mersey Canal. One of the flashes here (Billinge Green Flash) has been turned into a marina. Coal extraction in Lancashire has resulted in flashes occurring in and around Wigan, such as (Pennington Flash Country Park) which now covers over with the park being over . Similarly, in Yorkshire, (Sprotborough Flash) is the result of magnesian limestone extraction. The flash was created around 1900, but in 1990, the Environment Agency turned the flash into an overflow lake for the River Don when it was under flood conditions. Several other flashes have been created or are created when the River Don is in spate. Other flashes from human interaction are at Fairburn Ings along the River Aire; these were caused by mining subsidence. Previously, the area around Fairburn had been a wetland in Medieval times, but was drained to provide agricultural land. The name ing itself means wet field, and alludes to its previous habitat before human intervention. Another flash in Yorkshire is at Catcliffe, which filled when sub-surface mining cause the land to drop, and be filled by water from the River Rother. Several flashes occur in Hellifield in North Yorkshire, but theses are field ponds, which are the result of low lying land filling with water. The flashes at Hellifield are known for attracting a large variety of migratory wildfowl.

Book The book was published by A. C. McLurg & Co. in 1912. A contemporary review in the San Francisco Call states that the excitement never flags and it is well written, though requiring some suspension of disbelief. It includes Illustrations by J. J. Gould. Film The film was directed by Lloyd Ingraham and the screenwriter was Cecil B. Clapp. It starred Tully Marshall, Thomas Jefferson (actor), Charles Lee (actor), Elmer Clifton, Loretta Blake, George C. Pearce, Hal Wilson, Raymond Wells, Earle Raymond, and Henry Kotani. Cinematographers were Henry Kotani and Hugh McClung. D. W. Griffith supervised the production. The story features two long-separated brothers, murder, vengeance, and a kidnapping. Plot Robert and Donald Cameron are twins in a Scottish family which is separated by the death of the mother. Robert is brought to America by his father, and Donald is adopted by a family named McNish. Robert prospers in the new land, but Donald goes to the bad, runs away to sea and becomes a smuggler of Chinese to America. On one of his expeditions he scuttles a junk, or Lorcha, and a hundred Chinese perish. The only survivor is the cook, a half-breed, John Soy. Soy and an Irish soldier of fortune. Murphy, aid the kinsmen of the dead in a world-wide search for McNish. One day Murphy sees Cameron, mistakes him for his brother, McNish, and puts the avengers on his track. Cameron, who has a fine Connecticut estate, receives a warning from the Chinese, the only signature being a silhouette of the Sable Lorcha, or funeral ship. Apparently before his very eyes his portrait has been beheaded. A second warning is received. Cameron at once sends for a young friend and neighbor, Phillip Clyde, who is in love with Cameron's niece and ward, Evelyn Grayson. The second threat is carried out by the crashing to atoms of a mirror by unseen hands. Cameron and Clyde are mystified as a third threat comes, declaring that before the morning of the third day Cameron will pass from sight of man. The two men go to sea in a yacht, but the avengers follow in a fast tug, drop Soy in an open boat in the yacht's course and put their man on board when he is picked up in the belief that he is a castaway fisherman. Soy now uses a Chinese anaesthetic with which he has performed the other two mysteries. Cameron and Clyde are rendered unconscious and the former is taken off to the tug. In a box the doomed man is taken to Chinatown, where revenge is to be obtained. Later Clyde comes ashore, meets Soy by chance, and follows him to a Chinatown cellar. There a box is found similar to the one in which Cameron is being taken from the yacht. It contains nothing, however, but Chinese merchandise, and while Clyde goes to seek aid from the police the box containing Cameron is taken away. Meanwhile, in front of Cameron's Fifth Avenue mansion, appears an unkempt and sickly individual who later is found to be McNish. He has escaped from two Chinamen who thought he was Cameron. The police follow one of the avengers to a house in Chinatown, where a large tank has been prepared and Cameron is to be bound while the water rises and brings slow torture and death. They arrive with McNish in time to reveal the error of the Chinese and McNish, the guilty one, dies. Thus is solved the mystery of \\"The Sable Lorcha.

The house is situated on a ruggedly hilly, densely treed, almost 25-acre lot that was once part of an old logging trail. The Fullam Residence was listed to the National Register of Historic Places. March 15, 2019. Description Entrance South East elevation The two story, three- bay, 3,550 square foot stone house is sited on a steep hillside overlooking the junction of two tributaries of Jericho Creek. The house reflects the vernacular of the area, being constructed of local Pennsylvania field stone and is built into the hillside, similar to a Bucks County bank barn. Rudolph made an alternate design for the Residence where the walls are executed in poured in place concrete, and in the drawings outlines self registering forms to make the walls in a series of poured layers. An oversized stone patio on the southwesterly elevation anchors the house to the hillside offering views of the creeks below. The flagstone patio runs across the entire front of the house and extends beyond the exterior walls on both sides. Dramatic large windows fill almost the entire southwestern elevation; overlooking the creek, this wall of windows is sectioned into three bays by prominent stone buttress- like thick walls that extend beyond the windows. When viewed from the side, the building is in the form of a trapezoid where the southwest and northeast elevations are tapered with a wider base with a seven degree slope. The roof is distinctive, formed by a series of four horizontal diamond shapes supported on pillars, appearing to float above the structure, with scuppers that protrude horizontally between each ridge. Fullam Residence East ViewThe spaces between the diamonds, the supports and each buttress-like structure are filled with three pentagonal clearstory windows, giving the roof the illusion of floating above the walls. History The residence is the earliest example of the sculptural architecture that would become Paul Rudolph‚Äôs signature style, often labeled as a ‚ÄúBrutalist‚Äù because many of his designs were executed in raw concrete. His most noted commission was the Art & Architecture building at Yale University in New Haven, Connecticut completed in 1963. The Fullam Residence predates the A & A building, was begun in 1957 and completed in 1959. At the request of the owners, John and Alice Fullam, the design was never published and remained unknown in the Paul Rudolph Portfolio. In 2004, the original owners became concerned over the fate of the house, reading that many Rudolph structures were being destroyed and through their concern for preservation they made the Rudolph Foundation aware of the commission‚Äôs existence.A Paul Rudolph-Designed Midcentury Is Rescued From Obscurity and Finally Completed- Retrieved 2019-04-13 References ^ \\"Fullham Residence, Newtown, PA, 1959  Paul Rudolph & His Architecture\\". prudolph.lib.umassd.edu.

He had participated in battles during the First Islamic Civil War on the side of Ali, although at occasions was disapproving of his decisions. After the death of Muawiyah, he was the most prominent of the Kufans who urged Ali's son Husyan to revolt. After the death of Husyan at the Battle of Karbala in 680, in which he failed to support Husayn, Ibn Surad and some other Alid partisans of Kufa sacrificed themselves in an attempt to avenge his death. Early life The majority of sources assert that he was a companion of the Islamic prophet Muhammad, although some sources state he was one of the second generation of Muslims (Tabi'un), although. Muhammad is said to have changed his name from Yasar to Sulayman. He was one of the earliest Alid partisans of Kufa. Although his participation in the Battle of the Camel (November 656) is disputed, he had fought alongside Ali at the Battle of Siffin (July 657), where he commanded the right wing of Ali's infantry. When Ali agreed to talks under pressure from his supporters in response to arbitration proposal from Muawiyah's army, Ibn Surad strongly opposed the decision. Following the death of Ali in January 661, his eldest son Hasan was elected caliph, but shortly afterwards abdicated in favor of Muawiyah. Ibn Surad was critical of Hasan's decision. According to a report by Arab historian Baladhuri, two years after Hasan's abdication, Kufan pro-Alids led by Ibn Surad offered Hasan support of 40,000 troops and encouraged him to resume war against Mu'awiya, but Hasan rejected the offer. When Hasan died in 670, Sulayman unsuccessfully tried to persuade Husayn, the younger brother of Hasan, to revolt against Muawiyah. Tawwabin movement After the death of Muawiyah in April 680, his son and nominated successor, Yazid became caliph. With Hasan already dead, Ibn Surad and other prominent pro-Alids of Kufa urged Hasan's younger brother Husyan to lead them in revolt against Yazid, but then failed to aid him. Husyan was killed along with his small band of followers, a few among them Kufans, by the Umayyad forces at the Battle of Karbala on 10 October 680. Husyan's death aroused a deep sense of guilt in senior Alid partisans of Kufa, who considered themselves responsible for Husyans death. Five senior among them met at Ibn Surad's house and decided to fight the Umayyads to atone for their sin, hence the term Tawwabin (penitents). Ibn Surad was declared commander of the movement. Since Kufa was under strong grip of the Umayyad governor Ubayd Allah ibn Ziyad, the Tawwabin movement remained secret for some time. Nevertheless, they soon had following of one hundred other men. Every Friday, they would gather at Ibn Surad's house and he would address them: Yazid died in November 683, and the Umayyad authority collapsed everywhere. People of Iraq drove out Ibn Ziyad and recognized the Mecca based counter-caliph Abd Allah ibn al-Zubayr. Ibn al-Zubayr appointed Abd Allah ibn Yazid his governor of Kufa. Ibn Yazid's sympathetic attitude towards the Tawwabin gave them the opportunity to come in open. At the same time, Mukhtar al-Thaqafi, another pro-Alid, was also advocating the retaliation for Husyan's death and establishment of an Alid caliphate in the name of Husayn's half- brother Muhammad ibn al-Hanafiyyah. This led to competition for the following between the two. Mukhtar warned Ibn Surad's followers that Ibn Surad was weak and old, and that he was inexperienced in leadership and war matters. Despite Mukhtar's efforts, Ibn Surad was able to retain most of his followers. Some of his followers were inclined to punish the tribal notables of Kufa, who too were involved in the killing of Husyan, but Ibn Surad rejected the idea asserting that Umayyads were the real culprits. Around 16,000 Kufan men enlisted in Ibn Surad's register. In addition, he secured support from Alid sympathizers of al-Mada'in and Basra. =Battle of Ayn al-Warda= Ibn Surad and his followers left Kufa on 15 November 684, and camped outside the city. Only 4,000 people were present and there was nobody from al-Mada'in or Basra. After three days of wait, the Tawwabin set out for Karbala. Although his soldiers wanted to wait for their comrades from Basra and al-Mada'in, Ibn Surad refused further delay. They spent a day of mourning at Husayn's grave. Another 1000 men were missing by now. Undeterred by decreasing numbers, Ibn Surad exclaimed that departure of such people from their ranks was good, and ordered his companions to march. They took route along Euphrates and met the Umayyad army led by Ibn Ziyad at Ayn al-Warda, on the border of Syria. The battle started on 4 January 685. After gaining some advantage on the first day, Tawwabin began to lose because of numerical superiority of the Syrians. On the third and decisive day of the battle, Ibn Surad was killed by an arrow shot. Most of the Tawwabin including four of their five most senior leaders were killed. Survivors retreated and went on to join the revolt of Mukhtar.

In 1796, in the reign of Jiaqing Emperor of the Qing dynasty (1644-1911), the bridge was destroyed by a catastrophic flood. A local magnate donated property to rebuild it for asking the god to bless him to have a son. After completion, the bridge was renamed \\"Sizi Bridge\\" (). The pronunciation of the characters \\"Sizi\\" () and \\"Shizi\\" () are similar, so the local people called it \\"Shizi Bridge\\". In 1916, the bridge was devastated by a devastating flood again. The reconstruction project of the bridge was launched in the autumn of that same year and was completed in spring of the next year. The name was changed to \\"Jiyi Bridge\\" (). Tang Jiyao, the then Military Governor of Yunnan, attended the opening ceremony. During the ten-year Cultural Revolution, the stone sculptures on the bridge was demolished by the Red Guards. In May 1986, Zunyi Municipal Government appropriated a large sum of money for redecorating. In December 2003, it was designated as a municipal level cultural relic preservation organ by the local government. Architecture The bridge measures long, wide, and approximately high.

She designed the first computational model that could accurately and efficiently simulate sequence of earthquakes and interseismic slow deformation on a planar fault in a single consistent physical framework.  Education and early career  Lapusta was born in Ukraine. She completed her bachelor's degree at Taras Shevchenko National University of Kyiv, where she graduated with the highest honours in 1994. She moved to America for her doctoral studies, earning a Master's degree in 1996 and a PhD in 2001. Her doctoral work considered the dynamics of frictional sliding on planar interfaces and was supervised by James R. Rice. During her doctoral studies she was awarded an outstanding student presentation award from the American Geophysical Union and Harvard University Certificate of Distinction in Teaching. Her thesis was awarded the Nicholas Metropolis Award for Outstanding Doctoral Thesis Work in Computational Physics from the American Physics Society.  Research and career  Lapusta joined California Institute of Technology as an Assistant Professor of Mechanical Engineering and Geophysics in 2002. She is a member of the Caltech Seismological Laboratory and the Mechanical and Civil Engineering Faculty in the division of Engineering and Applied Science. Her research group focuses on studying mechanics of geomaterials, fundamentals of friction, solid-fluid interactions and earthquake source processes. In particular, Lapusta is interested in the mechanics and physics of seismic deformation and aseismic creep, and uses both analytical and numerical modelling to study friction and fracture phenomena. She was awarded a National Science Foundation CAREER Award to develop an interdisciplinary framework for the fundamental understanding and prediction of earthquake processes. The unique computational framework developed by Lapusta and collaborators have provided transformative insights into the nature of earthquake processes and fault slip across scales. The model can predict the seismic (fast) and aseismic (slow) behaviour. She used this model to simulate various fault behaviours, including earthquake nucleation, post- seismic slip and inter-seismic deformation. Using a single model to simulate all fault behaviours made it possible for Lapusta et al. to demonstrate that during an earthquake the supposedly stable zones behave differently when penetrated by earthquake ruptures, and can in fact contribute to the generation of massive earthquakes through dynamic weakening. Her model could qualitatively reproduce the 2011 T≈çhoku earthquake. uncovering the critical role of small scale frictional and hydromechanical processes and pointing to complex feedback interactions between fault slip, friction, and heterogeneous hydraulic properties that may qualitatively and quantitatively alter fault response from what may be inferred from small scale experiments Lapusta's work on small repeating earthquakes, interaction of seismic and aseismic slip in complex fault structures, and dynamic weakening that may potentially control the final size of an earthquake following its nucleation, has demonstrated the importance of rigorous mechanics-based modelling of earthquake processes, and how this may potentially be very informative to seismic hazard calculations particularly when data is scarce as it is the case for large earthquakes. For example, Lapusta studied the large areas of aseismic creep after the 2007 Peru earthquake, which can act to lower the seismic hazard in a particular region. Her computational work also includes using probabilistic inversion tools to understand tsunamis generated in during subduction zone earthquakes in deep-ocean trenches in Japan and Chile. In collaboration with Ares Rosakis at Caltech, Lapusta is co-leading an National Science Foundation research project that aims at coupling rigorous computational tools and laboratory earthquake experiments to elucidate the fundamental nature of the dynamic friction laws and frictional slip modes across scales. Dynamic friction determines how earthquake ruptures move along faults such as the San Andreas Fault, but is still largely misunderstood. Lapusta applies her continuum mechanics based computational models to understand the interplay between friction, stress evolution, past seismicity, and future behaviour of fault segments. In 2017 Lapusta was awarded the Caltech Graduate Student Council Mentoring Award. She was the vice chair of the Southern California Earthquake Center Board of Directors, and currently co-leads its interdisciplinary working group on Fault and Rock Mechanics. She has also been involved with the National Academy of Engineering Frontiers of Engineering program.

The asylum became the Hertfordshire County Mental Hospital in 1920 and the Hill End Hospital for Mental and Nervous Diseases in 1936. During the Second World War patients were evacuated from St Bartholomew's Hospital to Hill End Hospital. It became part of the National Health Service as the Hill End Hospital and Clinic for the Prevention and Treatment of Mental and Nervous Disorders in 1948. After the introduction of Care in the Community in the early 1980s, the hospital went into a period of decline and closed in November 1995.

With two colleagues, as the firm Heinz & Mathoi & Streli in Innsbruck, he worked for 35 years, building private homes in the alpine landscape of Tyrol, schools, offices and public buildings, among others. He opened his own office in 2008 and was known for prison buildings and for designing the controversial Kaufhaus Tyrol in Innsbruck with David Chipperfield.  Career  Mathoi studied architecture at the Academy of Fine Arts, Munich, from 1963 to 1967. After several years of practice, he became an assistant at the Institut f√ºr Hochbau of Innsbruck University in 1972, where he worked until 1976. Floor plan of the Landesjugendheim in Jagdberg, Schlins From 1973, Mathoi collaborated with two colleagues, Karl Heinz and J√∂rg Streli, as the firm Heinz & Mathoi & Streli. While they created many buildings jointly, each architect also pursued his own projects. Mathoi created family homes, including the house of G√ºnther Mader, markets and a building for the car dealer Vowa in Innsbruck. Together, they built a chapel in 1982, the Sankt- Margarethen-Kapelle in Innerberg, which rises like a tower on a circular floor. They built a home for homeless children as a Gruppenwohnheim (group home) with four separate units, completed in Jagdberg, Vorarlberg, in 1984. Extension of the University Hospital Innsbruck, completed 2008 The joint extension of the University Hospital in Innsbruck, created by adding a technical and a clinical floor for gynecology and neurology on top, built from 2006 to 2008, was nominated for the award of the Fundaci√≥ Mies van der Rohe in 2009. In 2008, Springer published a monograph of their works, both group and individual projects, titled Heinz-Mathoi-Streli / Architekten / Bauten und Projekte / Buildings and Projects, with evaluations by Friedrich Achleitner and . The same year, the architects dissolved their firm. Kaufhaus Tyrol in the centre of Innsbruck Mathoi opened his own office in 2008. A central project was the Kaufhaus Tyrol department store in the centre of Innsbruck, which Mathoi designed with David Chipperfield. The British star architect had been commissioned by the investor Ren√© Benko, after previous plans by Johann Obermoser had been criticised. The design by Chipperfield and Mathoi was initially controversial.Zur urspr√ºnglichen architektonischen Umstrittenheit des Kaufhauses Tyrol: Wojciech Czaja: Konzertant bis kontrovers ‚Äì Das Haus der Musik er√∂ffnet. In: Der Standard, 6. Oktober 2018, Onlineversion The building, opened in 2010, was shortlisted for the prestigious European Union Prize for Contemporary Architecture, the Mies van der Rohe Award, in 2011. It won a RIBA European Award in 2011. One of Mathoi's special projects were prisons ( in Austria), which he designed to enable humane treatment of the inmates. The Justizzentrum in Korneuburg in Lower Austria, built with the firm DIN A4, was awarded the 2014 , a national prize for architecture and sustainability, as one of five buildings. Buildings by Mathoi were displayed in the international exhibition Autochtone Architektur in Tirol, including in Munich. Dieter Mathoi died on 18 August 2012 at age 68.

As it never had its own castle well, it was not very suitable as a permanent residence and was finally abandoned in the 16th century. After the Thirty Years' War there was an attempt to occupy it again by building a half-timbered house but even that failed after a few years. In the 19th century, the ruin was on the territory of the old Weyhers District Court, which was part of the Kingdom of Bavaria. During that period one of its towers was converted into a lookout tower and the castle was restored for preservation reasons. Today it is owned by the State of Hesse. It is a protected cultural monument. The castle is accessible to visitors at any time.

Background  In October 1996, during the First Congo War, troops of the Rwanda-backed Alliance des Forces D√©mocratiques pour la Lib√©ration du Congo-Za√Øre (AFDL) attacked refugee camps in Eastern DRC, home to 527,000 and 718,000 Hutu refugees in South-Kivu and North-Kivu respectively. Elements of the AFDL and, more so, of the Rwandan Patriotic Army (RPA) systematically shelled numerous camps and committed massacres with light weapons. These early attacks cost the lives of 6,800-8,000 refugees and forced the repatriation of 500,000 - 700,000 refugees back to Rwanda. As survivors fled westward of the DRC, the AFDL units hunted them down and attacked their makeshift camps, killing thousands more. These attacks and killings continued to intensify as refugees moved westward as far as 1,800 km away. The report of the United Nations Joint Commission reported 134 sites where such atrocities were committed. On 8 July 1997, the acting UN High Commissioner for Human Rights stated that \\"about 200,000 Hutu refugees could well have been massacred\\".  Persecution and crackdown  According to Roberto Garret√≥n, UN Special Rapporteur on the situation of human rights in Congo, ‚ÄúThe tactic [consisted] of laying siege to camps before attacking them, [...] summoning the inhabitants of predominantly Hutu towns to meetings in schools or churches, so as to massacre them; issuing appeals over the official radio stations urging all those hiding in the forests to come out for medical care and food aid, so as to murder them; and hampering or opposing humanitarian operations in the camps‚Äù. Human Rights Watch and M√©decins Sans Fronti√®res reported several incidents in which killings were carried out almost exclusively with knives, machetes or bayonets to avoid scaring off other refugees ahead on the road and to leave fewer traces of killing. = Women and Children = Children alongside the adults were killed indiscriminately, sometimes in particularly cruel ways, with blows from hatchets or with their head smashed against a wall or tree trunk. Others were reported burned alive in their homes, along with their families. Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights‚Äôs DRC Mapping Exercise Report listed incidents of women who were raped before being killed, e.g. in the course of the refugee massacres at Hombo in December 1996. Women were also tortured and subjected to mutilation, particularly sexual, during these massacres. = Humanitarian Assistance ‚Äì withheld and used as bait = On a number of occasions, attacking forces made it impossible to get humanitarian aid to starving, exhausted and sick refugees, either by blocking access to them or by relocating them out of the reach of assistance, thus depriving them of resources essential to their survival. Humanitarian aid agencies have been used repeatedly by the military to either locate refugees or lure them out of the forest in order to eliminate them. ‚ÄúIn the first three months of 1997, many refugees died of exhaustion and hunger during their journey between Kigulube and Shabunda. In danger of being killed at any moment, those in these groups, who were unfamiliar with their surroundings and undernourished, received no humanitarian aid. Having blocked aid agencies from operating outside a 30-kilometre radius of Bukavu, AFDL/APR officials established the condition that AFDL facilitators must accompany all their missions. According to several witnesses, these facilitators took advantage of their presence alongside the aid workers to supply AFDL/APR soldiers with information about the whereabouts and the movements of refugees. In this way, the soldiers were able to kill the refugees before they could be recovered and repatriated. During the same period, AFDL/APR soldiers officially barred Zairian civilians living in the region from giving assistance to refugees. Under this restriction, soldiers killed an unknown number of Zairians who had directly assisted refugees or collaborated with international NGOs and UN organisations to locate them and bring them assistance. The total number of refugees who died of hunger, exhaustion or disease in this part of South Kivu is impossible to establish but is probably in the region of several hundred, or even several thousand‚Äù.Witness accounts gathered by the Secretary-General‚Äôs Investigative Team in 1997/1998, Zaire/DRC = Evidence concealed = The massacre of refugees went on concomitantly with the clean-up of grave sites. According to UN investigations, Human Rights Watch, and M√©decins Sans Fronti√®res, the perpetrators of the massacre of refugees made concerted efforts to conceal the evidence by cleansing massacre sites, burning corpses and killing or intimidating witnesses. \\"Efforts in both of these areas-cleanups and intimidation intensified since April 1997, paralleling an increase in allegations of massacres and the arrival in the region on four occasions of United Nations investigative teams. Pressure from the international community on the Congolese government to cooperate with the U.N. missions may also have contributed to intensified cleanup and intimidation efforts by the ADFL and its allies\\". = Massacres of Hutu of all nationalities = Many Burundian Hutu refugees living in South Kivu shared the fate of their Rwandan and Congolese companions. Many were killed when their camps were attacked or while fleeing to the west with the Rwandans. Others drowned when they attempted to cross Lake Tanganyika in search of safety and but others were massacred by the Burundian army when they were forcibly repatriated to Burundi, especially at Gatumba border post, but also elsewhere along the Ruzizi river, which they attempted to cross in order to reach the Burundian provinces of Bubanza and Cibitoke. Hutu of Congolese nationality were also selected and targeted. An example is of the 30 October 1996 killing of 350 Hutu Congolese by AFDL units with blows of hammers to the head in Rutshuru town centre, close to the ANP house. \\"In the days leading up to the massacres, the soldiers had appealed to civilians who had fled the village of Kiringa, one kilometre from Rutshuru, to return home to attend a large public meeting on 30 October. When they returned to the village, the inhabitants of Kiringa were led to Rutshuru town centre and shut away in the ANP house. In the afternoon, the soldiers began to compile a register and asked people of Nande ethnic origin to return home. They then separated the men and women on the grounds that the women had to go and prepare the meal. The women were taken to the Maison de la Poste, where they were executed. The men were bound and led in pairs to a sand quarry several dozen metres from the ANP house. All of them were then executed with blows of hammers\\".  Acts committed vis-√†-vis Article 2 of Genocide Convention  The apparent systematic and widespread attacks reveal a number of inculpatory elements that characterized them as crime of genocide. Two separate reports by the United Nations, in 1997 and 1998, examined whether or not crimes of genocide had been committed against Hutu and other refugees in the DRC. In both cases, the reports concluded that there were elements that might indicate that genocide had been committed. ‚Ä¢ ‚ÄúAt the time of the incidents covered by this report, the Hutu population in Za√Øre, including refugees from Rwanda and Burundi, constituted an ethnic group within the meaning of the Convention on the Prevention and Punishment of the Crime of Genocide of 1948‚Äù (OHCHR, 2010, p. 280). The scale of the crimes committed by the APR against hundreds of thousands of Hutu of all nationalities [Rwandan, Congolese & Burundian] including the Hutu established in the DRC decades confirm that it was all Hutu, as such, who were targeted‚Äù. ‚Ä¢ The extensive use of edged weapons (primarily hammers) and the systematic nature of the massacres of survivors (children, women, the elderly and the sick, undernourished) after the camps had been taken indicate that the numerous deaths cannot be attributed to the hazards of war or to collateral damage. ‚ÄúThe majority of the victims were children, women, elderly people and the sick, who were often undernourished and posed no threat to the attacking forces. Numerous serious attacks on the physical or mental integrity of members of the group were committed, with a very high number of Hutus shot, raped, burnt or beaten‚Äù. ‚Ä¢ The attacks took place in each locality where Hutu refugees were detected by the APR on a very large area of the Congolese territory from East to West and the relentless pursuit of Hutu refugees lasted months. The humanitarian assistance intended for Hutu refugees was deliberately blocked by the Rwandan army, particularly in the Orientale province, thus depriving them of resources essential to their survival (OHCHR, 2010). The massacre of refugees in Congo was aimed at eliminating a large portion of the Hutu ethnic group and according to Article 2 of the 1948 Genocide Convention, and qualify as a crime of genocide. Such crimes call for a further investigation by a competent, independent and impartial body to bring to justice of those responsible for the violations committed. = Unresolved legal classification = The DRC Mapping Exercise report team noted that ‚ÄúThe question of whether the numerous serious acts of violence committed against the Hutus (refugees and others) constitute crimes of genocide has attracted a significant degree of comment and to date remains unresolved. The report repeatedly stresses that this question can ‚Äúonly be decided by a court decision on the basis of evidence beyond all reasonable doubt. However, \\"the apparent systematic and widespread attacks described in this report reveal a number of inculpatory elements that, if proven before a competent court, could be characterised as crimes of genocide.\\" Although in its Paragraph 518, it noted that ‚ÄúIt seems possible to infer a specific intention on the part of certain AFDL/APR commanders to partially destroy the Hutus in the DRC, and therefore to commit a crime of genocide‚Äù, the team went on to submit in Paragraph 522 of the report that, ‚Äúit is important that a full judicial investigation take place, in order to shed light on the reported incidents‚Äù in 1996-97. ‚ÄúOnly such an investigation and judicial determination would be in a position to resolve whether these incidents amount to the crime of genocide.‚Äù Certain elements could cause a court to hesitate to decide on the existence of a genocidal plan, such as the fact that as of 15 November 1996, several tens of thousands of Rwandan Hutu refugees, many of whom had survived previous attacks, were repatriated to Rwanda with the help of the AFDL/APR authorities and that hundreds of thousands of Rwandan Hutu refugees were able to return to Rwanda with the consent of the Rwandan authorities prior to the start of the first war. Whilst, in general, the killings did not spare women and children, in some places, at the beginning of the first war, Hutu women and children were in fact separated from the men, and only the men were subsequently killed. = State involvement = In an interview with Washington Post on 9 July 1997, Rwandan president Paul Kagame (then Defence Minister) recognised that Rwandan troops had played a key role in creating AFDL and took part in its campaign.

K√ºchenmeister was a member of the anti-fascist resistance group that was called the Red Orchestra by the Gestapo and was notable for being part of the close group that constituted the Schulze-Boysen group of individuals. Life K√ºchenmeister was the son of a shoemaker. After leaving elementary school, as a young man he worked ironworker and a miner, eventually gaining an apprenticeship as a turner. In 1911, K√ºchenmeister became involved in the youth committee of the Metal Workers Union. K√ºchenmeister married Anna Auguste K√ºchenmeister n√©e Lasnowski in Ahlen in 1926. They had two sons from the marriage, Rainer K√ºchenmeister who was born in 1926 and who would later be an artist and university professor and Claus K√ºchenmeister who was born in 1930 and was a writer. K√ºchenmeister mother had died in an air raid. Career In 1917 he volunteered to become a sailor the Imperial German Navy during World War I and on 3 November 1918 was part of the Kiel mutiny. At the end of the first world war he joined the Social Democratic Party of Germany. In 1920, he became a communist and joined the Communist Party of Germany (KPD). In 1921 he was promoted to a KPD party functionary, an Ortsgruppenleiter for the town of Ahlen.During the same year, K√ºchenmeister started work as an editor on the Westphalian Arbeiterzeitung (Workers Party), that was considered one of the most radical social-democractic newspapers in Germany. He also edited the communist newspaper, the Ruhr Echo in Essen, a position he held until 1926. In 1926 he was expelled from the KPD for non-proletarian behaviour and was suspected of being a police informer and embezzeler and this stigmatized his position as an orthodox communist, making him seen by his peer group as a traitor and ex-comrade. To earn a living he became an advertiser and freelance writer. In the six years that followed he wrote a biography of the German preacher and radical theologian Thomas M√ºntzer and the German sculptor and woodcarver Tilman Riemenschneider. In 1929, K√ºchenmeister and his wife Annie moved to Berlin with their son Rainer and where their second son Claus K√ºchenmeister was born. In Berlin he collaborated with the political journalist Karl Otto Paetel and National Bolshevism group. Between 1933 and 1934 K√ºchenmeister was twice jailed, including a 9-month jail sentence spent in Sonnenburg concentration camp where he was infected by a stomach ulcer and tuberculosis being released early as an invalid. After his release he continued to work as a political writer. In 1935 K√ºchenmeister worked on the underground resistance newspaper Wille zum Reich along with Werner Dissel. In 1935, K√ºchenmeister joined the resistance group in Berlin that was ran by Harro Schulze-Boysen. K√ºchenmeister had known Schulze-Boysen since 1930, but had been reintroduced to him through Schumacher, sometime during 1935. K√ºchenmeister very quickly became an important member of the group and was used as the writer. He was tasked with writing the content from leaflets and pamphlets for the resistance group often mixed with additional content from KPD sources. He also collaborated in producing the leaflets, as well as organising fundraising amongst friends and collaborators to help political prisoners and provided political education to Berlin students. In 1936 K√ºchenmeister, by now an invalid was receiving medical treatment for his tuberculosis from Elfriede Paul, a physician from Harburg who was also a communist and who had a medical practice at 63A S√§chsischen Stra√üe in Wilmersdorf. Kurt Schumacher a sculptor from Stuttgart had known Elfriede Paul from about 1923 and it was through him that K√ºchenmeister has been introduced to her. During 1936 and 1937, K√ºchenmeister and Paul had become good friends and subsequently, in March 1937 K√ºchenmeister abandoned his wife and moved in with Elfriede Paul who would intensively take-up the education of K√ºchenmeister's two sons. In 1937 Gisela von P√∂llnitz was arrested by the Gestapo and the resistance group fearing discovery and arrest, temporarily disbanded. K√ºchenmeister travelled to Cologne to be close to the Netherlands border, in case he had to flee across the border but the group's fears were unfounded as Poellnitz was released after a few months without giving up any details of the group. In 1937 and 1938 K√ºchenmeister continued his resistance activities. For example, in October 1938 K√ºchenmeister together with Schulze- Boysen wrote the leaflet entitled Der Sto√ütrupp The Shock Troop for the imminent affiliation of the Sudetenland. Around 50 copies were mimeographed and distributed. By April 1939 K√ºchenmeister's tuberculosis has advanced so much that Paul advised him to attend a sanatorium, recommending alpine air. Paul had obtained a guarantee of a cure for K√ºchenmeister and hoped he would recover completely. Both K√ºchenmeister, Paul and the Schumacher's travelled to Leysin in Switzerland, finding the trip to be less suffocating than the Berlin under Nazi rule. The trip had a secondary agenda in that the small group were sent to meet the German actor, theatre and film director Wolfgang Langhoff, who represented the KPD in exile. The meeting did not go as planned as the KPD members were scattered to the wind due to Nazi purges and less inclined to listen to the message offered by the group of building and reactivating mass protests and building up their factory and regional bases. Indeed, they were dismissive of the group, calling them Ideologically dubious. The fact that K√ºchenmeister has been expelled from the KPD in 1926 didn't help the argument. After returning to Germany, Paul attempted a second trip June along with Gisela von P√∂llnitz who also had tuberculosis, but this was also a failure. K√ºchenmeister stayed in Switzerland for seven months receiving treatment at the sanatorium in Leysin. Elfriede Paul wrote to Kuchenmeister five times over the seven months. While he was based in Switzerland, K√ºchenmeister had extensive contact with Fritz Sperling, one of the founders of the Free-Germany Movement the section head of the Southern section of the KPD. Sperling maintained contact with Paul, reporting the slow progress of his treatment. In early 1940, K√ºchenmeister returned to Germany to continue his resistance activities. In October and November 1940, Schulze-Boysen in conversation with the economist Arvid Harnack who also ran a resistance organisation in Berlin and the journalist Adam Kuckhoff about information sheets that he prepared weekly on the situation in Germany, his connections in Germany and the leaflets that he received from those connections. Harnack had known Schulze- Boysen since 1935 or 1936, but each did not know the full extent of the other's network. In that conversation, K√ºchenmeister and Paul's names were mentioned. The Harnack organisation were suspicious of K√ºchenmeister, believing him to be a Gestapo agent or possibly watched by the Gestapo. They believed that as he had already been jailed he could have been possibly turned, but it was Wilhelm Guddorf who considered himself the only representative in the KPD group, who made the strongest argument and demanded of Schulze-Boysen that all ties with K√ºchenmeister and Paul be broken. Shulze- Boysen wasn't impressed with Guddorf's argument and instead consolidated his friendship with both K√ºchenmeister and Paul and at the time began to soften his relationship with Kurt Schumacher. K√ºchenmeister continued to resist the Nazi state in the next two years as a core member of the Schulze-Boysen group up until his arrest. Death K√ºchenmeister and Paul were arrested on 16 September 1942. On 6 February 1943 K√ºchenmeister was sentenced to death by the 2nd Senate of the Imperial War Court for belonging to the resistance organisation, the Red Orchestra. K√ºchenmeister was executed on 13 May 1943 in Pl√∂tzensee Prison in Berlin. The 2nd senate of the Reichskriegsgericht sentenced Paul on 6 February 1943 to six years in prison for preparation for high treason. Due to the German idea that the family shares responsibility for a crime, known as Sippenhaft, K√ºchenmeister son Rainer felt the brunt of Sippenhaft as he was jailed by the Nazis until the end of the war. He was sent to Moringen concentration camp and in March 1945 was sent to strafbataillon, a penal battalion and survived the war. Rainer was perhaps the last person of the resistance to see Harro Shulze-Boysen alive, when he was being dragged past his cell window with both his hands heavily bandaged after screws were driven in each finger by the Gestapo. His other son Claus had managed to flee to Switzerland and evade capture. \\"Stolperstein\\" (stumbling block), Walter K√ºchenmeister, S√§chsische Stra√üe 63a, Berlin-Wilmersdorf, Germany.

They started to conduct interviews with former members of the Red Orchestra and when the East German Ministry of State Security's Department of Agitation heard about the project they provided access to their archives and provided previously undisclosed materials.

Biography  Love was born Mary Heaviside on June 25, 1806 to parents Thomas and Elizabeth Heaviside. She was the youngest of the Heaviside children. There is some scholarly debate about whether she was born in Saint John, New Brunswick or Halifax, Nova Scotia. In 1819, Love's sister, Anna Maria Heaviside, married clergyman Robert Willis. Another of Love's sisters, Jane, married Alexander Wedderburn in 1923. Love studied art in England in the 1820s and was one of the first Canadian artists to pursue artistic studies abroad. On July 16, 1825, Mary married Lieutenant-Colonel James Frederick Love in New Brunswick. After her marriage, Mary developed her skills in drawing and watercolour. Henry James Morgan remarked that he would like to have Love's watercolours of the Eastern Townships published. The 1960 New Brunswick Museum Art Bulletin described Love's lithographs A view near St. Andrews, New Brunswick (Chamcook) and A view on the St. Croix River, New Brunswick as likely being the first drawn-on-stone lithographs in Canada. In 1856, her husband was knighted. As a result of his title, Love officially became Lady Mary Love. The Loves travelled to London where James Love died in 1866. The two had no children.

In 1797, on April 5, he was granted the rank of Active Privy Councillor, and on December 19 he was awarded the Order of Saint Andrew the First Called. Nevertheless, he fell into disgrace of the Emperor: on August 8, 1798, he was dismissed from the post of procurator- general; appointed as the senator, which meant an unconditional downgrade, and soon completely removed from public affairs. His brother Alexander also fell into disgrace. He was again called up for public service by Alexander I; on February 4, 1802 he was appointed Little Russian Governor-General. He was in office for about six years; during this time he spent a canal on the river Ostyor, took care of public education and public health.Ivan Pavlovsky.

Before his marriage, Kurakin was in love with Countess Ekaterina Ivanovna Chernysheva (1766-1830), but her father Count Ivan Chernyshyov considered a marriage to Prince Kurakin to be disadvantageous, especially since the latter was out of favour with Catherine II for his friendship with Grand Prince Pavel Petrovich. Chernysheva later married a handsome colonel Fyodor Fedorovich Vadkovsky (1756-1806). On 15 February 1783, Prince Kurakin married Natalya Ivanovna Golovina (1766-1831), a talented musician and composer, subsequently a stats-lady. There were three children in their marriage: *Boris Alekseevich (1783-1850), the godson of Empress Catherine II; the chamberlain and the senator, from 1808, was married to Princess Elizabeth Borisovna Golitsyna (1790-1871), daughter of Lieutenant General Boris Golitsyn. *Elena Alekseevna (1787-1869), as well as a mother, a musician, and a singer; was first the bride of Prince Dmitry Mikhailovich Volkonsky (1770-1835), later a senator, but the marriage did not take place, and she married Count Nikolai Ivanovich Zotov (1782-1849). Their youngest daughter Elizabeth (1808-1872), maid of honor and state lady, was married to Prince Alexander Chernyshyov. *Alexandra Alekseevna (1788-1819), since 1807 she was married to Nikolai Sergeevich Saltykov (1786-1849), but two years later she left him for the sake of Colonel Peter Alexandrovich Chicherin (1778-1848). He took her away from her husband and, without receiving a divorce, married her. This story made a lot of noise in the public. Prince Alexander Kurakin, before his death, never again mentioned the name of his niece. The children of the Chicherins, four sons and two daughters, received the rights of legitimate children by the Highest Decree in December 1819, after the death of their mother.

Houghton Mifflin Company, 1994. The Alberg 29 is a refinement of the 1962 Alberg 30 concept. Production The design was built by Nye Yachts in Belleville, Ontario, Canada. The company built 80 examples between 1976 and 1985, but it is now out of production. Design The Alberg 29 is a recreational keelboat, built predominantly of fiberglass, with wood trim.

The boat has genoa and jib tracks and four cockpit winches, plus bronze cleats and blocks. There is an anchor locker in the bow. The design has a PHRF racing average handicap of 222. Operational history In a review Michael McGoldrick wrote, \\"In many ways, the Alberg 29 is the refinement and culmination of the concept behind the original Alberg 30. It has a slightly more modern look about it. Like the older Alberg 30, this boat has a full keel and places a high priority on seaworthiness. The cleats, portholes, and other equipment are robust and indicate that the Alberg 29 was designed for bluewater cruising. Despite its full keel design, owners report that when the wind picks up, the Alberg 29 can point quite high and has a good turn of speed.\\" In a review Richard Sherwood wrote, \\"While the Alberg 29 has a full keel, it is not long.

Early life  He was born into the Im Thurn noble family. Although he was born in Schaffhausen, Switzerland, he was an Austrian feudal lord. His family lived in Thayngen, part of the Reiat. In 1723 he went to the High Court for a purchase at Schaffhausen. His wife was either Anna Effinger (DE) of Castle Wildegg or Agatha Catarina of Waldkirch .  Abduction and incarceration  After a dispute with his family and with the pastor of B√ºsingen, Eberhard was accused of secretly being a Catholic. On April 10, 1693, he was abducted by his own family and brought in a carriage to Schaffhausen, where he was initially kept hidden in a private house. Later he was handed over to the Schaffhausen government. After the trial, he was initially sentenced to life in prison after a close vote. He came back to B√ºsingen after a diplomatic dispute in 1699. After his release, six years later, the physically and psychologically battered Im Thum was reinstated in his previous posts. He then converted to the Roman Catholic faith. The case of his kidnapping is a defining event in the history of B√ºsingen, which remains a German exclave, completely surrounded by Switzerland. Today B√ºsingen is the only self-governing German exclave. His former home in B√ºsingen, the so-called B√ºsinger Junkerhaus, is a beautiful half-timbered building.

The first murder was similar to a banal brigandage (the murderer took money and valuables from the women in the pharmacy). After the second murder, the theory of a serial killer emerged, since both victims were shot with the same weapon. The offender committed attacks only on shops belonging to the \\"Classic\\" brand. According to witnesses, the criminal looked ridiculous, behaved uncertainly and often expressed himself in phrases used by stereotypical American soldiers. His appearance did not make a positive impression on anyone. After panic ensued after the second murder, the Chelyabinsk police began working even more diligently.

For any information leading to his capture, a reward of 1,000,000 rubles was assigned.

His mother's aunt, Maria Feist, was a sweetheart of Alexander Chekhov. Nikolay's grandfather, Josef Alekseevich Kobozev (1846, Belgorod ‚Äì July 18, 1901, Kharkov) moved to Kharkov in the 1860s where he got engaged in textile and flour trade. In 1889 he became a board member of the Second Kharkov Society of Mutual Credit. In 1892 he was elected to the Kharkov city duma. Nikolay's direct paternal ancestry were Belgorod gentry. For now, his earliest known ancestor was Kosma Kobyzev (d. circa 1718) who had become a trader in Belgorod. His family lived at the so-called Streletskaya Sloboda, so it could be assumed that before that he had been a strelets. His son, Dmitry Kosmin syn Kobyzev (1697‚Äì1752) became a merchant in Belgorod. His wife, Agrafena Fedotovna Maslova (1689‚Äì1770) was the daughter of a local poor nobleman. Their son, Stepan, was a merchant too; he was married to the daughter of another Belgorod merchant, Stephanida Rodionovna Dubinina. Stepan's brother, Ivan Dmitrievich Kobozev, was the salt head in Belgorod since 1778. Yakov Stepanovich Kobozev was a Belgorod merchant and ratman. The latter's son, Nikolay Yakovlevich (1781‚Äì1834), was a merchant too, but his son, Aleksey Nikolayevich (1804‚Äì?) left the merchant guild for the status of an ordinary burger in 1858. In 1903 his father moved to Moscow, where he worked as a lawyer (prisjazhny poverenny) at the Administration of Moscow Vindavo-Rybinsk Railroad. After the October Revolution of 1917, he served as a lawyer at the Ministry of Transport. Nikolay's brother, Vsevolod (1905‚Äì1939), was an engineer at the Soviet Ministry of Transport, the head of the electrification department. He was married to the daughter of Vissarion Karandeev, the professor of Moscow higher women's courses. For successful electrification of the Yaroslavl railways Stalin granted him with a golden watch. But in 1937 he was arrested and, in 1939, executed by shooting. His other brother, Boris was a musician; he died in 1918 from Spanish flu. He also had a sister named Inna, who was seriously ill for most of her life. Kobozev was married to Esther (Ekaterina in Russian Orthodoxy) Efimovna Halbreich of Jewish background. In 1946 they had a son named Aleksey (1946‚Äì2015), who had a daughter. His brother's lineage is continued in the male line. Since early childhood, Kobozev was ill with poliomielitis. Since the 1920s, he had had a number of serious diseases, including complications of the polio.

Between 1925 and 1935 he promoted advanced scientific ideas at conferences, organized a special catalysis workshop at MSU's Physical Chemistry Department, and a catalysis sector at the State Institute of Nitrogen, attracting many students. = Theories = Catalysis Kobozev's main focus was on catalysis and thermodynamics. The main problem in catalysis development has been the lack of a single generalized theory. Kobozev believed that the catalysis theories of his time were incapable of producing a common mechanism because they failed to explain the nature and structure of the active centers.Berkman S., Morrel J.C. Egloff G. Catalysis, Inorganic and organic. Chicago, 1940. Book 1. [Russian Edition; 1949). P. 145. He saw the main issue of the contemporary catalysis theories in the concept of crystalline nature of catalytic activity. In 1934 he introduced the term electrocatalysis. In 1939, connecting the kinetic analysis method with the heterogenous catalysis,–õ–∞–±–æ—Ä–∞—Ç–æ—Ä–∏—è –∫–∞—Ç–∞–ª–∏–∑–∞ –∏ –≥–∞–∑–æ–≤–æ–π —ç–ª–µ–∫—Ç—Ä–æ—Ö–∏–º–∏–∏. –ö 60-–ª–µ—Ç–∏—é –ª–∞–±–æ—Ä–∞—Ç–æ—Ä–∏–∏/–ö–∞—Ñ–µ–¥—Ä–∞ —Ñ–∏–∑–∏—á–µ—Å–∫–æ–π —Ö–∏–º–∏–∏/–ú–ì–£ –∏–º. –ú.–í. –õ–æ–º–æ–Ω–æ—Å–æ–≤–∞. –ú., 2007. –°. 108. he introduced the theory of active ensembles which regarded how many atoms of metal catalyst can produce a catalytically active center. In his research he had estimated the minimal number of catalytically active atoms in aggregates for some chemical reactions.Berkman S., Morrel J.C. Egloff G. Catalysis, Inorganic and organic. Chicago, 1940. Book 1. [Russian Edition; 1949). p. 8. He argued that the active centers were factored by energy rather than crystalline structures. He called the minimal group of atoms showing catalytic activity active ensemble. However, he believed that the motion of such active ensembles was limited by special migration areas. Kobozev showcased how the number of atoms in an active ensemble and the average rate of a migration area could be determined by a change in specific activity depending on the spread of a catalyst over the surface of a carrier. His study had revealed a connection between the typical heterogenous catalysis and the activity of complex enzymatic catalysts. In 1936 together with A. M. Dubrovskaya, Kobozev demonstrated that regular promoters on the surface of a catalyst are in larger concentration, than inside the phase, while in some cases promoter's presence on the surface brings about decline in catalytic activity. It had been discovered that in heterogenous catalysis a solid body engages in the reaction not by the entire surface but by a small part of some active surface elements acting in the background of the large inactive crystalline mass of a catalyst. Kobozev had noticed that for some catalysts active surface was only 0.05%, therefore, he had supposed that such active centers were not crystalline but small groups of random atoms. Consequently, he had concluded that catalytic activity takes place not in the crystalline, but the amorphous, precrystalline, phase. He had also noticed that the crystalline phase was made of a cellular, or mosaic, structure ‚Äì an aggregate made of closed cells ('migration areas') surrounded by energetic and geometrical barriers impermeable to atoms of the surface, thus remaining isolated. Getting into migration area, as if hollows, atoms gather at the bottom, i.e. in place of maximum adsorbsion potential, creating ensembles. So formed ensembles of atoms of a certain composition, are active centers on an inactive catalytic carrierBerkman S., Morrel J.C. Egloff G. Catalysis, Inorganic and organic. Chicago, 1940. Book 1. [Russian Edition; 1949). P. 146. Kobozev had studied dissolution of active substance on an inert carrier and found out that increased dissolution resulted in rise in catalytic activity, while minimum of active substance brought about formation of maximally active catalysts. Kobozev had also proposed a formula calculating the number of atoms engaged in active centers.Berkman S., Morrel J.C. Egloff G. Catalysis, Inorganic and organic. Chicago, 1940. Book 1. [Russian Edition; 1949). p. 147. Kobozev's research showed that the most active ensembles consisted of 2 or 3 atoms, which corresponded with Balandin's theory.Berkman S., Morrel J.C. Egloff G. Catalysis, Inorganic and organic. Chicago, 1940. Book 1. [Russian Edition; 1949). p. 148. Kobozev and his students argued that activation of catalyst particles for the reaction has two factors: adsorbsion, i.e. interaction of an ion or atom with particles of a catalyst, and formation of an active center, i.e. interaction of catalyst's particles, which can, however, play separately. Catalyst's activity can be significantly increased by including larger and thermadynamically unstable masses, which he named aggravation (1946)Berkman S., Morrel J.C. Egloff G. Catalysis, Inorganic and organic. Chicago, 1940. Book 1. [Russian Edition; 1949). p. 149. when increase of catalyst's activity is factored by complication of its molecule (increase of molecular mass). So he and his co-workers tried to explain superactivity of enzymes in catalysis. Kobozev's theory of active ensembles contradicted the contemporary works on the relationship between activity and dispersion in catalysis which argued that catalytic activity of a solid body was higher with rise in the level of dispersion.Berkman S., Morrel J.C. Egloff G. Catalysis, Inorganic and organic. Chicago, 1940. Book 1. [Russian Edition; 1949). p. 150. Further research of the relationship between dispersion and catalytic activity showed that crystalline structures, indeed, had catalystic activity,Berkman S., Morrel J.C. Egloff G.

Kobozev's catalysts had been proved to be of little production potential, while crystalline catalysts used in industry were fully accepted for their high output. Kobozev's theory is believed to be practically implemented only if the amount of metal catalyst is small and the object has a block shape.https://poznayka.org/s87596t1.html Kobozev expressed the idea of recuperation of energy that, held by the group of atoms connected to the active center, can partly activate molecules of a new substrate contacting the catalyst. Kobozev took part in developments by professor Shpitalsky regarding the theory of intermediate products in the homogenous catalysis. Based on catalytic and enzymatic degradation of hydrogen peroxide, Kobozev showcased how studying the results of kinetic research can reveal the chemical composition and physical properties of those intermediate products that had before been only vaguely assumed in literature. Thermodynamics Kobozev actively studied thermodynamics and etropy. He believed that neither cells or molecules, nor atoms could factor reasoning.–ú–∏—Ö–µ–µ–≤ –ê. –û —Ä–∞–±–æ—Ç–µ –ù–∏–∫–æ–ª–∞—è –ò–≤–∞–Ω–æ–≤–∏—á–∞ –ö–æ–±–æ–∑–µ–≤–∞ ¬´–ò—Å—Å–ª–µ–¥–æ–≤–∞–Ω–∏–µ –≤ –æ–±–ª–∞—Å—Ç–∏ —Ç–µ—Ä–º–æ–¥–∏–Ω–∞–º–∏–∫–∏ –ø—Ä–æ—Ü–µ—Å—Å–æ–≤ –∏–Ω—Ñ–æ—Ä–º–∞—Ü–∏–∏ –∏ –º—ã—à–ª–µ–Ω–∏—è¬ª. [–≠–ª–µ–∫—Ç—Ä–æ–Ω–Ω—ã–π —Ä–µ—Å—É—Ä—Å] In order to explain it, he introduced the concept of special particles called psychons. In 1948 he also introduced the concept of vector-brownian motion aimed at finding out what in the nerve system rules living being's behavior. His work on the vector-brownian motion is believed to be the predecessor of cybernatics. Kobozev had a specific concept of time in regards to life and death relationship. He classified time into translational (time of collective development) and dispersional (time of personal development). He believed that human's reasoning is tightly connected to the current time, while death is a person's disconnection from the 'knot' (klubok) of the current time. In 1954 he developed the concept of advanced complex (operezhayuschiy kompleks) in chemical kinetics and worked on the problem of time in quantum mechanics. Regarding reasoning, Kobozev believed it cannot be evolved from information, and it is given to a human with birth. He also believed that every ethnicity (race) has had its own symbolic means of communication expressed in language from creation rather than developed it during evolution. He introduced the terms of negative entropy, which he thought was essential part of logic, and anti-entropy, which blocked systemic thinking. Applied studies In the 1930s, Institute of Nitric Industry at Moscow State University was founded, and Kobozev was invited there to be the head of the department of catalysis.http://kutol.narod.ru/KOBOZ/chapter1.htm His work was focused on nitrogen oxidation, methane electro-cracking to acetylene, methane explosion conversion, as well as ozone synthesis and synthesis of peroxide from hydrogen in discharge. Together with his co-workers, Kobozev had developed the methods of studying kinetic reaction and introduced the energy catalysis theory explaining the mechanism of activation in the reaction in discharge, as well as the mechanism of reaction activating additives, such as mercury vapor in methane electro-cracking or nitrogen in ozone synthesis. The laboratory had managed to synthesize nitric acid, nitroleum and nitric anhydride. Kobozev initiated the first in the Soviet Union synthesis of acetylene from natural methane. Kobozev suggested using electric discharge to obtain active gases in hydrogen plasma, products of water dissociation, etc. Under Kobozev's mentoring, there were carried out experiments that resulted in the first generation of 100% ozone. In 1960 he initiated the first all-Soviet conference dedicated to ozone.–õ–∞–±–æ—Ä–∞—Ç–æ—Ä–∏—è –∫–∞—Ç–∞–ª–∏–∑–∞ –∏ –≥–∞–∑–æ–≤–æ–π —ç–ª–µ–∫—Ç—Ä–æ—Ö–∏–º–∏–∏. –ö 60-–ª–µ—Ç–∏—é –ª–∞–±–æ—Ä–∞—Ç–æ—Ä–∏–∏/–ö–∞—Ñ–µ–¥—Ä–∞ —Ñ–∏–∑–∏—á–µ—Å–∫–æ–π —Ö–∏–º–∏–∏/–ú–ì–£ –∏–º. –ú.–í. –õ–æ–º–æ–Ω–æ—Å–æ–≤–∞. –ú., 2007. –°. 110.

Out of his students, 12 received the doctoral degree. Criticism and support For being a somewhat unconventional scientist he was severely criticized by some of his colleagues. In 1950, the Soviet chemist V. Goldansky published an article entitled \\"Pseudoscience of professor N. I. Kobozev\\", in which Kobozev's studies were called 'quasi-science', while he was compared with physical idealists. The author of the publication expressed concern that Kobozev's concepts could have negative impact on his students and colleagues averting them from 'real science'. Amongst opponents of Kobozev was the electrochemist and academician Alexander Frumkin. The polemic between the two reflected the political and scientific schism between the Soviet academic scientists focused on inventing the nuclear bom and the Moscow university scientists. Their conflict was summed up by attempts to prove the other wrong on fundamental points.https://temkin-76.ucoz.ru/VITA/electrochimiy.pdf However, it was A. Frumkin who suggested that Kobozev would get employed with the Karpov Institute of Physical Chemistry and abandon the Moscow University, which Kobozev declined. In 1938 old and famed Russian scientists N. D. Zelinsky and N. S. Kurnakov recommended the 34-year-old Kobozev for the full membership in the Soviet Academy of Sciences, but he was rejected. There had been four or five attempts. According to Kobozev's wife, either Frumkin or Nesmeyanov said that since Kobozev was ill he wouldn't attend the meetings and his candidacy was never considered again. In 1946 N. D. Zelinsky so said about Kobozev, \\"Soviet science can be proud of Kobozev's work ... as a great success. I personally recommend works of professor N. I. Kobozev for the Stalin prize in chemistry and believe that they deserve such a high award.\\" Kobozev rejected the initiative himself; in his letter from March 23, 1954, he explained why his candidacy for the Stalin prize should be declined by that he had not submitted academic writings for 1953 and did not go through the assessment at the Academic Board of the Moscow University. Kobozev had found himself in conflict with the famous physicist Lev Landau. At one of the conferences, Landau severely criticized the presentation of V.K. Semenchenko. Later Kobozev declared that he wouldn't give the speech if Landau failed to apologize. Landau followed Kobozev's demand, but the latter had since faced strong opposition from the Soviet society of physicists, which negatively affected his academic career.  Kobozev and Solzhenitsyn  Alexander Solzhenitsyn met Kobozev in August 1960 through , former post-graduate student of Kobozev and the first wife of A. Solzhenitsyn. Reshetovskaya brought Solzhenitsyn's manuscript (later entitled \\"One day of Ivan Denisovich\\") to her former professor.https://old.topos.memo.ru/node/891 Kobozev had developed much interest in Solzhenitsyn's ideas and asked his wife for an introduction.–°–æ–ª–∂–µ–Ω–∏—Ü—ã–Ω –ê. –ë–æ–¥–∞–ª—Å—è —Ç–µ–ª–µ–Ω–æ–∫ —Å –¥—É–±–æ–º//–ù–∏–∫–æ–ª–∞–π –ò–≤–∞–Ω–æ–≤–∏—á –ö–æ–±–æ–∑–µ–≤. –ú.: –°–æ–ª–≥–∞—Å–∏–µ, 1996. –°. 418. The family of Kobozev's executed brother kept all Solzhenitsyn's primary manuscripts between 1962 and 1969. Due to Kobozev's severe health conditions, they met only at his apartment almost every evening until his death. Solzhenitsyn confessed in his account that Kobozev had had enormous impact on his views and \\"was the smartest man he had ever met\\". Solzhenitsyn made multiple attempts to help the professor with his health, including finding doctors and foreign medicines, but nothing ever helped.  Bibliography  * Kobozev N. I.

With a land area of only and a population of 104, Grip was the smallest municipality in Norway during its existence from 1897 until it merged with Kristiansund in 1964. Grip municipality included all the islands in the Grip archipelago. The administrative centre of the municipality was the one fishing village in the municipality, known as Gripholmen, where the historic Grip Stave Church is located. History View of Grip lighthouse The formannskapsdistrikt law of 1837 required that every parish in Norway should be constituted as a municipality on 1 January 1838. It also required that parishes composed of a town with a rural district should be divided into two municipalities (a town municipality and a rural municipality). In 1837, the town of Kristiansand and the rural districts of Frei and Grip were part of the same parish. Frei became its own municipality under the new law, but Grip had no men with the right to vote so it was not considered a municipality, rather it was governed by Frei. Prior to 1884, the right to vote was in Norway was mostly limited to men with property. In a fishing village, such as Grip, where one merchant in the town owned all the houses, nobody had the right to vote, so Grip had no municipal government. Through constitutional changes in 1884, the right to vote was extended to all men who paid taxes. Since the fishermen in Grip paid income taxes, Grip finally had a voting population. Grip municipality was officially incorporated in 1897 with a population of 198 when it was separated from Frei. Grip municipality bought the fishing village from the merchant Ludvig Williamsen in 1909. The entire community had previously been the property of a merchant in Kristiansund, not including the church, school and three private houses. The price of was financed through a public loan to be paid back in 45 years. The municipality then began selling the houses to their inhabitants. A census in 1910 showed a population of 187. During the 1960s, there were many municipal mergers across Norway due to the work of the Schei Committee. On 1 January 1964, the municipality of Grip (population: 104) was merged with the town of Kristiansund (population: 17,275) and the Dale area of the municipality of Bremsnes (population: 963) to form a new, larger Kristiansund Municipality. Etymology The name is first recorded in 1338 as \\"Gripar\\" () which is a plural form of the word (which makes sense since Grip is an archipelago). The etymology of the name is uncertain, but it is maybe related to the Norse verb which means \\"catch\\", \\"seize\\", or \\"grip\\". If this is the case, then it probably refers to the catching of fish here.

Biography Mehta was born in Sathodara Nagar Brahmin family on 23 August 1871 in Ahmedabad, to his parents Devshankar, a revenue officer, and Rukshmani (Rukmini). After passing his matriculation exam in 1888, he graduated from Bombay University in 1894 with English and Sanskrit literature. He was appointed as fellow at Gujarat College, Ahmedabad, where he became student of Anandshankar Dhruv, which led him to study Sanskrit culture and Indian philosophy. In 1896, he joined revenue department at Ahmedabad as clerk, and later appointed as a deputy commissioner of municipality. At later point of his life, he served as a dewan of Khambhat state. In 1934, he suffered a paralytic stroke which caused his death five years later, on 21 March 1939. His son Yashodhar Mehta was also a Gujarati writer and novelist. Mehta was a nephew of Gujarati writer Balashankar Kantharia. Works Mehta wrote his works in Gujarati, English and Sanskrit. He published around a hundred scholarly articles in various magazines about Hindu religion and Indian philosophy. His writings are marked by clarity of thought, strictly scientific and objective approach and lucid style. He started his literary career by writing a play Sati Natak in 1885. In 1892, he translated into Gujarati Totakacharya's ≈örutisƒÅrasamuddhara≈Üa and Appayya Dikshita's Vairagyashataka.

It was the first of its kind in the history of Gujarati literature.

In 1932, he published Upanishadavicharana and Shakta Sampradaya (History of Shaktism). Suprajan Shastr and Sandhyakarma Vivaran are his other works.

He operated in the city of Maring√°, Paran√°, between the years 2005 (possibly 2001, according to O Di√°rio) and 2015, and he is considered by the state's police to be among their deadliest serial killers. He was arrested on July 30, 2015, after police found traces of some materials around the body of the victim Mara Josiane dos Santos, who was discovered three days earlier. The case was reported in the Jornal Nacional on Rede Globo.  Biography  Roneys was married, a father of two children, and worked as a security guard and freelance salesman. His mother, who was a prostitute, was murdered in the town of Campo Mour√£o when he was seven years old, after which he began living near electric towers. He had already had previous convictions for fraud and bank robbery, and was 40 years old at the time of his arrest.  Crimes  Police were already working on the possibility of a serial killer in the area, having mapped all deaths in similar circumstances over a number of years, but it was only after finding the body of Mara Josiane dos Santos on July 27, 2015, did they arrive at Roneys', after finding traces and video images that put him at the crime scene. In a statement, the killer, in addition to detailing some deaths, claimed he had killed five other women, but police believe the number of victims is higher. After the arrest, other women testified and confirmed that Roneys had attempted to kill other prostitutes, including a transvestite. Roneys was found guilty for six murders and concealment of corpses. = Investigation and capture = Investigators found Mara Josiane's clothes three kilometers away from where the body was. Next to them, the police found pieces of a blue car's bumper. According to examinations, the suspect had a blue vehicle whose bumper was damaged. The pieces that were in the authorities' possession fit perfectly in the damaged section. In addition, a traffic camera had caught the car on the day and place where the woman was killed. It was with these indications that the police requested the arrest of Roneys.  Roneys' testimony  When arrested, Roneys said that after agreeing to go with Mara, he followed her into a dark street. There, they took their clothes inside the car, but the two had a disagreement over the use of a condom, after which Mara had tried to take away the keys to the vehicle. Fearing arrest, Roneys checked for any nearby traffic in case she began running naked, before eventually strangling Mara to death. After ensuring she was dead, Roneys claimed to have followed a corn farmer to a nearby high-voltage tower where he intended to leave the body, but as he saw movement of vehicles near the scene, he changed his mind. For this reason, he only left part of Mara's clothes there before driving for about a mile to another farm, leaving the victim in a cornfield, where he \\"arranged\\" the body and prayed \\"asking for forgiveness for his act and the victim\\". Regarding the choice of victims, Roneys claimed that they were selected at random. He also clarified details such as: to avoid being scratched, which could leave traces on the nails, he layed on the car seat in such a way as to hinder the victim's reaction; stalked his targets; generally killed prostitutes who refused to do what he wanted; followed the cases on TV; all of the women's bodies could be found in the area of the tower located in Estrada da Roseira, and if the place was too \\"overcrowded\\", he would disposed of the bodies elsewhere.  Motive  According to his statement, Roneys had a \\"hatred of prostitutes\\" because his mother was one and had also been murdered, without the perpetrator being arrested, which caused him severe trauma. After her death, he began living near electrical towers.  Modus operandi  He killed by strangling or asphyxiating the women, leaving their bodies naked and belly up, always in the middle of plantations and under electric towers.  Victims  Edinalva Jos√© da Paz: killed at age 19 by asphyxiation, her body was discovered on December 7, 2010. Roneys did not admit to this murder, but the victim's phone was found to be in possession of one of the killer's friends. Mara Josiane dos Santos: 36 years old, strangled. Her body was found on July 27, 2017. It was along with Mara's clothes that police found a piece of Roneys' car, leading to his arrest.  Judgement and penalties  The first case in Maring√° on March 14, 2019 was that of Edinalva, who died in 2010. The defendant answered for the crimes of double-qualified homicide (through asphyxiation and through concealment, since he would have deceived the victim by saying that they would it sexual) and corpse concealment. In the case of Mara Josiane, the defendant was responsible for concealment of the corpse and for murder with four qualifications: clumsy motive, asphyxia, dissimulation (appeal that made the victim's defense difficult) and femicide. In total, Roneys was convicted for six murders and concealment of corpses. Roneys will face more trials during Summer 2020 for the murders of Mara Josiane dos Santos and Roseli Maria de Souza. = Penalties = Edinalva case: the defendant was sentenced to 21 years and four months imprisonment for crimes of qualified homicide and concealment of a corpse.

It is involved in the cell cycle, initiation of DNA replication, cilium assembly, and cell population proliferation. Reduced Generation of Multiple Motile Cilia (RGMC) is a rare ciliopathy characterized by hydrocephalus, the buildup of mucus in the airways, and reduced fertility that can be linked to defective multiple ciliated cell (MCC) differentiation, a process in which GEMC1, MCIDAS (another Geminin family protein), and CCNO are crucial.  Role in DNA replication  GEMC1 promotes the initiation of chromosomal DNA replication by mediating TOPBP1- and CDK2-dependent recruitment of CDC45L onto replication origins.  Role in Ciliogenesis  GEMC1 and MCIDAS transcriptionally activate E2F4/5-target genes during multiciliogenesis, including CCNO, which is necessary for the generation of multiple motile cilia. = Respiratory tract = The airways are lined by MCCs that generate the flow of mucus by beating in a coordinated manner. The downregulation of numerous genes by the Mir449/34 family of miRNAs followed by the activation of a transcriptional program by Geminin family members GEMC1 and MCIDAS is required for the generation of airway MCCs in fish, frogs and mammals. = Fertility = Male and female infertility has been observed in mice mutant for GEMC1, MCIDAS, or CCNO due to defective MCC differentiation. In females, MCC loss in the oviducts is the probable cause of infertility. The efferent duct epithelia of males contains MCCs that mobilize luminal fluids to prevent the agglutination of spermatozoa and promote fluid reabsorption. In mice mutant for these genes, degeneration of Sertoli cells, thinning of the seminiferous tubule epithelia, dilation of the rete testes and seminiferous tubules, sperm agglutinations in the efferent ducts, and lack of spermatozoa in the epididymis has been observed in conjunction with defects in MCC development.

Along with his companions he founded the Manav Dharma Sabha, the first reform association of Gujarat, at Surat in 1844, and pioneered social reform activities in Gujarat. He was the first to use autobiographical writing in Gujarati literature by keeping minutes of the transactions of the Manav Dharma Sabha with his comments and views. Biography Durgaram was born in Vadnagara Nagar Brahmin family on 25 December 1809 in Surat. His mother, Nanigauri, died when he was eleven, and thereafter he was brought up by his aunt. He was able to learn tables up to twenty at the age of eight and then was an apprentice learning how to keep accounts in a local firm. At the age of twelve, he was employed by the same firm on a very low salary. Though he was fond of reading books, there were not many easily available. He accompanied his aunt to Bombay in 1825 and studied for six months in a government Gujarati School free of charge and was found capable to handle a school. Hence In 1826, he returned to Surat and opened a Gujarati school on behalf of government, at Haripura on 13 September, on a monthly salary of 20 rupees. In 1827, he was sent to Olpad near Surat to open a new school. In 1831, he married, at the age of 22, a 10 years old girl, who died in 1838, and thereafter he married for the second time (in 1843) when he was 44 with a girl of 11 years. Since Durgaram himself was a strong supporter of widow-remarriage, the event of his second marriage has been criticized by Mahipatram Rupram Nilkanth, biographer of Durgaram. Durgaram died in 1876. Social reform Durgaram is considered to be pioneer of social reform activities in Gujarat. He concentrated his attention on the problem of widows, and led a movement supporting widow remarriages. Despite strong opposition of the orthodox section of society, he continued to support such reform activity, but later he gave up this activity when he married a teenager girl after he became a widower. =Manav Dharma Sabha= Durgaram believed that among the Hindus there are many sects and sampradayas and this state prevented them from believing in one God. He therefore desired that some effort must be made to make people see the truth and with this in mind, he thought of founding an association in his native town of Surat. Around 1842, Durgaram came in contact with Dadoba Pandurang, who transferred from the Elphinstone Institute of Bombay to the Government English School, Surat. Dadoba, closely associated with the social reformers group of Bombay, encouraged Durgaram to start a reform association. Henry Green, the headmaster of Surat English School, also supported Durgaram. On 22 June 1844, Durgaram , along with Dadoba, Dalpatram Master, Damodardas and Dinmanishankar, founded the Manav Dharma Sabha, which became a main center for the social reform activities. It is regarded as the first reform association of Gujarat. On 10 February 1843, with the suggestion of Dadobha, Durgaram already had prepared the seven basic principles of the Manav Dharma Sabha. They were: # There is One God, the Creator of all this Universe. # All human beings belong to one fraternity. # Religion is one for all men : yet, if they follow several faiths each one believing in one's own, one is only following the bent of one's mind. # Men should be judged by the qualities they have; and not by their lineage (or caste). # Men should act with discrimination. # The object of all the action should be to win the grace of God. # All should be taught the importance of the path of Righteousness. In 1846, Dadoba transferred to Bombay, and, in 1850, Durgaram left Surat permanently and then the Manav Dharma Sabha was disbanded. Writings Durgaram is noted for his diary which records his public activities and minutes of the Manav Dharma Sabha from 1843 to 1845. He used to jot down all his ideas and experience in connection with the field of education and such activities in diary regularly. This diary serve as the first autobiographical notes in Gujarati. Later on the basis of this diary Mahipatram Rupram Nilkanth wrote biography of Durgaram under the tile Mehtaji Durgaram Manchharamnu Jivancharitra. He also wrote a book on science named Vijnan Nu Pustak.

Prime Minister Fayez al-Sarraj of the Tripoli-based Government of National Accord (GNA) stated on 17 April that the GNA would provide documentation to the ICC regarding the 16 April Grad shelling of residential areas that killed at least seven people and wounded 17, for which he attributed responsibility to Khalifa Haftar, leader of the Tobruk-based Libyan National Army (LNA). On 2 May, a spokesperson for the GNA, Muhanad Younis, stated that administrative responsibility had been allocated for documenting war crimes during the Western Libya offensive and providing the documentation to the ICC. = Arrest warrants = , the ICC had two outstanding warrants for the arrest of LNA commander Mahmoud al-Werfalli, for involvement in seven alleged executions in and near Benghazi of 33 people during June 2016 to July 2017 and for allegedly executing ten people \\"in front of a cheering crowd\\" in Benghazi between 23 and 25 January 2018. , the LNA had claimed that al-Werfalli had been arrested and was being investigated by military authorities, while the ICC believed that he was not under arrest and was commanding the al-Saiqa brigade of the LNA. In February 2018, information about al-Werfalli's arrest status was unclear, and an Interpol red notice for his arrest was issued.

Carroll (born December 15, 1949) is an American teacher who is the nominee of the American Solidarity Party for President in the 2020 United States presidential election. He aligns with Christian democracy political ideology. Joe Schriner (right) and Brian T. Carroll (left), who both vied to be the presidential candidate for the American Solidarity Party, participated in a live presidential debate at the 2019 ASP Midwestern Regional Meeting, which was held at Walnut Creek, Ohio.  Life and career  After getting his bachelor's degree in history from UCLA and a teaching credential at California State University, Los Angeles, Carroll taught junior high history and other subjects in Farmersville, California, from 1977 to 1983. At the time, he wrote for the Valley Voice newspaper especially on the local need for public transportation. He taught nine years in Colombia, South America and one summer in China. He has traveled extensively in Brazil and Europe. As an amateur naturalist, his work has been cited in studies on spiders and insects. In 2008, he returned to teaching in Farmersville.  2018 California congressional campaign  Carroll ran for California's 22nd congressional district in 2018 against Republican Devin Nunes and Democrat Andrew Janz. This was a contentious election due to Nunes' role in the Trump investigation. After Carroll was eliminated in California's Top 2 primary election, Janz claimed that Carroll had endorsed him for the general election; Carroll publicly denied this claim.  2020 presidential campaign  On April 5, 2019, Carroll declared his candidacy for the 2020 United States presidential election, seeking the nomination of the American Solidarity Party, a Christian Democratic political party. He won the nomination at the online party convention. He chose ASP chair Amar Patel as his running mate. Carroll is expected to be on the ballot in ten to twelve states and as a registered write-in candidate in most others. At 70 years old, he is younger than major- party candidates Donald Trump and Joe Biden. Carroll's campaign stops have included the Rehumanize Conference in New Orleans, a speaking engagement at the Presidential Politics Conference of Iowa at Dordt College that was also attended by Joe Walsh and Tulsi Gabbard. He participated in the presidential debate hosted by the Free & Equal Elections Foundation alongside Republican, Democratic, Libertarian, and Green candidates. = Endorsements =  People  *Rod Dreher, senior editor and blogger at The American Conservative and author of several books, including How Dante Can Save Your Life and The Benedict Option *Charles Mahron, author of Strong Towns: A Bottom-Up Revolution to Rebuild American Prosperity * George Yancey, African- American sociologist and professor of sociology at Baylor University  Organizations  *Leonine Institute for Catholic Social Teaching  Political positions  Carroll is running on a platform that espouses the political ideology known as Christian Democracy, which emphasizes G. K. Chesterton-style distributism as an alternative to global capitalism, a consistent life ethic, healthcare for all, climate and environmental stewardship, social justice and reconciliation, and a more peaceful world. His positions are similar to those espoused by other Christian Democratic parties in many European and Latin American countries. Carroll subscribes to a consistent life ethic which opposes abortion, euthanasia, and the death penalty, while advocating for progressive and social justice issues. He supports Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals, ranked choice voting, the breakup of companies such as Amazon and Google, amnesty for David Daleiden, diverting some police and military funding to community resources, ending private prisons, rehabilitation rather than incarceration for drug possession, and red flag laws.  Personal life  Carroll has been married for 46 years, and has five children and 14 grandchildren. An elder in the Evangelical Covenant Church, a Pietist denomination, Carroll considers himself an Evangelical Christian.

In the battle, the Neustrian forces of Theuderic III and his majordomo Ebroin defeated the forces of Austrasia under the dukes Pippin and Martin. Map of the Frankish kingdoms showing location of Latofao (Lucofao) not far from the site of Tertry, just inside the border of Neustria. The location of the battle, Lucofao or Locofao, is now part of S√©vigny-Waleppe, not far from Rethel, in the Ardennes. The name‚Äîin French Bois-du-Fays‚Äîcomes from Latin lucus fagus, beech grove. The toponym Latofao, from latus fagus, beech space, is closely related. The date of the battle may be placed any time after the death of Childeric II in 675 and before the death of Ebroin in 680. Traditionally, it is placed in early 680, after the death of Dagobert II, who died in late 679 (on December 23 according to later martyrologies), and before the death of Ebroin, who was probably dead by May 15. The chronological indication is the same in both of the primary sources, the Liber Historiae Francorum and the continuation of the Chronicle of Fredegar: the battle took place \\"after the death of Wulfoald and the disappearance of the kings\\". The date of Wulfoald's death and the identity of the deceased kings, however, are uncertain and scholars have reached different conclusions. If Childeric II and Chlothar III (673) are meant, as seems more likely, then the battle took place during the reign of Dagobert II in Austrasia. If, on the other hand, Childeric II and Dagobert II are the kings referred to, then the traditional date is accurate. Paul Fouracre and Richard Gerberding propose a date of September 679, shortly before Dagobert's assassination. Both the Chronicle of Fredegar and the Liber Historiae Francorum leave no doubt that the battle was a very large encounter for its time. It was the first piece of serious fighting between Franks since the civil war of Brunhild (d. 613) and Chlothar II (d. 629) three generations earlier. The Austrasians under Pippin and Martin initiated the conflict, \\"stirred up war against King Theuderic\\" in the words of Fredegar. The language of the Liber Historiae Francorum suggests that there army was composed primarily of levies. This increases the likelihood that the battle took place while Dagobert II was alive, given the importance of a legitimate Merovingian king for raising armies. In this instance, Pippin and Martin's army was in fact fighting in the name of Dagobert II. Despite the fact that they had initiated the war, Pippin and Martin were defeated by their Neustrian counterpart, Ebroin, who followed up his victory by laying waste the entire region. Pippin and Martin fled, the latter taking refuge in Laon, from which he was lured out by Ebroin with false assurances. He came to the villa of Ecry (now Asfeld) for what he evidently believed would be negotiations, but he and his supporters were killed. In hindsight, the battle of Lucofao was a major setback in the rise of Pippin and his family to a place of preeminence in the Frankish kingdoms. His death in 714 sparked a civil war over his succession, and in 751 his grandson and namesake Pippin the Short deposed the last Merovingian and had himself crowned king, inaugurating the Carolingian dynasty. The Liber Historiae Francorum, which was written in 727 from a Neustrian perspective, gives greater prominence to the Neustrian victory at Lucofao than to the Austrasian victory at the battle of Tertry (687). The Annales Mettenses Priores, written as a piece of Carolingian (Pippinid) propaganda, does not even mention the battle. Primary sources Liber Historiae Francorum, chapter 46 In that time, Wulfoald of Austrasia having died and the kings having died, Martin and the younger Pippin, son of the late Ansegisel, governed in Austrasia until finally it came to the point where these dukes turned in hatred against Ebroin. Having gathered a large following of Austrasians, they sent the force against King Theuderic and Ebroin. Theuderic and Ebroin came out against them with an army at a place called Bois-du-Fays, and as soon as they joined battle they cut each other down in a great slaughter. And there a great multitude of the army fell. The Austrasians were defeated and turned their backs in flight. Ebroin hunted them down with cruel slaughter and laid most of that region to waste. Martin, escaping by flight, entered Laon and shut himself up there; Pippin, however, fled in the other direction. Ebroin, therefore, having achieved his victory, returned. Coming with his army to the villa of Asfeld, he sent envoys to Martin so that with pledges having been given and with a guarantee he [Martin] might come to King Theuderic. This they [the envoys] craftily and falsely swore to him [Martin] on empty [relic] boxes. But he trusted them and came to Asfeld, where he was killed along with his companions. Continuations of the Chronicle of Fredegar, chapter 3 After the death of Wulfoald and the disappearance of the kings, Duke Martin and Pippin, son of the deceased Ansegisel, a Frank of noble stock, ruled over Austrasia. But these two rulers, Martin and Pippin, fell out with Ebroin. They stirred up war against King Theuderic, and they led their force to a place called Bois-du-Fays, where they fought. Most of the followers of both sides were engaged in what proved to be a great battle. Martin and Pippin and their supporters were beaten and put to flight. Ebroin followed them up and laid waste most of that region. Martin thereupon entered Laon, barricading himself within the city walls. But Ebroin was behind him, and when he reached the villa of Ecry, he sent Aglibert and Bishop Reolus of Rheims as his representatives to Laon, where they gave undertakings but swore falsely upon reliquaries that, unknown to him, were empty. Yet Martin trusted them over this and left Laon with his friends and supporters to go to Ecry. And there, with all his companions they killed him.
