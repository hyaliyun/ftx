The dolls originated in the late 18th and early 19th century as a way to cheaply copy more expensive imported dolls for poorer families. The dolls are made from a very hard form of papier-m√¢ch√© called ‚Äúcartoner√≠a‚Äù which is also used to create alebrijes and skeletal figures for Day of the Dead. However, the craft has waned with the only workshops making and selling them located in Celaya in the state of Guanajuato, mostly as collector‚Äôs items. The project‚Äôs aim was to create more contemporary designs through a series of free workshops to the public. The resulting dolls have been displayed in Mexico City, Japan and Portugal and featured in a number of Mexican publications. Lupita dolls Miss Lupita is named after ‚ÄúLupita‚Äù (diminutive for Guadalupe) dolls. These are hard papier- m√¢ch√© dolls with origins in the late colonial to early Independence period, created by poorer families to imitate more expensive imported dolls from Spain. The papier-m√¢ch√© technique is properly called cartoner√≠a, making a very hard surface when dry. The body and head are made separate from the limbs, which are attached with cords in order to allow them to move. This technique has been used to make a number of crafts up to this day, most notably to make alebrijes and skeletal and other figures for Day of the Dead. However, Lupita dolls have lost popularity. Today they are made and sold only in workshops in Celaya in the state of Guanajuato, often as collectors‚Äô items. Workshops in Mexico City Doll named \\"Pita, la haceadors de soles\\" in honor of Pita Amor. The Miss Lupita project was initiated in Mexico City in 2010, with the aim being the revitalization of the craft of making dolls. The name is based on the Mexico City name for the dolls (in Celaya they are simply called cartoner√≠a dolls). The base of the project would be to introduce new and contemporary designs based on urban culture through workshops in Mexico City. The project was initiated by Carolina Esparragoza in January 2010, who continues to run it. Carolina Esparragoza was born in Mexico City in 1977. She is a graduate of the Escuela Nacional de Pintura, Escultura y Grabado \\"La Esmeralda\\".Aside from the Miss Lupita project, she has worked on video and art object projects as part of groups such as Malestares and La misma historia. She has exhibited her work in Mexico and the United States. Carolina Esparragoza speaking at the Memoria de un proyecto Miss Lupita event The project was initially sponsored by the Fondo Nacional para la Cultura y las Artes (FONCA). The project has also included the collaboration of artist Maria Eugenia Chellet, artisan Carlos Derramadero and writer Ana Clavel. Six free workshops were held in different parts of Mexico City in 2010 and 2011 with the only requirement being the attendance at all six. The workshops consisted of the history of the dolls along with how to make them. The workshops had over 100 participants with men and women between 12 and 71 years of age. They included professionals, artists, artisans, housewives, students and professionals. One participant traveled from Maravat√≠o, Michoac√°n to attend. The resulting 134 dolls have dimensions of about 45x16x15cm and took on average 25 hours to complete. Designs included dancers, lucha libre figures, mermaids, Godzilla figures, ladies-of-the-night, goddesses, cats as well as one made in the images of famous women in Mexico. The dolls were given names such as Siempre Viva, Hanami, La Memoria, Lupita Pecadora, Lupita Auxiliadora, Amalia, Gena, Adela, Encanto, Lupe la Brava and Andy.(mktokyo) Andy is a homage to Andy Warhol. The resulting dolls were initially exhibited in different cultural centers in the city: Casa Talavera Cultural Center, the Comunidad Barros Sierre and the Centro Cultural Teatro del Pueblo, Foro Cultural Antigua F√°brica Textil El √Åguila. An exhibition of 20 dolls was held in Mexico City in September 2011 at the lobby of the Sal√≥n Digna Ochoa at the headquarters of the Comisi√≥n de Derechos Humanos del Distrito Federal. The Jos√© Mar√≠a Velasco Gallery named the project its Piece of the Month, exhibiting five of the dolls. \\"Beauty contests\\" were also held featuring the dolls and winners appeared in publications such as Artes de M√©xico, Arqueolog√≠a Mexicana, Culturas Populares and others from CONACULTA, those of the Universidad Aut√≥noma de la Ciudad de M√©xico and Mexico City Secretary of Culture. International exhibitions and workshops Participants in a workshop in Tokyo In 2011, the Miss Lupita project was invited to visit Japan as a cultural exchange. This included an exhibit at the Sokei Academy and the Sagio-Plaza Gallery, workshops and a talk given at Tokyo Zokei University. The first exhibition was at the Sagio-Plaza Gallery in Sengawa, Tokyo with twelve Lupitas, eleven made at the Mexico City workshops and one made at a traditional workshop in Celaya. It was followed by a second exhibition of five Lupitas as part of a larger exhibition called M√©xico Chido. The workshops were nearly canceled as a result of the 2011 T≈çhoku earthquake and tsunami, but after meetings with officials it was decided to continue but at a later date. Participants in the workshops were originally to be giving Mexican traditional shopping bags as gifts, but instead it was decided that these would be sold for a nominal fee, with the proceeds going to the Japanese Red Cross. In November 2011, five workshops were given in Tokyo similar to those given in Mexico City. There were almost sixty participants in the workshops ranging from 25 to 55 years of age and included artists, students and workers who made a total of 59 dolls. Thirteen of the resulting dolls were displayed along with traditional Japanese dolls at the ATLIA Kawaguchi Art Gallery. The success of the visit in Japan prompted an invitation to the Museo do Brinquedo or Sintra Toy Museum in Portugal sponsored by the Mexican embassy in Portugal. This museum has a collection of over 40,000 toys collected over 50 years by Jo√£o Arbu√©s Moreira and is one of the most important in the world. The exhibit of four traditional style Lupita dolls from Celaya and eighteen from the 2010 workshops were on display from late 2011 to early 2012. The trips abroad were sponsored by Fundaci√≥n BBVA Bancomer, the Direcci√≥n General de Cooperaci√≥n Educativa y Cultural, the Secretar√≠a de Relaciones Exteriores and the Mexican embassy in Japan.

It is known simply as Sacred Heart. History of Sacred Heart-Saint Wenceslaus Parish The congregation dates back to 1862, when the Kaszubian Polish and the Bohemian families settling in Pine Creek united to practice their faith in the absence of any nearby Roman Catholic parish. On February 7, 1864, a parish was formally established and dedicated to Saint Wenceslaus, in honor of the parish's Bohemian contingent.Franklyn Curtiss-Wedge, compiler, and Eben Douglas Pierce, MD, editor: History of Trempealeau County Wisconsin (Winona: H.C. Cooper, Jr. and Co.) 1917, pages 878-879. Despite the Bohemian name, the parish was predominantly Polish and was served by Polish-speaking priests. In all likelihood, the parish's predominance of Kaszubian Poles led to the addition of \\"Sacred Heart\\" to the church's name, recognizing a devotion particularly dear to Poles. The first permanent pastor was the Reverend Florentine Zadzioski, who arrived in 1866. Until roughly the turn of the century, pastors came and went frequently. As Polonia expanded, Polish- speaking priests were in high demand, and not every priest could flourish in a rustic setting like Pine Creek. The arrival of the Reverend Jakob W. Gara as pastor on June 10, 1904 marked the beginning of an era for Sacred Heart-Saint Wenceslaus. Although he ruled the parish with an iron hand, as was expected of Roman Catholic pastors in those days, he was genuinely beloved by his flock. One anecdote relates that Reverend Gara was known to appear in the local saloons and buy the patrons (all of whom were his parishioners) a round.Ron Galewski, \\"Dodge, Wisconsin\\" (Winona: privately published), 2012. He died, worn out from his efforts at the comparatively young age of 62, on December 29, 1937. His funeral on January 3, 1938, was attended by more than 1,500 mourners. After Reverend Gara's death, the parish was pastored by Polish- speaking priests well into the 1960s. Sacred Heart-Saint Wenceslaus Church The original Sacred Heart-Saint Wenceslaus Church, a small frame building, was constructed shortly after the parish's formal establishment in 1864. It stood on top of the hill, overlooking the location of the current church. On May 10, 1875, a new pastor, the Reverend Adolf Snigurski, began construction of the present church. This church was designed by C.G. Maybury of Winona, who later designed the Basilica of Saint Stanislaus Kostka in Winona, Minnesota. On November 12, 1875, it was completed and dedicated. Combined with the rectory, the parish school building, and the convent built for the nuns who taught at the parish school, the church literally dominated the hamlet of Pine Creek. As the Winona Republican Herald commented in reporting on Sacred Heart-Saint Wenceslaus's fiftieth anniversary celebration, the church was truly a village in itself.\\"Winona Republican-Herald,\\" November 22, 1912. As with other similar Roman Catholic churches in the area, Sacred Heart-Saint Wenceslaus Church underwent numerous changes made for structural and for liturgical reasons. Most recently, the entire church has been renovated in a way selected to recall as much as possible the original configuration from 1875. This \\"restoration\\" is particularly appropriate seeing that Sacred Heart-Saint Wenceslaus will be celebrating its 150th anniversary in the fall of 2012. Sacred Heart-Saint Wenceslaus Parish School The Saint Wenceslaus-Sacred Heart faith community set great store by education from the very start. Religious instruction came first, of course, and a public school existed in Pine Creek from the mid-1870s on and off until 1946. But it was important that the children‚Äôs formal education also be grounded in Roman Catholic beliefs and values. Building a school was the easy part: a brick schoolhouse was completed in 1890 for the handsome sum of $3,000. The challenge was to find suitable teachers. By 1890, teaching Sisters were in great demand ‚Äì and short supply. Fortunately, the Sisters of St. Francis of Assisi (OSF), from Saint Francis, Wisconsin, came to Pine Creek in 1898. The school was expanded to four rooms in 1906, with instruction in both Polish and English. Sometimes one nun would teach two or even three grades in one classroom, but it was nothing the good Sisters could not handle. There was a tradition that public school students aged twelve and thirteen ‚Äì that is, of Confirmation age ‚Äì would attend the Catholic school for a year to complete their religious education. In 1949 the Sisters of St. Joseph of the Third Order of St. Francis came from Stevens Point, Wisconsin to take up teaching duties. A modern combination of school and convent, built on land donated by the Kujak family, was dedicated on November 10, 1961. The school closed down in 1976 but the building still serves as the rectory.

He composed learned poetry on a variety of subjects in the tradition of Hellenistic poets like Nicander and Parthenius of Nicaea, but his magnum opus was perhaps the lipogrammatic Iliad, a work which would have been a showpiece for his poetic virtuosity and knowledge of Homeric scholarship. Although his fame was great during his lifetime, little survives of Nestor‚Äôs poetry today, but its influence may be recognized in Nonnus' Dionysiaca, which appears also to have drawn upon the work of Nestor's son Peisander. Works The Suda attributes two poems to Nestor by name, a lipogrammatic Iliad (, Ili√†s leipogr√°mmatos) and a Metamorphoses (), and notes that Nestor also wrote other poems.Suda s.v. 261) Several verbatim fragments of the Metamorphoses are transmitted in the Greek Anthology. No fragments of the Ilias leipogrammatos survive, but the poem will have concerned the Trojan War much like Homer's Iliad, with at least one notable difference: the letter denoting each book's number would not have been used in its text; the first book, for example, would not include the letter alpha () which was used to denote the numeral 1.Suda s.v. 261), cf. , . Two works of medical didactic poetry are also attested for Nestor by the Geoponica: the Alexicepus (, Alex√≠kƒìpos), or Garden of Defence, and Panacea (, Pan√°keia). The Alexicepus will have belonged to the tradition of Nicander's Alexipharmaca.. An Alexandreiad (, Alexandrei√°s), attributed to a \\"Nestor\\" by Stephanus of Byzantium, who cited the poem for toponyms, was probably the work of this poet.Stephanus of Byzantium, Ethnica s.v. ; cf. , , FGrHist 153 F 13.

The main premise revolved around the fight between an underground task force called M.A.S.K. (Mobile Armored Strike Kommand) and a criminal organization called V.E.N.O.M. (Vicious Evil Network of Mayhem). After its initial launch in 1985, the franchise spawned a variety of products, including four series of action figures, an animated television series, video games, comics, and a live-action theatrical film is currently in development by Hasbro Studios and Paramount. History M.A.S.K. was developed by Kenner Products in 1985, along with an animated television series to help with toy merchandising. The animated series debuted the same year and ran for two seasons (1985 to 1986). It focused mostly on toys released during the first two series of the toyline. From 1987 to 1988, Kenner released two additional series of action figures and vehicles. However, these last two series strayed from the original theme of the series of crimefighting and terrorism, focusing instead on a racing theme. Action figures (1985‚Äì1988) The M.A.S.K. toyline ran from 1985 to 1988, releasing four official series through those years. Each series featured vehicles with hidden gimmicks designed to represent combat-ready forms. Most vehicles came with one or two drivers, and each character had a mask that was depicted in fiction as having a certain special ability. Animated series (1985‚Äì1986) Debuting in 1985, the M.A.S.K. animated series followed the original premise where M.A.S.K., a law enforcement task force led by Matt Trakker, fought against V.E.N.O.M., a criminal organization led by Miles Mayhem. The series was produced by DIC Enterprises, Inc.. M.A.S.K ran in broadcast syndication on local TV stations across America for two seasons (from 1985 to 1986). In total, 75 episodes were aired. Other media =Comics= The first M.A.S.K. comics were three mini-comics produced by Kenner that were packaged with the vehicles from the first series of toys in 1985. After the success of the franchise, DC Comics picked up the rights and produced a special insert which appeared in several comic books dated September and November 1985 to launch a four-issue miniseries (December 1985 ‚Äì March 1986). This was soon followed by another insert in comics dated from June to November 1986 and a regular series that lasted nine issues (February‚ÄìOctober 1987). A selection of the DC strips were reprinted in the UK, by Grandreams in Christmas Annuals (1986 and 1987), which also featured original text stories. Fleetway's M.A.S.K. comic magazine, initially published fortnightly before moving to a weekly pattern, featured entirely new plots produced by British writers and artists, in the standard mostly black and white short strip format of British comics. The stories were in their own continuity, not connected to either the cartoon series or DC/Grandreams comics. There was a notable difference in the comics in that Venom knew the identities of M.A.S.K. agents, whereas in the first cartoon series they did not. This weekly title lasted 80 issues before merging with the second incarnation of Eagle in 1988. M.A.S.K. was presented at the 2011 New York Comic Con by Hasbro in a convention-exclusive one-shot comic titled UNIT-E that featured various Hasbro licenses. Written by Andy Schmidt, M.A.S.K. was repackaged therein as a rogue quasi-law enforcement agency battling corruption in Detroit, led by Matt Trakker and four original team members, including a married couple. In 2016, the franchise was reintroduced as part of IDW's Revolution crossover series, with writing by Brandon Easton and artwork by Tony Vargas. Matt Trakker is depicted as African-American in the series; Easton described the character as \\"an engineering genius and intellectual bad boy who has been in search of stability since the loss of his father at an early age.\\" M.A.S.K. branched out into its own series starting in November 2016 but was canceled by IDW after only ten issues, with the final issue released on August 23, 2017. Although the series was canceled, the characters from Brandon Easton's M.A.S.K. Comic Series returned later in 2017 as part of IDW's First Strike crossover series, featured in both a one-shot issue and a six issue mini-series. =Video games= Screenshot from the Commodore 64 version of M.A.S.K. III: Venom Strikes Back Beginning in 1987, British software house Gremlin Graphics released a trilogy of computer games based on the M.A.S.K. franchise for various eight-bit computer formats. The first game, MASK I, was a vertically-viewed 2D game in which the player controls the Thunderhawk vehicle. The premise of the game is that V.E.N.O.M. have propelled Boulder Hill into a time vortex, and the player must rescue the other members of the M.A.S.K. team by collecting and re-assembling parts of a scan key, which then directs the player to the location of the missing personnel. The game received mostly favorable reviews at the time, although it was noted by some that the tie-in to the franchise was quite tenuous and only the graphics, rather than the storyline and gameplay, connected it to the M.A.S.K. franchise.MASK on Lemon Retro StoreMASK on C64Endings The second game, MASK II, also released in 1987, was a 2D horizontal scrolling shoot-em- up. The game featured many more of the M.A.S.K. vehicles, and included a selection process in which the player chose which vehicles to use before the game began. Only one vehicle could be controlled at a time but these could be quickly interchanged. Again, the game was received favorably in the press, where it was noted that it was a better tie-in to the franchise than the first, because it featured more of the vehicles.MASK II on Lemon Retro Store The final game in the trilogy MASK III ‚Äì Venom Strikes Back was released in 1988 and was a 2D horizontal shoot-em-up. The premise of the game is that V.E.N.O.M. have kidnapped Scott Trakker and are holding him on the moon. The player controls Matt Trakker (unrecognizable in a space suit with helmet) through a series of static screens featuring platform puzzles and obstacles which must be overcome using the powers of the various masks. The player can hold up to four masks at a time, but can only use the power of one at a time. The masks can also be exchanged at certain points in the game. This game received the best reviews of the trilogy, despite the deviation from the franchise's storyline and style.MASK III on Lemon Retro StoreMASK III on Generation-MSX All three M.A.S.K. games were released for the ZX Spectrum, Commodore 64 and Amstrad CPC formats, while the second and third games were also released for the MSX format. =Television= In the animated series Transformers: Prime and Transformers: Robots in Disguise, M.A.S.K. is referred as a division of the United States military that developed a special vehicle (which they described as \\"experimental, all-terrain, expeditionary fighting\\").Transformers: Prime ‚Äì Season 3: Beast Hunters ‚Äì Episode 5: Project Predacon Years later, several copies of that vehicle have been apparently mass-produced.Transformers: Robots in Disguise ‚Äì Season 1 ‚Äì Episode 17: One of Our Mini-Cons is Missing =Film= On December 15, 2015, The Hollywood Reporter reported that Hasbro and Paramount were joining forces to create a shared cinematic universe combining M.A.S.K. with G.I. Joe, Micronauts, Visionaries: Knights of the Magical Light, and Rom. A group of screenwriters that included Michael Chabon, Cheo Hodari Coker, John Francis Daley and Jonathan Goldstein were hired to develop storylines, with Akiva Goldsman overseeing the project. In January 2018, Daley and Goldstein told IGN that M.A.S.K.'s inclusion in the film project was \\"unlikely to happen\\" without specifying a reason, but in April 2018, Paramount announced the M.A.S.K. film project would commence, directed by F. Gary Gray and developed as \\"a contemporary subculture movie with a youth empowerment angle.\\" On February 28, 2020, Chris Bremner has been announced to pen the script.

Tanner invented a depth sounding system, wrote several books on hydrography and retired as a commander of the United States Navy in 1897. Career Zera Tanner was born in Warsaw, New York in 1835, the son of Zerah and Ruth (Foster) Tanner. The elder Tanner died when his son was one year old, so the younger Tanner worked in family farms until his late teens, when he apprenticed to a mechanic. Tanner traveled by ship to Great Britain in 1855, and because of ill health chose to take a longer voyage from Liverpool to Bombay, India aboard SS Culloden in 1856. After two round trips, one as third officer, Tanner chose sailing for his profession. Returning to the United States, after Tanner served aboard American merchantmen, he eventually assisted several seaborne troop movements in the Gulf of Mexico. =Civil War service= Tanner chose to join government service and was appointed acting ensign of the Union Navy in the summer of 1862. Tanner served upon the bark and the supply steamer during the American Civil War. When Rhode Island captured a British blockade runner in December 1864, Tanner was put in charge of the prize crew. During the Second Battle of Fort Fisher in 1865, Tanner commanded the boats from his vessel landing Union ground forces. =Post war service= Tanner entered the United States Navy in 1868, coming over from the deactivated volunteer services. Until his retirement in 1897, Tanner served the navy in hydrographic survey and dredging commands, often in conjunction with the United States Commission of Fish and Fisheries, generally known as the United States Fish Commission. Tanner partially designed and oversaw the construction of two ships for the commission. USFC Fish Hawk, in service from 1880 to 1926 and the first large vessel ever built expressly for the promotion of fisheries, was a smaller vessel designed for coastal waters and was primarily used as a mobile fish hatchery although she also conducted fisheries research, while USFC Albatross, which served as a fisheries research ship from 1882 to 1921 except for brief periods in U.S. Navy service in 1898 and from 1917 to 1919, was the first full-sized vessel primarily designed for marine research. Tanner was the first commanding officer of Fish Hawk, from 10 November 1882 to 21 May 1885. He commanded Albatross for nine years, including transporting famed naturalist Alexander Emanuel Agassiz on an 1891 voyage to the Galapagos Islands. Tanner was promoted to commander in 1893 and was relieved of command of Albatross on 1 May 1894. After an extended furlough, was assigned to duty with the Fish Commission on 1 January 1895. He retired from the Navy on 5 December 1897, having reached the mandatory retirement age of 62. Tanner died in Washington, D.C. in late 1906 and was buried with military honors at Arlington National Cemetery. Tanner was a Companion of the Military Order of the Loyal Legion of the United States. He was also a member of the Grand Army of the Republic and the Society of American Wars. Legacy Tanner developed an improved method of depth sounding, using instruments of his own design. He patented his system in 1899 as the Tanner navigational sounding apparatus. Two U.S. Navy ships have been named after Tanner. After World War II, , an attack cargo ship with service in the Okinawa campaign was re-purposed for oceanographic survey work and renamed . Tanner spent her career mapping significant coastline areas and was retired in 1969. In 1990, was built for the U.S. Navy as a fast oceanographic research vessel. Now named TS State of Maine, she serves as the training ship of the Maine Maritime Academy.

Bloodfire eventually ran 13 issues. Other long-running titles for Lightning Comics were Judgement Day and Perg, which ran 8 issues each. Trent Kaniuga's Creed appeared in a number of titles, one- shots, and crossovers, including one with the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles. Similar, Hellina appeared in more than 15 separate specials, crossovers, and one-shots.

United States. Bureau of Foreign Commerce, United States. Dept. of Commerce and Labor G.P.O., 1894. Pg 361 or a request for tenders) is a formal, structured procedure for generating competing offers from different potential suppliers or contractors looking to obtain an award of business activity in works, supply, or service contracts, often from companies who have been previously assessed for suitability by means of a supplier questionnaire (SQ) or pre- qualification questionnaire (PQQ). The term \\"notice inviting tenders\\" (NIT) is often used in purchasing in India.Telecommunications Consultants India Limited, Notice Inviting Tenders (NIT), accessed 6 March 2019 An ITT differs from a request for quotation (RFQ) or a request for proposal (RFP), in which case other reasons (technology used, quality) might cause or allow choice of the second best offer. An RFP is a request for a price from a buyer but the buyer would also expect suggestions and ideas on how the project work should be done. RFPs are thus focused on more than just pricing/cost, they entail a bit of consulting from the contractor or vendor. The closest equivalent to an ITT in the mainstream private sector is an RFP which, since public money is not involved, typically has a less rigid structure. Types *Open tenders, open calls for tenders, or advertised tenders are open to all vendors or contractors who can guarantee performance. *Restricted tenders, restricted calls for tenders, or invited tenders are only open to selected pre-qualified vendors or contractors. The tender stage may form part of a two-stage process, the first stage of which (as in the expression-of-interest (EOI) tender call) was itself advertised, Compare: resulting in a shortlist of selected suitable vendors. *Sole source tenders, where only one potential supplier is invited to submit a tender. The reasons for using restricted tenders differ in scope and purpose. Restricted tenders can come about because of: *confidentiality issues (such as in military contracts) *the need for expedience (as in emergency situations) *a need to exclude tenderers who do not have the financial or technical capabilities to fulfill the requirements. A sole source tender may be used where there is essentially only one suitable supplier of the services or product. Origin of the term Dictionaries explain the etymology as coming from Old French , which means 'to offer'.TheFreeDictionary by Farlex, Tender, accessed 4 June 2020 Typical template contents A typical invitation to tender template in any project has the following sections: *Introduction * Project background *Legal issues: proposed terms and conditions of contract * Supplier response required * Timetable for choosing a supplier * Requirements for tender submission, for example a fully completed but otherwise unamended form of tender must be submitted by the specified deadline. Locating tender opportunities Public sector organisations in many countries are legally obliged to release tenders for works and services. In the majority of cases, these are listed on their websites and traditional print media. Electronic procurement and tendering systems or e-procurement are also increasingly prevalent. The European Union states that 235,000 calls for tender are issued annually using its Tenders Electronic Daily (TED) system, including those issued by countries in the European Economic Area and beyond.European Union, TED: Tenders Electronic Daily, accessed 13 June 2020 Public sector organisations in the United Kingdom use this system but from 1 January 2021, on the conclusion of the Brexit process, a new e-notification service called \\"Find a Tender\\" (FTS) will be used to post and view public sector procurement notices.Cabinet Office, Public-sector procurement from 1 January 2021, published 24 April 2020, accessed 13 June 2020 A number of companies provide subscription alert services which send notifications of relevant tender documents to the subscriber. An array of private organisations also assist businesses in finding out about these tenders. Cost may vary from a few pounds a week to a few hundred. Because of the specialised language and sometimes difficult-to-grasp procedures, there are several consulting organizations who also offer companies tender writing training, or undertake bid-writing for them. ITTs may be distributed to potential bidders through a tender service, allowing businesses to receive and search live tenders from a range of public and private sources. These alerts are most commonly sent daily and can be filtered down by geographical area, or by business sector. Some tendering services divide types of business very finely in their own way, by CPV (Common Procurement Vocabulary) codes. This enables a business to find ITTs specific to what that business can supply. An ITT is usually an open invitation for suppliers to respond to a defined need as opposed to a request being sent to selected potential suppliers. The ITT often requests information following on from other information gathered previously from responses to a Request for information (RFI). This will usually not only cover product and service requirements, but will also ask for information about the suitability of the business.Mhay, S. and Coburn, C., Meaning of RFQ RFI RFT RFP An ITT is usually expected to conform to some legally standardized structure designed to ensure impartiality, and the tender bid winner is entitled to take responsibility of the contract business supply documentations formalities and settle any tender bid engagement charges for official recording. Tender box A tender box is a mailbox used to receive the physical tender or bid documents. When a tender or bid is being called, a tender or bid number is usually issued as a reference number for the tender box. The tender box would be open for interested parties to submit their proposals for the duration of the bid or tender. After the closing date, the tender box is closed and sealed and can only be opened by either the tender or bid evaluation committee or a member of the procurement department with two witnesses. Double envelope system In an open bid or tender system, a double envelope system may be used. The double envelope system separates the technical proposal (based on and intended to meet the statement of work) from the financing or cost proposal in the form of two separate and sealed envelopes. During the tender evaluation, the technical proposal would be opened and evaluated first followed by the financing proposal. The objective of this system is to ensure a fair evaluation of the proposal. The technical proposal would be evaluated purely on its technical merits and its ability to meet the requirements set forth in the Invitation without being unduly skewed by the financial proposal. Security deposit Registered contractors may be required to furnish a bond for a stipulated sum as security or earnest money deposit to be adjusted against work done, normally in the form of bank guarantee or surety. Tender validity date A tender validity date is a date until which a tenderer commits to keeping their prices (and other tender details) open for acceptance (or otherwise) by the client. Such a date is usually included in a form of tender,Form of tender, accessed 1 June 2020 either as a specified date or as the termination of a specified period from another key tender date. For example in tendering for gym equipment in 2013, West Dunbartonshire Council required tenderers to accept that \\"Your tender shall remain open for acceptance for ninety (90) days from the date for return of tenders indicated above, or any subsequent date notified to you by us. Your tender may be accepted by us at any time during this period.\\" Post-tender negotiation Post-tender negotiation involves negotiation between an intending buyer and seller after a seller's tender has been submitted. An initial stage may involve tender clarification, which is intended to eliminate any uncertainties or contradictory elements of a proposal, before moving into a true \\"negotiation\\" phase. The Chartered Institute of Procurement & Supply believes that \\"provided it is undertaken professionally and ethically, ... post tender negotiation is an appropriate process to secure value for money.CIPS, Tendering and Post Tender Negotiation, accessed 4 June 2018  Related proposal types  Other types of proposal and terms in use include: *EOI ‚Äì expression of interest *IFB ‚Äì invitation for bids *ITN - Invitation to negotiate *ITV ‚Äì invitation to vendors *RFA ‚Äì request for applications *RFD ‚Äì request for documentation *RFI ‚Äì request for information *RFO ‚Äì request for offers *RFP ‚Äì request for proposal *RFQ ‚Äì request for quotation or request for qualifications *RFS ‚Äì request for services *Sources sought See also *Construction bidding *E-procurement *ERFx *Government procurement **Government procurement in the European Union *Presales *Private electronic market *Procurement *Project management *Proposal (business) *Request for proposal *Request for tender *Reverse auction *Statement of work *Strategic sourcing References Procurement Auctions ","title":"Invitation to tender"},{"id":"36571615","text":"Nephopterix bicolorella is a species of snout moth in the genus Nephopterix.

Armed militias reportedly took positions in villages, at which point the fighting spread into Moyale itself. Businesses were shut in Moyale on both sides of the border, and homes in the villages of Chamuki and Shawabarre were reported to have been burnt. On 28 July, the United Nations reported that at least twenty people had been killed in the fighting. On 28 July, the Kenya Red Cross Society (KRCS) announced that more than 20,000 people had fled into Kenya to escape the fighting.

It was designed to be carried in soldier‚Äôs backpack, be hand-launched and recoverable through a soft landing. It is completely autonomous and can be programmed with navigational way-points, which can be changed in-flight by the ground control. With a ground tracker system, it is capable of providing continuous imagery of the on-board camera irrespective of the attitude of the aircraft. The major advantage of the vehicle is that it functions on autopilot. Its orientation can be controlled using a dedicated real-time operating system (RTOS). Further, the UAV can be tracked using Automatic Gain Control or GPS-based systems. Patrolling across the target area, the UAV will send images day and night. Zooming in over the enemy area, the UAV can carry a payload of about 250 g and has an accuracy of 1 degree. According to DRDO spokesperson Ravi Kumar Gupta, the UAV had been tested for several years, and the program has been deemed successful after the flight tests in January 2012. Collaboration with private industry Many components of the UAV, like the autopilot, thermal camera, data links, trackers and the carbon composites air- frame were provided by the private industry in India. Operators The unique features of Imperial Eagle have already caught the attention of several premier institutions and paramilitary wings. National Security Guard (NSG), Central Reserve Police Force (CRPF), National Institute of Disaster Management and home department of several states have shown interest in procuring the vehicle.

Ackerman is an American neuroscientist and geneticist. Her work has highlighted some of the genetic and biochemical factors that are involved in the development of the central nervous system and age-related neurodegeneration. Her research is aimed at helping scientists understand what causes several types of neurodegeneration in mammals. This research, and others' like it, may lead to cures for neurodegenerative diseases. Ackerman is a professor at University of California San Diego. She was formerly a professor at the Jackson Laboratory and the Sackler School of Graduate Biomedical Sciences at Tufts University. She also serves as an adjunct professor at the University of Maine, Orono. Ackerman was an associate geneticist at Massachusetts General Hospital in Boston, Massachusetts.  Education  As an undergraduate, Ackerman attended California State University (Chico), graduating with a Bachelor of Arts degree in Chemistry, and a Bachelor of Arts degree in Biology. Subsequently, Ackerman pursued graduate studies, earning a Doctorate in Biology at the UCLA.  Career and research  Since 2005, Ackerman has served as an investigator at the Howard Hughes Medical Institute. Her work there has centered on the mice that are available through the Jackson Laboratory, known as the Jax mice. These mice have a wide array of genotypic mutations, which lead to different phenotypic expression. Ackerman observes these mice and investigates the genotypic variations that lead to defects in mice. She then investigates the product of these genes and how they affect neurological development and preservation. She was elected a member of the National Academy of Sciences and the American Academy of Arts and Sciences in April 2019. = Unc5c = Ackerman's research has centered largely on the Unc5c gene. The gene product of Unc5c is the Unc5c protein, a neurological netrin receptor. Her research on Unc5c protein revealed that the protein is integral in the development of the corpus callosum, the neurons that form the connection between the two hemispheres of the brain. A mutation in the Unc5c gene, in association with other mutated genes, leads to a degeneration of the corpus callosum. However, if Unc5c is the only gene that is mutated, no noticeable difference in the corpus callosum is present. This is because the Unc5c receptor is only integral in the formation of the corpus callosum in early-born, deep layer neurons. These neurons comprise a small percentage of the corpus callosum relative to the late-born, upper layer neurons. = Harlequin mice = Ackerman's research has also dealt with genetic variations that lead to neurons being more susceptible to oxidative damage. This oxidative damage leads to apoptosis in many neurons. The research centers on the Harlequin mice, who have a proviral insertion in the apoptosis-inducing factor (AIF) gene. The AIF protein is, as the research shows, a free radical scavenger, saving cells from and reducing oxidative damage. The proviral insertion into this gene causes an 80% reduction in expression, causing oxidative damage in neurons as they age. = Other research = Other projects Ackerman has been involved in include the mutation of a U2 snRNA and its connection to neurodegeneration, an editing defective tRNA synthetase that leads to protein misfolding and neurodegeneration, and ribosome stalling by tRNA mutations that leads to neurodegeneration.

It is located at a distance of around from Earth and has a slightly variable apparent visual magnitude around 4.7. Spectrum The primary component of Œ≥ Equulei is a chemically peculiar star with a stellar classification of . It has a spectrum corresponding to an A9 main sequence star, but with unusual abundances of strontium, chromium, and europium. Stars with this type of spectral peculiarity are called Ap stars. The abundances of some metals are believed to be due to chemical stratification in the slowly-rotating star, unusual for hot main sequence stars. A fairly wide range of spectral types have been published for Œ≥ Equulei, ranging from A5 to F1, some of them also indicating unusual abundances of iron in the spectrum. Œ≥ Equulei has particularly sharp absorption lines in its spectrum, a sign of very slow rotation. Variability Œ≥ Equulei undergoes rapid periodic variations in brightness, which places it among the rapidly oscillating Ap (roAp) stars. The apparent magnitude varies between extremes of +4.58 and +4.77. It shows pulsations in several periods near 12 minutes. The strongest pulsation is at 11.7 minutes; others are found at 11.9, 12.2, and 12.4 minutes. These are identified as a series of even and odd p-mode (pressure-induced) pulsations. Magnetic field The surface magnetic field of Œ≥ Equulei undergoes slow variation, ranging from +577 G to ‚Äì1,101 G. Although only 67 years of magnetic field measurements are available, a period of has been fit to the data. This is thought to be the rotation period of Œ≥ Equulei.

The group was founded by Mahdi Al-Harati, an Irish-Libyan who led the Libyan rebel Tripoli Brigade during the Battle of Tripoli. Harati stepped down as the group's leader after six months, leaving Syrians in charge. In September 2012, it aligned itself with the Free Syrian Army. By January 2014, Liwaa al-Umma had joined with other rebel groups in Hama Governorate, including Liwa al-Haqq and Jund al-Aqsa, into a Salafi jihadist coalition called the Muhajirin wa- Ansar Alliance (not to be confused with the Chechen-led Jaish al-Muhajireen wal-Ansar). Structure and membership Harati decided to form the group following discussions with supporters of the Syrian opposition during a fact- finding mission to Syria in early 2012. According to Harati, about 90% of its 6,000+ members are Syrians, with the remaining 10% a mixture of Libyans, Egyptians, Palestinians, Sudanese and other Arabs. Harati also says that most of the Syrian fighters are former members of other rebel groups who decided to join Liwaa al-Umma, whilst others have joined as individuals. He also says that most of the Libyans are former members of the Tripoli Brigade, which received training from Qatari Special Forces in the town of Nalut during the Libyan Civil War. Syrians in Liwaa al-Umma say that, compared to most other rebel groups in Syria, the group is seen as better organized and more disciplined. Although allegedly most of its members are Syrian, foreign volunteers play a key role in the leadership of the group. The main alleged reason behind the formation of the group was so that Al-Harati and other foreign volunteers could share with the Syrian opposition their expertise and experiences fighting elsewhere. Liwaa al-Umma and the Free Syrian Army were separate until around September 2012. The group also reportedly has plans to set up a political wing to represent it in post-war Syria. Ideology According to Thomas Pierret, a lecturer in contemporary Syrian Islam at the University of Edinburgh, \\"He (Al-Harati) is not a jihadi; he sees himself as a Libyan revolutionary there to help the Syrian revolution\\". Members of the group have described the Syrian Civil War as a \\"people's revolution\\" and not an \\"al-Qaeda jihad\\". Radwan Mortada, from Al Akhbar newspaper, described the group as \\"jihadist\\" but not as extreme as other groups like the al-Nusra Front. According to the newspaper, the group holds that every Muslim has a religious obligation to free Syrians from \\"the tyrant\\" and establish \\"right- guided Islamic rule\\" in the country. It also says that Liwaa al-Umma follows \\"Islamic rules of warfare\\", which includes not targeting non-combatants, carrying out reprisals against innocents, or harming property or possessions. The group's alleged Facebook page lists goals such as defending the ummah and liberating it from dictatorship and aggression; co-operating to establish Islamic governance, and working to unite the ummah and bring about its \\"renaissance\\". Mohammed al-Sukni, Liwaa al-Umma's commander in Homs, said \\"I would like to see Syria with a moderate Islamic government ‚Äì something like Tunisia or Turkey\\". Abdelmajid al-Khatib, the group's political organizer, said that Liwaa al-Umma plan to transform into a political party once the Assad government is overthrown. He said \\"we envisage a party that will accept all factions, religions, and sects in Syria, including Alawites, but with an Islamic frame of reference\\" and added, \\"we want to be part of any transitional government\\". History Funding Liwaa al-Umma is well-funded compared to other Syrian rebel groups, with most of its uniforms and weapons having been bought in Turkey. Harati has claimed that the group's funds come from a network of private donors from throughout Syria, the Middle East, and North Africa, with several named benefactors from Kuwait receiving particular praise on the group's Facebook page.

During the period of Ahom supremacy in Assam, the Singarigharutha ceremony had important constitutional significance. It was believed that even though an Ahom prince became king, he could not attain the status of full-fledged monarch until his Singarigharutha ceremony was completely performed.Barbaruah Hiteswar Ahomar-Din or A History of Assam under the Ahoms 1981 page 412 Therefore, each Ahom ruler after their accession to the throne tried to organize the ceremony as soon as possible. But it was not as easy since the ceremony was very expensive and there were records when some of the Ahom kings had to postpone it owing to emergency situations or due to financial crisis of the state. Origin  The Singarigharutha ceremony was first observed by the Ahom King Sudangphaa, popularly known as Bamuni Konwar. Sudangphaa came to throne in 1397 CE. He transferred his capital from Charaideo to Charguwa. In the new capital, Sudangphaa organized the Kheun rwan mai kaw, a Tai-Ahom ceremony of coronation and claimed the mandate of Heaven to rule the Ahom Kingdom as a descendant of Lengdon or Indra, the Lord of Heaven and Earth. From that time onward, the Ahom kings performed the Singarigharutha ceremony as the main event of their coronations. The ritual was termed Singarigharutha because the wood of singari tree were used to construct the main platform on which the King sat during the procedure.Barbaruah Hiteswar Ahomar-Din or A History of Assam under the Ahoms 1981 page 38-39 Most of the Ahom rulers preferred to perform the Singarigharutha ceremony in Charaideo, which was considered very sacred by the Tai-Ahom community of Assam, since the reign of the first Ahom King Sukaphaa. Procedures  To perform the ceremony, the king, at first, consulted the Tai-Ahom priests and astrologers: the Deodhai and Bailungs. An auspicious day was fixed. On the day of ceremony, the king, wearing the Somdeo, or image of his tutelary deity, and carrying in his hand the Hengdan or ancestral sword, proceeded on a male elephant, followed by his chief queen in a female elephant, to Charaideo, where he planted a pipal tree (ficus religiosa).Barbaruah Hiteswar Ahomar-Din or A History of Assam under the Ahoms 1981 page 412Gait E.A. A History of Assam 1926 page 235 The royal couple next entered the Patghar, where the presiding priest poured a libation of water over them. Some Ahom chronicles stated that two people of common origin were selected and placed under the bamboo platform. When consecrated water was poured over the royal couple, it fell on the people below. The two who were under the bamboo platform were presented with gifts of gold and silver coins. Then they were exiled far from the capital, sometime even exiled from the kingdom, as it was believed that all the evil or ill omens of the new king and queen will leave with them. Such people were called Neusa-Jua which literally means the one who takes away the evils or ill omens. In olden days descendants of Neusa-Jua people were found in Goalpara district.Barbaruah Hiteswar Ahomar- Din or A History of Assam under the Ahoms 1981 page 413 Afterward the royal couple took their seats in the Solongghar, on a bamboo platform, under which were placed a man and a specimen of every procurable animal. Consecrated water was poured over the royal couple and fell on the animals below. Then, having been bathed, they entered the Singarighar and took their seats on a throne. The leading nobles came up and offered their presents and homage.Barbaruah Hiteswar Ahomar-Din or A History of Assam under the Ahoms 1981 page 414 New money was coined, and gratuities were given to the principal officers of the state and to religious mendicants. The presents to the officers consisted of gold earrings, gold bangles and gold embroidered cloths. Deodhai-Bailungs were offered gold earrings, embroidered cloths, girdles, and long clocks, and silver, gold, cowries and cloths to the children and the people at large. On that day, prisoners convicted with minor crimes were released. The king and his chief queen stayed in the Singarighar for one full day and night.Barbaruah Hiteswar Ahomar-Din or A History of Assam under the Ahoms 1981 page 414 In the evening, there was a feast which the king attended with his council of minister and noble.Gait E.A. A History of Assam 1926 page 235 There was a custom that when the king sat on the royal throne engraved with dragons, with the image of Somdeo hanging down in his neck, the four principal ministers (Burhagohain, Borgohain, Borpatrogohain and Borbarua) held the four pillars or supports of the throne, signifying their importance and their support to the king.Barbaruah Hiteswar Ahomar-Din or A History of Assam under the Ahoms 1981 page 414Bhuyan Dr. S.K. Tunkhungia Buranji or A History of Assam (1681-1826) 1968 page 46 The image of Somdeo was considered very sacred to the Tai-Ahom royalty and it was very rarely exposed to common masses. During the Singarigharutha ceremony, Somdeo was shown to the Ahom nobles, to which they use to kneel down nine times. When the king came down from the nin-step dragon-engraved throne, the ministers and nobles use to salute the king seven times. After this the king was required to perform sacrifices to the gods.Bhuyan Dr. S.K. Tunkhungia Buranji or A History of Assam (1681-1826) 1968 page 137 Before the reign of Swargadeo Rudra Singha it had been the custom for the new king, before entering the Singarighar, to kill a man with his ancestral sword or Hengdan, but the monarch caused a buffalo to be substituted. The example was followed by his successors.Barbaruah Hiteswar Ahomar-Din or A History of Assam under the Ahoms 1981 page 413Gait E.A. A History of Assam 1926 page 235 When a king was consecrated he attained the status of a full-fledged monarch. The festivities and amusements continued for seven days. On the eighth day, the image of Somdeo was returned to its shrine in the manner in which it was first brought and the king returned to the capital, with his family and nobles.Bhuyan Dr. S.K. Tunkhungia Buranji or A History of Assam (1681-1826) 1968 page 47 During the next 30 days the tributary rulers and state officials who had not been present at the installation were expected to come in and do homage and tender their presents to the new king. Historical significance of the ceremony The Kheun rwan mai kaw ceremony occupied an important place in the history of Ahom Kingdom. Records existed that the Ahom kings and nobles held special respect and importance to this ceremony. In some religious rites, the rank of the kings who had performed the Kheun rwan mai kaw ceremony and the kings who had not were different. One event that occurred during the reign of Swargadeo Chandrakanta Singha in early 19th century, clearly showed the significance of the Kheun rwan mai kaw ceremony. During Ahom rule in Assam, the Shraddha or the death anniversary of the previous kings were observed annually according to Tai-Ahom traditional rituals.Barbaruah Hiteswar Ahomar-Din or A History of Assam under the Ahoms 1981 page 414 A tribute of rice beer and other items were offered on decorated plates to the former kings of Ahom kingdom. Chandrakanta Singha visited one of these rituals to offer his respect to the previous Ahom kings. He noticed that one plate was placed separately from others during the religious ceremony. When he enquired about this to the Prime Minister Purnananda Burhagohain, the premier replied that that plate was offered to Swargadeo Kamaleswar Singha and the reason of placing it in separate rank was because Kamaleswar Singha could not perform the Singarigharutha ceremony during his reign due to financial constraints: Kamaleswar Singha could not be placed in the same rank with the kings who had performed the ceremony. Purnananda Burhagohain also explained that owing to financial constraint the Singarigharutha ceremony of Chandrakanta Singha could not be performed at his accession. Chandrakanta Singha became anxious and began to put pressure on the premier to perform his Singarigharutha ceremony, which later became a cause of conflict between the king and the prime minister.Barbaruah Hiteswar Ahomar-Din or A History of Assam under the Ahoms 1981 page 291-292 Ambassadors from neighbouring kingdoms of Cachar and Jaintia and representatives of neighbouring hill tribes visited this occasion to pay their respect to the Ahom monarch. Sometime the ambassadors were granted special privilege to witness the main events of the ceremony along with the festivals and amusements associated with it, as a sign of strengthening the friendly relations with neighbouring kingdoms and tribes.Bhuyan Dr. S.K. Tunkhungia Buranji or A History of Assam (1681-1826) 1968 page 47-48 Conclusion The Kheun rwan mai kaw ceremony signifies the fact that even though the Ahom rulers of Assam adopted Hinduism, the significance of the Tai- Ahom religious customs and practices were at large during the Ahom period. The Tai-Ahom priests and astrologers, the Deodhais and the Bailungs, occupied important position in the Royal court of Ahom kingdom till the very end. It was because of their efforts and influence on the royal court, kings and nobles continued to pay their respect to the ancient customs and religious ceremonies of the Tai-Ahom community during the period of Ahom supremacy in Assam.

G. Wells, including some of the aspects of a fable. It was serialized from July to December 1901 in Pearson's Magazine before being published as a volume by Methuen. The inspiration for the novel was Wells's glimpse of May Nisbet, the daughter of the Times drama critic, in a bathing suit, when she came to visit at Sandgate, Wells having agreed to pay her school fees after her father's death.Michael Sherborne, H.G. Wells: Another Kind of Life (Peter Owen, 2010), p. 145. In presenting a creature of legend active in the prosaic contemporary genteel English society, the book clearly falls into the definition of contemporary fantasy, at the time not yet recognized as a distinct subgenre.  Plot  The intricately narrated story involves a mermaid who comes ashore on the southern coast of England in 1899. Feigning a desire to become part of genteel society (under the alias \\"Miss Doris Thalassia Waters\\"), the mermaid's real design is to seduce Harry Chatteris, a man she saw \\"some years ago\\" in \\"the South Seas‚Äînear Tonga,\\" who has taken her fancy.H. G. Wells, The Sea Lady, Chap. 6, ¬ß II. This she reveals in a conversation with the narrator's second cousin Melville, a friend of the family who adopts \\"Miss Waters\\". As a supernatural being, she is unimpressed with the fact that Chatteris is engaged to the socially-minded Miss Adeline Glendower and is trying to make amends for his wastrel youth by entering politics. With mere words, the mermaid shakes both Chatteris and Melville's faith in their society's norms and expectations, enigmatically telling them that \\"there are better dreams\\". In the end, Chatteris is unable to resist her alluring charms, though succumbing supposedly means his death.  Themes  Couched in the language of fantasy and romance that blends with light-hearted social satire, The Sea Lady explores serious themes of nature, sex, the imagination, and the ideal in an Edwardian world in which moral restraints are loosening. Wells wrote in Experiment in Autobiography that The Sea Lady reflected his \\"craving for some lovelier experience than life had yet given me.\\"Norman and Jeanne Mackenzie, H.G. Wells: A Biography (New York: Simon and Schuster, 1973), p. 179. In its narrative structure, The Sea Lady plays cleverly with conventions of historical and journalistic research and verification. According to John Clute, \\"Structurally it is the most complex thing Wells ever wrote, certainly the only novel Wells ever wrote to directly confirm our understanding that he did, indeed, read Henry James.\\"John Clute, Pardon This Intrusion (Beccon Publications 2006), p. 123. Adam Roberts has argued that The Sea Lady was written in a kind of dialogue with James's The Sacred Fount (1901).A.

Located between former Mariko-juku in what is now Aoi-ku, Shizuoka, and Okabe-juku in what is now Fujieda, it is the only portion of the original Heian period road known to have survived to the present day, and was proclaimed a National Historic Site on February 22, 2010. Overview The route of the ancient T≈çkaid≈ç highway skirted the coast of Suruga Bay during the Nara period. However, due to the rugged coastline in the area, the route was shifted inland to the Utsunoya-t≈çge during the Heian period. Mention of the pass is made frequently in Heian-period waka poetry, with references to the narrow road and the sound of Japanese bush warblers in the area. During the 1590 Battle of Odawara, Toyotomi Hideyoshi ordered the route of the T≈çkaid≈ç to be shifted slightly, avoiding the pass, to its present course, which offered less of a bottleneck to his armies. The Edo period T≈çkaid≈ç followed this new route, and the Heian period pathway was forgotten until rediscovered in 1965. During the Meiji period, a modern tunnel was dug under the Utsunoya-t≈çge. Completed in 1876, it was the first tunnel in Japan to charge a toll for passage. The tunnel was in use until closed by a fire 1896, but was reopened from 1904-1930. Made obsolete by automobiles, the original tunnel was replaced in 1930 by a larger tunnel, and a second tunnel was added in 1959. The 1930 tunnel is used by Shizuoka Prefectural Road 208, and the 1959 tunnel by Japan National Route 1. The original Meiji period tunnel was designated a National Registered Tangible Cultural Property in 1997. Due to ever increasing traffic, the Heisei Utsunoya-t≈çge Tunnel was completed in 1990 on the Okabe Bypass of Japan National Route 1.

The Shimijizuka site is located on a small plateau approximately one kilometer from Lake Sakaru, which had plentiful smelt and shijimi clams until the early 1930s. A portion of the Shijimizuka site was destroyed by local farmers mining it for fertilizer in the 1830s. However, with the excavation of the ≈åmori Shell Middens by Edward S. Morse of the Tokyo Imperial University in 1877, due academic attention became focussed on the Hamamatsu site, and preliminary investigations were conducted by Tokyo Imperial University in 1889. These investigations recovered earthenware fragments and stone tools, and confirmed that the site dated from the J≈çmon period. Subsequent excavations in 1895 and 1915 uncovered human bones from 30 grave sites, as well as necklaces and bracelets made from shells. The bones of deer and wild boar were also found. Later excavations were conducted by Kyoto Imperial University in 1920‚Äì1922 uncovered the foundations of twenty pit dwellings. The site was further explored using modern methods by the University of Shizuoka from 1954‚Äì1955 and in 1983. Many of the artifacts, which included iron arrowheads, jewelry and pottery, are on display at the adjacent Hamamatsu City Museum. At present, the shell midden is divided into four parts. One part is preserved with the cross-section on display to a depth of approximately 1.5 meters, indicating habitation of the site for approximately 1000 years. In addition to the shells and animal bones, the bones of various saltwater fish have been discovered, indicating that the site was rich in both marine and forest resources.

He was killed while commanding a brigade at the Battle of Atlanta of July 22, 1864, one day before his commission as a Brigadier General in the Confederate Army was delivered.  Early life  Francis Marion Walker was born in Paris, Kentucky on November 12, 1827 and was named in honor of Francis Marion.Allardice, Bruce S. More Generals in Gray.

His parents were John and Tabitha (Taylor) Walker.Allardice, 1995, p. 232 says that he investigated the claim by sources such as Armstrong, 1931, pp. 466‚Äì467 which state that Walker's mother was a niece of President Zachary Taylor and could find no support for the claim. Walker's mother died while he was young. In 1843, the Walker family moved to Hawkins County in east Tennessee, where his father was proprietor of a tavern.In 1857, John Walker was appointed Indian agent to the Tohono O'odham (previously sometimes referred to as the Papago people), Pima people and Maricopa people at Tucson, Arizona.

Walker graduated with honors from Transylvania University in 1850. He established a law practice in Rogersville, Tennessee. In 1854, he moved to Chattanooga, Tennessee and set up a law practice. He was a Chattanooga alderman in 1858‚Äì1859 and attorney general of the Tennessee Fourth District from 1860 until the start of the Civil War.

American Civil War service  Walker was actually a committed Unionist and made speeches in support of the Union in eastern Tennessee before Tennessee declared its secession from the Union. After Tennessee joined the Confederacy, Walker decided to stay with his State and joined the Confederate cause. He became Captain of the \\"Marsh Blues\\" of Hamilton County, Tennessee, which became Company I of the 19th Tennessee Infantry Regiment. The company was named for Ed Marsh, a local man who provided uniforms and equipment.Armstrong, Zella. 'The History of Hamilton County and Chattanooga, Tennessee', Volume 2. Chattanooga, TN: Lookout Publishing Company, 1940. Reprint: The Overmountain Press, 1993. . p. 291. Walker was promoted to Lieutenant Colonel of the regiment on June 11, 1861. Walker's regiment fought at the Battle of Mill Springs and Battle of Shiloh where both the unit and Walker were praised for bravery. Walker received Union general Benjamin Prentiss' sword in surrender at Shiloh. Walker was elected Colonel of the 19th Tennessee Infantry on May 8, 1862. Thereafter, he led the regiment at the Battle of Stone's River, Battle of Chickamauga and in the Chattanooga Campaign. The regiment fought during the Atlanta campaign. Fighting from trenches, they decimated the soldiers of a Union assault at the Battle of Kennesaw Mountain on June 27, 1864. Brigade commander, Brigadier Otho F. Strahl and corps commander, Lieutenant General William J. Hardee repeatedly recommended that Walker be promoted to brigadier general. In June 1864, Walker was given command of a brigade in Major General Benjamin F. Cheatham's division when Brigadier General George Maney was promoted to division command. On July 17, 1864, just before the Battle of Peachtree Creek on July 20, 1864, Confederate President Jefferson Davis replaced General Joseph E. Johnston as commander of the Army of Tennessee defending Atlanta with the aggressive Lieutenant General, temporary General, John Bell Hood.Kagan, Neil, and Stephen G. Hyslop.

On July 22, 1864, Hood ordered Lieutenant General Hardee to maneuver around the left flank of the Union Army east of Atlanta for a surprise attack while Major General Cheatham, then in command of Hood's former corps, was to make a diversionary attack on the front of the Union force and the cavalry commander, Major General Joseph Wheeler, would attack their supply line.Kagan, 2006, p. 324.McPherson, 1988, p. 754.Ecelbarger, 2010, pp. 48‚Äì50. The Battle of Atlanta, fought east and south of the city and near the Union supply lines further east at Decatur, Georgia, ensued. During a hard day of fighting after a night march to get into position, Hardee's men succeeded in bending back the Union left flank and retaking some breastworks that had been built by the Confederates earlier.Ecelbarger, 2010, pp. 147, 170. Union Major General James B. McPherson, who was killed during the battle, anticipated the Confederate maneuver against the far end of his flank, reshaped his line and sent reinforcements to the flank.Ecelbarger, 2010, p. 65. By 5:00 p.m., Confederate advances along the Union front had been reversed although the Union force had lost a large part of the left, or southern, part of their line.Ecelbarger, 2010, pp. 189‚Äì191, Still part of the XVII Corps under Major General Francis Preston Blair, Jr. still held a position anchored on Bald Hill.Ecelbarger, 2010, p. 191. Confederate Major General Patrick Cleburne, operating under Hardee, gathered available forces in the area to make a large assault against the Union position on Bald Hill.Ecelbarger, 2010, p. 193. Blair meanwhile had thought the Confederate effort had been spent and even suggested in a message to Union Army commander Major General William T. Sherman that with another brigade he could retake the lost ground. Francis M. Walker's men, which included his 19th Tennessee Infantry as well as Maney's old brigade, had not been engaged that day since they had been marched and countermarched almost back to their original position.Ecelbarger, 2010, p. 195. Cleburne placed Walker's brigade on the left front of the attacking force. The attack was launched with about 3,500 men in total, with 2,000 more in a second wave, at about 6:00 p.m.Ecelbarger, 2010, p. 196. Cleburne himself led the attack with Walker's brigade. The Union force had about half the number of men but they were behind their defenses. Emerging from a stand of woods, Walker's men were hard hit and began to retreat before Cleburne and Maney rallied them.Ecelbarger, 2010, p. 199. Then they moved with a two-sided assault with troops to their right toward the Union line.Ecelbarger, 2010, p. 200. Despite taking about 100 casualties in their previous advances, Walker's men followed Walker, who was waving his sword in encouragement, toward the crest of the hill.Ecelbarger, 2010, p. 201. As they reached the crest, Walker's brigade was hit with a tremendous volley from defenders over the crest. Walker was killed by that volley. He had been appointed a brigadier general the previous day but he had not yet received written notification of his appointment. Walker's commission arrived at his headquarters the day after he was killed.Allardice, 1995, pp. 231‚Äì232. After Walker's death, many of his men diverted to another point of attack to try to take a Union battery and suffered severe casualties.Ecelbarger, 2010, p. 204. As night fell, the Confederates could not continue the attack and the Union troops held their fort at the top of the hill.Ecelbarger, 2010, p. 205. The Confederates had sustained over 600 casualties while the Union defenders had endured about 550 casualties in the Battle of Bald Hill, which was but a small part of the overall Battle of Atlanta.Ecelbarger, 2010, p. 206.Allardice, 1995, p. 231 gives the date of Walker's death as June 22, 1864. This is clearly wrong as the Battle of Atlanta was fought on July 22, 1864 as Eicher and other sources show. Eicher, 2001, p. 614 gives the correct date of Walker's death, July 22, 1864. Although Walker could have acted as a brigadier general from the receipt of the commission, he still would not have officially and legally been a brigadier general until after his appointment had been confirmed by the Confederate Senate.Eicher, 2001, 30‚Äì32, 66‚Äì67. The Confederate Senate had not confirmed the appointment as of the date of Walker's death.  Aftermath  Walker initially was buried in Citizens Cemetery at Griffin, Georgia.Allardice, 1995, p. 232. His remains were reinterred in a family plot in Forest Hills Cemetery in Chattanooga, Tennessee in 1889.

He is currently the President of National Taiwan University and a Chair Professor in the Department of Finance of National Taiwan University. ROC Council for Economic Planning and Development Ministry =Taiwan's Q1 2013 economic growth= Kuan said in May 2013 that he was surprised at Taiwan's Q1 2013 economic growth rate of 1.54%, much lower than the forecast value of 3.26%. This was due to the low consumption by private sectors in Taiwan. Before the numbers were released, the CEPD aimed for Taiwan to show 4% overall economic growth that year, and to reach the original goal would require 5% economic growth for the remaining quarters of the year. However, investments in private sectors were rising at the time, an indication of a positive economic outlook. =Taiwan's 2013 global competitiveness ranking decline= Commenting on Taiwan's declining ranking as measured by the International Institute for Management Development in the Global Competitiveness Report released at the end of May 2013, Kuan said that it is not that Taiwan did not improve, but that other nations improved at a faster rate than Taiwan. He added that the business regulations have been relaxed in Taiwan but not as much as what have been done in other countries. He resigned his post as National Development Council head in January 2015. Kuan had attempted to resign in a month prior but was persuaded to stay at the time. National Taiwan University presidential selection On 5 January 2018, Kuan was elected to succeed Yang Pan-chyr as president of National Taiwan University. Shortly after his election, Kuan stated that he would work to help NTU establish international partnerships with other institutions and attract more international students by offering more dual-degree programs. Before taking office, Kuan was accused of an unresolved conflict of interest regarding Richard Tsai. Tsai was a member of the NTU presidential search committee, but neither he or Kuan had publicly declared that they both served on the board of Taiwan Mobile. Additionally, Chang Liao Wan-chien accused Kuan of plagiarism in a paper presented in May 2017. Upon further investigation, NTU cleared Kuan of plagiarism. Subsequently, the government looked into possible violations of the Classified National Security Information Protection Act. In March 2018, a group of NTU academics and alumni filed a complaint with the Taipei District Prosecutors‚Äô Office against Kuan's appointment as university president. The controversy resulted in the resignation of education minister Pan Wen-chung in April. Soon after Wu Maw-kuen took office, the education ministry chose not to approve Kuan's selection. Wu's successor Yeh Jiunn-rong announced on 24 December 2018 that Kuan's appointment had been approved. Yeh resigned from his post the next day. Kuan was inaugurated as president of National Taiwan University on 8 January 2019. Impeachment The Control Yuan started an investigation into Kuan's work with Next Magazine in April 2018. The probe found that Kuan wrote for the publication from 2010 to 2016, which overlapped with his tenure as a government minister between February 2012 and February 2015. Kuan's writings for Next Magazine while serving on the Executive Yuan constituted a violation of Article 14 of the Civil Servant Work Act, which barred civil servants from taking on outside work. The inquiry was led by Control Yuan members and . Upon its conclusion in January 2019, the Control Yuan voted 7‚Äì4 to impeach Kuan. The Judicial Yuan's Public Functionary Disciplinary Sanction Commission then issued Kuan a reprimand in September 2019.

It stars Lovi Poe and Benjamin Alves. The film is directed by Tara Illenberger.Lovi Poe‚Äôs two worlds By: Bayani San Diego Jr. Philippine Daily Inquirer. Retrieved 07-29-2012 Plot Thirty years ago, an unborn child was buried in the garden of what is now a boardinghouse in Cubao. It lies beneath the ground, unbeknownst to the tenants who live there. One of the tenants is Mylene (Lovi Poe) who appears like the perfect girl, nice, pretty and at the top of her medicine class. But nobody knows about her past, not even the man who loves her most, Paolo (Benjamin Alves). Paolo doesn't know anything about Mylene's family, her long, lost sibling or her estranged, nervous wreck of a mother. Nor does he know about the very long scar that runs across Mylene's body, nor of how incomplete she always feels. And he finds that the more he tries to win back her love, the more she retreats to her secret world that nobody could enter. One day Mylene is asked to perform an abortion for a fee, she feels conflicted about doing what is right and at the same time, being in dire need of tuition fee. Her decision ultimately leads to a dark outcome and awakens a force that has laid quiet for years in the boardinghouse grounds. Thereafter, she becomes tormented by nightmares of a dark twin, whose presence gets stronger as days pass, as strange things start to happen in the house. When one by one, the boarders die of unexplainable causes, Joanna (Empress) the resident psychic and Mylene's best friend struggles to understand the impending danger that she senses and decides to get to the bottom of the mystery; and as it unravels, they find themselves confronted by an angry soul that seeks justice.Guni-Guni Synopsis SM Cinema.

His appointment follows significant restructuring of the state education bureaucracy. Saxton previously served as the Superintendent of Tigard-Tualatin School District, which covers a suburb of Oregon's largest city. Saxton's tenure with the Oregon Department of Education will end on June 30, 2015, when he assumes the position of Superintendent at the Northwest Regional Education Service District in Hillsboro, Oregon. Rob Saxton, Former Oregon Deputy Superintendent of Public Instruction Saxton oversees all Oregon public schools, including Tigard High School  School District Administrator  Saxton started his career in education as a teacher and football coach in Big Spring, Texas. He returned to his home state after accepting a job teaching in Albany, Oregon. Rob's first administrative position was at West Albany High. He later held school administrative posts in nearby districts of McMinnville, Oregon and Sherwood, Oregon. Following this, he took the post as leader of the Tigard-Tualatin schools. With around 13,000 students, that district has shown marked improvement under Saxton's tenure. One area of particular focus for Saxton was closing the gap between minority students and the statewide averages in reading and mathematics. Colleagues also note his keen focus on early literacy and reducing inappropriate special education classifications. He acted as superintendent in Tigard-Tualatin for seven years before being appointed to statewide office.  Statewide Official  = Restructuring = For nearly 150 years, the highest education office in Oregon was the Oregon Superintendent of Public Instruction. However, Governor John Kitzhaber was elected in 2010 on a platform of reforming the education system. Therefore, at his direction the Oregon legislature passed major changes to the central administration of the Oregon Department of Education. One effect was the designation of the governor himself as Superintendent of Public Instruction. He then was to appoint a Deputy Superintendent to care for the day-to-day operation of the public school system. There is no longer an elected statewide Superintendent. This change was reportedly intended to give the governor stronger oversight of the education system. At the same time, a new office was created, the Oregon Chief Educational Officer. This office oversees all educational programs in Oregon, including preschool (Head Start), K-12 public schools, community colleges, and universities. Previously these educational institutions had been only connected in a loose sense. This new position is designed to provide budget and mission unification. Therefore, the position of Deputy Superintendent of Public Instruction reports to the Chief Educational Officer in the first instance, and then to the governor. The Deputy Superintendent of Public Instruction is a professional-level position, as opposed to an elected position, and therefore pays about three times the salary of the previous Superintendent of Public Instruction position. The Deputy Superintendent will continue in the role of the now-defunct Superintendent as head of the Oregon Department of Education, which oversees K-12 school standards. = Appointment = Saxton was announced for the statewide oversight position by Governor Kitzhaber on July 12, 2012. He becomes the first ever non-elected leader of Oregon's public schools. Kitzhaber indicated that Saxton's significant experience as Tigard-Tualatin superintendent was a key factor in his selection. After the appointment of Rudy Crew as Chief Education Officer, Saxton was the second top-level appointment in Kitzhaber's new education bureaucracy. The reforms were set to transfer the position from elected to appointed with the expiration of Susan Castillo's term as Superintendent. However, her early resignation created the vacancy filled by Saxton. Saxton takes up the role in an official capacity as of July 31, 2012. However, to continue on a permanent basis, his appointment must be confirmed by the Oregon legislature, which does not sit again until fall of 2012. In April 2015 The Oregonian reported that Saxton would leave his position as Deputy Superintendent of Public instruction effective June 30, 2015 for a new position with Northwest Regional ESD. Although Saxton‚Äôs reason for leaving the state position was given as ‚Äúaccomplishing where (my) heart lives, impacting outcomes for kids,‚Äù it was noted that Saxton would receive a $161,000 salary with the Northwest Regional ESD for the next two years plus ‚Äúbegin drawing from a large pension.‚Äù Hammond, Betsy (April 8, 2015) \\"Rob Saxton explains why he decided to quit as Oregon's state schools chief\\" The Oregonian.

The key roles of the agency include setting test standards and graduation requirements for statewide uniformity. This gives Saxton a wide latitude to influence pupil performance. Saxton has indicated that he intends to make the department focused, not only on legal requirements, but on offering a base of resources to local school districts. Saxton has a background in education lobbying, developed while serving as school administrator. However, he indicated a desire to learn more about the department before implementing any bold new initiatives.

It connects Sainte-Marie-aux-Mines (north) with Cernay (south) and runs on the border of the departements of Haut-Rhin (68) and Vosges (88). Most of the route is at an elevation in excess of , with the highest point being at the Col du Grand Ballon (). The road is generally open from April to November, but most of the route is closed in the winter by snow. Route des Cr√™tes near Rothenbachkopf History The ridge forms part of the boundary between the Alsace and Lorraine regions of France. In 1871, Alsace was ceded to Germany under the Treaty of Frankfurt, and thus the ridge formed the boundary between France and Germany. During the First World War, the French military decided to create a road to follow the ridge, thus allowing easier access to the valleys on both sides, enabling the faster movement of French troops. The route was mostly just below the ridge to the west and was thus protected from German gunfire. Description of route Route des Cr√™tes near Hohneck From Sainte- Marie-aux-Mines (Haut-Rhin) (elevation ), the Route des Cr√™tes is accessed via D48 and Col des Bagenelles (), which leads to the Col du Bonhomme (), on the route connecting Saint-Di√©-des-Vosges (west) and Colmar (east). The route (now D148) continues south via the Col de Louchbach () to the Col de Calvaire (), where it enters the department of Vosges. The route (now D61) then passes the Gazon du Faing () from where there is a panoramic view stretching to the Black Forest across the Rhine valley in Germany and the Hohneck, Petit Ballon and Grand Ballon summits in the Vosges mountains. From here the road then crosses the Col de la Schlucht (), which connects G√©rardmer (west) with Colmar. Near here, there is the Jardin d'altitude du Haut Chitelet. Now the D430, the road then passes the Hohneck mountain () from where there are also panoramic views. After passing the Kastelberg (), Rainkopf () and Rotherbachkopf () peaks in quick succession, the road returns to the Haut-Rhin department before it crosses the Cols du Herrenberg () and Hahnenbrunnen () on the way to the winter resort of Le Markstein (). The road (now D431) then reaches its highest point at the Col du Grand Ballon (), before passing the Col Amic () on the descent to Cernay. En route, it passes the ruins of Freundstein Chateau, which at an altitude of is the highest castle in Alsace, and the Hartmannswillerkopf military cemetery at Vieil Armand. Traffic management The route has become popular with walkers, cyclists, motorbikers and motorcaravanners. In 2000, a shuttle bus was introduced to carry walkers onto the ridge road in an attempt to reduce the pressure from the use of cars; this was not successful and the bus service was withdrawn in 2012. In 2008, a comprehensive report on the traffic problems was published by the park authority. Environmental groups were calling for partial closure of the road to prevent over-crowding especially during summer weekends, which often resulted in road accidents. The report's author, J.-P. Monet considered the conflicting environmental and economic issues. His report offered no real solutions but concluded: > Je souhaite aux acteurs . . . de trouver le chemin de la concertation et > d‚Äôarriver √† cr√©er un r√©seau coop√©ratif leur permettant de valoriser ce > magnifique site dans un climat apais√©. (I hope the players can find the path > of dialogue and create a cooperative network allowing them to develop this > wonderful site in a peaceful climate.) With effect from 1 May 2012, a speed limit of 70 km/h was introduced on the sections of the road in the Haut-Rhin department, between the Col des Bagenelles and Uffholtz (near Cernay). At present, a similar speed limit has not been imposed by the Vosges department covering the central section of the route. A proposal has also been put forward to close the road entirely to motor vehicles, other than public transport, on at least one day a week.

They said that it was not a threat to Yahoo!, Inc. The IT Security firm TrustedSec.net said that the passwords contained a number of email addresses from Gmail, AOL, Yahoo, and more such websites. Response from Yahoo Immediately after the hack, Yahoo!, in a written statement, apologized for the breach. Yahoo! did not disclose how many passwords were valid after the hack, because they said that every minute, 1‚Äì3 passwords are changed on their site. Yahoo! said that only 5% of its passwords were stolen during the hack. The hackers' website, \`d33ds.co\`, was not available later on Thursday, after the hack.

Barberau was born in Paris. He entered the Conservatoire de Paris in 1810 and received numerous prizes. He was awarded with the Prix de Rome in 1824 for his cantata Agnes Sorel with text by Pierre- Ange Vieillard. He conducted many orchestras in several theatres, especially the Th√©√¢tre Italien between 1836‚Äì38. Many times he replaced Anton Reicha, who had been his teacher in the class of composition of the Conservatory. Among his disciples are Ambroise Thomas, Ernest Guiraud, and Charles Delioux. He wrote the score of the opera Les Sybarites de Florence, and took part in a variety of symphonies and concert works. But the real contribution of Barbereau is his theoretical work, among them his Trait√© d'harmonie th√©oretique et pratique (1843‚Äì45), considered the most important scientific work published hitherto on this subject. After this work he published a curious √âtude sur l'origine du syst√®me musical (Paris, 1852), which gave rise to great controversy.

Production history The BBC invited Elbow to present ideas for the 2012 Olympic theme, on the strength of their 2008 song \\"One Day Like This\\", which had been used during the Beijing Olympics and televising of subsequent sporting events. In November 2011 it was announced that the BBC had commissioned Elbow to composing the theme music. The six- minute anthem was recorded with the BBC Philharmonic Orchestra and the NovaVox gospel choir. The anthemic composition and the accompanying visuals were intended to sum up the achievement of reaching the Olympics, the emotions of those who win and those who do not, and the coming together of the whole country to support the event. The title was inspired by a child of one of the band members learning to walk during the composition of the song, symbolising the hope and achievement of the moment. The title sequence used for television coverage of the Games pairs the song with an animation depicting the United Kingdom as one vast stadium. Although the full version lasts more than six minutes, it was intentionally composed to allow different clips of one or two minutes to be played during montages of winners or losers. Availability \\"First Steps\\" was available only as a digital download from selected retailers, who waived their profits. Elbow also waived any fees from sales.

He is primarily known as a theorist on account of his treatises on harmony, based on the methods of Charles Simon Catel, which were widely used as reference works, especially his Trait√© d'harmonie (c. 1838), the Trait√© d'accompagnement pratique (c. 1840), and his M√©thode √©l√©mentaire pour le pianoforte (c. 1820). Biography Victor Dourlen was born in Dunkerque. He entered the Paris Conservatory in 1799 at the age of 19, becoming a pupil of Charles-Simon Catel (harmony), Fran√ßois-Joseph Gossec (counterpoint), and Benoit Mozin (piano).Olivier Bara: \\"Dourlen, Victor (Charles Paul)\\", in: Die Musik in Geschichte und Gegenwart (MGG), biographical part, vol. 5 (Kassel: B√§renreiter, 2001), cc. 1346‚Äì1347. He became a teacher of elementary singing at the institution in 1800. In 1805, he won the Prix de Rome for musical composition with his cantata Cupidon pleurant Psych√©. Prevented by war to go to Rome immediately, he first had his opera Philocl√®s performed at the Op√©ra-Comique in October 1806, but with four performances only, it was not successful. He then went to Rome in 1807, where on 14 July his Te Deum for the Battle of Friedland was performed, followed in 1808 by the Dies irae, another large-scale cantata. On his return to Paris, he produced several comic operas, all public failures, including Linn√©e (1808), La Dupe de son Art (1809), and Cagliostro (1810).Bara (2001), c. 1346. In 1816, he was appointed full professor of harmony and counterpoint, a position he held until 1842. Among his pupils were Charles-Valentin Alkan, Fran√ßois Bazin, Louis D√©sir√© Besozzi, Alexandre Goria, Henri Herz, F√©lix Le Couppey, Antoine Fran√ßois Marmontel, Joseph O'Kelly, and Ambroise Thomas. His only operatic success was Le Fr√®re Philippe (1818) after a libretto by Auguste Duport, which was performed 91 times.

It is caused by the occlusion of one of the branches of central retinal vein. Signs and symptoms Patients with branch retinal vein occlusion usually have a sudden onset of blurred vision or a central visual field defect. The eye examination findings of acute branch retinal vein occlusion include superficial hemorrhages, retinal edema, and often cotton- wool spots in a sector of retina drained by the affected vein. The obstructed vein is dilated and tortuous. The quadrant most commonly affected is the superotemporal (63%). Retinal neovascularization occurs in 20% of cases within the first 6‚Äì12 months of occlusion and depends on the area of retinal nonperfusion. Neovascularization is more likely to occur if more than five disc diameters of nonperfusion are present and vitreous hemorrhage can ensue. Risk factors Studies have identified the following abnormalities as risk factors for the development of branch retinal vein occlusion: * hypertension * cardiovascular disease * obesity * glaucoma Diabetes mellitus was not a major independent risk factor. Diagnosis  Branch retinal vein occlusion revealed by laser Doppler imaging through flow alteration in the upper right branch artery. The diagnosis of branch retinal vein occlusion is made clinically by finding retinal hemorrhages in the distribution of an obstructed retinal vein. * Fluorescein angiography is a helpful adjunct. Findings include delayed venous filling, hypofluorescence caused by hemorrhage and capillary nonperfusion, dilation and tortuosity of veins, leakage due to neovascularization and macular edema. * Optical coherence tomography is an adjunctive test in branch retinal vein occlusion. Macular edema is commonly seen on optical coherence tomography exams. Serial optical coherence tomograph is used as a rapid and noninvasive way of monitoring the macular edema. * Laser Doppler imagingPuyo, L., M. Paques, M. Fink, J-A. Sahel, and M. Atlan. \\"In vivo laser Doppler holography of the human retina.\\" Biomedical optics express 9, no. 9 (2018): 4113-4129. reveals dynamic hemodynamics discrepancies between branch arteries and veins, from local vascular resistance increase by the venous occlusion. Treatment Several options exist for the treatment of branch retinal vein occlusion. These treatments aim for the two of the most significant complications, namely macular edema and neovascularization. * Systemic treatment with oral aspirin, subcutaneous Heparin, or intravenous thrombolysis have not been shown to be effective treatments for central retinal vein occlusion and for branch retinal vein occlusion no reliable clinical trial has been published. * Laser treatment of the macular area to reduce macular edema is indicated in patients who have 20/40 or worse vision and did not spontaneously improve for at least 3 months (to permit the maximum spontaneous resolution) after the development of the vein occlusion. It is typically administered with the argon laser and is focused on edematous retina within the arcades drained by the obstructed vein and avoiding the foveal avascular zone. Leaking microvascular abnormalities may be treated directly, but prominent collateral vessels should be avoided. In a Cochrane Review comparing laser treatment to other treatments, grid laser was found to be preferable to no laser. Due to quality of evidence it is uncertain whether bevacizumab injections or subthreshold diode were preferable to grid laser treatments. * The second indication of laser treatment is in case of neovascularization. Retinal photocoagulation is applied to the involved retina to cover the entire involved segment, extending from the arcade out to the periphery. Ischemia alone is not an indication for treatment provided that follow-up could be maintained. * Preservative-free, nondispersive Triamcinolone acetonide in 1 or 4 mg dosage may be injected into the vitreous to treat macular edema but has complications including elevated intraocular pressure and development of cataract. Triamcinolone injection is shown to have similar effect on visual acuity when compared with standard care (Laser therapy), However, the rates of elevated intraocular pressure and cataract formation is much higher with the triamcinolone injection, especially the higher dosage. Intravitreal injection of Dexamethasone implant (Ozurdex; 700,350 Œºg) is being studied, its effect may last for 180 days. The injection may be repeated however with less pronounced effect. Although the implant was designed to cause less complications, pressure rise and cataract formation is noted with this treatment too. * Anti-vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) drugs such as bevacizumab (Avastin; 1.25 -2.5 mg in 0.05ml) and ranibizumab (Lucentis) injections are widely used. Intravitreal anti-VEGF drugs have a low incidence of adverse side effects compared with intravitreal steroids, but are often requiring repeated injections. They are the treatment of choice for macular edema or neovascularization. The mechanism of action and duration of anti-VEGF effect on macular edema is currently unknown. The intraocular levels of VEGF are increased in eyes with macular edema secondary to branch retinal vein occlusion and the elevated VEGF levels are correlated to the degree and severity of the areas of capillary nonperfusion and macular edema. * Surgery is employed occasionally for longstanding vitreous hemorrhage and other serious complications such as epiretinal membrane and retinal detachment. * Arteriovenous sheathotomy has been reported in small, uncontrolled series of patients with branch retinal vein occlusion. Branch retinal vein occlusiontypically occurs at arteriovenous crossings, where the artery and vein share a common adventitial sheath. In arteriovenous sheathotomy an incision is made in the adventitial sheath adjacent to the arteriovenous crossing and is extended along the membrane that holds the blood vessels in position to the point where they cross, the overlying artery is then separated from the vein. Prognosis In general, branch retinal vein occlusion has a good prognosis: after 1 year 50‚Äì60% of eyes have been reported to have a final visual acuity of 20/40 or better even without any treatment. With time the dramatic picture of an acute branch retinal vein occlusion becomes more subtle, hemorrhages fade so that the retina can look almost normal. Collateral vessels develop to help drain the affected area. Epidemiology *branch retinal vein occlusion is four times more common than central retinal vein occlusion. *Usual age of onset is 60‚Äì70 years. *An analysis of population from several countries estimates that approximately 16 million people worldwide may have retinal vein occlusion.

He played for the Manly-Warringah Sea Eagles in the New South Wales Rugby League (NSWRL) competition.http://www.rugbyleagueproject.org/players/allan- thomson/summary.html He is the uncle of rugby league players Ian Thomson and Gary Thomson. Career =Playing= Thomson, a tough forward from the Lakes United club in the Newcastle Rugby League, represented the district in a 14-7 win over the Parramatta Eels in the 1964 State Cup competition. He went on to play for the NSW Colts against the touring French team later that year. In 1966 he made the first of 8 appearances for New South Wales, and a year later made his test debut for Australia in a 22-13 win over New Zealand at the Sydney Cricket Ground. He was retained for the second test against New Zealand at Lang Park in Brisbane which saw a 35-22 win for the Australians. While still playing for Lakes United in Newcastle, Allan Thomson was selected for the 1967-68 Kangaroo Tour at the end of the 1967 season. He played in one test on the tour (his final appearance for Australia), a 16-13 loss to France at the Stade des Minimes in Toulouse, France. He also played in 13 minor games during the tour. Thomson left Lakes at the end of the 1968 season and linked with NSWRFL club Manly-Warringah in 1969. He was a reserve in the Sea Eagles 23-12 loss to the South Sydney Rabbitohs in the 1970 NSWRFL Grand Final, and went on to play in Manly's first ever premiership win in 1972 when the Sea Eagles defeated Eastern Suburbs 19-14 in the Grand Final at the SCG, partnering Terry Randall in the Second-row. Following the Grand Final win, Thomson returned to Newcastle to once again play for Lakes United. =Coaching= Allan Thomson returned to Manly as its first grade coach for the 1980 NSWRFL season. The Sea Eagles ended the 22 round season with an 11-9-2 record and a 6th place finish, one spot out of the finals. During his coaching at Manly in 1980, Thomson coached 1972 Grand Final team mates Graham Eadie and Terry Randall. He was replaced in 1981 by former Manly player Ray Ritchie. Thomson, who had represented Country Firsts six times as a player between 1965 and 1973, was appointed coach of the team in 1983. He coached Country in four of the annual City vs Country games from 1983‚Äì86, but lost all four games to NSW City. Death Allan Thomson died on 26 September 2006.

At the age of thirty and upon the death of his father he left home to wander India, embarking on a career as an itinerant peddler. He then moved to eastern Australia where he became fluent in English, set up a company selling Eastern produce, participated in the 1887 Jubilee Exhibition, and met British officials familiar with trade opportunities in East Africa.Emmanuel Kwaku Akyeampong, Dictionary of African Biography, Volumes 1-6, OUP USA, 2 Feb 2012, p.206 Returning to Karachi, he established a company providing stevedoring and translation services to visiting ships. In 1890 he sailed to Mombasa on a dhow to open a branch of his company there, branching out into road building, construction and transport.Emmanuel Kwaku Akyeampong, Dictionary of African Biography, Volumes 1-6, OUP USA, 2 Feb 2012, p.206 Business In 1895, A.M. Jeevanjee of Karachi ‚Äî as he was called at the time, was awarded the contract to supply the Imperial British East Africa Company with labour as they built the Uganda Railway. He imported his workforce from the Punjab region of British India.Uganda Society, The Uganda journal, Kampala, 1948, p.7 The first group to arrive had a total of 350 men and the number grew for the next six years to reach a total of 31,895. Most of the workforce were Sikhs, Hindus and Muslims who worked as skilled labourers, artisans, bricklayers, carpenters, plumbers, tailors, motor mechanics and electrical fitters. The construction of the railway proved hugely profitable for Jevanjee and his company in Mombasa. He now established a commercial empire across the Indian Ocean, including two steamships between Mauritius and Bombay and between Bombay and Jeddah.Sana Aiyar, Indians in Kenya, Harvard University Press, 2015, p.42 He was lauded in the European press as a \\"real asset to a young country\\", who spoke English with \\"quite a good accent\\" and whose methods were \\"approximating more to the European, than the Asiatic type.Sana Aiyar, Indians in Kenya, Harvard University Press, 2015, p.42 He soon ventured into other business interests in the region.

He was also a notable philanthropist, supporting religious institutions, the Bohra mosque and cemetery in Nairobi and several schools in Karachi. In 1906 he gifted Nairobi City Council a marble statue of Queen Victoria which he had commissioned. During the First World War, he offered his services to the government to help alleviate food shortages suffered by Indians in German East Africa and Zanzibar.Sara Keller, Knowledge and the Indian Ocean, Springer, 2018, p.174 Politics When construction of the Uganda Railway reached Lake Victoria, Jeevanjee began taking an active role in political life, and launched the African Standard which was a weekly newspaper. He had hired an editor- reporter, W.H. Tiller whose work was to oversee the operations of the newspaper. In 1905, he sold the newspaper to two British businessmen, Anderson and Mayer, who renamed it the East African Standard. Later in 1910 the paper became a daily newspaper and it moved its headquarters to Nairobi which was a fast developing commercial center. Jeevanjee co-founded the Mombasa Indian Association in response to the European settlers' Convention on Associations and began to mobilise the Indian community in the struggle for equal rights.Emmanuel Kwaku Akyeampong, Dictionary of African Biography, Volumes 1-6, OUP USA, 2 Feb 2012, p.206 Disappointed by the lack of progress he returned to India but in 1910 returned to take up a seat as a member of the Legislative Council.

Stating his pride in being a citizen of the British Empire, he proclaimed that if Indian enterprise was allowed to operate freely, Kenya would become a second India, and a source of great strength to the Empire.Sana Aiyar, Indians in Kenya, Harvard University Press, 2015 By positioning himself as pro-imperialist, fighting for Indian equality within the framework of the Empire and reserving his ire for the policies of the white settlers, the majority of whom happened to be Boer rather than British, he was able to attract sympathy amongst the British press.Sana Aiyar, Indians in Kenya, Harvard University Press, 2015, p.42 In 1912, he published an Appeal on behalf of the Indians of East Africa in which he cited the role played by Indians in developing East Africa and issued a call for British East Africa to be annexed by the British Indian Empire and its administration to follow Indian principles. His appeal failed to attract the attention of the Indian National Congress but he did receive support from the Aga Khan, then head of the All India Muslim League and Gopal Krishna Gokhale.Luthy, Herbert. \\"India and East Africa: Imperial Partnership at the End of the First World War.\\" Journal of Contemporary History 6, no. 2 (1971): 55-85. https://www.jstor.org/stable/259635.

In 1906 he gifted the gardens to the people of Nairobi to use as a place to relax. These gardens became the subject in the news headlines in 1991 where some leaders in authority were purporting to turn it into a commercial plot. There had been a proposed construction of a Multi- storey car park which was against the wish of Jeevanjee.

Purpose  The concept of \\"caf√© gourmand\\" was created in 1985 for the seafood chain restaurant La Cri√©e, inspired by free mignardises offered with an order of coffee at high-end restaurants. There are similarities between \\"caf√©s gourmands\\" and the English tradition of afternoon tea, although the latter is an altogether different occasion. It is a step further in a general trend, in France, to have lunches in restaurants that are quicker than in the past. Back in the 20th century it was common as a minimum to have a starter, then a main course, then a plate of cheese, then a dessert, then a cup of coffee, and then a digestif. Then the starter ceased to be the accepted norm, and the plate of cheese became scarce, and the digestif disappeared. The \\"caf√© gourmand\\" represents a further step, as ordering the dessert and the coffee in one go gains time, avoiding the need to have to call the waiter over to order. Apart from the gain of time, the \\"caf√© gourmand\\" has other advantages: * It gives the opportunity to eat several different desserts in one go, without feeling guilty for the calories as the quantity of each dessert is supposed to be tiny. * It allows the diner to sweeten the bitterness of the coffee, by going back & forth between the desserts and the cup of coffee. * It creates a feeling of mystery and surprise, as the names of the mini-desserts are not indicated on the menu, so that the customer does not know what they will get beforehand.

Multinet Gas distributes natural gas to more than 690,000 customers throughout Melbourne's inner eastern suburbs and outer Eastern Suburbs, the Yarra Ranges, and South Gippsland. The network comprises 175 km of licensed Transmission Pipelines, 9,959 km of distribution mains (operating at pressures between 7kPa and 515 kPa), and 258 regulator stations. The Multinet Gas area has over 200 km of low pressure (7 kPa) gas mains, some of which are cast iron mains that date back to the 1880s. These older cast iron mains are subject to water ingress during wet weather and as such, are the common cause of supply reliability issues. Multinet Gas' mains Replacement Program is aimed at replacing low-pressure gas distribution mains in the network and is targeting to replace all low-pressure mains by 2033. Upgraded low-pressure mains are typically replaced with high-pressure polyethylene gas mains by inserting the new ductile polyethylene pipe into the existing cast iron main. This method minimizes damage to property and offers additional protection to the polyethylene mains.  History  Multinet Gas' distribution AreaGas networks were first built in Melbourne by the Metropolitan Gas Company some time before the 1880s. In 1951 the Metropolitan Gas Company was taken over by the government-owned monopoly supplier, the Gas and Fuel Corporation of Victoria (G&FC;). G&FC; owned the Melbourne gas network area from 1951 until the privatization in 1997.

Panama. Touchstone. .DuTemple, Lesley A. \\"The Panama Canal\\"; 2002; pp 50‚Äì55; Lerner Publishing Group; The Island was created when the waters of the Chagres River were dammed by the Gatun Dam to create the Gatun lake. When the waters rose, they covered a significant part of the existing rainforest, and the hilltops became the islands that are now scattered throughout the lake. History Isla Tres Perros was known locally by other names prior to 1989; since it didn‚Äôt officially have a name, residents of other islands all referred to it differently. It wasn‚Äôt until 1989 that the island received its current name, which most locals know it by, Isla Tres Perros, Island of the Three Dogs. The island took on this name when three key military officers from the failed 1989 coup took refuge to avoid the military, CPT Jorge Bonilla Arboleda, CPT Juan Jose Arza Aguilera and CPT Jes√∫s Balma. The three military officers, all graduates of the School of the Americas, supported Major Giraldi‚Äôs coup attempt,Harding , Robert C. II (2001). Military Foundations of Panamanian Politics . Transaction Publishers. . to overthrow Noriega, but when the coup fell apart and conspirators were rounded up and summarily executed, the three young officers went on the run and found themselves held out on Isla Tres Perros, when their boat ran out of gas. Due to the survival skills they had earned through Special Forces and Infantry training, they were able to survive on the small island for three weeks before the Panamanian military finally hunted them down and executed them for treason. Once the story of the three ‚Äúfugitive‚Äù military officers became public, people began to call it Isla Tres Perros, or Island of the Three Dogs. The story was spurred on by a pro Noriega reporter at La Prensa newspaper. Notables The journalist Escolastico Calvo has been known to live on the island briefly before the United States invasion of Panama to avoid persecution because of his pro Noriega support and printing Noriega propaganda in the Panamanian newspaper La Hora.Panama: U.N. Diplomat in Action TIME May 24, 1964. Accessed September 14, 2011. When Calvo arrived, there was one family living on the island. He found his way to the island from the fishing town of Arensoa, which is about 500m from the island. From first hand accounts of the family, they stated that he was living on the island for sometime, but the exact length could never be determined as he had bribed them to stay quiet and to prevent his discovery. During his time on the island he had contracted Typhoid and fell ill and became very weak. He was treated by the locals and then finally discovered by the US government Special Forces during the Invasion of Panama.Amnesty International Report, 1991 p. 3.

In 1990, he was a member of the CEA Squadra Corse, a well known firefighter company that fielded more than 200 men. Gislimberti also worked as a youth coach for the Trentino Volley team. =Death= In the 2000 Italian Grand Prix, Gislimberti was working for CEA Squadra Corse at Monza. Before the start of the race, he moved further up from his post, taking his fire extinguisher with him. During the first lap of the race, Gislimberti had stopped for a brief moment after running back to check on his fire-fighting equipment, as a multiple-car accident at the Variante della Roggia corner sent a wheel from Heinz-Harald Frentzen's Jordan flying, striking Gislimberti with full force, leading to massive head and chest injuries. His red helmet came loose and rolled towards the side of the track. Another firefighter standing next to Gislimberti attempted to save his life before medical help from Sid Watkins and Gary Hartstein arrived on the scene. He was taken to the First Aid Room at Monza Hospital where he was pronounced dead. Gislimberti's death was the first Formula One related fatality since the death of Ayrton Senna in the 1994 San Marino Grand Prix, and the first for a bystander since Team Osella mechanic Giovanni Amadeo was killed in the pitlane at Zolder in May 1981. An autopsy reported that Gislimberti also suffered from cardiac arrest when he was struck by the wheel of Frentzen's car. He was survived by his pregnant wife of two years, Elena, who had a daughter named Lisa born in December 2000, and has received financial help from the Formula One community via a fund. His parents, two brothers and sister also outlived him. Bernie Ecclestone donated $40,000 and the teams donated $10,000 with the drivers holding an auction to sell their overalls used in the 2000 United States Grand Prix. =Funeral= Gislimberti's funeral was held in Lavis at the Sant'Udalrico church on 14 September. His coffin was wrapped with the flag of Ferrari, as Gislimberti had a passion for the team, which was represented by Luca Badoer, Claudio Berro and Stefano Domenicali. His widow Elena and other friends and relatives were present along with Formula 1 driver Gast√≥n Mazzacane.

However, Jeptha is not often recognised as the first black British boxing champion.Cashmore, E. 1982. Black Sportsmen. Routledge & Kegan Paul: London  Early life Andrew Jeptha was born on 30 December 1879 in Cape Town, South Africa. He was the son of a Cape Town carpenter and was educated at the Marist Brothers School in Hope Street, Cape Town. He came to England in 1902 after winning a boxing competition in South Africa organised by visiting world champion Kid McCoy. He married Abby Mitchell (born 2 December 1881 in Adlington, Lancashire) in 1904 in the District of St Marylebone, London. They had four children. Abby Mitchell was the daughter of Charles Mitchell and Mary Ellen Hope. Her parents ran the Cardwell Arms pub in Chorley Road, Adlington. Career Jeptha became a professional boxer in South Africa before the age of 18 years, fighting as a professional in the Vaudeville Theatre and also in Fillis' Circus. He started his boxing career in England as a booth fighter and was reportedly a big attraction for Peddlar McMahon who operated a booth- fighting business. He had 74 fights in his career, winning 32 (KO 21), losing 27 (KO11) and drawing 6. He was a popular and well known boxer. Stories about him often appeared in newspapers and he was known as \\"le Negre\\" in France and as \\"the Boer\\" in Ireland. His first recorded fight in England, which he lost, was against Jim Green in Liverpool in September 1902. He won his British boxing title in a fight hall called Wonderland at 100 Whitechapel Road, Mile End, London on 25 March 1907, when he knocked out Curly Watson in the fourth round. The fight was arranged for a purse of five hundred and fifty pounds. At the time, Watson (who was also known as Robert Watson, Curley Watson and Seaman Watson) was the boxing champion of the Royal Navy. Curly Watson later died of injuries sustained in a fight with Frank Inglis in London on 5 March 1910. Jeptha had been having problems with damage to his eyesight since before the March 1907 title fight and had received treatment at the Moorfields Eye Hospital, and now had blurred vision. Jeptha did not hold onto the title for long. He was defeated by Joe White in the British welterweight title fight at Cardiff in August 1907. He was at the peak of his career at this point, but knew that he needed to retire because of the problems with his eyesight. However, he kept on fighting and was able to make a living outside of boxing for a while when he appeared in a play called \\"Black against White\\". An actress called Mabel Goldswain appeared with him in this vaudeville play, along with British lightweight champion Jack Goldswain. Jeptha played the role of a villain and it is said that his eyes suffered further damage from heavy blows to the head from Goldswain in every performance. Later life Jeptha fought Jim Doran in October 1909 and the sight in his right eye was permanently damaged during this contest. However, he continued to box until he was injured in a fight with Joe White in July 1910. Apparently, the famous referee John Douglas and his son Johnny Douglas, together with other prominent sportsman, tried to help him earn a living. Andrew Jeptha was in hospital in Liverpool for a while, but unfortunately nothing could be done to save his sight. HIs supporters bought him a tobacconist and confectionery shop in Walthamstow, but he was unable to make a go of it because of his lack of sight. He returned to South Africa without his wife and children. It is recorded that he could be seen sitting on the sidewalk between the flower sellers in Adderley Street, Cape Town, selling a booklet at the price of one shilling. The title of this booklet was \\"A South African Boxer in Britain ‚Äì Experiences of Andrew Jephta\\".

It is a stable rice genotype that maintains its features. In 1970 it covered 8% of Italian rice-cultivated fields. Maratelli rice keeps its shape better than other forms of rice during the slow cooking required for making risotto due to higher quantities of amylose. History Maratelli rice facebook Riso Maratelli was \\"born\\" at Asigliano V.se (Vercelli) in the autumn of 1914 when the rice farmer Mario Maratelli saw a rice plant in the field which was different from all the other plants of the Chinese originario he was growing in that field. The plant has longer panicles, is droopier, and has a larger number of grains. The panicles are yellow, which is typical of full ripening and therefore near to harvesting. These panicles are different from the other panicles in the fields in that they have matured early whereas the others are hardly yellow and not mature. Maratelli picked these already mature panicles, isolated them, and packed them to preserve them with the intention of sowing these \\"different\\" kernels the following year. The next year he sowed the few kernels on an isolated plot of land and closely followed all the biological phases of the plants which germinate from them. He takes note of the tiller index of the mother plants and also, above all, the early ripening in comparison to the other cultivars grown. He receives confirmation of the differences he had observed the previous year and all the panicles present underlined these differences when they matured. Maratelli noted the vegetative development of the plants and compares these characteristics with those of plants from other varieties underlining certain positive aspects, these are: early maturing, better yield, better use of the land. The grains of white rice are tried in the kitchen to prepare classic dishes (such as risotto, panissa, and rice in broth) and once again the new rice finds wide approval in as much as it doesn't overcook, it combines well with other ingredients and satisfies the housewives. The new variety spreads rapidly in the Vercellese lowland and in a few years takes over from the other established varieties and imposes and maintains the record for a long time. An important step has been taken to recoup and enhance the rice \\"invented\\" by Mario Maratelli in 1914. From the end of April 2013, the original Maratelli has been inserted in the National Register of Historic Varieties. Botanical and agronomic traits Maratelli is an historical variety of Italian rice production, developed in 1919 through the selection of Chinese originario by Mario Maratelli from Asigliano. Maratelli is a semi-early variety (15 days earlier than Chinese originario) which shows a medium height, ‚Äúsemifino‚Äù, awnless pearl grain. Maratelli shows a high seedling vegetative vigor, quite a good tiller index (seven fertile stems/plant), good cold tolerance at germination stage, and medium cold tolerance at flowering stage. Stem has average height of 90‚Äì110 cm, strong and resistant to lodging. Leaf is light green colour. * Panicle: open, semi droopy attitude. * Average length 20 cm, with 90-110 kernels per panicle. * Spikelet: yellow colour, pigmented point and awnless. * Spikelet biometric data: 7.8 mm length and 3.7 mm width. * 1000-kernel weight is 32.2 grams * Kernels: white pericarp, pearl endosperm (lateral pearl and irregular shape). * Kernel biometric data: 5.6 mm length and 3.2 mm width. * 1000-kernel weight is 24.1 grams References Rice varieties ","title":"Maratelli"},{"id":"36574429","text":"Stine Nielsen (born 9 February 1991) is a Danish sports shooter.

K. Gani, was an Indonesian politician. Born in West Sumatra, he spent much of his youth in Java, where he studied medicine and became involved with the nascent nationalist movement before going to South Sumatra to work as a doctor. During the Indonesian National Revolution he served three terms as Minister of Welfare; two of these were concurrent with terms as a deputy prime minister. Afterwards Gani went to Palembang, South Sumatra, where he remained active in politics until his death. In November 2007 Gani was made a National Hero of Indonesia. Early life Gani was born in Palembajan, West Sumatra, west of Bukittinggi, on 16 September 1905. The son of a teacher, he finished his early studies in Bukittinggi in 1923 before going to Batavia (modern day Jakarta), first for his secondary studies and then to study medicine. He graduated from STOVIA (Dutch: School tot Opleiding van Indische Artsen), a school for prospective doctors, in 1926. From his teens Gani was active in politics and social organisations. He was a member of several groups for native youth, including Jong Java and Jong Sumatera. By the late 1920s he had several enterprises running, including a boarding house and book reseller. This revenue enabled him to donate funds to the Youth Congress of 1928, where the Youth Pledge was first read and \\"Indonesia Raya\\" (the national anthem of Indonesia) was first played; Gani also attended this conference. In 1931 he joined Partindo, which had split off from the Indonesian National Party (, or PNI) shortly after Sukarno's arrest by the colonial government. Gani became acquainted with Sukarno after the latter's release from prison the following year and joined the Indonesian Political Federation with him. Long interested in theatre, in 1941 Gani starred in Union Film's Asmara Moerni after being invited by the film's director, Rd. Ariffien. At the time the country's film industry was beginning to cater to well-educated audiences. Although some of the audience considered Gani's involvement in Asmara Moerni as besmirching the independence movement, Gani considered it necessary to improve how the people viewed local productions. The film, the only one Gani ever made, was a commercial success. That year Gani received his medical degree. After the Japanese occupied the Indies in 1942, Gani refused to collaborate. As such, he was arrested in September 1943 and held until October of the following year. He spent the rest of the occupation as a private practitioner. National revolution After the country's independence and during the ensuing revolution, Gani gained greater political power while also serving with the military. From 1945 to 1947 he was the commissioner for the PNI in South Sumatra, also serving on that party's board. He also coordinated military efforts in the province. He considered Palembang a viable economic powerhouse for the newly independent nation, arguing that with oil they could gather international support. He negotiated sales with international interests, including the Dutch-owned Shell while smuggling weapons and military supplies past the Dutch blockade. He had numerous connections in the Chinese community in Singapore, which assisted him in these tasks. Gani, 1947 From 2 October 1946 until 27 June 1947 Gani served as Minister of Welfare under Sutan Sjahrir in the prime minister's third cabinet; Sjahrir later remarked that he felt as if Gani had been imposed upon him by Sukarno, who was by then president. While serving as minister of welfare Gani, with Sjahrir and Mohammad Roem, served as the Indonesian delegation to the third plenary session for the Linggadjati Agreement, becoming a signatory on 25 March 1947; the Dutch considered him undiplomatic and prone to showing his emotions. He also worked to establish a national banking network, the BTC, as well as several trade organisations. With Amir Sjarifuddin and Setijadji, Gani was a formateur for the new cabinet, which received its mandate on 3 July. He stayed on as Minister of Welfare while also serving as a deputy prime minister under Sjarifuddin. Gani was the first cabinet member arrested during Operation Product, a Dutch assault on Indonesian-held territory in mid-July, but was later released. He also attended a trade conference in Havana, Cuba. In Sjarifuddin's second cabinet, Gani continued to serve as a deputy prime minister and minister of welfare until the cabinet collapsed on 29 January 1948 owing to dissatisfaction with the Renville Agreement. Post revolution After the revolution ended in 1949, Gani became the Military Governor of South Sumatra. In 1954, while still involved in politics as minister of transportation in the First Ali Sastroamidjojo Cabinet, he became the rector of Sriwijaya University in Palembang; he remained active in the province until his death on 23 December 1968. He was buried in Siguntang Heroes' Cemetery in Palembang. Gani was survived by his wife, Masturah; the couple had no children. Legacy On 9 November 2007, President Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono gave Gani the title National Hero of Indonesia; Gani received the title along with Slamet Rijadi, Ida Anak Agung Gde Agung, and Moestopo based on Presidential Decree Number 66 / TK of 2007.

Grgur was the eldest son of Serbian Despot ƒêuraƒë Brankoviƒá and Eirene Kantakouzene. In 1439, after the Ottomans captured Smederevo, the capital of the Serbian Despotate, they appointed Grgur as governor of his father's captured estates. Because he plotted against the Ottomans, they dismissed him and put him in prison in April 1441. In May 1441 the Ottomans blinded Grgur and his brother Stefan. In 1458, during struggle for the throne of the Serbian Despotate, Grgur resurfaced claiming it for himself or his son. In 1459 he retreated to Hilandar Monastery, where he took monastic vows.

In April 1441 the Ottomans, probably justifiably, accused Grgur for treason and dismissed him from his governorship. On 8 May 1441 both Grgur and his brother Stefan were blinded, based on the order of Sultan Murad II. According to John Van Antwerp Fine, Jr. and Sima ƒÜirkoviƒá, Grgur resurfaced in 1458, claiming the succession of the vacant throne of Serbian Despotate for himself or his son.

She previously played for Arsenal, Chelsea and Reading (on loan from Chelsea). She is a former England youth international. She was involved in the final stages of the 2012 Summer Olympics torch relay. Early life Bailey is the daughter of soccer coach Trevor Bailey, the founder of Interwood Junior Football Club. Bailey started playing football at age 6 for a Sunday league team, becoming the top goalscorer for Chapel End. She eventually became captain and the only female player of Waltham Forest Schools U11. But the team did not allow mixed-gender teams from age 11, so Bailey got a trial with Arsenal, was signed to Arsenal's U12s girls team, started training with Arsenal, and was spotted by England scouts. Bailey says she admired footballers Ashley Cole and John Terry, then later Arsenal and England captain Faye White. Club career She was given a scholarship and a two-year professional contract by Arsenal Ladies football team. Bailey came off the bench during Arsenal's win in the 2013 FA Cup. Bailey started the 2014 FA Cup final and was part of the Arsenal side which won 2‚Äì0. In April 2015, Manchester City's England midfielder Jill Scott was shown the red card and banned for three matches for headbutting Bailey during a match. Bailey transferred to Chelsea in 2016 and made 16 appearances in her first season, as a deep-lying midfielder and sometimes in central defence. She suffered an anterior cruciate ligament injury in April 2017, ruling her out of participation in the following season. In January 2019, Chelsea gave Bailey a one-year contract extension and sent her on loan to Reading to prove her fitness. In July 2019 Bailey was transferred to Liverpool, who assigned her the number 8 shirt. International career Bailey made her debut for England's under-17s on 3 October 2010 against Turkey as a defender although she had been an unplayed substitute in the matches against Italy and Serbia earlier that year. She was chosen by kit manufacturer Umbro in 2010 as one of the next generation of England's footballing stars. She was named in the England under-20 squad for the 2014 FIFA U-20 Women's World Cup in Canada. In 2016 Bailey was selected by coach Marieanne Spacey for England's 'Next Gen' squad, which replaced the previous Under-23 set up, though still competing in U23-aged matches and competitions. Olympic Games The Olympic organizers appealed for a talented young footballer to take part in the 2012 Summer Olympics torch relay. Bailey had been trained by the Bailey Elite Football Academy in Wadham Lodge, Walthamstow during her teens and Waltham Forest Council nominated her to the organizers. Her part in the relay was watched by an estimated global audience of one billion as she stood on the prow of the motorboat driven by David Beckham and held the Olympic torch that was ferried to Steve Redgrave during the 2012 Summer Olympics opening ceremony. She was interviewed by the BBC's children's news program \\"Newsround\\" about the event and pointed out that Beckham drove the boat for most of its journey but didn't get to park it.

Schwarzlose S√∂hne was a German perfume-manufacturer that operated from 1856 to 1976, with its heyday between about 1870 and the Second World war. It specialized in perfume but also sold powders, soaps and other toiletries. A new company was founded in 2012, as J.F. Schwarzlose Berlin, selling fragrances under some of the same historical brand names.  History  In 1856, Joachim Friedrich Schwarzlose, a piano maker, founded the company J.F. Schwarzlose S√∂hne for his children Franz, Kurt, Max and Hedwig. The company was initially a pharmacy but two of the brothers, Kurt and Max, left the main business and came to specialize in the production of perfumes. The store was located at Markgrafenstra√üe 29 in Berlin. In 1895, J.F. Schwarzlose S√∂hne took over the distinguished fragrance manufacturer Treu & Nuglisch, which was founded in the 1820s and had been a purveyor to the Court, thus giving the company a good reputation among imperial and royal personages. From then on, business was done under the name of J.F. Schwarzlose S√∂hne ‚Äì Treu & Nuglisch. In 1902, Ernst K√∂thner, grandson of Joachim Friedrich Schwarzlose, became the owner and with him the company began to expand, from Europe to Asia and Australia. In 1922, Ernst K√∂thner and his wife, Hedwig K√∂thner, renamed the company J.F. Schwarzlose S√∂hne GmbH. The factory was located at 5 Dreysestra√üe in Moabit. In September 1930, they moved to a modernized store located at 113 Leipziger Stra√üe. Two months later, in November 1930, Ernst K√∂thner died and his son Werner took over the company and became head of the company with his mother Hedwig K√∂thner. After the factory and shops were destroyed in 1944, Anni K√∂thner restarted the business in 1947, first in Hamburg, then again in Berlin. Difficulties came with the building of the Berlin Wall in 1961, because offices in the districts of Prenzlauer Berg and Moabit and the shop in Leipziger Stra√üe were separated by it. In 1965, Anni M√ºller-Godet ‚Äì born K√∂thner ‚Äì became the head of the company. In 1976, J. F. Schwarzlose S√∂hne was liquidated.  Products  The fragrances that were popular included the floral \\"Rosa Centifolia\\" and \\"Hymen\\", a German bouquet-fantasy \\"Royalin\\", or masculine cologne \\"Finale\\". Between the First and Second World Wars, leather fragrances \\"Juchten\\" and \\"IA-33\\" (for women) were popular throughout Germany and Europe. The latter's unusual name derived from the vehicle license plate for Berlin at this time. The flacon was designed in the Art d√©co style and resembled a car radiator grill ‚Äì a sign of the modern way of life in the intellectual and progressive capital. Other important products were \\"Treffpunkt 8 Uhr\\", \\"Hohenzollern Veilchen\\" and \\"Lilaflor\\".  J.F. Schwarzlose Berlin  A new company was founded in 2012, under the name of J.F. Schwarzlose Berlin. The perfumer V√©ronique Nyberg (of International Flavors & Fragrances) and the designer Lutz Herrmann created four fragrances: floral linden fragrance \\"1A-33\\", spicy woody fragrance \\"Treffpunkt 8 Uhr\\", \\"Trance\\" and \\"Rausch\\".

In 1921, the site was recognized as a National Historic Site, and in recognition that it had only surviving Edo-period checkpoint structure remaining in the country, its status was upgraded to that of a Special National Historic Site by the Japanese government in 1962. Overview Located between Maisaka-juku and Arai-juku, in what is now the city of Kosai, Shizuoka Prefecture, the Arai Barrier was strategically positioned on the narrow strip of land between Lake Hamana and the Pacific Ocean, and was the only checkpoint on the T≈çkaid≈ç intended for travelers both by land and by water. All travelers were required to submit to an examination of their travel permits, and taxes were levied on commercial travelers with merchandise. The checkpoint was initially managed by the , a post with a revenue of 1000 koku, who was assisted by six yoriki and 20 d≈çshin. From 1696, the post was to be held by two men who served in alternate years; however, the position was abolished in 1702 and the Barrier was thereafter managed by Yoshida Domain on behalf of the shogunate. The initial checkpoint, built in the year 1600, was destroyed by a tsunami during the Genroku period (1688-1703) and rebuilt only to be destroyed again during the 1707 H≈çei earthquake. It was then moved to its current location on the western shore of Lake Hamana. The structures were rebuilt again after the 1854 Ansei-T≈çkai earthquake. The main building is a single-story structure facing south, with Irimoya gambrel sides and a tiled roof. It is long from east to west, and is divided into several rooms within. Following the Meiji Restoration, the barrier was abolished in 1869, and its buildings were converted for use as an elementary school, followed by government offices until 1951. The main building was restored in 1971, and additional buildings, such as gates and a pier, were re-created in 1998 on their original foundations as part of a museum.

In cricket, Toovey was a left-handed batsman who bowled slow left-arm orthodox. He was born at Warwick, Queensland. Toovey served in the Royal Australian Navy during World War II, enlisting for service when he was seventeen. He served during the war aboard , where he was present during the Battle of the Java Sea and was also aboard the ship during its sinking at the Battle of Sunda Strait in February 1942. Half of the ship's crew were lost, while the remainder who survived, including Ordinary seaman Toovey, were captured by the Japanese and spent the remainder of the war in Prisoner of War camps. While imprisoned, he reportedly resisted recommendations to have his leg amputated because of an ulcer, telling his captors \\"You can't take my leg off because I've got to play cricket for Queensland.\\" His time as a prisoner saw Toovey put to work as part of the forced labour constructing the Thai-Burma Railway. Following the end of the war and his release from Japanese captivity, Toovey stuck by his wartime aim of playing cricket for Queensland by making his first-class debut for the state against South Australia in the 1949‚Äì50 Sheffield Shield. He made 36 further first-class appearances for Queensland, the last of which came against New South Wales in the 1955‚Äì56 Sheffield Shield. In his 37 first-class appearances for Queensland, he scored 1,346 runs at an average of 24.03, with a high score of 87. One of nine half centuries he made, this score came against Victoria in the 1950‚Äì51 Sheffield Shield. Following his playing career for Queensland, he served as a selector for the Queensland side, as well as serving on the Queensland panel as chairman for nearly 25 years, before retiring in 1989. He was also the President of Northern Suburbs District Cricket Club.

Origins In the beginning of April 1941, Iraqi politician Rashid Ali al-Gaylani along with several more Iraqi officers, part of the nationalist group the Golden Square, overthrew the pro-British regime in the Kingdom of Iraq. The new pro-Nazi government sought German and Italian support for an Iraqi revolt against the British forces in the country. Contact was established with the Axis powers with the help of the Nazi supporter Grand Mufti of Jerusalem Amin al-Husseini who had lived in Iraq since he fled imprisonment from Mandatory Palestine shortly before the war.Churchill, Winston (1985) [1950]. \\"14: The Revolt in Iraq\\". The Grand Alliance. The Second World War. III. Boston: Houghton Mifflin Company. . In May, 1941 the Anglo-Iraqi War begun with British forces entering Iraq. Adolf Hitler had agreed to send Luftwaffe squadrons to support Iraq as well as Sonderstab F, a special mission headed by Hellmuth Felmy which was to support the revolt and raise a German-led Arab brigade. By late May the same year the Iraqi forces had been beaten by the British and al-Husseini and al-Gaylani fled to Iran and then Germany. After the failure a number of Arab sympathisers were shipped out of the Middle East through French Syria and ended up in Cape Sounion, Greece. Units A soldier from the Free Arabian Legion in German-occupied Greece in September 1943 Hellmuth Felmy had by June been given command of Army Group Southern Greece and was to continue the raising of the German-Arab units through Sonderstab F, which had now been expanded and \\"should be the central field office for all issues of the Arab world, which affect the Wehrmacht\\".Zitiert nach Walther Hubatsch (Hrsg.): Hitlers Weisungen f√ºr die Kriegf√ºhrung 1939‚Äì1945. Dokumente des Oberkommandos der Wehrmacht. Bernard & Graefe, Frankfurt a. M. 1962 Therefore, the two units Sonderverband 287 and Sonderverband 288 were created. Sonderverband 288 contained only a small proportion of Arab soldiers. However, the term Free Arabian Legion was not the name of any specific unit, but an all-encompassing name of all Arabic units in the German Army.Rolf Stoves: Die gepanzerten und motorisierten deutschen Gro√üverb√§nde. Podzun-Pallas-Verlag, Friedberg 1986. . Seiten 288‚Äì289. =Sonderverband 287= Sonderverband 287 was formed on 4 August 1942, with much help from Amin al-Husseini and Rashid Ali al-Gaylani and consisted of mostly of Iraqi and Syrian Muslims, bolstered by former prisoner of war and other volunteers. The 3rd battalion of Sonderverband 287 was taken from the unit and sent as the Deutsche-Arabische Lehr-Abteilung to the Caucasus in September 1942. It was part of the Axis offensive into the region and the German plan to raise an Iraqi government-in-exile there. They were then to use the region as a force station and base for a way of conquering Iraq. The plan never came to be and the unit never saw action following heavy German setbacks in late 1942. The unit was sent to the battle in Tunisia through Italy in January 1943. Here the Deutsche-Arabische Lehr-Abteilung was placed on the southern flank of the Axis army and was used to recruit more local Arabs who formed a second battalion of auxiliaries who were used for guard duty and as construction troops. The whole unit was captured along with the rest of the Axis forces in Africa, May 1943. The remaining soldiers the 3rd battalion, i.e. the Deutsche-Arabische Lehr-Abteilung, who had not been sent to North Africa, were used, together with French residing Muslims from North Africa, to form into the German-Arab Batallion 845 in the summer of 1943. They served in the Peloponnese region of Greece as part of the 41st Fortress Division from November the same year. It participated in the Greek partisan war, specifically against ELAS. In October 1944 it was withdrawn from Greece into Yugoslavia and was in early 1945 strengthened by the addition of Arabs from a battalion of Arab volunteers that was disbanded before it was fully formed. It ended the war near Zagreb as part of the 104th J√§ger Division. The 1st and 2nd battalions of the Free Arabian Legion who had not been part of the Deutsche- Arabische Lehr-Abteilung were used to replace losses and rebuild Grenadier Regiment 92 together with a light battery and light pioneer company on 2 May 1943, which was then redesignated to Grenadier Regiment 92 (MOT) on 5 June 1944. The regiment moved to Yugoslavia to fight against Partisans and was part of Army Group F. The regiment suffered heavy losses in the fighting near Belgrade in October 1944 and the remains became part of the 2nd Panzer Army where it was rebuilt into Panzergrenadier Brigade 92 in January 1945. The whole army capitulated in disarray in Austria, May 1945. =Sonderverband 288= Sonderverband 288 consisted mostly of Germans but with a cadre of Arab translators and a mobile printing company that could produce Arabic-language leaflets as well as a squad for the operation of oil production facilities.Roland Kaltenegger: Die deutsche Gebirgstruppe 1935‚Äì1945. Weltbild Verlag, Augsburg 2000, . By January, 1942 the whole unit was transferred to Libya to defend against the British forces in the North Africa Campaign, the unit was planned to eventually be used in an invasion of the Middle East through Egypt, but this never came to be. After several months of fighting the unit was renamed Panzer Grenadier Regiment Africa and eventually captured by American forces following the capitulation of all Axis forces in North Africa, May 1943.Gregory Douglas - Sonderverband 287 & 288 (in The Military Advisor, Vol 4, No 3)  See also  * Azerbaijani Legion * Free Indian Legion * Relations between Nazi Germany and the Arab world * Waffen-SS foreign volunteers and conscripts References Further reading * Foreign volunteer units of the Wehrmacht Military units and formations established in 1941 Military units and formations disestablished in 1945 ","title":"Free Arabian Legion"},{"id":"36574955","text":"Jennet Saryyeva (born 30 March 1994 in Ashgabat) is a Turkmenistan swimmer.London2012.com Profile At the 2012 Summer Olympics, she competed in the Women's 400 metre freestyle, finishing in 35th (last) place in the heats; her time of 5:40.29 was nearly a minute behind that the next slowest competitor,London2012.com Women's 400m Freestyle but set a new Turkmenistan record.

She is the current leader of Ladies in White, a group originally composed of wives and female relatives of political prisoners who protested on their behalf which has since 2011 transformed into a more general human rights group open to Cuban women. She assumed leadership following the death of group founder Laura Pollan. In 2012, the Associated Press described her as \\"one of Cuba's leading dissidents\\".  Biography  = Early life = Soler is a former microbiology technician at a Havana hospital. She is married to Angel Moya Acosta, a construction worker and dissident, with whom she has two sons, Luis Angel and Lienys. = Activism = In March 2003, Soler's husband Moya, the founder of the Alternative Option Movement, was arrested during Cuba's \\"Black Spring\\" crackdown on political dissidents. He was later sentenced to twenty years in prison. Soler then became a founding member of the Ladies in White, a group composed of wives and female relatives of political prisoners. Each Sunday, members would dress in white and march down Havana's Fifth Avenue in protest of their husbands' continued detention. When Moya suffered a herniated disc in October 2004, Soler began a campaign to urge the government to give him an operation, submitting a letter to President Fidel Castro on his behalf and staging a rare protest in Havana's Plaza de la Revoluci√≥n with the Ladies in White. She described the protest as \\"my right and duty as a wife\\". After two days of protest, Moya was given surgery. Soler was one of five members of the Ladies to be selected to receive the 2005 Sakharov Prize for Freedom of Thought of the European Parliament. The Cuban government barred the group's leaders from attending the Sakharov Prize award ceremony in Strasbourg, France, drawing an appeal on the group's behalf from the European Parliament. After Moya's release from prison, he and Soler chose to remain in Cuba and continue their calls for the release of political prisoners, despite being offered emigration to Spain. In March 2012, Soler and Moya were detained along with three dozen other demonstrators when they staged their weekly protest ahead of a visit of Pope Benedict XVI. Soler told reporters that authorities had warned the Ladies to avoid Benedict's public appearances, including masses. She responded, \\"They are mistaken because who is going to prohibit us from being close to Christ, being close to God, to the pope who is represents Christ on earth?\\" In 2013, seven members and former members of the Ladies in White denounced Berta Soler for the diversion and appropriation of the funds the organization receives from the US and EU supporting governments and agencies, as well for using \\"dictatorial\\" practices.

In the valley lying amongst the Hohburg Hills, the stream of the Lossabach flows through M√ºglenz, Hohburg, Klein- and Gro√üzschepa to empty into the Mulde near Thallwitz.  History  The Hohburg Hills were shaped by decades of intensive stone quarrying. This produced steep rock faces and several lakes in the hollows that were left behind. The rock faces, up to forty meters high, have been used for climbing since 1925. Climbers from the area, such as Felix Simon, made use of the terrain as a training ground for the Alps. Many of the climbs used in those days fell victim to ongoing quarry operations. From 1965, the Schwarze Wand (\\"Black Wall\\") has been used for Alpine training (aid climbing). Since the mid-1990s, many, new, very difficult routes have emerged as part of a further wave of development. Currently there are over 500 climbing routes in various quarries.

It was established in 1819 and forms the cricket section of Cardiff Athletic Club with its headquarters at Cardiff Arms Park. The first team plays in the South Wales Premier Cricket League. It is one of the oldest sporting organisations in the whole of Wales. History Cardiff Cricket Club was established in 1819. The club initially played on various cricket grounds, mostly in eastern Cardiff, due to better drainage. The club then moved to Cardiff Arms Park, but it was more of a gentlemen's club, rather than a sports club. By 1867 the Bute Estate agreed that the cricket club could rent the eastern part of the Arms Park at only one shilling per annum. By April 1875 the Bute Estate decided to restrict access to the Arms Park to Cardiff Cricket Club and other recognised clubs. In 1922 Cardiff Football Club, later renamed Cardiff Rugby Football Club and Cardiff Cricket Club amalgamated to form the Cardiff Athletic Club. There had been previous attempts to merge the clubs, in November 1892 and between 1902 and 1904, when the two clubs worked closely to fund a new pavilion to serve the needs of both clubs, but it was not until 1922 that the merger finally took place. Later the Cardiff Arms Park Company Limited was formed by Cardiff Athletic Club, Arms Park (Cardiff) Greyhound Racing Company Limited and the Welsh Rugby Union (WRU) acquired the land from the Bute Estate for ¬£30,000 (GBP), but on the understanding that the Arms Park was only used for recreational purposes and was not sold for building. The cricket section of the Athletic Club acquired a 99 lease from the company at a rental of ¬£200 per annum, with Glamorgan County Cricket Club paying rent for the use of the park for county cricket. The existing wooden cricket and rugby pavilion had been demolished and new changing rooms included in the new North Stand. In 1937 a new cricket pavilion was built for the cricket section of Cardiff Athletic Club. By the mid 1950s improvements meant that the capacity of the cricket ground had increased to around 15,000, although the ground was still very small and often visiting teams agreed to the boundaries being shortened so that people could sit on the grass. Cardiff Athletic Club however wanted to develop new facilities for both the bowls and tennis sections, and did not allow new seating to be erected just for county games. A new scheme was developed to change the existing rugby ground into the National Stadium, and creating a smaller ground for Cardiff R.F.C. on the existing cricket ground, with the cricket section of Cardiff Athletic Club moving to Sophia Gardens. Cardiff Cricket Club played their final game at Cardiff Arms Park against Lydney Cricket Club on 17 September 1966. In 1998, Cardiff Athletic Club sold the Sophia Gardens ground to Glamorgan County Cricket Club and the cricket section of Cardiff Athletic Club (Cardiff Cricket Club) for many years had no fixed cricket ground, while they were looking for a suitable cricket ground. In 1997 the club moved to their permanent home of the Diamond cricket ground at Forest Farm, Whitchurch, Cardiff and by July 2007 a new pavilion had been built on the ground. Cardiff Cricket Club have won the South Wales Premier Cricket League in both 2009 and 2011.

World Directory of Minorities and Indigenous Peoples - Uruguay : Afro-Uruguayans The party was founded in 1936 and was close to the Nuestra Raza group. The foundation of PAN followed the establishment of two other Black political parties in Latin America, in Cuba (1908) and Brazil (1931). Founding A first reference of the project to launch a Black political party can be found in the October 24, 1935, issue of Nuestra Raza. The following issues of the journal carried more editorials and articles arguing for the foundation of the party. On May 9, 1936, a preliminary assembly of the party was held. Some 30 people participated in the event. Two preparatory bodies were named, a Reporting Committee and a Provisional Board. On May 23, 1936, the manifesto of the party (drafted by the Reporting Committee) was adopted at a party meeting.Gascue, Alvaro. Un intento de organizaci√≥n pol√≠tica de la raza negra en Uruguay - Partido Aut√≥ctono Negro, pp. 50‚Äì53.

After Betervide's death from tuberculosis in 1936 the chairmanship of the party was taken over by Mario M√©ndez.Andrews, George Reid. Blackness in the white nation: a history of Afro- Uruguay. Chapel Hill: University of North Carolina Press, 2010. pp. 96‚Äì97, 201 On January 5, 1937, the party was recognized by the Electoral Court. In March 1937 a new manifesto was issued, following similar lines as the original party manifesto. Local committees On July 5, 1937, a local committee of the party was established in Rivera. On December 4, 1937, a General Assembly of the party was organized. On December 18, 1937, a local committee was set up in the town of Melo. Pan The party published the journal Pan ('Bread') as its organ. The first issue was published on April 15, 1937. Nine issues were published until December 1937.Lewis, Marvin A. Afro-Uruguayan Literature: Post-Colonial Perspectives. Lewisburg, [Pa.]: Bucknell University Press, 2003, pp. 28, 159. Sandalio del Puerto was the editor of Pan, until being replaced by Carmelo Gentile in October 1937. Electoral debacle On March 5, 1938, the party convention was opened. The convention was a public event. The majority of the 22 participants came from Montevideo. The convention was chaired by Victoriano Rivero, Isabelino Jos√© Gares and F√©lix Tejera. At the meeting a draft candidate list for the upcoming elections was presented. On the second day of the convention (March 7), 16 people participated. The candidate list was approved with Mario M√©ndez as the top candidate. Other candidates were Carmelo Gentile, Pilar Barrios, Rufino Silva Gonzalez, Juan Carlos Martinez, Rolando R. Olivera, Victoriano Rivero, C√°ndido Guimaraes, Sandalio del Puerto and Roberto Sosa. The party failed to win major support as the majority of Afro-Uruguayans preferred to vote for either of the two main parties. The party launched a list of ten candidates ahead of the 1938 general election. The election campaign, carried out in Montevideo, centered around racial discrimination in employment in the state administration. The campaign had meager results, though, receiving a mere 87 votes. Following this humiliating experience, the party never contested elections again. Split PAN suffered a split in 1941. A group of Executive Committee members met on August 13, 1941, and voted to demote M√©ndez from his post as party chairman. Effectively two groups emerged that claimed to be the legitimate PAN, the group led by M√©ndez and another led by Anibal Eduarte, Ignacio Suarez Pe√±a (chairman) and Ismael Arribio. I. Bello served as general secretary of the M√©ndez faction. On August 15, 1941, M√©ndez reported to police that properties at the PAN office had been stolen by the Suarez Pe√±a faction. The Suarez Pe√±a group responded by appealing to the Electoral Court that they be recognized as the genuine PAN. The Suarez Pe√±a faction held a party assembly on August 23, 1941. The declaration of the assembly was signed by 49 persons. In January 1942 the M√©ndez faction adopted a party hymn, composed by Victor Irrazabal and Carlos Tarama. On January 23, 1942, the Electoral Court declared that it would not take sides in the dispute in PAN, arguing that it was not possible to determine who was the legitimate claimant to the name PAN. Reunification and dissolution M√©ndez died on June 5, 1942. Following his death the two factions were reunited in October 1942. The party was dissolved on June 11, 1944. The few properties of the party were donated to Nuestra Raza.

The institute was to be a \\"people's university\\" in the words of John Passmore Edwards, speaking at the building's opening ceremony in 1900 - he also opened the local museum, the Passmore Edwards Museum, in a separate building on the same site on the same occasion. Under principal Albert E. Briscoe, the college provided courses in science, engineering and art. In addition, under Maud J. Foster of the L.C.C. Training School, it had a Women's Department. The Institute it established its own internal degree courses in science and engineering, which were ratified by the University of London. Day secretarial courses for girls were added in 1906, a girls Trade School in 1912, a junior engineering school for boys in 1913, and a Junior School of Arts & Crafts in 1914. It became the West Ham Municipal college in 1921 and latterly, West Ham College of Technology. As demand for technical education grew throughout the 1930s and 1940s, the county council created two further colleges at Walthamstow and Dagenham. =North East London Polytechnic= In 1970, these three colleges (West Ham, Walthamstow, Dagenham) were combined as a merger of higher education colleges to create the North East London Polytechnic. Campuses were modernised and revitalised by buildings such as the Arthur Edwards building on the Stratford campus, completed in 1982. In 1988, the North East London Polytechnic became a Higher Education Institution, renamed the Polytechnic of East London in 1989. =University of East London= In 1992, the Polytechnic of East London became the University of East London. A \\"new university\\", the UEL's history of founding institutions exemplify the developments that took place in British further and higher education policy throughout the late nineteenth and twentieth centuries.Frank Gould, 'Introduction', Degrees East: The Making of the University of East London 1892‚Äì1992 (London: Athlone Press, 1995) vii The University of East London consisted of the Barking Campus (closed 2006) and the Stratford Campus. In 1999 the University of East London Docklands Campus was opened, the first new university campus built in London for over 50 years. from text provided to the publisher by UEL Present: Stratford Campus Details around the entrance to the library of the University of East London Stratford Campus The present Stratford campus of the University of East London is centred on the now Grade II* listed University House. The campus is home to the School of Education and Communities, the Schools of Health Sport & Bioscience and the School of Psychology. The Centre for Clinical Education was opened in January 2008. Operating in partnership with the National Health Service, the centre is London's only provider of podiatric education. Duncan House is near to the campus. It is used by the university's human resource services and by the School of Law and Social Sciences. It contains a library servicing the needs of those who attend the building. =Developments= It is expected that in 2013 the School of Law and Social Sciences and the Institute of Performing Arts will move to a new campus, University Square Stratford, located in Stratford's Cultural Quarter. The building will also be shared with Birkbeck College, University of London. Building began on site in July 2011 and is scheduled for completion in summer 2013, with the first students admitted for the academic year 2013/14. In 2011 UEL appointed Make Architects to lead on the design of a new, replacement library at the Stratford Campus. The project has a budget of ¬£13 million and a target opening date of 2013.

Work Rafman giving a lecture in Moscow, Spring 2012 Rafman's work focuses on technology and digital media, often using narrative to emphasize the ways in which they connect users back to society and history. Much of his work focuses on melancholy in modern social interactions, communities and virtual realities (primarily Google Earth, Google Street View and Second Life), while still bringing light to the beauty of them in a manner sometimes inspired by Romanticism.

She was wrecked off Guernsey in the Channel Islands on 28 November 1807 with the loss of most of her crew of 154 men. Service The Royal Navy commissioned Boreas under the command of Captain Robert Scott. On 2 October 1807 she captured, after a four- hour chase, the French privateer schooner Victoire. The privateer had a crew of 28 men and was armed with swivel guns and small arms. She had sailed from Morlaix the day before and had already captured an American brig, which Boreas recaptured. On 8 October 1807 Boreas and the sixth-rate frigate captured the Danish ships St Hans and Montreal. Wreck Boreas sailed from Saint Peter Port on Guernsey to the rescue of a pilot cutter that was in difficulty in bad weather. Sailing back around Guernsey with the cutter in tow, she struck the Requiers rock. An expert pilot was on board and had ordered the ship to put about, but the officer of the watch refused to act without permission from the captain, resulting in the loss of the ship in the confusion. After efforts to save Boreas failed, Scott ordered the crew to abandon ship. He sent some men ahead in boats that landed at Hanois Point, but strong seas and the desertion of many of the men prevented the boats from going back to rescue the remaining men. Boreas eventually sank, with only her rigging remaining above water. The next morning, boats dispatched by Admiral James Saumarez, commander of the Royal Navy Channel Islands squadron and himself a Guernsey native, rescued 30 men. In all, 120 persons drowned, including Scott. Twenty-six of the survivors took advantage of the situation to desert. The normal post-loss court martial was held with the captain, officers and crew being praised for their \\"standing in good conduct.\\" Post script The sinking of Boreas added greatly to the call to construct a lighthouse, which resulted in Les Hanois Lighthouse being erected on Guernsey between 1860 and 1862. Fort Grey on Guernsey is now a shipwreck museum and holds one of the cannon from Boreas. It points towards the reef where she sank.

A specialist steeplechaser, he ran thirty-nine time and won eighteen races in a career which lasted from March 1990 until February 1997. After winning five races over hurdles, Jodami switched to racing over fences in the autumn of 1991. In early 1993 he won four consecutive races, culminating with a win in Britain's most prestigious steeplechase, the Cheltenham Gold Cup. He also won three editions of the Hennessy Gold Cup at Leopardstown Racecourse. Jodami's racing career was ended by injury in 1997. He died in 2008. Background Jodami was a bay horse bred at Ballinabanogue, County Waterford by Eamon Phelan. During his racing career, he stood just under 17 hands high and weighed 570 kg. Timeform described him as being \\"deep- girthed\\" and an \\"old-fashioned\\" type of chaser while according to Richard Edmondson of The Independent Jodami was \\"a brute of a horse, a huge and stocky animal\\". He was sired by Crash Course who won the Doncaster Cup and became a successful National Hunt stallion: his other progeny included Rough Quest, Esha Ness and Maid of Money (Irish Grand National). Eamon Phelan sold Jodami as a foal, but bought him back three years later and returned him to Ballinanaogue for another year before sending him to the Tattersalls sales where the horse was sold for IR¬£12,500. He was later purchased privately by the Yorkshire based trainer Peter Beaumont on behalf of John Yeadon. The exact price was not made public, but according to Beaumont, \\"he wasn't dear (expensive) at all\\". Beaumont trained the horse at his Foulrice Farm stable at Brandsby near York. Beaumont had originally established himself as a trainer on the amateur point-to-point circuit and at the time of Jodami's greatest success his stable housed approximately twenty horses. Yeadon named the horse after himself and his two sons: the names of John, David and Michael combining to make \\"Jodami\\". Racing career =1990-1992: early career= Jodami began his racing career as a 5 year old by running in National Hunt flat races or \\"bumpers\\"; race designed for National Hunt-bred horses who lack the maturity to compete over obstacles. He won on his debut at Kelso as a 33/1 outsider before finishing fifth at Aintree and second at Ayr. In all three of his bumpers, he was ridden by Peter Beaumont's daughter, Anthea Farrell. The Aintree race was the last time that Jodami would finish a race in lower than third place for five years. After his run at Ayr, Jodami did not appear on the racecourse for nine months. Jodami returned in January 1991 to compete in novice hurdle races and over the next three months he won five of his six races, ridden by Beaumont's son-in-law Patrick Farrell. Most of his wins were in minor races at tracks in Scotland and Northern England but on his final appearance he carried 151 pounds to a twelve-length victory in a novice handicap at Ayr in which his opponents included the Mersey Novices' Hurdle winner Shannon Glen. In the 1991/1992 season, Jodami began to compete over larger obstacles as he ran in novice chases. He won minor events at Kelso in November and January and was then stepped up in class for the Grade II West of Scotland Novices' Chase at Ayr. Starting the 11/8 favourite, he made several jumping errors but won by three lengths from the Stayers' Hurdle winner King's Curate. Eleven days later, Jodami raced in the South of England for the first time when he started odds on favourite for the Reynoldstown Novices' Chase at Ascot Racecourse. His unbeaten run of seven races came to an end as he jumped erratically and was beaten fifteen lengths by Danny Harrold. He was beaten in his two remaining novice chases, but showed better form when finishing second to Bradbury Star at Aintree and third behind Second Schedual[sic] when carrying top weight at Punchestown. =1992/1993 season: Gold Cup campaign= Jodami's first race against experienced chasers came at Haydock Park in November 1992, when he finished second to Run For Free in the Edward Hanmer Chase a race in which he was ridden for the first time by Mark Dwyer. Run For Free went on to win the Welsh National and the Scottish Grand National later that season. He then started favourite for the British Hennessy Cognac Gold Cup Handicap Chase at Newbury Racecourse, in which his opponents included The Fellow and Party Politics, and finished second, beaten three quarters of a length by Sibton Abbey. Jodami returned to Newbury in January and recorded his first success of the season in the Mandarin Handicap Chase, carrying top weight of 168 pounds to a two and a half length win over Esha Ness. After the race he was identified as a potential Gold Cup winner, and Beaumont reported that the Jodami's owner had turned down several \\"tempting\\" offers for the horse. Two weeks later, Jodami and Run For Free met again in the Peter Marsh Chase at Haydock, where the field also included the Grade I winner Gold Options and the course specialist Twin Oaks, who had won eight steeplechases at the track. Dwyer tracked Run For Free before challenging at the last fence, and Jodami took the lead in the closing stages to win by two lengths. In February, Jodami was sent to Leopardstown Racecourse for the Hennessy Gold Cup a race which as well as being one of Ireland's major weight-for-age prizes, also serves as an important trial for the Cheltenham Gold Cup. The race was dominated by the two British challengers, with Jodami prevailing by a head from the Martin Pipe-trained Chatam. After the race Beaumont expressed the view that Jodami was likely to improve further before the following month's Gold Cup and identified The Fellow as his horse's principal rival. At Cheltenham on 18 March, Jodami started at odds of 8/1 for the Gold Cup, making him the joint second favourite of the sixteen runners, but there appeared to be little confidence behind the horse, as his odds had drifted out from 4/1 on the morning of the race. The Fellow started favourite and the field also included Sibton Abbey, Run For Free and Chatam as well as the previous winners Garrison Savannah and Cool Ground. Dwyer restrained Jodami in the early stages before moving up to join the leaders on the second circuit. Over the last two fences the race resolved into a struggle between Jodami and Rushing Wild, a former hunter and point-to-pointer. Jodami overtook his rival just after the last obstacle and stayed on strongly to win by two lengths, becoming the first Northern-trained winner since The Thinker in 1987. The Independent described the performance as a display of \\"awesome power\\" and Dwyer confidently predicted that Jodami would win the race again. =1993-1997: later career= Jodami took time to reach his best form in the 1993/1994 season. On his debut at Wetherby racecourse he fell for the only time in his career and then had to be driven out record a narrow success over Cab On Target in the Edward Hanmer Chase. He then started 2/7 favourite for the Rehearsal Chase at Chepstow but was beaten twelve lengths into third by Party Politics, before finishing third again, behind Zeta's Lad and Run For Free in the Peter Marsh Chase. At Leopardsown, however, Jodami re-established himself as one of the best chasers as he won the Hennessy Gold Cup for a second time, beating Deep Bramble by seven lengths. Despite his inconsistent form, Jodami started 6/4 favourite for the 1994 Cheltenham Gold Cup on 17 March. Dwyer employed tactics similar to those employed in 1993, but despite finishing strongly Jodami was unable to catch The Fellow and finished second, beaten one and a half lengths. Dwyer admitted that he was beaten by a better horse on the day, commenting that he was \\"fighting a losing battle\\" in the closing stages. Jodami again ran disappointingly in the early part of the following season. He unseated Dwyer at Haydock before being pitted against the six-year-old One Man in an anticipated race for the Rowland Meyrick Chase at Wetherby. The event proved anticlimactic as One Man unseated Tony Dobbin at the fifth-last fence and Jodami falling two fences later. He was remounted to finish a distant second to the surprise winner Cogent. The highlight of Jodami's season came at Leopardstown where he won his third Hennessy Gold Cup, beating the Irish seven-year-old Merry Gale by three lengths. In this race he rallied on the flat to overtake the younger horse after looking beaten at the last fence. Dwyer received a seven-day ban for excessive use of the whip in the closing stages. At Cheltenham, Jodami looked impressive before the race but failed to cope with the exceptionally heavy ground and finished eighth behind Master Oats in the Gold Cup. Jodami won one race (at Kelso) from five starts in his 1995/1996 campaign. At the end of the season he ran two notable races in defeat in two of the year's most valuable handicaps. In April he carried 166 pounds when second in the Irish Grand National and a month later he ran fourth under 168 pounds in the Whitbread Gold Cup. Jodami began his final season by finishing second to The Grey Monk at Ayr in November. He appeared to be in decline, but his last two races, in early 1997 showed that he was still competitive at the highest level at the age of twelve. In January, he conceded weight to his five rivals in the Peter Marsh Chase and won by a neck from Unguided Missile, a victory which saw him made favourite for the Grand National. A month later he contested the Hennessy Gold Cup for the fourth and last time. Ridden by Norman Williamson, he finished second, three lengths behind Danoli and twenty ahead of Imperial Call in third. The performance was achieved despite the fact that Jodami broke down in the closing stages and finished lame. Examinations revealed a ruptured tendon in his right foreleg, bringing an end to his racing career. Retirement Jodami spent his retirement at Beaumont's stable. He took part in hunting and spent most of his time acting as a companion for young horses at Brandsby- \\"nannying the babies\\" in Beaumont's words. Jodami died on 1 December 2008 at the age of twenty-three after being injured in his stable. Assessment and honours Timeform rated Jodami's Gold Cup win as the best performance in the race since Burrough Hill Lad's victory in 1984. In their book, A Century of Champions, based on the Timeform rating system, John Randall and Tony Morris rated Jodami an \\"average\\" Gold Cup winner.

Tens of mostly abandoned buildings were decorated by international artists in the period 5‚Äì21 July 2012, culminating in a grand opening and a guided town tour attended by hundreds. Finnmarken: Fiskerens gudinne ble til kunst The event was curated by noted Norwegian urban artist P√∏bel.

Traditionally a vibrant fishing community, the town's population halved between the 1960s and 2000s. As per 2012, depopulation had balanced out and Vard√∏ had 2,122 inhabitants. Statistics Norway (Statistisk sentralbyr√•) Because of the population decline, Vard√∏ was left with many empty buildings in various stages of disrepair. P√∏bel wanted to organize a larger scale continuation of the \\"Getto spedalsk\\" (\\"Ghetto leperous\\") project, where he and collaborator Dolk painted abandoned buildings in at the Lofoten islands. After securing the cooperation of local developers in spring 2012, the project started getting permission from individual property owners to decorate buildings. The name \\"Komafest\\" plays on the notion of the houses being roused from their sleep by the activity. Finnmarken: Tar street art til verdens ende The festival Although substantial financing had been secured from, among others, the Northern Norway Artists' Centre, much of the daily activity relied on volunteer work and free use of privately owned heavy equipment, including lifts and cranes. \\"P√∏bel\\" himself insisted the festival was as much about the locals and the town as it was the art, saying he hoped that the festival would be a catalyst for renovation and increased enthusiasm for local history.

Plot summary Disillusioned by Britain, wealthy youth Oliver Chant is sent abroad to Trier (Germany) by UK Communist leader Kurtz. Kurtz had been exiled to Britain by Trier's new dictator Demassener and promised Oliver Chant that he'd be part of a dramatic rebellion. Chant arrives in Trier with orders to meet up with the underground party run by a Jewish poet, Joseph Kapper and comrades Torner (an artist) and Lintz (a shoe maker). It becomes apparent that the small faction are not interested in bloodshed, but spreading dissent against the Dictator only by literature and posters. By a strange turn of events the dictator's wife, Anne-Marie Demassener, enters the party's quarters seeking help from a minor car accident. She claims that her husband is more than aware of what these men do and isn't in the least concerned. Oliver Chant is invited to meet her husband that night, where he witnesses the mother of an executed gun runner come pleading for her son's body. Over the course of the evening Chant becomes infatuated with the dictator's wife. He heads back after the town's curfew, and after being cornered by local police is rescued by the poet Kapper, who shoots the policeman dead in the street. Kapper and Chant dispose of the body in the canal and then send Kapper's wife out with a tray of raw butcher's meat to spread over the area where the murder took place. In the morning Kapper and Chant argue over the murder, and further conflict arises when Kapper shows him the party's next propaganda poster which is a slur on the dictator's wife. Chant vows to leave the group and the country. He visits Anne-Marie Demassener to bid farewell and to declare his love for her. During his visit the owner of a canal boat enters, and tells her of the murdered policeman he fished out of the river. Anne-Marie presumes Chant is involved and tells him to leave the country; he proposes that she come with him, which (though unhappy herself) she mockingly rejects. Chant vows to stay on in Trier and try and fight for her. He goes back and, overruling a humiliated Kapper, leads the party on a planned rebellion. Chant arranges for a risky liaison to smuggle in arms by canal boat. Anne-Marie is destined to interfere with his plans again, making him question the motive for his involvement and giving Kapper an opportunity to lead the party to success by other means. Repudiation In his autobiography Ways of Escape Greene spoke of this book and its subsequent repudiation: > My second and third novels, The Name of Action and Rumour at Nightfall, > published in 1930 and 1931, can now be found, I am glad to think, only in > secondhand bookshops at an exaggerated price, since some years after their > publication I suppressed them.

He had considerable early success in restoring law and order in Ireland, which was no doubt the reason for his appointment as Justiciar, but he was recalled to England after the military situation deteriorated. He was later re-appointed to the office of Justiciar, and returned to Ireland to take up office, but died soon afterwards. Background  The Rokebys were a prominent landowning family from Mortham in North Yorkshire; Thomas was probably the son of Thomas de Rokeby, who died in 1318 (some sources name his father as Alexander).Kingsford, Charles Lethbridge ‚Äì \\"Sir Thomas de Rokeby\\" ‚Äì Dictionary of National Biography 1885‚Äì1900 Vol. 49 p.152 His nephew, also named Thomas, was closely associated with him in his later years and the elder Thomas was often called \\"l'oncle\\" to distinguish him from his nephew. It was almost certainly the nephew, not the uncle, who was the grandfather of the second Sir Thomas de Rokeby, who died sometime after 1423.Kingsford p.152 Service in Scotland Rokeby first came to public attention in 1327 when, after his return from having been a prisoner in Scotland, he received the thanks of the new King Edward III for being the squire who had first pointed out the approach of the Scots army during the incursion of the previous July. As a reward he was knighted and given lands worth ¬£100 a year.Kingsford p.152 He saw action against the Scots regularly between 1336 and 1342 and had charge of Stirling Castle and Edinburgh Castle while they were held by the English. He was High Sheriff of Yorkshire 1342‚Äì1349. He was one of the English commanders at the Battle of Neville's Cross, and it was said, \\"gave the Scots such a draught as they did not care to taste again\\".Kingsford p.152 He was then entrusted with bringing King David II of Scotland as a captive to London, and he received further grants of land as a reward for his good services. Justiciar of Ireland In 1349 he was appointed Justiciar of Ireland, and given a large armed retinue to accompany him, as it was recognised by the English Crown that \\"Ireland is not in good plight or good peace\\". He arrived in December and made a quick circuit of the south of Ireland, mainly to keep watch on the troublesome magnate Maurice FitzGerald, 1st Earl of Desmond.Otway-Ruthven , A.J. History of Medieval Ireland Reprinted Barnes and Noble 1993 p.277 =Administrative reforms= Rokeby was praised by his contemporaries for his regard for justice and his zeal in checking extortion by Crown officials. He undertook what has been called a general overhaul of the Irish administration, aimed particularly at the detection of corruption and the removal of incompetent officials.Otway-Ruuthven p.278 Arguably he showed excessive zeal in arresting the Treasurer of Ireland, Robert de Emeldon, a man who enjoyed the King's personal regard.Gilbert, Sir John History of the Viceroys of Ireland Dublin J.Duffy and Co. 1865 p.205 Admittedly the charges against Emeldon were very serious, including rape, robbery and manslaughter, but Rokeby must have known that the King, out of regard for their long friendship, had already pardoned Emeldon for killing one Ralph de Byrton, a knight, in 1336. Emeldon was once more pardoned and quickly released. In November 1351 Rokeby held a Great Council at Kilkenny. It dealt partly with the problem of official corruption already described, partly with the problem of defence of the Pale, and partly with the question of intermarriage and other close contacts between the Anglo-Irish and the Old Irish. Otway-Ruthven notes that little of the legislation was new, apart from the application to Ireland of the English Statute of Labourers of 1351, and that much of it was repeated in the later Statutes of Kilkenny of 1366.Otway- Ruthven p.278 =Military campaigns= In 1353 the Clan MacCarthy of Muskerry, the dominant clan in central County Cork, who had until then been loyal to the English Crown, rebelled. Rokeby showed considerable skill in crushing the uprising and succeeded in replacing the rebellious head of the clan, Dermot MacCarthy, with his more compliant cousin Cormac. Cormac's descendants gained great wealth, extensive lands and the title Earl of Clancarty.Otway-Ruthven p.279 This promising state of good order did not last long: a rebellion by the O'Byrne Clan of Wicklow in 1354 was followed by a general uprising headed by the MacMurrough-Kavanagh dynasty. Although Muirchearteach MacMurrough- Kavanagh, who was styled King of Leinster, was captured and executed, Rokeby suffered several military defeats. He was unable to overcome the O'Byrnes in Wicklow, and other risings took place in Tipperary, Kildare and Ulster.Otway- Ruthven p. 280 Recall and last years Rokeby was now an ageing and discouraged man, and in 1355 it was decided to recall him. His replacement, rather surprisingly, was that Earl of Desmond whom it had been one of his main tasks to keep in check. Desmond died a year later on 26 July 1356. Rokeby was reappointed Justiciar, and returned to Ireland, only to die soon afterwards at Kilkea Castle.Otway-Ruthven p.282 Kilkea Castle, Rokeby's Irish stronghold, where he died in 1356 or 1357. Character Rokeby was a popular and respected figure in Ireland: he was described as \\"one who paid well for his victuals, and did not rob the poor\\" (i.e. he did not abuse the much criticized system of purveyance, the forcible requisition of foodstuffs from the public)Kingsford p.152 The citizens of Cork, protesting at his recall, referred to his \\"evident good work\\" in maintaining law and order. Otway- Ruthven contrasts his early successes with his disappointing later record, and notes that the 1350s were seen as the crucial decade in which the English Crown lost control of much of Ireland until the sixteenth century.Otway- Ruthven p.277 References People from Barnard Castle 1356 deaths Norman warriors 14th-century Irish politicians 14th-century Irish people Year of birth unknown Justiciars of Ireland Lords Lieutenant of Ireland ","title":"Thomas de Rokeby (died 1356)"},{"id":"36575760","text":"The Kosciuszko Road is a road in the Snowy Mountains of New South Wales, Australia which runs from , to the ski resort of .

All types included a major transfer of furs and goods to be traded for furs. Variations included a mix of other types of trading, business transactions, business meetings and revelry.  In canoe- based fur trade areas  Shooting the Rapids, 1871 by Frances Anne Hopkins (1838‚Äì1919) One type of rendezvous is associated with the voyageur & canoe- based fur trade business which was largely in Canada.

Such a rendezvous might include several fur trading companies, and array of fur traders, mountain men and native Americans.Bernard DeVoto Across the Wide Missouri Houghton Mifflin Company ‚Äì Boston 1947 A substantial amount of deal-making and trading occurred at these rendezvous. These were often a temporary \\"town\\" of sorts with businesses which offered the fur trade workers and participants ways to spend their money on supplies and revelry. The emblematic type was a large annual rendezvous held in the Rocky mountains from 1825 until 1840. One of the largest of these was the Rendezvous of 1832. Much of the attendance of these consisted of mountain men who were fur trade participants who were experienced at living in the mountain back country. The syndicated television anthology series Death Valley Days offered a 1958 episode, \\"The Big Rendezvous\\" about the 1825 gathering. Peter Walker (born 1927) was cast as the historical Kit Carson, Gardner McKay as the villainous Pierre Shunar, and Iron Eyes Cody as a trapper. Laurie Carroll (born 1933) was cast as the young Indian woman, Waa-Nibe, for whom Carson is smitten. The 1980 Western The Mountain Men (1980), starring Charlton Heston and Brian Keith, featured the rendezvous of 1838 and 1839.

With the Romanian team he was European champion in 2006, World champion in 2009 and Olympic team silver medal in 2012.  Personal life  Dumitrescu discovered fencing at age ten by circumstance: his mother, a teacher, had a pupil whose father was a fencing coach. He began training at his local club CS Tractorul under CƒÉtƒÉlin Albu, who also served as sparring partner in the absence of other sabre fencers in Bra»ôov: the Olympic center was in Ia»ôi. He was also frustrated by a lack of money: his parents had to pay for his travel expenses and entrance fees when he began competition. He did not have dedicated fencing shoes either and wore out dozens of ordinary trainers on the piste. The hard training regimen almost made him quit fencing when he was in high school, but he persevered and transferred in 2003 to CS Dinamo Bucure»ôti. Dumitrescu graduated in 2006 from the Faculty of physical education and sport of the Transilvania University of Bra»ôov and earned in 2008 a master's degree in marketing and sport management from the Alexandru Ioan Cuza University in Ia»ôi. He married in 2009 his high school girlfriend.  Career  Dumitrescu (L) during the team men's sabre final at the 2012 Summer Olympics Dumitrescu earned his first major title in 2005 with a team bronze medal at the European Championships in Zalaegerszeg. In March 2006 he got on the podium for the first time in a World Cup event with a silver medal in Athens. He also won the European Champion Clubs' Cup with CS Dinamo. A few months later he earned a team gold medal at the European Championships in Izmir. In 2008 Dumitrescu won his first World Cup title in Madrid. He made his Olympic debut in the Beijing Games, but was eliminated in the table of 16 by France's Julien Pillet. He was again tempted to retire because he was tired of commuting between Bra»ôov and Bucharest, but his former teammate Mihai Covaliu, now coach of the national team, persuaded him to go on. In 2009 he won two World Cup stages in Budapest and Warsaw. He was eliminated early in the individual event of the European Championships in Plovdiv, but took the silver medal with Romania. At the World Championships in Antalya he made his way to the final, where he was defeated by Germany's Nicolas Limbach and took the silver medal. He was noted for his ‚Äúfighting spirit and his intelligence‚Äù as well as his technical progress. In the team event Romania created an upset by beating favourites Germany, France and Hungary to meet Italy in the final. Dumitrescu entered for the last bout on 40‚Äì34 for Italy and beat Aldo Montano 11‚Äì4 to win Romania their first World gold medal in sabre. Dumitrescu finished the 2008‚Äì09 season number two in FIE rankings. For this performance he was granted the title of master emeritus in sport. At the men's sabre competition at the 2012 Summer Olympics Dumitrescu was beaten in the match for the third place by Nikolay Kovalev and missed the podium, but won a silver medal in the team sabre event. He retired after the Games to become a coach at CS Dinamo.

Knight of the Order of Leopold, he was the founder and conductor of the choral chamber ensembles Soci√©t√© Symphonique and R√©union Lyrique in Belgium. Biography Delphine Ugalde as B√©atrix in Armand Limnander van Nieuwenhovens opera The Montenegrins. Born to a family who formerly belonged to the bar of the late Council of Flanders, ennobled in 1683, Armand Limnander van Nieuwenhoven was raised in the village of Malines.

(2009), From the Clarinet D'Amour to the Contra Bass: A History of Large Size Clarinets, 1740-1860, p. 373, Oxford University Press, From 1838 to 1847 he conducted with great distinction the direction of an amateur choral society entitled R√©union Lyrique composed of 25 members, for which he wrote a number of musical pieces for male voices and which eventually came to establish his reputation in festivals and competitions. In 1845, prompted by the desire to work for the stage, he left for Paris. The following year he performed at the chateau des Tuileries, in the presence of King Louis Philippe I, three choir excerpts from his Sc√®nes druidiques with orchestral accompaniment under the direction of Daniel Auber. In 1847 Limnander decided to settle in the French capital, where his dramas and lyrical operas such as The Montenegrins (1848), by librettists G√©rard de Nerval and Jules-√âdouard Alboize de Pujol, which premiered there on 31 March the following year, was very well received along with his Le Ch√¢teau de la Barbe-Bleue (1851). In the course of 1853 the composer was working on two books, one for the Opera House and the other to the Op√©ra-Comique of Paris. The first of these pieces Le Maitre √† Chanter, a grand opera in two acts set to a libretto of Henri Trianon, choreographed by Joseph Mazilier, successfully premiered at the Academy of Music on 17 October 1853. His opera Yvonne (1859), set to a libretto by Eug√®ne Scribe, premiered at the Theatre de l'Op√©ra-Comique on 29 November 1859 and was also well received. His religious music is composed of a Te Deum, performed in 1845 on the anniversary of the avencement to the throne of King Leopold, a Requiem, written in honor of the citizens killed in the upheaval of 1830 and performed in Brussels in September 1852, the Stabat Mater La Messe de minuit, performed by the choir Harmonie √† Bruxelles in April 1853, during the political majority of Prince Leopold, Duke of Brabant, and a national song for full orchestra with text by Andr√© Henri Constant van Hasselt, written for the celebration of the national festivities in Brussels in 1855.

It was published by Atlus for Microsoft Windows, PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360 in 2013. The game is a direct sequel and features the same characters and setting as the first. It continues the story of Ghat, Rimat, and Father-Mother.  Plot  The game begins with the first game's protagonist, Ghat, meeting with his antagonistic sister Rimat in a bar. Since the events of the last game, the Northern Golem has established the rule of law in the previously lawless city of Halstedom. After law was established the Golem promptly arrested Ghat and Rimat's single parent, the creature named Father-Mother, for the crime of serial kidnapping. While Rimat is furious and wants revenge against the Golem for the arrest of Father-Mother, Ghat is a true anarchist and has come to hate the Golem for taking away Halstedom's freedom and wants to kill him to restore it. Regardless of their different motives, this shared anger at the Northern Golem leads them to set aside their differences. Together they enter the newly built prison and free Father-Mother. But by doing so, they end up in the middle of a conflict between the authoritarian Northern Golem and the laissez faire but cruel Southern Golem. To free their city from the tyranny of the seemingly invincible Northern Golem, they must journey through all of Zenozoik to find a method capable of killing their near immortal overlord, even if it means playing right into the Southern Golem's plans. Along the way, Ghat and Rimat will discover the secret past of their mysterious planet.  Gameplay  Much like the previous game, Zeno Clash 2 is a first person brawler centered around melee combat. New is the ability to individually punch with each fist, use an array of special weapons that range from a simple chain to a glove that links enemy health together, and a semi open world instead of the mission based system of the first game. Zeno Clash 2 features a multiplayer game mode, in contrast to the first game which was only single-player. The game also includes multiple forms of Arena modes which were included in the last game, and one of these Arena modes lets you play as the Rock from Rock of Ages.  Development  Zeno Clash 2 was released on April 30, 2013, 4 years after the original. A demo for the game was released 6 days before the game itself.  Reception  Zeno Clash 2 was met with mixed reviews, with the PC version receiving a rating of 61/100 on reviews aggregator Metacritic. The most favourable rating by nowgamer says the game bests its predecessor, praising the \\"sumptuous looking and stylish\\" world and \\"excellent\\" combat system but noting that Zeno Clash 2 may \\"obviously not be for everyone, and its low budget does show through.\\" Other critics praise the artwork and characters but cite various flaws and most seem to agree that the game fell behind in comparison to the first game. Destructoid said \\"Zeno Clash II might be bigger than its predecessor, but it fails to be truly better.\\"  References   External links  * 2013 video games Action role-playing video games Atlus games Beat 'em ups Fantasy video games First-person shooters Indie video games Multiplayer and single-player video games PlayStation 3 games PlayStation Network games Role-playing video games Unreal Engine games Video games developed in Chile Video games featuring female protagonists Video game sequels Windows games Xbox 360 games Xbox 360 Live Arcade games ","title":"Zeno Clash 2"},{"id":"36576009","text":"Olga Sergeyevna Zabelinskaya (also transliterated Zabelinskaia; ; born 10 May 1980) is a Russian-born Uzbekistani professional racing cyclist, who currently rides for UCI Women's Continental Team .

But at the same time, it warns, sometimes, a certain monotony, excessive rhetoric, with consequent abrupt interruptions retakes, disjunctions, etc. Through its pages the text shows a peculiar mix of Aristotelian influence and Neoplatonic Sufi mysticism, and an overview of the most important doctrines of the science of antiquity, including for instance, the logic of Aristotle. Structure The treatise is divided into a prologue, wrote perhaps one of his disciples, which explains the origin of the correspondence, the answer to the four philosophical questions raised by Frederick II of Hohenstaufen, an Appendix referred to several issues, and finally, an epilogue. These parts are of variable length and are subdivided, in turn, into several sections. Given, then, that its structure is as follows: *A. Preface of the work **1.

Epilogue of the work As usual in medieval Arabic treatises, and how could it be otherwise, if we take into account the rich and highly educated of Ibn Sab'in, in the Sicilian Questions the author quotes from other writers, especially those in the classical antiquity; among them are, for example, Plato's Phaedrus and especially those belonging to the logic of Aristotle, as the most relevant. Similarly, and for the same reason, it makes frequent references to ancient philosophers and thinkers to a greater extent, but also to his fellow followers of other faiths and representatives of the most varied theories and doctrines, explained or simply commented on the work, which make it a rich melting pot of scientific knowledge to justify the time and interest in it. Among all these philosophers, he notes, the volume of citations is made on his thought and his writings, Aristotle, which is really central to the treaty and the Andalusian mystic most often named as the Wise (al-Hakim) and the Man (al-Rayul). Other important philosophers and thinkers in the Sicilian Questions referred to are, in alphabetical order, Alexander of Aphrodisias, Anaxagoras, Berossus, Crates, Diogenes, Euclid, al- Farabi, Galen, al-Ghazali, al-Hallaj, Ibn Bajja (Avempace), Ibn Sina (Avicenna), Iamblichus, Parmenides, Pythagoras, Plato, Socrates, Themistius, Theophrastus and Zeno of Elea. The masterful character of the work lies at the confluence of all these philosophical currents which combine great diversity of theories and beliefs.

H. Campbell, ‚ÄòGarbett, Samuel (1717‚Äì1803)‚Äô, Oxford Dictionary of National Biography, Oxford University Press, 2004 accessed 29 July 2012) was a prominent citizen of Birmingham England, during the industrial revolution, and a friend of Matthew Boulton. Historian Carl Chinn argues that he: Garbett's education extended: Garbett was employed by a London merchant named Hollis, as his agent for purchasing goods in Birmingham. In that role, he came: He married Anne Clay (d. 1772) of Aston in August 1735. He then made his fortune as a merchant in his own right, before entering partnership with Dr John Roebuck to set up a laboratory in Steelhouse Lane where precious metals were refined and assayed; a manufacturing centre for sulphuric acid in Prestonpans in 1749; and, with others, the Carron Iron Works, in Scotland, in 1760, in which the two Birmingham men each held a 25% share. He also chaired, from January 1788, a Birmingham committee against the slave trade. His eldest child and only daughter Mary married Charles Gascoigne in 1759, and in 1765 Gascoigne became a partner in the Carron works, having been manager of Garbett's nearby turpentine factory, Garbett & Co., since 1763. Garbett was involved in the creation of Birmingham Assay Office in 1773, and was the first chairman of Birmingham's Commercial Committee, forerunner of successive Birmingham Chambers of Commerce, as was a member of the committee that raised funds to create Birmingham General Hospital. He was declaredbankrupt in 1782. Boulton encouraged him to re-establish his business in Birmingham, which he did successfully. At his death in 1803, his estate was over ¬£12,000, albeit with some creditors not discharged. He was buried at St Philip's Church (later Birmingham's cathedral), where he had been a church warden. Matthew Boulton wrote of him: Throughout his life, Garbett played a prominent part in local politics and affairs, including police proposals and the development of Birmingham's canals.John Money, Experience and identity, Birmingham and the West Midlands 1760-1800 (Manchester, 1977). During the Birmingham riots of 1791, it was at his house in Newhall Street that the town and country gentry held their emergency meetings.TNA HO 42/19/109. His political lobbying in general, and correspondence with Shelburne in particular, make him a significant figure in national politics.John Money, op.cit.; John Norris, Shelburne and reform (London, 1963); T M Norris, \\"Samuel Garbett and the early development of industrial lobbying in Great Britain,\\" The Economic History Review, 10(3) (1958), 450-460.

It had a magnitude of 6.7 on the moment magnitude scale and a maximum perceived intensity of IX (Violent) on the Mercalli intensity scale. The epicentre was in the province of Fars in southern Iran. The earthquake caused the destruction of Qir and serious damage to towns and villages in the surrounding area. The estimated number of deaths is 5,374, with a further 1,710 injured. Tectonic setting The earthquake occurred in the Fars Domain of the Zagros fold and thrust belt, which forms part of the collisional zone between the Arabian Plate and the Eurasian Plate. The Fars Domain lies at the southeastern end of the Zagros and is part of the 'simply folded belt', which is characterised by detachment folding over the late Neoproterozoic to Early Cambrian Hormuz salt layer. Most earthquakes have epicenters beneath the salt layer and are thought to represent reverse faulting in the underlying basement, possibly involving the reactivation of older rift faults. Earthquake The earthquake is thought to have been caused by rupture along a WNW-ESE trending reverse fault. The focal mechanism suggests that the reverse fault is moderately-dipping to either south or north. The earthquake was preceded by a series of foreshocks in March 1972, which caused some of the inhabitants of Hingam and Karzin to move out of their houses. Damage Zagros fold and thrust belt Initial casualty reports (compiled on April 28, 1972) showed that there were 3,399 deaths in Qir (two-thirds of the population), with a further 889 injured. There were 400 deaths in Gavakei (almost half of the population) and a further 300 in Bian (a third of the population) and 150 in Sekehravan (about a quarter of the population). The total number of deaths based on initial reports was 5,374 with a further 1,710 injured. The methods of construction used in that affected area led to the high levels of damage. Most buildings were built of adobe brick with a relatively heavy flat roof of thick date palm beams resting directly on the brick walls. The addition of layers of mud and straw for waterproofing increased the load on the walls. These structures have a very low resistance to earthquake shaking and most of the deaths occurred due to the collapse of such buildings. More modern types of construction generally fared little better, as they were not properly engineered and lacked many of the elements that would have made them more resistant. Even some of the engineered buildings were badly damaged due to poor design and construction techniques, such as a lack of anchoring between the steel roof I-beams and the reinforced concrete tie-beams on which they rested. One structure, the Shahabad bridge that was well-engineered and constructed using modern techniques, was almost undamaged, compared to the adobe houses in a neighbouring village, all of which collapsed. The earthquake caused damage to qanats (water tunnels), with the destruction of 180 wells. The flow of some springs was disrupted.

It was founded in 2009 by Sitashwa Srivastava and Manik Kinra. The company is headquartered in Bangalore, India and has white label partnerships in Qatar as Mixilion and in Singapore as id8on. Jade Magnet crowdsources design requirements for marketing campaigns (logos, websites, brochures, print ads, animation videos) to freelancers, professionals, small agencies and technology from teams across the world. Initially established as an open crowdsourcing platform, Jade Magnet moved to a \\"managed crowdsourcing\\" model in 2013 wherein the company curates teams of designers from the crowd to provide solutions to its clients‚Äô. It offers delivery assurance to its clients and handles the full project management, payments and legal contracts of crowdsourced output. Crowdsourcing gives businesses the option of choosing from multiple design possibilities, while at the same time, creates money- making opportunities for those with a creative bent-of-mind and a technology background. Businesses sourcing marketing and design requirements from Jade Magnet get to select from multiple designs submitted by different designers or \\"providers\\" to whom the task gets posted as a contest. In this way, the platform enables customers to extract multiple options for creative solutions before making a final selection. Crowdsourcing designers also makes available a larger pool of the best available talent from among freelancers, who would otherwise not be available within a single organisation or agency. Designers can apply to become providers on the Jade Magnet network, and are then invited participate in live internal contests the ones that are of interest to them. Jade Magnet also sources designers and artists by visiting art schools and design colleges where there is a ready community willing to participate in any invitation for crowdsourcing ideas. Providers who perform well on projects and receive good customer feedback can become Jade Magnet Champions, which ensures them a steady stream of projects. Jade Magnet has developed a community engagement system for all providers (students, moonlighters, small agencies and freelancers), offering introductory skill appraisals, appraisal and accreditation based on client feedback and opportunities for creative skill enhancement. Some Jade Magnet providers are based in tier-2 cities of India and make a living with work coming from the platform. Company history Jade Magnet was co-founded by Sitashwa Srivastava and Manik Kinra, who were classmates at the Great Lakes Institute of Management. The company was born out of their idea to develop a crowdsourcing platform, based on the notion that solutions coming from a physically disconnected world could still serve business needs if channelled properly. The idea behind establishing the company was to tap the market space comprising millions of small and medium businesses around the world which need creative support in their marketing campaigns but are unable to work with large creative agencies due to budget constraints. Crowdsourcing could cater to the needs of all such businesses on a single platform, bridging the gap between small businesses that could not afford big agency fee, and freelancers who are always looking for creative freedom and opportunity. Also, there was an opportunity to work for large and mature businesses in search of new creative ideas for their marketing campaigns and willing to experiment with more people than traditional agencies can provide. There's a case study being written on why the business after scaling up couldn't reach the next level by professors in Great Lakes Institute of Management. The founders, Sitashwa has moved on to do startup in financial services vertical called Stockal while Manik has started a venture in Real Estate Space called Pin Click =Contest Based Platform= Under a pilot program for testing the business model by the name of creADivity, the founders brought on-board 45 providers and got their first five customers. In July 2008, creADivity got selected for The Indus Entrepreneurs‚Äô (TiE) Entrepreneurial Acceleration Program (EAP), which selects one or two startup companies every year and assists in funding, mentoring and networking to support them. The program provides role models in successful entrepreneurs, and helps with the support required by early-stage entrepreneurs. Joining the TiE Program also helped Manik and Sitashwa raise initial seed funding, with the help of which they launched the platform, rebranded by the name of Jade Magnet, on 15 October 2009. The name was changed from CreADivity since it was observed that people found it difficult to pronounce the name and place the brand. The company's new name was derived from Jade ‚Äì a precious stone with sacred connotations in many cultures, and Magnet that signifies an ability to pull towards itself anything that comes close to it. The design of the company's logo itself was the result of a crowdsourcing exercise, where multiple designers created more than 15 design options. The logo that was finally chosen symbolises high-value by juxtaposing \\"a‚Äù and \\"g‚Äù together (\\"Ag\\" is the scientific name of silver), with the \\"g\\" falling slightly to represent the magnetic force of gravity. Under the contest ‚Äìbased platform, customers looking crowdsourced design requirements could register on the website and post a project. Jade Magnet set a minimum payout limit for categories of creative projects, below which market dynamics have shown that there are no takers for given tasks. Customers post projects for a budget above the pre-set minimum, 80% of which is paid out to the winning entry. Once the project was posted as a contest, it received a number of entries from providers registered on the platform. Customers then shortlisted up to five entries from these and made a final choice after any modifications. Providers looking to participate in design contests on the Jade Magnet platform registered on the website. Registered designers could participate in the projects of their interest and submit their work in response to the posted requirements. The client selected the design which was found most appropriate. In its first three years of establishment, Jade Magnet got on board around 8000 freelancers and small agencies in its network, delivered more than 2000 design and technology projects to nearly 1000 customers, and awarded about $650,000 as prize money to designers. =Managed Crowdsourcing = After trying out the open crowdsourcing model and a closed group delivery assurance for a few years, Jade Magnet moved to a Managed Crowdsourcing model in 2013, where they create teams of experts by bringing together the best providers. This helps get the best designs out as the first step from multiple designers and then work with the team to deliver the output to the client. Crowdsourcing thus helps businesses get access to a larger pool of the best available talent from among freelancers, who would otherwise not be available within a single organisation or agency. Joint ventures Mixilion logo = Mixilion = In September 2012, Jade Magnet entered the Middle East with a joint venture as Mixilion, which is headquartered in Doha (Qatar). Mixilion is the Middle East's first crowdsourcing platform and provides solutions to SMEs in the region using Jade Magnet's technology back end and a localised delivery assurance model. id8on logo = id8on = In October 2012, Jade Magnet entered into a joint venture with a technology firm in Singapore as id8on, with the help of which it expanded its operations in the Asia-Pacific (APAC) region. Products The creative marketing solutions provided by Jade Magnet include: *Logo/brand designs *Advertisements (banner ads for online campaigns, print ads for print campaigns and billboard ads for out-of-home campaigns) *Web design (basic websites, dynamic websites, microsites, prototypical platforms) *Brochure designs *Animation videos *Application UI *Digital marketing *Online Marketing (including search engine optimisation and social media marketing) *Template designs of other marketing collateral like newsletters, stationery, emailers, power point presentations and document templates Platform technology  The key to scaling the crowdsourcing business lies in automation of as many crowd- management processes as possible and Jade Magnet has created, executed, analysed and fine-tuned many such processes. Jade Magnet is built on the Symfony framework with a MySQL back-end. The platform is a cloud-hosted application at Amazon Web Services. Jade Magnet is building a new sales support and portfolio application that organises collateral designs by category and cost to enable Jade Magnet sales team and account managers close deals faster. It doubles up as a design showcase for provider portfolios at Jade Magnet.

Her film credits included Field of Dreams and Hoosiers. Persons served on the national board of directors of the Screen Actors Guild (SAG) from 1976‚Äì98. She also sat on SAG's Chicago Branch Council for 44 years and the AFTRA Chicago Local Board for more than thirty years. Much of her work at SAG and AFTRA focused on improving the professional acting opportunities for older actors. Life and career Fern Gwendolyn Ball was born in 1910 in Chicago, Illinois, and moved to Kalamazoo, Michigan as a young girl with her family. She earned a Bachelor of Arts in drama from Kalamazoo College in 1933. She later received a Bachelor of Fine Arts of acting from Carnegie Institute of Technology, now called Carnegie Mellon University in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. She graduated magna cum laude and Phi Beta Kappa from both colleges. She was also awarded the Otto Kahn Prize for excellence in acting at Carnegie. Ball met her future husband, Max Persons, while both were college students. They married in 1935. Once she graduated from Carnegie, Persons worked in Detroit in radio for a short period. The family, which now included a newborn daughter, then moved to Chicago so Persons could pursue her acting career in the latter half of the 1930s. Persons joined Screen Actors Guild (SAG) in 1937 and became the fifth member of the SAG Chicago Branch when she joined in 1953. She was elected to the Chicago Branch Council in 1962 and served for forty- four years until 2006, when she stepped down only because she could no longer drive. She also served more than thirty years on the AFTRA Chicago Local Board. Persons was elected to the SAG National Board in 1976, and served on that body until 1998. During that time, from 1977‚Äì81, she was elected SAG 5th national vice president. She served as a SAG Regional Branch Division representative on TV/Theatrical and Commercials negotiating committees throughout the 1980s and intermittently through the 1990s. Personal life Fern Ball married Max Persons in October 1935 and remained married for thirty- six years until his death in November 1971. On July 27, 1999, Chicago Mayor Richard Daley officially declared \\"Fern Persons Day\\" to mark her 89th birthday. The day honored her contributions to the Chicago arts and acting communities.

An area of 32 hectares is a biological Site of Special Scientific Interest. The name Riddlesdown also applies to the local district of residential housing. History Discoveries of Neolithic stone axes and possible traces of Iron Age fields show that occupation goes back thousands of years. The name Riddlesdown is first recorded in 1331 as Ridelsdoune meaning 'cleared woodland on a hill'. In medieval time Riddlesdown and the neighbouring Kenley Common formed part of the waste land of the manor of Watendone, and the commoners rights included pasture for their livestock and gathering of materials for fuel. In the nineteenth century the coming of the railways increased the value of the land, and the lord of the manor, Edmund Byron, began enclosing the area. One local landowner, William Hall, refused to sell his land to Byron, and in 1877 Hall and his brother brought a case against Byron in the Court of Chancery for encroaching on Common Land. They were successful, William Hall then asked the Corporation of London to purchase the land to preserve it as open space.

It was founded in May 2006 by the Principal, Martyn Percy as a research-led and consultancy body to work with the church, developing ecclesiology and practical theology that enables the church to develop its polity and praxis for mission and ministry. The Centre initially worked through appointing Research Fellows who were funded by external grants. Initial funded research projects included a detailed ethnographic survey of a midlands diocese in the Church of England, exploring the dynamics of mission and ministry; and a fully-funded evaluation of the ‚ÄòFresh Expressions‚Äô movement. The Centre‚Äôs first full-time Director was Dr Helen Cameron, appointed in 2007. The post was generously funded by a supporter and benefactor, who shared the vision of the Centre. Dr Cameron subsequently shaped the Centre as a focussed and dedicated research and consultancy body that sought to ‚Äòthink with the church‚Äô. The Centre now has a vision for developing the life and mission of the church by attending to God‚Äôs work in the world in order to develop faithful and reflective practice. People connect with the Centre to collaborate and engage in strategic thinking, to develop resources, to do research ‚Äì all with the aim of transforming practice. Dr Cameron was succeeded as Director by the Rt. Revd. Professor Stephen Pickard (interim Director, 2011). The current Director is the renowned missiologist, Dr Cathy Ross, originally from New Zealand. The Patrons of OxCEPT are The Rt. Revd John Pritchard, Bishop of Oxford and Dr Paula Gooder. Since its foundation in 2006, OxCEPT has generated over half a million pounds (GB) for research-led and consultancy-based initiatives with the churches, making it one of the most successful and high-profile bodies of its kind in theological education in the UK. OxCEPT‚Äôs approach is through praxis-based research, offering consultancy and producing publications. It helps people to network by bringing together parishes, dioceses, mission agencies and other faith-based organisations. It is intentionally ecumenical. The work is praxis- orientated as well as independent and constructively critical. In addition to the specific research at the local and national level, OxCEPT is thoroughly embedded in the wider research culture of Ripon College Cuddesdon, where there is a particular expertise in mission, ecclesiology, ecumenism, Anglicanism, and Biblical hermeneutics. Notable work undertaken by OxCEPT has included several research projects, including the report on Fresh Expressions commissioned by the Church Urban Fund which particularly focused on emerging forms of church in deprived communities. ARCS (Action Research in Church and Society) was jointly pioneered by OxCEPT and Heythrop College (University of London), one outcome of which was the ‚ÄòLiving Church in the Global City‚Äô report which investigated the mission outreach of the church and church- related groups. ‚ÄòSustaining Leaders in Mission and Change‚Äô was a significant report into the ministry and resourcing of Archdeacons in the Church of England. There has also been significant research into the spirituality of older people. OxCEPT also has a specialist interest in researching and resourcing chaplaincy practice, in all its manifestations, as well as highlighting its role in the church today. It also has a specialist interest in world Christianity and its significance for the church today. There are several strands to OxCEPT‚Äôs work besides the research that serves both the contemporary church and the academic sphere. It also aims to foster a vibrant learning and research community among the students at Ripon College Cuddesdon during their time in training and beyond. Consultancy work is also undertaken for churches, denominations, dioceses and mission agencies. This is usually a process by which a range of experts and some skilled researchers assist an individual, group or organisation to analyse and reflect upon their work. OxCEPT provides consultancy services and support to enable the church to reflect on practice. OxCEPT also helps with the professional development and continuing ministerial development of clergy, by fostering research capacity through offering sabbaticals, seminars and educational events. OxCEPT hosts regular public seminars at Ripon College Cuddesdon on issues of interest to students in training and the wider church. Theological Reflection (TR) is at the core of all OxCEPT‚Äôs research methods. This comprises a range of methods for investigating and supporting groups as they articulate their espoused theology, and compare it with their operant theology. This is currently being developed under the name of Theological Action Research (TAR).

Since this was the feast of Saint Romuald. he added the name Romuald to his own. He was ordained to the Roman Catholic priesthood at Li√®ge, Belgium, on Aug. 5, 1866. After his ordination, Reverend Byzewski became professor of philosophy and theology at the Franciscan seminary in ≈ÅƒÖki Bratia≈Ñskie, Poland.\\"Rev. Romuald Byzewski: An Advocate for the Polish People\\" by Sherlyn Meiers and Marty Byzewski i In 1875, at the height of the Kulturkampf, the Congregations Law was enacted, effectively forbidding Roman Catholic religious orders to operate within the Prussian Empire. Reverend Byzewski was consequently permitted to leave the Franciscans and emigrate to the United States, thereby becoming part of the Kaszubian diaspora. Reverend Byzewski arrived in New York on August 13, 1875, aboard the SS Mosel.http://immigrantships.net/IMMpictures/pixindex.html His first service in America was as pastor of Saint Stanislaus Kostka Parish in Winona, Minnesota. He served in this role until 1890, helped no doubt by his Kashubian heritage in a city which came to be known as the \\"Kashubian Capital of America.\\" He established a school for the parish, brought in the School Sisters of Notre Dame to teach there, and served as a capable intermediary between the English-speaking majority and the bumptious Kaszubian Poles. As a stalwart supporter of the Polish Roman Catholic Union of America he also established the newspaper Wiarus, which quickly became the United States‚Äôs leading Polish-language periodical, under the editorship of the mercurial Kaszubian poet Hieronim Derdowski. According to the historian-priest Reverend Waclaw Kruszka, unexplained ‚Äúdisagreements and difficulties‚Äù may have sped Father Byzewski‚Äôs departure from Winona.Father Waclaw Kruszka, \\"History of the American Poles,\\" volume 4, p. 122. An 1890 city directory for Milwaukee, Wisconsin lists Reverend Byzewski as an assistant pastor at Saint Stanislaus Church at 404 Mitchell Street. Yet by June 1890, he was in Detroit, Michigan directing the foundation of that city's fifth Polish parish, Saint Francis of Assisi. In 1898 he was transferred to Sweetest Heart of Mary Roman Catholic Church, also in Detroit. In 1899, Reverend Byzewski was granted readmission to the Franciscan Order, and relocated to Pulaski, Wisconsin. There he was a pastor for parishes and served as the first rector of Saint Bonaventure College. Reverend Jan Romuald Byzewski died in Green Bay, Wisconsin, on October 30, 1905.

Although Survarium is external to the S.T.A.L.K.E.R. series, the developers intend to include comparable features, notably the anomalies and artifacts that reference the Russian science-fiction novel Roadside Picnic, and the 'ecological catastrophe' that renders much of the environment uninhabitable for humans.  Gameplay  At this point in development and for the foreseeable future, Survarium is not a massively multiplayer online first-person shooter (MMOFPS), despite Vostok Games listing it as such on the game's website. According to Vostok Games their \\"ultimate goal is to eventually combine the entire world of Survarium into one massive game world,\\" but no mention has been made of increasing the number of players allowed to interact simultaneously in the game world to achieve the status of being a true MMOFPS. =Planned game modes= Vostok Games have detailed their plans for Survarium in Dev Diaries both in written and video form. There are three planned game modes announced so far. ;Team play (PvP) The PvP mode is intended to allow players to represent their chosen factions and combat against rival factions. There are currently five modes available: Team Deathmatch, Artifact Hunt, Research, Battery Retrieval, and Slaughter. The latter was added in Survarium update 0.30. ;Free play The free play game mode will contain a large, session based map with limited numbers of players in it at one time. Players will enter the map at a random point and can freely explore the map to scavenge supplies and uncover components of the story. Players can choose to work together with other players, fight against them or avoid them altogether. Players will be able to leave the map with all earned items by getting to one of the exit points located around each map. If a player is killed, they lose all items found during that session and are moved back to the lobby where they can enter another free play instance. ;Co-op The cooperative game mode is intended to contain the main story arc of Survarium. Squads of players will enter a random map and work together to discover the cause of the apocalypse and a possible defense against its spread. Plot A worldwide ecological disaster occurred in the year 2020, wiping out approximately 90% of the human race. The disaster takes the form of a fast- growing forest, that actively seeks out threats to its growth and destroys them. Such targets include weapons manufacturers, military installations and laboratories that are working on methods of stopping the spread of the forest. No manmade efforts to stop The Forest worked, with only natural barriers being able to slow it down. Survarium takes place in 2026 with players attempting to survive and defend themselves against the forest in destroyed cities and encampments. Players can choose to join a faction to gain access to supplies and resources. There are currently four factions, although Vostok Games has stated that they intend to have nine factions upon completion, however not all will be playable as some are intended to add support to the story as players progress. The factions all follow different ideals and often conflict with that of other factions, creating hostilities.

History Promotion at IgroMir 2013 On 9 December 2011, video game journalists reported that Sergei Grigorovich, the chief executive officer (CEO) of GSC Game World, had allegedly expressed his disappointment at the development of S.T.A.L.K.E.R. 2 during a meeting with employees. Despite the company's initial denials in response to press inquiries, the media widely reported that senior management had officially cancelled S.T.A.L.K.E.R. 2 and dissolved the company. In March 2012, former employees from GSC Game World founded Vostok Games with capital from Vostok Ventures Ltd, and announced subsequently the development of Survarium on 25 April 2012. On 13 May 2013, the alpha test started in Russian and Ukrainian- speaking territories.http://survarium.com/en/news/survarium-alpha-test-has- begun The alpha launched internationally a few weeks later. The closed beta testing for the PvP mode began on 20 December 2013 although it didn't have even have 50% of the planned content implemented at the time. Survarium went into open beta on 5 January 2015. The soundtrack and effects in Survarium were made by the founder of the Ukrainian melodic death metal band Firelake.

Winston Watts Has five kids, Neecia Watts, Remonia Watts, Romain Watts, Shauna Kaye Watts, and Winston Watts Jr. He has been a participant at four Olympics, most recently the 2014 Winter Olympics in Sochi. Olympics Watts first appearance at the Winter Olympics came during the 1994 Games held in Lillehammer, Norway. Competing in the four-man event alongside teammates Dudley Stokes, Nelson Stokes and Wayne Thomas, Watts finished in 14th position in a time of 3 minutes 29.96 seconds. At the 1998 Winter Olympics held in Nagano, Japan, the same Jamaican quartet finished in 21st position in the four-man event with a combined time of 2 minutes 43.76 seconds. For the 2002 Winter Olympics in Salt Lake City, Utah, United States, Watts switched to the two-man bobsled event. Competing alongside brakeman Lascelles Brown the Jamaican pair set a new Olympic push-start record of 4.78 seconds. Watts and Brown finished 28th out of the 37 competing teams in a time of 3 minutes 14.94 seconds. Watts retired from the sport as Jamaican teams failed to qualify for the 2006 Games in Turin, Italy, and the 2010 games in Vancouver, Canada. During his retirement Watts moved to Evanston, Wyoming, United States to work in the oil fields. In 2010 he came out of retirement at the age of 43 with the aim of qualifying for the 2014 Winter Olympics in Sochi, Russia. For the 2013-2014 season Watts teamed up with compatriot Marvin Dixon and based himself in Utah to allow the pair to compete in the North American Cup. They obtained enough points to qualify for the 2014 Olympics by taking part in lower-tier events at tracks in Park City, Utah, Lake Placid, New York and Calgary. Funding for Watts and Dixon to compete in Sochi was provided by Jamaica Olympic Association and Sochi 2014 Olympic and Paralympic Organizing Committee. To raise additional money for equipment the pair started an online funding appeal with users of the website Reddit donating over US$25000 via the cryptocurrency Dogecoin. Further money was raised via Crowtilt, a crowdfunding website. Watts and Dixon finished 29th out of the 30 competing teams in the two-man event in Sochi with a combined time of 2 minutes 55.40 seconds for their three runs. During their second run Watts suffered an issue with his visor that nearly resulted in the sled overturning.

In a brief racing career, lasting from October 1970 until September 1971 she ran five times and won four races. In 1971 she won the 1000 Guineas at Newmarket, the Oaks at Epsom and the Irish Oaks at the Curragh. Altesse Royale was injured and retired from racing later that year. She made no impact as a broodmare. Background Altesse Royal was tall, lightly-built chestnut filly with a narrow white blaze and white socks on her hind feet. She was bred by Vera Hue- Williams and raced in the colours of her husband Roger Hue-Williams. She was sired by Saint Crespin, a half-brother of Tulyar, who won the Prix de l'Arc de Triomphe in 1959. Her dam, Bleu Azur won two minor races and was a half-sister to the Champion Hurdler Magic Court. Bleu Azur had previously produced the Fred Darling Stakes winner Royal Saint. As a descendant of the broodmare Rose Red, Altesse Royale was a product of the same branch of Thoroughbred Family 1-w which produced Alycidon, Festoon, Celtic Ash and Larkspur. Altesse Royale was sent into training with Noel Murless at his Warren Place stables at Newmarket, Suffolk. Racing career Altesse Royale was slow to mature, and Murless ran her only once. In October she won a maiden race over six furlongs at Lingfield Park. On her three-year-old debut, Altesse Royale was moved up to Group Three class for the Nell Gwyn Stakes, a recognised trial race for the 1000 Guineas run over seven furlongs at Newmarket. She finished second to Super Honey, carrying four pounds less than the winner. She was not regarded as a leading contender for the Classic at Newmarket, and Murless's stable jockey, Geoff Lewis, elected to ride the Cheveley Park Stakes winner Magic Flute. Ridden by the leading French jockey Yves Saint-Martin, Altesse Royale started at 25/1 in a field of ten fillies. She took the lead from the start and was never seriously challenged, winning by one and a half lengths from Super Honey with Catherine Wheel third and Magic Flute fourth. Her win gave Murless a fifth success in the race, setting a 20th-century record. Geoff Lewis reclaimed the ride on Altesse Royale when she ran in the Epsom Oaks a month later. She started 6/4 favourite despite some doubts about her stamina: her sister Royal Saint had apparently failed to stay one and a half miles when she was the beaten favourite for the race in 1967. Lewis sent Altesse Royale past her stable companion Maina to take the lead in the straight and the filly drew clear to win by three lengths. the win gave Lewis a notable double, as he had won the Derby on Mill Reef three days earlier. In July she was sent to Ireland to contest the Irish Oaks at the Curragh. She won, but was not impressive in beating the French-trained filly Vincennes by half a length. Altesse Royale was being prepared for a run in the Prix Vermeille at Longchamp in September when she sustained an injury in training and was retired to stud. Retirement Altesse Royale was retired to her owners' Rathasker Stud in County Kildare, Ireland. She was bred to stallions including Mill Reef, Brigadier Gerard, Dancer's Image and Known Fact, but produced no winners of note. Assessment and honours Altesse Royale was given a rating of 126 by Timeform. In their book, A Century of Champions, based on the Timeform rating system, John Randall and Tony Morris rated Altesse Royale an \\"average\\" winner of the 1000 Guineas and Oaks. Pedigree Altesse Royale was inbred 3 √ó 4 to Donatello, meaning that this stallion appears in both the third and fourth generations of her pedigree.

It is a Church of Denmark parish church. History monstrance The main chapel on the north side of the church and the lower, square part of the tower are remains of a Romanesque church. In 1488 the church stood in its present form. The Catholic past of the building is heralded in a monstrance, now located to the right of the altar, and a stoup in what was then the porch. After the Reformation, it came into use as a protestant church. It underwent rough-handed restoration work in 1842-56 and 1881-84. The tower Architecture The church is a three- nave church built in large, red brick of the type in Denmark known as monk stone (munkesten). Typically of Gothic churches, the roofs of the aisles are lower than that of the central nave, allowing light to enter through clerestory windows. The tower stands at 48 metres. Its octagonal upper part is unusual in Danish church architecture, the only similar design is that of the five towers of Church of Our Lady in Kalundborg. Furnishings The altarpiece dates from about 1620. The painting is from 1826 and by Dankvart Dreyer. It was a gift from the painter who was born in Assens and settled there again later in life. Another work by a local artist found in the church is a marble angel created by the sculptor Jens Adolf Jerichau who was born in Assens in 1816, incidentally the same year as Dreyer. The pulpit, from the second half of the 17th century, was made in Hans Nielsen Bangs's workshop and is decorated with woodcarvings depicting scenes from the Passion on the sides, and nine wooden figures on the edges, probably representing nine of the disciples. Figures of the last three disciples may have decorated the stairs leading up to the pulpit. It also has an hour glass from the 18th century, probably to ensure that the priest's services did not last more than one hour. The wrought iron balustrade of the altar rails feature a crossed hammer and key, the trademark of King Christian IV's court smith, Casper Finck. The pews are from 2007. Individual chairs were introduced as seating in the early 1940s. They have an integrated sound system in the backrests and heated seats.

Some were covered with richly decorated tomb stones while others were covered with brick or simple wooden planks. All the burials were removed from the church in the beginning of the 19th century when burials inside churches were abolished due to health risk. The tomb stones were then placed along the external walls of the church.

It is also referred to as \\"The Fence of Gibraltar\\" () or simply \\"The Fence\\". The border runs east-west for a total of separating Gibraltar from the neighbouring Spanish municipality of La L√≠nea de la Concepci√≥n. Since Gibraltar (like the United Kingdom) is outside the European Union's Schengen Area, identity checks are required to cross the border. History The territory of Gibraltar was ceded to Great Britain in perpetuity under the Treaty of Utrecht in 1713. In 1730, the Lines of Contravallation of Gibraltar were built by Spain to isolate Gibraltar: these lines were north of the isthmus linking Spain with Gibraltar. These lines were the first form of border between Gibraltar and Spain. During the Peninsular War in the early 19th century, Spain had initially been allied to the First French Empire while trying to invade the Kingdom of Portugal, but France shortly afterwards turned on its ally thus forcing Spain to ally itself with Great Britain and Portugal against the French Empire. The Lines of Contravallation were blown up by the Gibraltar Commanding Royal Engineer Charles Holloway, with permission from Spain on 14 February 1810, to avoid them falling into the hands of the approaching French.R. H. Vetch, ‚ÄòHolloway, Sir Charles (1749‚Äì1827)‚Äô, rev. Alastair W. Massie, Oxford Dictionary of National Biography, Oxford University Press, 2004; online edn, Jan 2008 accessed 25 May 2013 Gibraltar, supported by La Linea, became an important base for Spanish fighters against Napoleon's troops. Currently, all that remains of the Lines of Contravallation are the Ruins of Fort St. Barbara, which is being restored, while remnants of the Fort San Felipe have appeared recently. Fort San Carlos does not seem to have left preserved evidence. In 1909 Britain decided to reduce the number of sentries and built a fence high, however there was suspicion about the motives for doing so. The line of this fence has become the de facto border. Spain claims that, by building the fence where it did, the United Kingdom annexed 106 of the original 156 hectares of neutral ground. In this location Gibraltar International Airport was built. Spanish leader Francisco Franco ordered the closure of the border gate on 8 June 1969\\"Spanish close off 'Rock'\\", Montreal Gazette, June 9, 1969, p1 in response to the Gibraltar Constitution Order 1969. The border at La Linea remained closed for more than 13 years until it was partially reopened to Spanish and Gibraltarian pedestrians on 15 December 1982,\\"Spain ends Gibraltar blockade\\", by John Hooper, The Guardian (London), December 15, 1982, p1 and was fully reopened to motor vehicles on 5 February 1985 in preparation for Spain joining the European Economic Community in 1986.\\"The siege of Gibraltar is over\\", The Observer (London), February 3, 1985, p17\\"Spain, Gibraltar Open Gate After 16 Years\\", AP report in The Times Recorder (Zanesville OH), February 5, 1985, pB-1 Status of the isthmus Spain continues to dispute the sovereign status of the isthmus with the United Kingdom, specifically the territory where Gibraltar International Airport stands, in addition to a broader dispute about the status of Gibraltar as a whole. One of the sources of the dispute is the lack of appropriate definitions of what had been actually ceded to Great Britain in the Treaty of Utrecht. The Treaty did not include any map or specific description of the ceded elements, so that Article X is subject to different interpretations from each side. According to Article X of the Treaty of Utrecht, dominion is ceded over the town and castle of Gibraltar, together with the port, fortifications, and forts thereunto belonging. Customs and identity checks Customs and identity checks on the Spanish side of the border are carried out by the Spanish Civil Guard and the Spanish National Police. Customs and identity checks on the Gibraltar side of the border are carried out by HM Customs Gibraltar and the Gibraltar Borders and Coastguard Agency. =Congestion charge= In 2010, the People's Party mayor of La L√≠nea, Alejandro Sanchez, attempted to impose a \\"congestion charge\\" on people entering or leaving Gibraltar, despite having been told by the Spanish Government that such a charge would be a breach of national and EU law. =Territorial waters dispute= In July 2013, the Gibraltar Government placed a number of concrete blocks in the sea off the coast of Gibraltar, intending to form an artificial reef. The Spanish Government protested, stating that it harmed fishing in the area, restricting access for Spanish fishing vessels. At the end of July the Spanish Government introduced extra border checks for people going in and out of the territory into Spain. The British Government protested as the checks were causing major delays of up to seven hours while people waited to cross the border, and on 2 August the Spanish Ambassador was summoned to the British Foreign and Commonwealth Office in London to explain these developments. Maritime borders The Gibraltar Port Authority controls the territorial waters of Gibraltar that border Spain's.
