In 1931 the Kogan family moved to Leningrad and Kogan was transferred to the All‚ÄìRussian Academy of Arts (the former St. Petersburg Imperial Arts Academy) to study painting. Two of Kogan's professors were Shuchaev and Radlov. She received professional advice and support from Petrov- Vodkin. In 1938, she was accepted to the Leningrad Department of the Artist's Union of the USSR and took part in local and national exhibitions. During World War 2 and the siege on Leningrad, Kogan was evacuated with her children to Siberia. Her paintings were saved in the basements of the academy until the war had ended. After World War 2, Kogan started teaching painting and became a Professor of Drawing at the Saint Petersburg Art and Industry Academy. Her work was exhibited in many USSR company collections throughout the Soviet Union. Kogan then emigrated to Israel in 1973 and became a known artist and educator in the country. Her art-work is still presented in the Tel Aviv Museum of Art and in the Israel Museum in Jerusalem. Rachel Kogan died at the age of 86.

After its discovery in 1937, it was not recorded again until its rediscovery at the same location in 2015. Description The species is relatively large for an amphipod, with an adult body length of 14‚Äì15 mm. The carapace is uniformly greyish-brown. The second gnathopod has a thickened terminal digit (dactylus) with a shape reminiscent of a bird's head, from which the specific name is derived. A 2016 nanotomography analysis showed that the gnathopod contains an unusual horseshoe-shaped spring-like structure, which may enable the amphipod to produce forceful snaps in the manner of the pistol shrimp. As this structure is embedded in the retractor muscle itself rather than extraneous to it, it may represent a unique development in animals. Distribution and habitat Q. aviceps is known only from its type locality in the Palmiet River lagoon near Kleinmond in the Western Cape of South Africa, at the junction of river and tidal areas, and from a locality on the estuary of the nearby Klein river, near Hermanus. It was first collected in 1937 and then not recorded again until a further collection at the type locality in 2015. The species may have a total distributional range of no more than a few km2.

While a Minister is free to introduce an opposing viewpoint for debate in Parliament, once a decision is taken by the Parliament, all ministers are bound to abide by the decision. A minister who does not agree with a Parliamentary decision should resign.  Examples  * In 2016, Waytha Moorthy Ponnusamy, a Deputy Minister under the Prime Minister of Malaysia, spoke out against the Malaysian police regarding the shooting of five criminals in Penang. This statement was rebuked by Ahmad Zahid Hamidi who demanded Ponnusamy's resignation for speaking outside of his ministerial jurisdiction. Advantages The Doctrine of Ministerial Responsibility may be used to avoid confusion regarding government policy or the government's position on a given issue, as well as to show solidarity of the government to maintain its credibility.  Disadvantages  The Doctrine prevents minority party ministers from expressing dissenting opinions in public. Although free to speak within Parliament, as a minority, their votes are unlikely to change the outcome of a bill that may adversely affect their minority constituency.

At the time of its activation, the 2nd Infantry Division was composed of the 3rd Infantry Brigade, which included the 9th Infantry Regiment; the 23rd Infantry Regiment and the 5th Machine Gun Battalion; the 4th Marine Brigade, which consisted of the 5th Marine Regiment, the 6th Marine Regiment and the 6th Machine Gun Battalion; 2nd Brigade of field artillery; and various supporting units. History =World War I= The brigade was first organized as the 1st Provisional Brigade, a Regular Army unit, at Syracuse, New York, on 11 August 1917. It was redesignated as the 3rd Infantry Brigade of the 2nd Division on 22 September, a day after the latter was constituted. Edward Mann Lewis, with decorations The 2nd Division was first constituted on 21 September 1917 in the Regular Army.In World War I, there was only one type of division in the US Army, the infantry division, and all divisions were called simply \\"Division\\". It was organized on 26 October 1917 at Bourmont, Haute Marne, France. At the time of its activation, the Indianhead Division was composed of the 3rd Infantry Brigade, which included the 9th Infantry Regiment; the 23rd Infantry Regiment and the 5th Machine Gun Battalion; the 4th Marine Brigade, which consisted of the 5th Marine Regiment, the 6th Marine Regiment and the 6th Machine Gun Battalion; 2nd Brigade of field artillery; and various supporting units. Twice during World War I the division was commanded by US Marine Corps generals, Brigadier General Charles A. Doyen and Major General John A. Lejeune (after whom the Marine Corps Camp in North Carolina is named), the only time in U.S. military history when Marine Corps officers commanded an Army division. The division spent the winter of 1917‚Äì18 training with French and Scottish veterans. Though judged unprepared by French tacticians, the American Expeditionary Force (AEF) was committed to combat in the spring of 1918 in a desperate attempt to halt a German advance toward Paris. Major General Edward Mann Lewis Commanded the 3rd Brigade as they deployed to reinforce the battered French along the Paris to Metz road. The Division first fought at the Battle of Belleau Wood and contributed to shattering the four-year-old stalemate on the battlefield during the Ch√¢teau- Thierry campaign that followed. On 28 July 1918, Marine Corps Major General Lejeune assumed command of the 2nd Division and remained in that capacity until August 1919, when the unit returned to the US. The division went on to win hard-fought victories at Soissons and Blanc Mont. Finally the Indianhead Division participated in the Meuse-Argonne Offensive which ended any German hope for victory. On 11 November 1918 the Armistice was declared, and the 2nd Division entered Germany, where it assumed occupation duties until April 1919. 2nd Division returned to U.S. in July 1919. The 2nd Division was three times awarded the French Croix de guerre for gallantry under fire at Belleau Wood, Soissons, and Blanc Mont. This entitles current members of the division and of those regiments that were part of the division at that time (including the 5th and 6th Marine Regiments) to wear a special lanyard, or fourrag√®re, in commemoration. The Navy authorized a special uniform change that allows hospital corpsmen assigned to 5th and 6th Marine Regiments to wear a shoulder strap on the left shoulder of their dress uniform so that the fourrag√®re can be worn. The division lost 1,964 (including USMC: 4,478) killed in action and 9,782 (including USMC: 17,752) wounded in action. =Interwar years= Upon returning to the United States, the division was stationed at Fort Sam Houston, at San Antonio, Texas as one of three divisions to remain intact and on active duty for the entire interwar period. At this time, Major General Edward Mann Lewis was placed again in Command, this time not only of the Division, but of the Eighth Corps Area. It remained there for the next 23 years, serving as an experimental unit, testing new concepts and innovations for the Army. The 2nd Division stationed at Camp Bullis and Fort Sam Houston, Texas was the first command reorganized under the new triangular concept of organization theory of warfare, which provided for three separate regiments in each division. Second Division Memorial, dedicated in 1936, is located in President's Park, Washington, D.C. =Reorganization= In the summer of 1954 the 2nd Infantry Division was transferred from Korea to Fort Lewis, Washington, where it remained for only two years, until being transferred to Fort Richardson, Alaska in August 1956. On 8 November 1957, it was announced that the division was to be deactivated. However, a few short months later, in the spring of 1958, the Department of the Army announced that the 2nd Infantry Division would be reorganized at Fort Benning, Georgia, with personnel and equipment of the 10th Infantry Division returning from Germany. Fort Benning remained the home of the new 2nd Infantry Division from 1958 to 1965, where they were initially assigned the mission of a training division. To improve combat readiness, in March 1962 the 2ID was designated as a Strategic Army Corps (STRAC) unit. Following this the division became engaged in intensified combat training, tactical training, and field training exercises, in addition to special training designed to improve operational readiness. In 1963, the division was reorganized as a Reorganization Objective Army Division (ROAD). Three Brigade Headquarters were activated, including the 3rd Brigade, and Infantry units were reorganized into battalions. =Back to Korea= 2nd US Infantry Division 1989 As a result of the formation of the 1st Cavalry Division (Airmobile) at Fort Benning in 1965, the 2nd Infantry Division's stateside unit, along with 11th Air Assault Division's personnel and equipment, were merged to form a new formation, and the existing 1st Cavalry Division in Korea took on the title of the 2nd Infantry Division. Thus the division formally returned to Korea in July 1965. From 1966 onwards the Korean DMZ Conflict (1966‚Äì69) increased. On 2 November 1966, soldiers of the 1st Battalion, 23d Infantry Regiment were killed in an ambush by North Korean forces. In 1967 enemy attacks in the Korean Demilitarized Zone (DMZ) increased, as a result, 16 American soldiers were killed that year. In 1968 the 2nd Infantry Division was headquartered at Tonggu Ri and responsible for watching over a portion of the DMZ.Stanton, Shelby, Vietnam Order of Battle: A Complete Illustrated Reference to the U.S. Army and Allied Ground Forces in Vietnam, 1961‚Äì1973, Stackpole Books 2006, p. 340‚Äì341 where a divisional order of battle in Korea can be found. In 1968 North Koreans continued to probe across the DMZ, and in 1969, while on patrol, four soldiers of 3d Battalion, 23d Infantry were killed. On 18 August 1976, during a routine tree-trimming operation within the DMZ, two American officers of the Joint Security Force were axed to death in a melee with North Korean border guards called the Axe Murder Incident. On 21 August, following the deaths, the 2nd Infantry Division supported the United Nations Command in \\"Operation Paul Bunyan\\" to cut down the \\"Panmunjeom Tree\\". This effort was conducted by Task Force Brady (named after the 2nd ID Commander) in support of Task Force Vierra (named after the Joint Security Area Battalion commander). Congress adopted the Nunn-Warner Amendment to the 1989 Defense Appropriation Bill, which ordered a reduction in U.S. troop strength in Korea from 43,000 to 36,000 by the end of calendar year 1991. As a result, on 16 September 1992, the 2nd Infantry Division's 3rd Brigade was inactivated at Camp Howze. To complete the 2nd Infantry Division with a third brigade, the 3d Brigade, 1st Armored Division, and an associated 'slice' of the division's supporting units from Bad Kreuznach, Germany, was to be returned home and stationed at Fort Lewis, Washington. However, when the move was completed in September 1994, the 4,000 3rd Brigade soldiers (still part of the 1st Armored Division) were separated from their new parent division. As a result, they were organized as a split-based brigade combat team (BCT). On 29 March 1995, the 3rd Brigade, 2nd Infantry Division was reactivated at Fort Lewis, effectively 'reflagged' from the 3d Brigade, 1st Armored Division. It was composed of the 1-23 Infantry, 1-32 Armor, 1-33 Armor, 1-37 Field Artillery, 168 Engineer, the 296th Forward Support Battalion, and Charlie Battery 5-5 Air Defense Artillery. Other sources have 16 April 1995 as the official reactivation date. =Iraq= 2ID soldiers patrolling in Baghdad. From November 2003 to November 2004, the 3rd Stryker Brigade Combat Team deployed from Fort Lewis, Washington in support of Operation Iraqi Freedom. In the sands of Iraq the 3rd Brigade Stryker Brigade Combat Team proved the value of the Stryker brigade concept in combat and logistics operations. firefight with insurgents in the Dora section of Baghdad 7 March 2007 From June 2006 to September 2007, the 3rd Stryker Brigade Combat Team deployed from Fort Lewis, Washington in support of Operation Iraqi Freedom. During the 3rd Stryker Brigade's second deployment to Operation Iraqi Freedom their mission was to assist the Iraqi security forces with counter- insurgency operations in the Ninewa Province. Following a second RIP (Relief in Place) with 172nd SBCT, the BDE split between the bridge proper and 1st BDE, 1st CAV DIV. The respective units were based out of Balad, Taji, and Greater Baghdad. The bulk of the 46 soldiers that were killed in action during the deployment, occurred during this time frame. On 1 June 2006 at Fort Lewis, Washington the 4th Brigade, 2d Infantry Division was formed. From April 2007 to July 2008 the 4th Stryker Brigade Combat Team was deployed in as part of the surge to regain control of the situation in Iraq. The brigade assumed responsibility for the area north of Baghdad and the Diyala province. 35 soldiers from the brigade were killed during the deployment. From October 2006 to January 2008, the 2nd Infantry Brigade Combat Team deployed from Fort Carson, Colorado in support of the Multi-National Division ‚Äì Baghdad (1st Cavalry Division) and was responsible for assisting the Iraqi forces to become self-reliant, bringing down the violence and insurgency levels and supporting the rebuilding of the Iraqi infrastructure. 43 soldiers from the brigade were killed during the deployment. SSG Christopher B. Waiters of 5th Battalion, 20th Infantry Regiment, 3d Brigade Combat Team was awarded the Distinguished Service Cross on 23 October 2008 for his actions on 5 April 2007 when he was a specialist. Shortly after, SPC Erik Oropeza of the 4th Battalion, 9th Infantry Regiment, 4th Brigade Combat Team Thus the division will be credited with the 17th and 18th Distinguished Service Cross awardings since 1975. The 2nd Infantry Division's 4th Brigade Combat Team deployed to Iraq in the fall of 2009. 3rd Brigade deployed to Iraq 4 August 2009 for the brigade's third deployment to Iraq, the most of any Stryker Brigade Combat Team (SBCT). =War in Afghanistan= Spc.

On 17 February 2009, President Barack Obama ordered 4,000 soldiers from the 5th Stryker Brigade Combat Team to Afghanistan, along with 8,000 Marines. Soldiers are being sent there because of the worsening situation in the Afghan War. These soldiers were deployed in the southeast, on the Afghanistan-Pakistan border. During deployment, 35 soldiers were killed in combat, two others were killed in accidents, and 239 were wounded. In July 2010, the 5th Stryker Brigade Combat Team was inactivated and reflagged as the 2nd Stryker Brigade Combat Team. The brigade's Special Troops Battalion was also inactivated and reflagged and the rest of the subordinate units were reassigned to the reactivated 2nd SBCT. 3rd SBCT deployed in December 2011 and served in Afghanistan for one-year. 16 soldiers from the brigade lost their lives during the deployment. They were joined by their sister Stryker brigade, the 2nd SBCT in the spring 2nd Brigade returned around December 2012 and January 2013 having lost eight soldiers during deployment. The 4th Stryker BCT also deployed to its first deployment to the country in fall 2012 and returned in summer 2013 having lost four soldiers. = Casing of the Colors = On 5 September 2015, the Army retired the 3rd Brigade, 2nd Infantry Division flag, and the unit was re-designated as the 1st Brigade, 2nd Infantry Division.

In February 2018, Mobike launched its operations in Mexico City and Santiago, Chile.  Design features  As described by the company, Mobike is intended to solve the last mile issue in which commuters face the problem of being stuck a bit too far from their destination to walk, but too close to justify the cost or delay of finding a taxi. Similar to Call a Bike in Germany, every Mobike bicycle comes with an internet-controlled electronic wheel lock that automatically unlocks but requires manual locking after use. Mobike bicycles are powered by a small generator installed on the rear wheel hub to power the lock, or by a PV panel in some bike models. The patented disc brake is said to withstand over 10,000 kilometres of riding without failure. Mobike has partnered with Qualcomm (using their IoT chip MDM9206) and Gemaltohttps://www.gemalto.com/brochures-site/download- site/Documents/M2M_CS_Mobike.pdf for the use of NB-IoT technologies to provide connection for the bikes. Mobike bicycles come in two versions, both of which requires a scan of a unique QR-code to unlock: A Classic Mobike showing its identification number. Here the smaller \\"020\\" means a bike assigned to Guangzhou, Guangdong. = Classic Mobike = The Classic Mobike, or \\"Mobike\\", is the standard variant of Mobike bicycles. It has an all-aluminium, V-shaped chassis, puncture-proof tires, and a shaft transmission system. Instead of conventional wire spokes, it uses five sets of two thick, parallel, metal rods positioned at 72¬∞ from each other to improve durability and lower maintenance costs. The identification number of each bicycle is put on the rear part of the chassis. Renters scan the QR-code, which is displayed at the base of the handle as well as on the smart lock. The livery is black for the seat, handlebars and the lock, orange for the wheel and metallic silver for the body. The bicycle weighs . Some users have complained about the Classic Mobike's weight and the lack of a bicycle basket (defended by Mobike as to \\"prevent spam advertising\\"), and difficulty in keeping balance on their first attempts, which kickstarted the development of Mobike's second iteration, the Mobike Lite. = Mobike Lite = Mobike Lite is known informally as \\"generation 2\\". It uses wire spokes and a conventional chain drive to deliver torque to the rear wheel. The identification number is on the right side on a plastic panel that protects the chain. The QR code has moved to the tip of the rear fender. The Mobike Lite comes with a net-like metal basket and has a solar panel that powers the QR lock and GPS tracker. The wheels were coloured orange. A Mobike Lite bicycle in Guangdong. Note the exposed transmission system. Newer models of the \\"Mobike Classic\\" and \\"Mobike Lite\\" have adjustable seats. The Lite weighs . = Second generation = According to a company press release, small batches of second generation Mobikes, both Classic and Lite, are being deployed in areas of service. Reports indicate that the second generation bicycles use a more durable aluminium kickstand rather than the formerly used hard plastic ones. Also mentioned is the new hydraulic adjustable seat installed on Generation 2 bicycles through depression of a small metal tab near the base of the seat. Finally, the second generation Classic Mobikes now also have a basket. The colour scheme of the second generation Mobike Lite is changed to orange for the inner rim, and reverts to black for the tyre.  Access  Several ofo and Mobike bikes blocking a bus stop platform Access to Mobike bicycles requires the Mobike application, which takes a minimum deposit of one unit of country-specific currency to ensure the user supplied payment details are correct. Each user is required to register using their mobile telephone number. In China they must also register their national identification number as required by local government regulations; the software does not allow users under the age of 14 to use the app, through the identification number. To use a bicycle, the user unlocks the bike using the mobile app. The app records the distance and duration of the trip and the energy the user spent using the bike. At the end of the rental the cost is deducted from the user's account. = Payment= As Mobike has no offline services, the Mobike app only accepts online transactions through AliPay, WeChat Pay, or credit card. The user needs to have a positive balance in their account when starting the rental, but it is allowed to go negative during a trip. The company previously required deposit in order to use the service in China, however the company ended the practice in July 2018. Users are free to withdraw their deposit from the service at any time as long as they do not have a negative account balance. = Mobike Score = The Mobike app initially used a \\"Mobike Score\\" system to keep track of user behaviour. The score system consisted of five levels: Outstanding (1000‚Äì701), Excellent (700‚Äì601), Good (600‚Äì501), Fair (500‚Äì301), Poor (300‚Äì0). Users' Mobike Score affected future fares and use of the system. Every new user automatically started with a \\"Good\\" score of 550 points. Users were awarded points for various actions such as reporting any problems with the system or parking in preferred areas with higher demand, and lost points for actions detrimental to the system, which could lead to account suspension. This system is no longer in use.  Issues  Many Mobikes stacked on top of each other in Beijing Mobike has several problems with practicality. Many people complain about bikes causing clutter; as they do not have fixed-station parking locations, users can leave Mobikes where they cause obstruction. In response to these complaints, Mobike has introduced parking zones to encourage users to park in specific areas. In some global markets such as the UK, there has been much reported vandalism of Mobikes.

It was recorded at Wally Heider Studios on January 9, 1970.  Background  The song describes a real-life dilemma faced by many hippies: whether to cut one's hair to a more practical length, or leave it long as a symbol of rebellion.. It was written by David Crosby, and features solo vocals by Crosby, with the rest of the band joining in on instruments rather than on vocal harmony, as in many of their other songs. Unlike most of the tracks on D√©ja Vu, the quartet and their studio musicians, Dallas Taylor (drums) and Greg Reeves (bass), all recorded it at the same place and time. It was one of only two songs from the album that Neil Young joined in on, despite not writing.. Although the notion of long hair as a \\"freak flag\\" appeared earlier, notably in a 1967 Jimi Hendrix song \\"If 6 Was 9\\", Crosby's song has been credited with popularizing the idea of long hair as a deliberate and visible symbol of the wearer's affiliation with the counterculture, and opposition to establishment values. The song also writes about the singer's \\"paranoia\\" at seeing the police; James Perone writes that, \\"more than any other song of the entire era\\", it \\"captures the extent to which the divisiveness in American society ... had boiled over into violence and terror\\".. It became one of Crosby's signature songs, and \\"probably his most important political song\\".. Crosby himself stated \\"It was the most juvenile set of lyrics I've ever written ... but it has a certain emotional impact, there's no question about that.\\".

It provides tools to design and build a transparent and competitive procurement process backed by strong data collection, electronic documents, and detailed reporting. OpenProcurement toolkit was first released in 2014 under Apache license for free and open source software. Originally OpenProcurement had been developed by Quintagroup for ProZorro, a procurement system implemented to provide transparent and efficient spending of public funds in Ukraine. But due to toolkit‚Äôs flexibility and scalability it remains in use for other government and private sector procurements.  The point of the project  The aim of the project was to create an effective electronic public procurement system with open source, which would meet the following requirements: * simplicity and ease of use - procurement procedures should be simple and understandable for all participants in the procurement process, especially the organizers (buyers) and participants (sites). * 'openness' of tender documents and transparency of procurement procedures - civil society should have free access to all documents related to procurement. * equal opportunities for participants - all legal entities or individuals should be able to participate if their offer satisfies the requirements specified in the tender documentation. * prevention of corruption - the use of electronic documents, strict qualification criteria, a transparent system of evaluation and selection of the most cost-effective offer will lay the foundation for the process of eradicating corruption.  Free software components  The OpenProcurement software package uses a number of other open source products: # Python (a programming language) # Pyramid # AngularJS # Bootstrap # Flask (web-framework) # CouchDB # PouchDB  Architecture  OpenProcurement consists of a Centralized database (CDB) and the API through which specialized electronic platforms can interact with the CDB and module auctions. Third- party web platforms (web platforms, which implement components of the e-procurement system, and give access to purchasing organizations, vendors, and ordinary visitors) interact with CDB using OpenProcurement API and provide temporary login data to access the Module of the auction and participate in it. The administrator has a direct access to CDB and services offered by the Backend; helps with the support of the system and with connecting web platforms to it. The body of appeal is granted access to the system through a special web interface to consider and adjudicate on complaints. The interaction between web sites and CDB is via API ‚Äî a web interface based on the module JSON. The business logic is implemented in Python. For saving the auctions, offers, etc., a non-relational database CouchDB was used. Attachments (binary files such as pdf, xls, etc.) are stored on the file server, which is compatible with Amazon S3.  Open Contracting  The toolkit contains Data Standard for procurement procedures. It was developed on the basis of Open Contracting 1.0RC http://standard.open-contracting.org and extended to ensure practical implementation of the procurement process in Ukraine.  Use cases and production deployments  The OpenProcurement functionality is suitable for both public and commercial procurement. = ProZorro = OpenProcurement toolkit was designed specifically for the Prozorro, the Ukrainian electronic Government procurement system. Prozorro was designed according to international standards and international best practices. As a model Ukrainian system used the procurement system in Georgia that is recognized as one of the best in the world. As the core of ProZorro project this toolkit: * covers specific requirements to the accessibility and transparency of procedures. * enforces (where appropriate) and encourages recognised best practices for public procurements during the whole tendering process. * uses electronic documents, strict qualification requirements, a transparent system of proposal evaluation and awarding, effective reverse auctions and open access to the procurement data. * applies time and cost effective reverse auction where suppliers compete to sell goods to the procuring entity at the lowest price. Currently for login on ProZorro or for the submission of tender proposal participants do not need the electronic digital signature (EDS). = ProZorro.Sale = OpenProcurement toolkit was used by Prozorro.sale, a Deposit Guarantee Fund (DGF) system that organizes sale of the assets belonging to insolvent or liquidated banks. Goal of ProZorro.Sale is a transparent, fast and effective sales of state and communal property, as well as fighting against corruption by the means of equal access to data, public control and increasing number of the potential buyers. The Prozorro.sale‚Äôs architecture and main components are the same as those in the original Prozorro project. The main difference is that the ascending auction is used for selling assets for the highest price. = Atreus = Atreus is a SaaS auction platform that has in its core an OpenProcurement toolkit. It consists of four types of auctions: # Forward English auction. The key feature of this auction type is the gradual increase in price for the item (goods or a service) that is put for sale by the auction organizer when the buyers bid in competition to purchase this item. The main peculiarity of the Forward English auction is the three-round procedure where participants can make their bids anonymously. # Reverse English auction. The number and the duration of the auction rounds are limited and machine-controlled, making the acquisition process quick, fair, and competitive. # Hybrid Dutch auction. This type of auction was created for NPL disposal for DGF within ProZorro.Sale system and for the state asset sale. # Texas auction. This type is well-suited for property lease or art auctions since its practically identical to the auctions conducted by Sotheby's. The bidding here starts with a price announced by the seller and lasts until there remains only one bidder willing to take a lot. = RIALTO = In addition to ProZorro and ProZorro.Sale, the OpenProcurement software package was also implemented in the RIALTO project - a platform for commercial procurement.

During the period of Frankish rule it was a Roman Catholic see, and continues to the present day as a titular see in the Roman Catholic Church.  History  Olena (·Ω¨ŒªŒµŒΩŒ±, today Oleni) became an episcopal see in Byzantine times, being recorded as the see of Bolaina (ŒíŒøŒªŒ±ŒØŒΩŒ±) since the 9th century in the Notitiae Episcopatuum of the Patriarchate of Constantinople. It was probably established after the reconquest of the Peloponnese from the Slavs, and was a suffragan of the Metropolis of Patras. The see remains attested in the Notitiae until the 13th century, but following the Latin conquest of the Peloponnese and the establishment of the Principality of Achaea, it was taken over by a Roman Catholic bishop. On the demand of Prince Geoffrey I of Villehardouin, however, its seat was moved to Andravida, the Principality's capital. The Latin bishops, who remained suffragans of the Latin Archbishop of Patras, resided there until the decline of the Principality, when the region became depopulated; they then moved to Kaminitsa near Patras. The Latin see was suppressed when the Principality was conquered by the Despotate of the Morea in 1430, and a Greek Orthodox residential bishop once again took up seat there. In Ottoman times, the see was variously based at Gastouni and Pyrgos. Following Greek independence, the vacant see was merged with the Metropolis of Patras, into the Archbishopric of Patras and Elis. In 1899, the Bishopric of Elis became independent, and was promoted to metropolitan see in 1922.

Concept The underlying concept is that, a team which is leading 2‚Äì0 will be complacent and have a 'false sense of security' in their lead. If the trailing team then scores to make it 2‚Äì1, the leading team can panic and concede further, resulting in a draw, or even a win for the other team. In contrast, a team which is leading 1‚Äì0 will tend to concentrate and play with intensity to protect or extend their narrow lead, whilst teams leading by three or more goals have a sufficiently large buffer that comebacks are unlikely. The clich√© may be invoked by coaches to encourage their players to maintain effort levels after obtaining a two-goal lead. It can also be used in broadcasting, such as by a commentator or studio pundit, to suggest that the final result is still in doubt, thereby maintaining audience interest in a game. There is little evidence that 2‚Äì0 is the worst lead in practice. In football, a team leading 2‚Äì0 at half-time only goes on to lose the game in about 2% of cases. In ice hockey, statistics show that if a team builds a two-goal advantage, they go on to win the game in the majority of instances, and that a one-goal lead is far more dangerous. As a result, the clich√© is often used in full knowledge that 2‚Äì0 is not in fact the worst possible lead. Examples of usage The clich√© was popularized by Czech football coach and television commentator Josef Csapl√°r in the Czech football community. His use of the term suggested that a 2‚Äì0 half-time lead could only end in a defeat and the clich√© is known in the Czech Republic as Csapl√°r's trap (Czech: Csapl√°rova past). In Serbia, the clich√© is known for being used by manager and former player Milan ≈Ωivadinoviƒá. The clich√© was also used by Australian former player and TV broadcaster Johnny Warren. Television pundit and former England international footballer Gary Lineker questioned the clich√©'s veracity during a 2016 match between Bournemouth and Liverpool while the latter were 2‚Äì0 ahead. On that occasion, Liverpool did in fact surrender the lead to lose 4‚Äì3.

At the time of her death, her library was perhaps the largest existing library assembled by a woman. Early life Born Jane Miller, February 21, 1747 or 1748, in Prince George County, Virginia, youngest of four children of Hugh and Jane (Bolling) Miller, tobacco grower, merchant, and vestryman of Old Blandford Church of Bristol Parish, Petersburg, VA.;The Vestry Book and Register of Bristol Parish, VA, 1720 - 1789 (transcribed and privately published by Churchill Gibson Chamberlayne 1898), .Ann Leighton, American Gardens in the Eighteenth Century, \\"for Use and for Delight\\", 262-283 (Univ. Mass. Amherst 1986), available on google books, a source which provides a biography, and reproduces many of Lady Skipwith's plant lists. Mr. Miller returned to Scotland with his family before December 8, 1760.in The Vestry Book and Register of Bristol Parish, VA, 1720 - 1789 (transcribed and privately published by Churchill Gibson Chamberlayne 1898), .Skipwith Family Papers, 1760 - 1977,Swem Library, Special Collections Database, College William & Mary, . Family and marriage Jean's older sister, Anne, had married Sir Peyton Skipwith, 7th Baronet, in 1765. Anne died in childbirth in 1779. While it is unclear where or with whom Jean Miller was living in Scotland between 1760 and 1786, the Skipwith Family Papers show bills and receipts for Miller's book purchases in Edinburgh in 1781, and Miller was back in Virginia by 1786. On September 7, 1788, Sir Peyton wrote to Jean Miller (then living at Sir Peyton's Elm Hill Plantation), expressing his wish \\"to complete a union on which my future happiness so much and so immediately depends.\\" He requested her permission to tell his daughter that, on a journey to Cototoman, he would be accompanied by \\"Lady Skipwith and not Miss Miller . . . by their [new] mother and not their aunt.\\" They were married on September 25, 1788 in Granville, North Carolina, and by April 1789, Lady Skipwith was corresponding with Samuel Goode regarding hop roots. Lady Skipwith's first daughter, Helen, was born June 25, 1789 at Elm Hill Plantation. In January 1788, letters to Sir Peyton began to be addressed to him at his new house, Prestwould Plantation, in Mecklenberg County, named for Prestwold Hall, the country home of the Skipwith family. Originally, the plantation had been acquired by William Byrd II and named \\"Blue Stone Castle.\\" On November 6, 1765, Sir Peyton paid William Byrd III 200 pounds for the plot of Blue Stone Castle land that would become Prestwould (deeded Oct. 30, 1765).Herbert A. Elliott. \\"Sir Peyton Skipwith and the Byrd Land.\\" The Virginia Magazine of History and Biography, vol. 80, no. 1, (Va. Hist. Soc. 1972), pp. 52‚Äì59. [www.jstor.org/stable/4247695]. The family moved to Prestwould in 1797, a Georgian-style house sitting above the Roanoke River.Julian Hudson, Exec. Dir. Prestwould Foundation, \\"Prestwould: Gracious Living on the American Frontier, 1790-1830 (lecture, Va. Hist. Soc. 2009).Sumpter Pinody, et. al., Prestwould Plantation - 1797, Historic Home Plans, (plans, elevations, and history). Prestwould Plantation, its outbuildings, and its grounds are now a National Historic Landmark and are open to the public, including what may be the earliest known slave house in Virginia.Pamela A. Stamford, \\"Archaeological Investigiations of the Prestwould Slave Quarter, Mecklenburg County, Virginia (44MC534), Williamsburg Foundation Library Research Report Series - 0393 (Williamsburg, 2009) This was a working tobacco plantation with farm and livestock, a mill, blacksmith shop, store, ferry, and where thoroughbred horses were raised. The plantation's records reflect many skilled laborers, as well as meticulous bills of sale for slaves.Prestwould Plantation, African American Historic Sites Database By the time of Sir Peyton Skipwith's death in 1805, the Skipwiths owned over 200 slaves. Prestwould's extensive archives are held by The College of William & Mary, Earl Gregg Swem Library Special Collections. These include plans for the house and gardens. Garden It was at Prestwould Plantation that Lady Skipwith had her garden built by enslaved laborers overseen by Samuel Dedman.Peggy Cornett, Thomas Jefferson Center for Historic Plants, \\"In the Company of Gardeners: The Flower Diaries of Jefferson, Skipwith, and Faris\\" (Monticello, Jan. 2000),. A receipt signed by Samuel Dedman on April 24, 1801 states that Dedman had received \\"Twenty two dollars in part for my services in building [the] Garden.\\" Dedman must have worked closely with Lady Skipwith to carry out her design, for two sketches in Lady Skipwith's hand map out several garden plots. Her sketches feature highly-organized garden plots crisscrossed by \\"boardwalks,\\" some wide enough for wheelbarrows, pony carts, or couples taking exercise to pass through. The plans also indicate where Lady Skipwith intended to plant verbena, strawberry, crocus, phlox, violets, pansies, and portulaca, as well as annuals and shrubbery.Peter Martin, The Pleasure Gardens of Virginia: From Jamestown to Jefferson, 126-130 (Univ. Press of Virg. 1991). The archives include records of Lady Skipwith's orders for vegetables, roots and bulbs, which she grew in raised beds. She ordered from Prince Nurseries on Long Island, as did George Washington and Thomas Jefferson. Lady Skipwith often corresponded with neighbors, requesting cuttings of plants she could then add to her own collections, or offering gardening advice of her own. \\"Plumb Stones,\\" for instance, were acquired from \\"General Parsons.\\" Her extensive botanical notes also describe where each kind of plant was grown at Prestwould, what the ideal conditions for its growth were, and how it should be cared for. She listed the many wildflowers she collected, including trillium and viola, identifying them from Philip Miller's Gardener's Dictionary‚Äîand noting when they were not in that source. For instance, she recorded that \\"The Sealy Pink coloured root from the Point of the Island\\" was of the \\"9th Sort -- Miller.\\" She kept records of her fruit crops, notes on how to raise trees from cuttings, and lists of what she planted. \\"Wintering plants,\\" including \\"Oranges, Lemons, and Limes\\" were grown in a glass-walled orangery abutting the garden. Lady Skipwith's botanical notes often connected a plant with its use. Of a particular kind of apple, the \\"Maryland Red Steeck,\\" Lady Skipwith noted that it \\"Makes a fine strong Cyder and keeps through the winter better than almost any other apples.\\" Lady Skipwith was a keeper of lists. She listed \\"Shrubs to be got when I can\\". Among her house plants she listed, not only oranges, lemons, and limes, but also oleander, dwarf myrtle, rose geranium and chrysanthemum, observing that those would \\"live in the garden through the winter though the first frost would destroy the flower.\\" Living, as she did, far from markets and major trade routes, Lady Skipwith also listed, for example, \\"Bulbous roots to get when in my power. . . . Meadow saffron a bulbous root about the size of a tulip, flowers in autumn and the leaves continue green all winter. Called by the common people Naked Ladies, great varieties may be obtained from seed\\". Later life and death After her husband's death in 1805, Lady Skipwith managed Prestwould Plantation for the next 21 years. Lady Skipwith died on May 19, 1826. Of her death \\"after an illness of 3 days,\\" Dr. Robert Redd of Mecklenburg County, Virginia, noted that \\"she, to the last, would not allow a Physician to be sent for. The character of this truly unique woman is well known. -- May her everlasting life be as happy as her days here were profitable.\\" By her death, Lady Skipwith had acquired a library of more than 850 volumes.Catherine Kerrison, The Novel as Teacher: Learning to be Female in the Early American South\\", The Journal of Southern History, vol. 69, no. 3, (Univ. Ga.) 2003, pp. 513‚Äì548. [www.jstor.org/stable/30040009].

The piece involves the manipulation of electric metronomes, followed by various unspecified sounds and actions. It is a very theatrical piece,Ichiyanagi, Toshi. Music for Electric Metronomes, Theatre Piece, Edition Peters and reflects Ichiyanagi's affiliation with Fluxus, an experimental art movement from the sixties. The only true scored \\"instrument\\" is an electric metronome for each individual player, though the varying sounds and/or actions may involve many different instruments and objects at the discretion of the performer. Because the graphic notation of the score‚Äîa series of dashes, lines, and numbers in an erratic pattern of connected paths‚Äîleaves room for personal interpretation and expression, each performance is unique, and almost certainly cannot be reproduced. There is no conductor for the performance. It has been recorded on the album Toshi Ichiyanagi: 1960's & 1990's. In a review of a performance by the S.E.M. Ensemble in 1992 at the Paula Cooper Gallery, the music critic of The New York Times, Alex Ross, described the piece as \\"merely a timid, spastic prelude to Gy√∂rgy Ligeti's monumental Po√®me symphonique\\" for 100 metronomes\\".\\"Review/Music; S.E.M. Evokes John Cage as Teacher\\" by Alex Ross, The New York Times, 24 December 1992 Score The score for Music for Electric Metronomes consists of a diagram featuring series of dashes, lines, and numbers in an erratic pattern of connected paths accompanied by a set of directions. Each player looks at the score and chooses a path, starting from one \\"end\\" of the score, and finishing at another. There are 10 \\"ends\\" to start and finish with. This path should culminate in about 8 minutes' worth of actions, sounds, and metronome manipulation. Once the player has chosen their path, they will use numbers as guides for meter and duration, and various types of lines as a guide to choosing their actions and sounds. Each player will begin at their respective ends, and start the metronome at the BPM (beats per minute) designated by their starting number. Then, using the amount of beats specified, they will gradually adjust the tempo of the metronome to the next designated BPM on their path. The connecting line between these BPMs is what specifies the action(s) or sound(s) that follow:\\"Toshi Ichiyanagi and the Art of Indeterminacy\\", seminar by Yayoi Uno Everett, Museum of Modern Art, New York City, 15 February 2013 * A straight, unbroken line means that no action will follow the metronome change. A single curved unbroken line stands for a single action, such as walking. An unbroken line with two or more curves means to make two more actions. * A straight, dotted line means to make a single physical sound, such as clapping or voice sounds. A single curved dotted line means to make any number of physical sounds of one kind. A dotted line with two or more curves means to make two or more physical sounds of different kinds. * A straight, zig-zag line means to make a single sound using an external object like an instrument or machine. A single curved zig-zag line means to make any number of sounds using a single external object.

He was the only officer in the Irish Prison Service to be killed in connection with the Troubles in Northern Ireland. Political controversy arose in 2016 around allegations that Gerry Adams, the leader of Sinn F√©in, knew the identity of the killers. Shooting and death Portlaoise Prison is the Republic of Ireland's high security prison and the place of detention for most of those convicted under the Offences against the State Act, including republican paramilitaries convicted in relation to the Troubles in Northern Ireland. As chief prison officer, Stack was responsible for reviewing security at the prison to prevent escape attempts. Stack's family later believed his efficacy in this role was what motivated his killers. In a 2013 statement, the IRA said \\"In Portlaoise a brutal prison regime saw prisoners and their families suffer greatly. This is the context in which IRA volunteers shot your father.\\" On 25 March 1983, Stack watched an Irish Amateur Boxing Association tournament in the National Stadium in Dublin. He was returning to his parked car on South Circular Road when he was shot in the neck from behind. The shooter escaped on a motorcycle driven by an accomplice. Stack was taken to hospital in a coma. He awoke with paraplegia and brain damage and remained in hospital until his death on 29 September 1984. Investigations Brian Stack's son Austin, later a senior officer at Wheatfield Prison, has been critical of the initial criminal investigation carried out by the Garda S√≠och√°na (police). A 2007‚Äì08 cold case review led to a restart by the National Bureau of Criminal Investigation (NBCI); in 2015, the Irish Independent reported that the NBCI had interviewed a suspect now living in Spain and sent a file to the Director of Public Prosecutions. The IRA initially denied involvement in the shooting. After Gerry Adams' 2013 meeting with Austin Stack, the IRA released a statement that its army council had conducted an internal investigation, determined that some of its members had carried out the shooting, and \\"disciplined\\" the perpetrators for acting without authorisation from their IRA superiors. Sinn F√©in legacy Austin Stack has campaigned for information about his father's killers. In 2013, he and his brother Oliver had several meetings with Gerry Adams. Austin Stack and Adams have given conflicting accounts of the number and locations of the meetings and who else was present at them. Adams claims the Stacks named two Sinn F√©in members of the Oireachtas (parliament) whom they said the Garda suspected of involvement; Adams further claimed the two denied involvement when he questioned them. Stack claims he only asked for names and did not give any names to Adams. In the run-up to the 2016 Irish general election, Stack was critical of Adams' 2013 actions. In December 2016, Adams made a \\"personal explanation\\" in the 32nd D√°il giving his version of the 2013 events; afterwards, Alan Farrell of Fine Gael used parliamentary privilege to suggest Martin Ferris and Dessie Ellis were the two Sinn F√©in members alluded to. Both denied this and alleged Farrell was abusing privilege; Ellis noted that he was in prison at the time of the 1983 shooting. In March 2018, Senator M√°ire Devine was suspended from Sinn F√©in for three months for retweeting a parody Twitter account's tweet describing Brian Stack as a \\"sadist\\". Commemoration On 3 May 2013, Alan Shatter, the Minister for Justice, attended a commemoration at the Midland Prison Centre in Portlaoise, where he unveiled a bust of Stack; renamed Beladd House, location of the Irish Prison Service College, as Brian Stack House; renamed the gold Merit Medal, the Irish Prison Service's highest honour, as the Stack Medal; and presented the first Stack Medal to Brian Stack's widow.

Scorpio. The song was performed live at Go Go Live at the Capital Centre in 1987, and the single was released thereafter. The song also appears on the 1988 compilation album The Go Go Posse. Background On April 15, 1987, D.C. Scorpio was part of a rap contest held at the Chapter III go-go club in Washington, D.C. The winner of the contest would win an opportunity to perform live at the annual go-go concert held at the Capital Centre (the defunct arena formerly located in Landover, Maryland). Doug E. Fresh was one of the honorable judges along with several prominent go- go musicians. D.C. Scorpio won the contest by rapping poignantly about the drug dealing and violence associated with the crack epidemic of the D.C. region in the late-1980s. The song was titled \\"Stone Cold Hustler\\" and D.C. Scorpio performed the song live at Go Go Live at the Capital Centre with Chuck Brown & the Soul Searchers. After the single was released, it quickly became a popular hit and D.C. Scorpio quickly became known as the region's pioneer rapper. Before this point, hip-hip was not popular in the D.C.-region, while go-go music was at its zenith in popularity in D.C. Most hip-hop artists were unable to sellout concerts in D.C. unless a go-go band was on the ticket. However, after the release of \\"Stone Cold Hustler\\" the D.C.-region became more receptive of the hip-hop genre.

It is a city park with nature trails, jogging trails, a playground and picnic areas. The park is heavily used, and has some environmental problems. Location The M√£e Bonif√°cia State Park is in the Duque de Caxias neighborhood of Cuiab√°, the state capital of Mato Grosso. It has an area of . The trees are mostly typical of the cerrado. There are some white-headed marmosets (Callithrix geoffroyi) and other small primates in the park. The park is a popular place for residents of Cuiab√° or tourists to relax with their children. There are paved and sand trails for exercise, with physical exercise equipment, a playground, a lookout that gives a 360o view of the city, and wildlife and flora trails. The longest trail is the Trilha das Bandeiras, at . The park can be visited free of charge from 5:30 am to 6:00 pm daily. It gets about 600 visitors per day, rising to 3,000 on weekends. History The park contains a statue of M√£e Bonif√°cia, after whom it is named. She is said to have been a black healer who lived in Cuiab√° near the park at the turn of the 19th century, and helped escaped slaves to avoid the men hired to recapture them. At that time the park area was dense forest, and contained a quilombo, a settlement of former slaves. There are few if any written records of M√£e Bonif√°cia's life, so almost all that is known comes from oral tradition. Some historians question whether she existed. The M√£e Bonif√°cia Park was created by decree 1.470 of 2000. It was inaugurated in December 2000 by state governor Dante Martins de Oliveira. It is administered by the Secretary of State for the Environment (SEMA). It was re-categorized as a state park by decree 722 of 2011. As a result it should be fully protected, with a natural area largely unchanged by human action, used for scientific, cultural, scenic, educational and recreational purposes, with only indirect use of its resources. A management plan was published in 2013, with an executive summary dated 22 November 2013, which makes recommendations for land use and ways to reduce environmental damage. Issues As of 2011 the region around the park did not have a sewage collection system, apart from a few condominiums that have their own arrangements. Sewage is washed into the nearest streams including the C√≥rrego M√£e Bonif√°cia, which runs through the park and causes an unpleasant odor. Other problems include trash, environmental damage due to the large numbers of visitors, destruction of the riparian forest and the presence of exotic species. Since the park is isolated, some native species may not be viable.

In 1806 a French privateer captured her. The Royal Navy recaptured her in 1809 and took her into service as HMS Vengeur before selling her later that year. Career Lieutenant Donald Campbell was appointed 20 February 1805 to command Tobago. He participated in a successful attack made in company with on two merchantmen, lying for protection under the batteries at Barcelona, on the coast of Caraccas. Campbell left Tobago in July.Marshall (1828), Supplement, Part 2, p.402. Lieutenant John Salomon (acting) assumed command of Tobago towards the close of 1805. He had commanded the prison ship Amboyna. Tobago then spent some months sailing between Grenada, Barbados, and Guadeloupe exchanging prisoners of war. On 6 August Tobago was in company with , , and the schooner when they captured Hercules. =Capture= Before dawn on 18 October 1806 Tobago left Dominica where she had been replenishing her water supplies. Soon after, Salmon sighted a brig, joined by a schooner and a sloop, that all made towards Tobago. Tobago prepared for action, while attempting to steer away from the probably hostile squadron. The enemy closed by 8:30, with the schooner and sloop exchanging fire with Tobago. The French attempted to board, but Tobago repulsed the attempt. She was not able to escape though, and the French schooner was able to get her jib-boom over Tobagos taffrail and rake her with small arms fire. Salmon received a shot in the head and his men took him below decks. Sub-Lieutenant Nichols Gould assumed command and continued the fight for another half-hour but then, with Tobago having lost one man killed and 15 wounded (including Salmon), was forced to strike.

Formation The foundations of the group were laid at the Turkish High School, Music and Folk Dance Competition, organized by the Milliyet newspaper in 1970. ƒ∞zmir Koleji participated in the competition with the song \\"The Only Voice of Only\\". Andreas Wildermann was the keyboardist of the group. Haluk √ñztekin, the guitarist who would join the group later, was also present. In their performances, they sometimes interpreted songs of famous groups such as The Who in addition to their own compositions. In 1973 √ñztekin and Wildermann entered the Aegean University. 21.Peron was founded in Bornova, Izmir, on 11 July 1973, during the meeting of 6 people at the 11th bus stop at 11 o'clock. The first formation of the group included Wildermann on keyboard, √ñztekin and Seyhan Eri≈ü on guitars, Aron Serez on bass, Halil Yildirim on drums, and Alp G√ºltekin on violin. The band used to play both foreign rock music and Anatolian rock music, which was popular during that period. In 1974, they prepared a single for √úmit Tuncaƒü, who had a radio program on TRT (Turkish Radio Television). During this period they began to make their own compositions.

Eurovision Song Contest and dissolution The band participated in the 1979 Eurovision Song Contest with a song called \\"Seviyorum\\" (I love), which was written by Epik. However, a month later, Turkey decided not to participate in the contest, which was to be held in Israel, because of pressure from Arab countries. Epik and 21.Peron recorded long titles like \\"I Love\\" the same year. This record was in the style of soft rock and pop as opposed to Peron's earlier works. Half of the album was composed by Epik, and the other half was composed by 21.Peron. Two of them were Necati Cumali poems (Rainy Sea, & Next to the Day) and two of them came from Orhan Veli Kanƒ±k poems (I can not say, & Suddenly) with their own compositions. They decided to leave Epik and continue their solo career as the group's producers were not satisfied with changes to the group.

Document from the Brazilian National Archives Kasato Maru or Kasado Maru () was a Japanese cargo/passenger ship built by the British shipyard Wigham Richardson in 1900. Originally christened as SS Potos√≠, the ship was bought by the Russian Dobroflot, and renamed Kazan, being used as a hospital ship. She was sunk by the Japanese Navy during the Russo-Japanese War, salvaged and passed to the Japanese control as compensation for war. She was adapted to be a passenger ship and renamed as Kasato Maru and transported the soldiers who had fought in Manchuria back to Japan. She was then used to transport Japanese immigrants to Hawaii in 1906 and to Peru and Mexico in 1907. In 1908, she brought the first official group of Japanese immigrants to Brazil. The trip began at the port of Kobe and ended, 52 days later, at the Port of Santos on June 18, 1908. There came 165 families (781 people) who went to work in the coffee plantations of the west of S√£o Paulo. Some Japanese immigrants arrived at Brazil before Kasato Maru, founding an agricultural colony in the current municipality of Concei√ß√£o de Macabu (then district of Maca√©), in the state of Rio de Janeiro. However, it was the arrival of this first group brought by Kasato Maru that initiated a continuous flow of immigration from Japanese to Brazil. Some of the Kasato Maru's passengers continued to Argentina (see :es:Caf√© El Japon√©s). After some time, Kasato Maru was transformed into a freighter ship and still returned to Brazil a second and last time, in 1917, transporting loads in the service of Osaka Sosen Kaisha (OSK) Line. In 1942 she was requisitioned by the Imperial Japanese Navy and became part of the Japanese fleet in World War II as a support ship. On 9 August 1945, Kasato Maru was bombed by three Soviet aircraft from 11:15. to 14:30. Kasato Maru then sank into the Bering Sea in the Soviet waters near the Kamchatka Peninsula. It is currently submerged to a depth of 18 meters and in good state of conservation.

As a public dispensary, it provided \\"outpatient medical treatment and advice to patients, in contrast to the inpatient service provided by hospitals\\".The eighteenth century dispensary movement. Royal College of Physicians of Edinburgh. Retrieved 29 December 2018. It offered medical treatment for poor women, educated the public on health matters, and provided female medical students with an opportunity to learn and gain experience. History Opened on March 1, 1891, and closed on March 1, 1910, the Dispensary was founded by two Woman's Medical College of Pennsylvania graduates, Kate Campbell Hurd-Mead, M.D. and Alice Hall, M.D. The two came to Baltimore and connected with the organization who petitioned Johns Hopkins Hospital and gained the interest of other individuals in Baltimore to open the clinic. During its existence, it had the same board of managers consisting of Alice T. Hall, Kate Campbell Hurd (Mead), Elizabeth T. King, Julia Rebecca Rogers, Bertha M. Smith, and Kate M. McLane, Anne Galbraith Carey, Dr. Lillian Welsh, M.D.. Their staff included Lilian Welsh, Mary Sherwood, Florence Sabin, and Elizabeth Hurdon, all devoted their time to practice medicine and help patients. Women physicians during this time lacked the opportunities necessary for their field, and the dispensary also provided lectures, medical training, and opportunities to women of higher education seeking post-graduate experience. The free care was offered to the poor and needy, it established clean milk distribution for sick babies, the first visiting nurse and public bath, a social service department, provided a study of midwives and birth registration in Baltimore, as well as a study of tuberculosis. Women now had the opportunity to find care from doctors of the same sex. Founders Lilian Welsh was a board member of the dispensary. She was born in 1858 in Pennsylvania. In 1889, at the age of 31, she received her medical degree from the Women's Medical College. To continue her medical training, she set off to Switzerland. There, she became acquainted with Mary Sherwood, who later recruited Dr. Welsh to become a part of the faculty at Goucher College, formerly known as Women's College of Baltimore. At Goucher College, she taught physiology and hygiene. Throughout her career, she was a leader for public health initiatives, an advocate for women's rights, and worked to persuade medical schools in the surrounding areas to accept women into their medical schools. Julia Rebecca Rogers was one of the many women involved in establishing the Evening Dispensary for Working Women and Girls. In 1898, she also helped found the Baltimore Association for Promoting the University Education of Women. Julia Rebecca Rogers was also one of the women working towards persuading medical schools in the area to accept female students. Julia Rebecca Rogers and Dr. Lillian Welsh were personal friends. Julia Rebecca Rogers became acquainted with Goucher College through Dr. Lillian Welsh. Alongside the former First Lady Lou Hoover, she worked as an honorary chairman of the Citizen's Committee of the Goucher College Building Fund. In 1994, Julia Rebecca Rogers left Goucher College her estate which facilitated the expansion of the College's campus. Kate Campbell Hurd-Mead was born in 1867 in Quebec, Canada. Her interest in medicine was stimulated by her father who was a doctor and Dr. Mary Putnam Jacobi. Dr. Kate Campbell Hurd- Mead was a strong advocate for women's rights, in particular in the medical field. She helped establish the dispensary and was also a part of the first institution to hire women physicians. Dr. Kate Campbell Hurd-Mead obtained her medical degree from the Women's Medical College of Pennsylvania in 1885. Afterwards, she spent a year in Boston, Massachusetts as an intern at Boston's New England Hospital for Women and Children. It was there where she met Dr. Marie Zakrzewska. Dr. Kate Campbell Hurd-Mead help many leadership positions and roles throughout her career. Dr. Kate Campbell Hurd-Mead oversaw the preventative health program at Bryn Mawr School for Girls. Dr. Kate Campbell Hurd-Mead was also a part of the team that incorporated Middlesex County Hospital. Her primary medical interests revolved around public health and gynecology. She obtained her training as a gynecologist in Vienna which led to her practicing gynecology in Connecticut in 1907. After 12 years of practicing as a gynecologist, Dr. Kate Campbell Hurd-Mead retired in 1925. Even after her retirement, she was actively dedicated to the women's rights movement. She continued doing research on women's health and continued to write the history of women in the medical field and medicine. She completed two volumes of the entire history of women in medicine up to the nineteenth century. Unfortunately she passed away in 1941, before she could finish the third volume.

He taught at K√∂nigsberg University and was the first Prussian scholar to hold a teaching chair in Art history and Aesthetics. Family provenance and connections Ernst August Hagen was born in K√∂nigsberg, at that time the administrative capital of East Prussia (and for almost a decade after 1806 when the king fled from Berlin, the home of the Prussian Court). His father, Karl Gottfried Hagen (1749-1829) was a distinguished chemist and the court apothecary. The family was intellectually distinguished and well connected socially. Ernst August's older brother, Carl Heinrich Hagen (1785-1856) was a professor of law and economics and a senior government official who had become became an early and prominent advocate of free trade after studying the work of Adam Smith. A cousin, Gotthilf Hagen (1797-1884), was notable as a hydraulic engineer. His younger sister, Florentine Hagen (1800-1838), later married the physicist-mathematician Franz Ernst Neumann (1798-1895); and as the result of the marriage of his elder sister, Johanna Hagen (1794-1885), he was also a brother-in-law to the astronomer-physicist Friedrich Bessel (1784-1846). In 1807/08, when he was 11, Ernst August and his brothers were taught by their father in the court apothecary, alongside the royal princes Friedrich Wilhelm and Wilhelm. Life Hagen passed his Abitur (school final exams) at the Altstadt Gymnasium which opened the way to his study of natural sciences and medicine in 1816 at the city's \\"Albertina University\\". The subject choice respected his father's wishes. Fairly soon, however, he changed his focus, touring East Prussia with his friend, the young historian Johannes Voigt and familiarising himself with the old artistic monuments dating back to the Teutonic Order as the focus of his stidues switched to arts and literature. He received his doctorate in 1821. His habilitation followed just two years later. He had already, while still a student, published in 1820 his romantic fairy-tale poem, \\"Olfried and Lisena\\", which was spotted by Goethe who judged it very positively. In 1821 he embarked on a lengthy \\"study trip\\" which according to one source lasted two years, although timelines are in places vague so there may, instead, have been more than one trip undertaken, each of shorter duration. During the winter term of 1821/22 he was in G√∂ttingen where he attended the lectures of the classical philologist Otfried M√ºller. He subsequently visited the principal artistic centres in Germany and Italy, making the acquaintance of a number of high-profile figures in arts and scholarship, forming friendships that were both \\"professional\\" and \\"personal\\". By the time he got back to K√∂nigsberg, in 1824, his burgeoning network included Carl Friedrich Gau√ü, Johann Wolfgang von Goethe, Jean Paul and Bertel Thorwaldsen. He now began to lecture on artistic and literary topics. In 1825 Hagen was appointed extraordinary professor in his culture related specialities at the university. He took on the teaching chair in German studies vacated by Karl Lachmann when the latter moved on to Berlin. In 1830 he took a teaching chair in Art History at K√∂nigsberg, the first such academic appointment in Prussia. Hagen received his full professorship in 1831. He was also given oversight of the university's artistic collections. Sources stress the impact of his enthusiasm for his subject. He backed the new city art gallery in 1831. He argued powerfully for the new K√∂nigsberg Arts Academy which opened in 1845, using personal contacts as appropriate, and in the end it was the new king himself, with whom Hagen had studied at the court apothecary back in 1807/08, who signed the cabinet order approving the project in May 1842. Ernst August Hagen was a consummate networker. He used his contacts and friendships in order to promote the development of the arts and arts related institutions in his home city. His circle included Peter von Cornelius (1783‚Äì1876), (1793‚Äì1842), Karl von der Groeben (1788‚Äì1876), Ignaz von Olfers (1826‚Äì1872), Eduard Gerhard (1795‚Äì1867), Wilhelm Eduard Albrecht (1800‚Äì1876), Franz Kugler (1808‚Äì1858), Ludwig Tieck (1773‚Äì1853), Gustav Friedrich Waagen (1794‚Äì1868), William Motherby (1776‚Äì1847), Eduard Devrient (1801‚Äì1877), Karl Schnaase (1798‚Äì1875) and Joseph von Eichendorff (1788‚Äì1857). August Hagen. Eine Ged√§chtnisschrift zu seinem hundertsten Geburtstage. 12 April 1897. Berlin, 1997 Family matters Ernst August Hagen married Emilie C√§cilie \\"Molly\\" Oestreich (1805-1876) at Braunsberg in 1825. Her father, Johann Oestreich, was a merchant from one of the region's leading families. Five of the six recorded children from the marriage, born between 1826 and 1835, survived beyond infancy. Both the sons pursued military careers. Ernst Heinrich Hagen (1831‚Äì1905) became a Lieutenant general and adjutant to Prince Albert of Prussia. He was himself raised to the nobility (thereby becoming identified in subsequent sources as Ernst Heinrich von Hagen) in 1871 and between 1876 and 1882 served as commander of the Number 5 Dragoon Regiment. The elder son, Hans Hagen (1829-1905), became a Lieutenant colonel and director of the Kassel War Academy. Ernst August Hagen remained engaged in K√∂nigsberg's cultural life almost till the end. He died in K√∂nigsberg on 15 February 1880.

Though considered to be temperamentally unsuited to his vocation, he became a strong advocate for better treatment of Australian aborigines, saving whose 'remnants' he considered part of his mission. Early life He was born at Chilwell in Geelong in 1868, the son of John Brown Gribble and Mary Gribble (), and the eldest of nine children. His father was a Methodist and then Congregational Union, and finally Anglican missionary who, disturbed by the systematic injustices visited on Aboriginal people as he had observed them in Jerilderie and elsewhere, wrote A Plea for the Aborigines of New South Wales, and established the Warangesda Mission on the Murrumbidgee river (1880). Ernest showed less than mediocre academic abilities during his schooling at The King's School, Parramatta, despite excelling in sports. Dissuaded from following a military career, he joined his father in a short- lived attempt to set up a mission at Gascoyne River in Western Australia. Local settlers ostracized John Brown Gribble for his public protests at the abuses of Aboriginal workers, and the mission had to be closed in 1887. Career After a time working as a stockman and drover, Ernest accepted a curacy at Tumbarumba in New South Wales for financial reasons. In 1892 John Brown Gribble, who had opened a mission at Yarrabah in Queensland, fell ill, and called on Ernest to take it over in his stead. His father died soon afterwards, and Ernest seems to have been driven by guilt and remorse in pursuing his father's footsteps. Ordained an Anglican priest in 1899, he went on to convert local Aboriginal people, and one, James Noble, became the first Aboriginal person to be ordained deacon. Gribble showed little comprehension of Aboriginal culture, failing to learn even elementary words of the local language at Yarrabah, which he eventually left in 1909, after suffering a breakdown from overwork according to Harris, from guilt over having a child with an Aboriginal woman in 1908, a year after he separated from his wife Emilie Julie Wriede. Gribble had expressed his public opposition to miscegenation. His breakdown could be attributed to the recognition of his own hypocrisy in speaking out publicly against relationships between white and Aboriginal people while he himself had developed a relationship with an Aboriginal woman. He was forced to 'retire' from his position at Yarrabah in the face of pressure from the Anglican church.http://adb.anu.edu.au/biography/gribble-ernest-richard-bulmer- ernie-10367 Forrest River His next mission, in 1913, was to run the Forrest River Mission, which depended on forced removals of indigenous people to maintain itself, and was on the verge of collapse at the time, and which he was asked to take over. His method of management has been described as one of 'autocratic paternalism'. Others speak of his embrace of muscular Christianity. A. P. Elkin regarded him as an incompetent superintendent, dismissing him as a 'conceited, uncouth tyrant' running a 'stud farm' for breeding natives. The food served at the mission was a notorious sludge of porridge, salted meat and stale bread. Under his administration, the sexes were segregated; children were isolated from their parents and relatives by being confined to dormitories, and generally, he seems to have instituted the kind of military barracks system of regimentation, with uniforms, parades and policing, typical of the career he aspired to as a youth. He played a key role in inquiries that exposed the role of police in murdering Aborigines in an incident known as the Forrest River massacre in 1926. His activism led to him being shunned by the white community, and he was dismissed soon afterwards, in 1928, contributing factors being his mismanagement of finances, and the discovery that he had hidden from police investigators facts that would have implicated an Aboriginal resident at the mission in a tribal murder. His offer to take over as chaplain on the aboriginal penal settlement on Palm Island was accepted and he spent his later years there in that capacity. He refused, despite failing health, to retire, and was forcibly removed from his post to Yarrabah in 1957, where he died on 18 October. He was awarded an OBE in 1956. Evaluations One of his biographers endorses the widespread view among settlers that he acted intemperately, a trait he appears to have inherited from his father: > Gribble was very much the son of his father: headstrong, self-righteous, > authoritarian, with a permanent chip on his shoulder and a tendency to blame > others for his or the mission's misfortunes. He thought nothing of knocking > down an aborigines who did something to displease him, or of \\"arresting\\" > aborigines caught killing the mission cattle'.

It was founded in November 2014 by Viki Vaurora. The social stigma associated with cannabis has long been prevalent among many communities in India. The campaign aims to educate people on the history and uses of cannabis and pave way for its legalisation to initiate a nationwide green industrial setup replacing thousands of ecologically damaging products with sustainable hemp-based alternatives. History of cannabis use in India Cannabis (Vijaya) has been used since ancient times in India, dating back to 2000 BCE. The cannabis plant has been mentioned as one of the five sacred plants in the Vedas. Bhang, an edible preparation of cannabis consumed either in the form of a drink or smoked is common during the Hindu festivals of Holi and Mahashivaratri. Legislation of cannabis India had no legislation on narcotic substances till 1985. On 14 November 1985, the Indian government banned the use of cannabis by passing the Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances Act, 1985. Under the act, it is illegal for a person to cultivate, possess, sell, purchase and consume narcotic and psychotropic substances. Violation of the law attracts a fine and/or imprisonment depending on the quantity of the banned substance. The act has come under criticism in the country, especially with the legalisation of cannabis in some US states. Campaign GLM India planned to launch several campaigns across cities like Bengaluru, Mumbai, Delhi and Pune. The first Medical Cannabis Conference was held in Bengaluru on 10 May 2015. Rick Simpson, a Canadian who has been using cannabis oil to treat medical conditions like cancer was the guest at the conference. The conference in Mumbai had to be cancelled after the management of the venue withdrew permission to host the meeting. In 2018 the campaign started a web series titled The Gaanja Situation to encourage debate on the legalisation of cannabis for medical and industrial uses.

Ideologically characterized by progressive ideas and including socialist elements, its founding roots can be traced to the late 1980s in the town of Midyat in Turkey. The modern manifestation of the movement is controversial among Assyrian organizations worldwide, particularly due to its ties to the militant Kurdistan Workers' Party (PKK) and the Democratic Union Party (PYD). The movement is also controversial for its alleged role in human rights abuses against Assyrians in Syria, often allegedly under the orders of the previously mentioned organizations. A symbol used by multiple Dawronoye organizations History Flag of the Bethnahrin Freedom Party In the late 1980s, a group of Assyrian youth gathered in Midyat to discuss the situation of Assyrians in Turkey after an increase of attacks directed at them. Assyrians were not recognized as a distinct ethnic group with their own language, and suffered from discrimination and oppression. The continued violence had led to a wave of migration of Assyrians towards Europe, leading a group of Assyrians to create an organization that had the main goal of preventing the exodus of Assyrians from the Assyrian homeland. This organization came to be known as \\"Tukoso Dawronoyo Mothonoyo d‚ÄôBethnahrin\\", translated as the \\"Patriotic Revolutionary Organization of Bethnahrin\\". The etymology behind \\"Dawronoye\\" shows that the word is understood to mean \\"revolutionaries\\" when in fact it turned out to mean \\"the modern\\". The founding members of Dawronoye found a correlation between the struggle of the Assyrians and Kurds in Turkey, prompting members of the movement to join the local support network of the Kurdistan Workers Party (PKK). Eventually, members of Dawronoye were arrested for their involvement with the PKK and later released, leading to the migration of some members of the movement to Europe where a diaspora network was eventually founded in European nations such as Sweden, Netherlands, Belgium, Austria and Germany. In 2000, Dawronoye held their first congress, and members reorganized as the Bethnahrin Freedom Party (Gabo d‚ÄôHirutho d‚ÄôBethnahrin, or GHB). Ideology The organization originated in the late 1980s from the radical left and describes itself as being \\"revolutionary socialist\\". Its initial purpose was to attain national rights of Assyrians in Turkey and prevent the exodus of Assyrians from their native homeland. However, the organization's goals were not confined to national rights, but extended to bringing out wider social, political, and cultural change. Dawronoye avoided involvement with the Assyrian/Syriac name dispute, holding both the Assyrian and Syriac flags at events and would circumvent the name dispute by rallying around the less controversial name of their homeland - Bethnahrain. Dawronoye pushed the idea that Assyrians/Syriacs are the same people, with the same homeland. Iraq There is a network of Dawronoye created civil society organizations and parties across modern state boundaries in the Assyrian homeland region. Among the Dawronoye affiliated organizations in Iraq are the Beth Nahrin Patriotic Union (Huyodo Bethnahrin Athronoyo, HBA) and the Nineveh Plain Forces (NPF) militia. On 17 July 1999, the Dawronoye-affiliated Patriotic Revolutionary Organization of Bet Nahrain (PROB) carried out its first attack alongside with the Kurdistan Workers' Party (PKK) against a KDP military compound in the town of Kasre, where 39 Peshmerga fighters were killed and 20 injured. Three days later a second attack was carried out by the group in which several of Masoud Barzani's fighters were killed when an army truck driving on a bridge between Kasre and Hajji Umran was blown up. Both attacks were claimed to be in retaliation to the death of an Assyrian woman, Helen A. Sawa, who was allegedly raped and murdered by a senior KDP official.RFE/RL iraq Report The political wing of the Dawronoye movement in Iraq is the Patriotic Union of Beth Nahrian (PUBN) which was previously on the Ishtar Patriotic List and runs for seats in the Council of Representatives of Iraq and the Iraqi Kurdistan Parliament. Another Dawronoye affiliated political party in Iraq includes the Syriac Assembly Movement which is based in the Assyrian town of Bakhdida. Both the PUBN and Syriac Assembly Movement have been in favour of the creation of an autonomous region in the Assyrian-dominated Nineveh plain. The Nineveh Plain Forces (NPF) was formed on 6 January 2015 in cooperation with the Bet-Nahrain Democratic Party to defend the Nineveh Plain against the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant. The armed force later participated in the Battle of Mosul (2016‚Äì2017) to liberate the Assyrian towns/villages from jihadists. Syria A flag used by the Syriac Union Party to represent Assyrian-Syriacs The movement is currently most prominent in Syria, with the Dawronoye affiliated Syriac Union Party (SUP), which is a major partner in the governing Movement for a Democratic Society (TEV-DEM) coalition of the Federation of Northern Syria - Rojava, led by the Kurdish Democratic Union Party (PYD). The SUP operates the Syriac Military Council (MFS) and Bethnahrain Women's Protection Forces (HSNB) militia which are a part of the Syrian Democratic Forces, as well as the Sutoro police force to protect Assyrian communities in their settlement areas in northeast Syria (Gozarto). Europe Most of Dawronoye's activities in Europe centred around the Assyrian genocide, commonly known between Assyrians as \\"Seyfo\\", which Turkey refuses to recognize to this present day. Activism for genocide recognition would include street protests, hunger strikes, and building occupations. A notable event included the day 100 members of Dawronoye forced entry and occupied a government building in Lausanne, Switzerland where the Treaty of Lausanne was signed. The purpose of the occupation was to attract the attention of the media and Swiss government on the denial of Assyrian rights in Turkey due to the Treaty of Lausanne, the continued oppression on the Assyrian people in Turkey, and to call for international recognition of the Assyrian genocide. On 15 August 2012, members of the Dawronoye-affiliated Syriac Union Party stormed the Syrian embassy in Stockholm in protest of the Syrian government. A dozen of its members were later detained by Swedish police. A number of delegates representing several Assyrian cultural-political organizations in Europe attended a congress held in Brussels between the 14th and 15 May 2004, to form an alliance that could represent Assyrians in Europe with governmental bodies such as the European Union and European Council. This alliance came to be known as the European Syriac Union with an associated youth group called the ESU Youth. In 2004, a satellite television channel, Suroyo TV, was formed by Dawronoye-affiliated members and broadcast from S√∂dert√§lje in the Western Syriac and Eastern Syriac dialects. Criticism =Criticism by Assyrians= Other Assyrian membership organisations, in particular those upholding a more traditional interpretation of Assyrian identity, are critical of Dawronoye. With respect to Syria, such organisations have alleged \\"continued attempts of the PYD to divide and rule the Assyrians in Syria\\". Some Assyrians and the organizations that represent them are critical of the fact that the movement is allegidly funded entirely by the PKK and the PYD, and claim that the movement exists to serve the interests of those groups. Dawronoye argue that they are both financially and politically independent from the PKK albeit having worked with and being helped by the PKK in the past. A report by Assyrian activist Max Joseph alleged that the leadership of the Dawronoye movement had engaged in numerous cases of abuses of the Assyrian people, including: The report claimed that the Dawronoye movement existed to create a sense of pluralism and inclusion of Assyrians to the outside world by Kurdish leadership in Syria. They also claim that it serves to advance Kurdish-nationalist interests within the Assyrian community of Syria. =Closure of Assyrian schools= A 2018 report alleged that Kurdish authorities in Syria, in conjunction with Dawronoye officials, had shut down several Assyrian schools in Northern Syria and fired their administration. This was said to be because these schooled failed to register for a license and for rejecting the new curriculum approved by the Education Authority. Closure methods ranged from officially shutting down schools to having armed men enter the schools and shut them down forcefully. An Assyrian educator named Isa Rashid was later badly beaten outside of his home for rejecting the Kurdish self-administration‚Äôs curriculum. The Assyrian policy institute (API) also alleged that PYD and Dawronoye affiliated authorities had forcefully broken and replaced locks in schools and fired all of their staff without warning. From 1935 until then, these schools had operated under the control of the Syriac Orthodox Church and taught the Syriac language to their students. The API stated that this was an effort by the PYD to \\"impose a Kurdish nationalist curriculum onto all areas it governs.\\" The forced closures were condemned by the Assyrian Democratic Organization and eventually led to widespread protests by Assyrian civilians in the area. =Souleman Yusph controversy= In 2018, the Assyrian Policy Institute reported that Assyrian journalist Souleman Yusph was arrested by the Kurdish Self-Administration in Syria through Dawronoye affiliated forces, allegidly due to his reporting of purported human rights violations enacted by PYK and Dawronoye authorities in Syria. This included forced closures of Assyrian schools, intimidation and imprisonment of rivals, and the severe beating of Isa Rashid. Yusph was also critical of the Dawronoye movement and posted videos on his personal Facebook page of individuals in the movement forcefully closing schools and intimidating residents, which the API alleged had a role in his arrest. The API urged the Kurdish self-administration to release Yusph.

The building was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2017. due to its significance to American music culture and being the heart of the Tulsa Sound. Originally built in 1915 as Grace Methodist Episcopal Church, the stone structure located at 304 South Trenton Avenue in Tulsa's Pearl District was converted to a recording studio in 1972 by Leon Russell, who bought the building and adjoining properties for his diverse recording activities and as a home for Shelter Records, the company he had earlier started with partner Denny Cordell. Numerous musicians recorded at The Church, including Willie Nelson, Eric Clapton, Bonnie Raitt, Dwight Twilley, Dr. John, JJ Cale, The Gap Band, Freddie King, Phoebe Snow and Peter Tosh. Tom Petty, with his early band Mudcrutch, signed his first record deal with Shelter Records there.Paul Zollo, \\"Tom Petty: Purity and Passion\\", American Songwriter, November 1, 2005.

At the time of her death, she held the position of Distinguished McKnight University Professor and Irving B. Harris Professor of Child Psychology at the Institute of Child Development, University of Minnesota. Crick received prestigious awards for her contributions as a scientist, including the American Psychological Association Award for Distinguished Early Career Contributions to Psychology in 2002 and the Boyd McCandless Award from APA Division 7 (Developmental Psychology) in 1995. She was a Fellow of the Association for Psychological Science and the American Psychological Association (Division 7).  Biography  Crick received her B.A./B.S. degree in psychology and a master's degree in human development and family studies at Purdue University. She went to graduate school at Vanderbilt University where she obtained her Ph.D in Clinical Psychology in 1992, under the supervision of Kenneth Dodge. After graduating, she joined the faculty of the Department of Psychology at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champagne. In 1996, Crick moved to the University of Minnesota where she served on the faculty of the Institute of Child Development.  Research  Crick's research career aimed to promote positive youth development. Her work on peer victimization has had a huge impact on society as a whole. Peer victimization is the experience among children of being a target of the aggressive behavior of other children, who are not siblings and not necessarily age-mates. Crick observed that forms of peer maltreatment that were common in boys' peer groups tended to occur much less frequently in girls' peer groups, and concluded that girls were more often relationally victimized, whereas boys were more overtly victimized. Crick published a number of influential articles on peer victimization including \\"An observational study of delivered and received aggression, gender, and social-psychological adjustment in preschool: \\"This White Crayon Doesn't Work ...\\". Crick's work on childhood aggression demonstrated that, as a group, boys are more physically aggressive than girls. Her study hypothesized that this finding reflects a lack of research on forms of aggression that are relevant to girls rather than an actual gender difference in levels of overall aggressiveness. The form of aggression hypothesized to be typical of girls, relational aggression, was assessed with a peer nomination instrument in third- through sixth-grade children. Results provided evidence for the validity and distinctiveness of the construct of relational aggression, defined as acts intended to harm others through deliberate manipulation of their social standing and relationships. In addition to finding that girls tended to be more relationally aggressive than boys, she found evidence that relationally aggressive children were at risk for serious adjustment difficulties. Crick's innovative research on relational aggression examined behaviors involving social exclusion or spreading malicious rumors. The research showed that girls are more likely to engage in relational forms of aggression than the physical forms of aggression that had previously captured the majority of empirical attention. Crick's research documented the harmful consequence of relation aggression for victims and perpetrators, which forced aggression researchers to expand their studies of aggressions to include a wider range of aggressive behaviors. At heart, she was an astute methodologist who took risks to develop reliable and reasonable measures. Her combination of theoretical and methodological intensity essentially changed the way that people study aggression today.  Representative publications  * Cicchetti, D., & Crick, N. R. (Eds.).

She has been a Fellow of the American Psychological Association and the American Psychological Society since 2006. She is currently Professor of Psychology and Neural Science at New York University (NYU) where she leads the Infant Action Lab at NYU, focusing on the study of behavioral flexibility in motor development.  Research  Adolph's work examines how individuals learn to adapt to changes in their bodies and develop skills to handle variation in the environment. She examines motor skill acquisition in infant humans and monkeys in order to track learning and development. Although much of her work has focused on infant development, the Infant Action Lab also conducts studies with children and adults. One of their main research methodologies involves developing tasks that challenge infants, children, and adults with novel predicaments, such as crawling over bridges, squeezing through apertures, swinging over monkey bars, and reaching for targets with the body in motion. Adolph has studied infant locomotion and coordination by using infant head-mounted eye-tracking cameras to examine infants' patterns of visual attention as they played in a toy filled room with their mothers.

She is best known for her research in the fields of motivation and self- regulation in work settings. Kanfer has received numerous awards for her research contributions including the American Psychological Association Distinguished Scientific Award for an Early Career Contribution in Applied Research in 1989, the Society for Industrial and Organizational Psychology (SIOP) William R. Owens Scholarly Achievement Award in 2006 and the SIOP Distinguished Scientific Contributions Award in 2007. Ruth Kanfer has authored influential papers on a variety of topics including the effects of Advanced Placement courses on college performance, motivation in the aging workforce, emotion regulation, and person determinants of contextual work behaviors.  Biography  Ruth Kanfer received her Ph.D. from Arizona State University in 1981. Kanfer went on to complete a postdoctoral fellowship at the University of Illinois. She began her career at the University of Minnesota and currently works at professor at the Georgia Institute of Technology. Throughout her career, Kanfer's research has addressed the impact that personality, motivation, self-regulation and emotion have on the behavior and performance levels of individuals in their work settings. Kanfer is a co director of the GT PARK Lab, which provides a space for graduate students to conduct research in cognitive, aging, personality, social, and applied psychology. Kanfer has edited volumes on Work Motivation, Emotions in the Workplace, and Abilities Motivation and Methodology. Support for Kanfer's research work has been provided by grants from the National Science Foundation, the Office of Naval Research, and the Air Force Office of Scientific Research.  Research  Ruth Kanfer is a psychologist known for her research in the role of motivation in a work setting. One of her research studies focused on age and reemployment success after a job loss. She focused on people who were aged 40 and over but were unemployed. Kanfer proposed that chronological age affects job search and reemployment outcomes after job loss. She used a meta-analysis and two supplemental datasets to examine the strength of the relationship between age and speed of reemployment, and whether the relationship between age and reemployment was mediated by job search activities. Her research documented difficulties that people over the age of 50 have in finding jobs, which affects their lives and how they will live after that age. Another study conducted by Kanfer and colleagues focused on college achievement after completion of Advanced Placement (AP) exams. AP is a program administered by the College Board offering college level material in high schools and administering annual examinations to assess students' understanding of the material. Kanfer used a sample of 26,693 students who entered the Georgia Institute of Technology as first-year undergraduates over a ten-year period (1999-2009) to explore the numbers of AP exams taken and performance on the exams in relation to college academic performance, interest in STEM versus non STEM majors, and graduation rates. They obtained admissions records and college transcripts, and examined whether performance on AP exams correlated with success in college. Students with more AP course credits tended to complete fewer lower-level college courses and more higher-level courses than students without AP credit. These students completed college coursework in fewer semesters and had a higher graduation rate. They found students to have more interest in choosing a STEM major if they had received credit for AP Calculus and completed of three or more AP exams in STEM areas. Kanfer and colleagues recommended that admissions committees should consider the actual AP exam performance data instead of just the AP enrollment data as predictors of college academic performance.

The team previously bore the name of its parent club, Mdina Knights F.C. In 2018, the team won its first silverware in the Maltese Futsal Knockout Cup. History =Season 2014‚Äì15= In 2014, after a multi-year hiatus, the futsal section of the Mdina Knights began to play again. The move was prompted by officials from Kunsill Studenti Universitarji and Malta University Sports Club officials, who suggested the football club recruit University of Malta students to play on the team. On September 15, 2014, the team played their first match against Mqabba, a match which ended in a three-to-three tie. The team ultimately finished their first season mid-table, surpassing the team's own expectations. Their wins included a victory over Luqa, a ten-to-zero shutout of Birzebbuga, and an upset against the then league leader, Mellieha. The team was the last opponent of Lija Futsal, who won the division title. In their match against Birzebbuga, vice-captain Cleaven Portelli registered the fastest goal of the season, scoring 13 seconds after the match's start. =Season 2015‚Äì16= After a positive inaugural season, the team sought a number of corporate partners. The team added Gaetano Gesualdi and other new players to their roster. The team strengthened its structures together with a healthy financial position, including charity for academic research towards Motor neuron diseases as part of its social responsibility, but found it difficult to adapt to the format change in the Maltese Futsal League. Although the team started positively, it finished in the eleventh place out of 14 teams. The Students were defeated by Swieqi United Futsal, Hamrun Futsal, and Luxol St Andrews Futsal Club, and were narrowly defeated by Sirens, Mqabba, and Zebbug. The team recovered toward the end of the season and won against Marsascala, Gozo, and Qrendi. =Season 2016‚Äì17= The team grew and because Futsal Malta Association regulations allowed teams to compete independently from any club within the Maltese football league system, Mdina Knights F.C. and the Student section ceased collaboration in 2016. The University of Malta Students' Futsal Team team became an independent organisation and was recognised as an official student organisation by the senate of the University of Malta. The team crowd funded its away kit, which would include the names of all those who contributed, in 2016. In 2016‚Äì17, the team saw unprecedented successful performances (except for the match against Hamrun), and won important matches, for example, against Msida Futsal. The team entered the race for the Elite Group of the Gatorade Futsal League. With a draw against Sliema Futsal, the team achieved Elite status for the first time. =Season 2017‚Äì18= In the 2017‚Äì18 season, the team aimed to enter the Elite Round once again and was considered on par with the strongest clubs. However the club did not make it to the top round of Maltese futsal. The club also failed to win the Division One play-offs. Having finished first in the Division One pool, the team played a semi-final against Tarxien JMI and exited on penalties after a draw. In the Maltese Futsal Knockout Cup, the club managed to defeat Valletta FC Futsal Club in the quarter finals to arrive at the finals. The club defeated Luxol St Andrews Futsal Club with a five-to-two score and claimed its first trophy in Maltese domestic futsal. The team later presented the trophy to the rector of the University of Malta. =Season 2018‚Äì19= The team saw major changes in the squad‚Äîthe departure of several key players, including Shawn Deguara to Valletta FC Futsal Club, and the departure of Kyle Sultana as coach. Former player Djordje Maksimoviƒá was appointed as the new coach. The University Futsal Team confirmed its participation in the 2018‚Äì19 Maltese Futsal League. Having won the Knockout Cup in the previous season, the club became eligible to contest the Maltese Futsal Super Cup. The University Team was defeated by Valletta FC Futsal by thirteen-to-one which made them the runners-up of the Super Cup. The club appointed Clayton Felice as new coach. The team opened its league commitments on October 5 against UM Futsal Academy, its own academy team, and won nine-to-one. Three days later, on October 8, Luxol won against the senior University side eight-to-one. Birkirkara gained their first three points against University on October 17, winning seven-to- four. New player Lee Grech proved a revelation and was called up to the Malta national futsal team. Grech scored the only goal for Malta on his debut on October 25, 2018, but the team lost two-to-one to the Northern Ireland national futsal team.

Born in London to Dutch parents, she was married first to William Reeve and later to William Lyon. Despite restrictions on women and foreigners, she was allowed to work as an apothecary with her first husband and to continue the business after his death. The Company of Apothecaries also judged that she was sufficiently skilled to supervise her second husband's training as an apothecary after her remarriage. Ownership and accreditation The activities of apothecaries in London were policed by the Company (or Society) of Apothecaries, chartered in 1617. Apprenticeship was a lengthy process, requiring a seven-year training period. This guild had the right to enter and investigate the premises of anyone exercising any part of \\"the Art or Mystery of Apothecaries\\" in the city of London and its environs, and to decide whether they were competent. Foreigners were barred from membership in the guild. Women could not attend university to obtain formal training. Married women could not legally own property, but it was possible for the widow of an apothecary to take over her husband's pharmaceutical business if she could convince the London guild that she was competent to do so. Susan Reeve, although she was of Dutch extraction, had been born in London. Her first husband, William Reeve, came from Wesel in the Duchy of Cleves. Nonetheless, the Company of Apothecaries allowed Susan and William Reeve to work as apothecaries. In 1617 they were recorded as living within the walls of London on Aldgate Street, and in 1618 in Limestreet Ward. In 1619, records show that William Reeve attended Lady Townshend. After William Reeve's death, Susan Reeve was considered competent to own and manage the business as a widow and to supervise an apprentice, Thomas Beedham. Remarriage In 1627 Susan Reeve remarried, to William Lyon. The Apothecaries guild did not consider her new husband to be sufficiently skilled to practice as an apothecary, describing him as \\"No artist.\\" Susan, however, was judged to be skilled. In 1629, the Court of Assistants of the Society of the Apothecaries decided that she would be allowed to supervise her second husband and ensure that he acquired the skills considered necessary by the guild.  The College of Physicians  Reeve's preparations were purchased by medical practitioners such as Arnold Boet and Gerard Boate, for resale to their patients. The Boates had qualified as doctors at the University of Leyden, but as Dutch physicians were at first considered \\"irregular practitioners\\" not approved to practice by the College of Physicians of London (CPL). As a result, in 1632, Susan Reeve Lyon was prosecuted by the College of Physicians for selling medicines to an unlicensed physician. The college did not, however, question the quality of the medicines she prepared or her credentials as an apothecary.

Mostly the nitrophily is consistent with the nitrate availability, where the lowest values occur with plants that grow in peat bogs (such as Drosera- and Erica-species), while the highest values occur with plants that grow on fresh organic waste such as dung piles, waste heaps and strandlines (such as Chenopodium-, and Urtica-species).

In 2002, Segerstrom was the first prize recipient of the Templeton Positive Psychology Prize for her work \\"aimed at understanding the processes behind optimistic dispositions and beliefs and, in particular, how these processes relate to the functioning of the immune system\\". She has served as President of the American Psychosomatic Society and is a Fellow of the Association for Psychological Science. Segerstrom attended Lewis and Clark College where she received a bachelor's degree in psychology and music (1990). After completing M.A. and Ph.D. degrees in clinical psychology at UCLA (1997), and a clinical internship in psychology at Vancouver Hospital and Health Sciences Center (University of British Columbia), Segerstrom went on to earn a M.P.H. degree in biostatistics from the University of Kentucky (2017). Segerstrom became involved in the study of optimism when she was a graduate student studying under the supervision of Shelley E. Taylor at UCLA. Segerstrom was awarded the Martin E. P. Seligman Award for Outstanding Dissertation Research on the Science of Optimism and Hope from the American Psychological Association. More recent longitudinal research, funded through grants from the National Institute on Aging, has focused on well being, self- regulation, and health in older adults.  Research  Segerstrom's research examines the impact of differences in cognition, emotion, and personality factors (e.g., optimism) on psychological well-being, health, and physiological functions (e.g., immune system). She is known for her research on disappointment and emotional approach coping. She is also known for her work drawing a connection between optimism and psychosocial factors in HIV patients. One aspect of Suzanne's research focuses on optimism in relation to the functioning of the immune system. She conducted a research study with Sandra Sephton (University of Louisville) to figure out how law students' expectations for their future affected their immune response. The results of the research study suggested that optimism yields health benefits. Other studies besides Segerstrom's similarly suggest that people who have positive attitudes have better health outcomes.

She is well known for her research on parent-child narrative (i.e., story telling and reminiscing) in relation to the development of autobiographical memory. Fivush is affiliated with the Departments of Psychology and Women's Studies at Emory. Fivush is the author of Family Narratives and the Development of an Autobiographical Self, coauthor with Susan Golombok, of the volume Gender Development. She has co-edited several volumes including The Remembering Self: Construction and Accuracy in the Self- Narrative (with Ulric Neisser), Autobiographical Memory and the Construction of A Narrative Self: Developmental and Cultural Perspectives (with Catherine Haden), Emotion in Memory and Development: Biological, Cognitive, and Social Considerations (with Jodi Quas), and The Wiley Handbook on the Development of Children's Memory (with Patricia Bauer).  Biography  Fivush completed an undergraduate degree in Psychology at the State University of New York at Stony Brook in 1975, and a master's degree in Psychology at The New School for Social Research in 1977. Fivush continued her education at The Graduate Center, CUNY, where she obtained a PhD in Developmental in 1983, under the supervision of Katherine Nelson. Her dissertation examined kindergarten children's temporally organized, script-like representations of the school day. From 1983 to 1984, Fivush was a postdoctoral fellow at the University of California at San Diego, where she collaborated with Jean Mandler on studies of young children's development of categories and their understanding of temporal sequences. Throughout her career Fivush has focused on the development of autobiographical memory and its connection to parent-child conversational practices, gender, and self-identity. She has written over 150 scholarly articles and books. Her research has been supported by grants from the National Science Foundation, the Spencer Foundation, the John Templeton Foundation, and the National Institute of Child Health and Human Development.  Research  Fivush is most well known for her research on the complex interplay between children's storytelling abilities and their creation of autobiographical memories. According to Fivush, stories serve as an important cultural tool for expressing our understanding of feelings and beliefs and the ways in which a child constructs a story about an event is directly related to their internal representation of that experience. Children learn how to enter into narrative discourse about the past through early conversations and social interaction. This social interactionist approach is based on a dialectical model in which the child internalizes adult thought through participation in joint activities where memories are experienced and shared. During social transactions, the child begins to understand the structures necessary for storing, organizing, and recalling memories. Research has identified two main parent communication styles: paradigmatic (characterized by repetitive questioning and a focus on categorical information) and elaborate (characterized by evaluative commenting that included information such as cause, motivations, emotions and mental states). Fivush suggests that a child's exposure to one type of narrative over another may result in a similar narrative organization in the child. Fivush conducted research indicating that mothers who used more evaluations and emotional comments during parent-child conversations about the past have children who included more evaluative and emotional information in their own autobiographical narratives later on. Fivush suggested that in conversations with a parent about a past experience, the child may recognize that the feelings and thoughts that they had about the experience differ from their parent's feelings, by direct comparison of what each person brought to the conversation. Hence parent-guided reminiscing helps children to organize, interpret, and evaluate past experiences in ways that give them the chance to cultivate their sense of self. Two approaches have been used in studies examining parent-child reminiscing about the past in an effort to answer the question ‚ÄúWhat does the mother contribute to the conversation?‚Äù The first focuses on the process through which the mother engages the child when talking about a previous emotional experience. Fivush and her colleagues describe two maternal styles of speech that are frequently used when conversing with young children: Mothers who exhibit a highly elaborative style provide a multitude of details about the event and foster their children's involvement in the conversation by evaluating what their child has to say. In contrast, mothers who display a highly repetitive style, tend to focus on a few details about the event, ask redundant questions of their child, and rarely encourage their child's participation in the conversation. Of these two maternal speech styles, elaboration has been found to be beneficial for children's development of autobiographical memory, literacy, narrative skills, theory of mind, and understanding of self and emotion. Children of highly elaborative mothers are more elaborative themselves when recollecting previous experiences. Other research has shown that mothers of girls are more elaborative than mothers of boys and, in turn, girls are more elaborative than boys. The second approach focuses on content, examining maternal speech for the specific subject matter introduced to the conversation. The content approach has been primarily used to investigate gendered patterns in maternal speech as they relate to children's speech. For example, Fivush and colleagues observed that mothers talked more about emotions with girls than boys, especially when those conversations concerned experiences of sadness. Other research has shown that by the end of preschool, girls tend to talk more about emotions, and sadness in particular, when compared to boys. Fivush has also created a scale that examines children's knowledge of their family history using 20 Yes/No questions. In this study, Fivush and her colleagues argue that knowledge of one's family history is correlated with multiple positive aspects of well-being, including higher self-esteem, better family functioning, and lower anxiety. This scale has also gained interest and attention in mainstream media outlets.

A well-known work of art, Mondrian contributes to the abstract visual language in a large way despite using a relatively small canvas. Thick, black brushwork defines the borders of the different geometric figures. Comparably, the black brushwork on the canvas is minimal but it is masterfully applied to become one of the defining features of the work. Mondrian's origins and connection with De Stijl Composition II with Red Blue and Yellow is a product of the Dutch De Stijl movement, which translates to ‚ÄúThe Style‚Äù. The De Stijl foundation can be viewed as an overlapping of individual theoretical and artistic pursuits. Mondrian is widely seen as the prominent artist for the movement and is thus held responsible for bringing popularity to the rather obscure style. Born in the Netherlands in 1872, Mondrian is cited as always having an interest in art. This transformed from a hobby to a passion when his uncle, Fritz Mondrian (a professional painter), helped him move to Amsterdam where he studied for three years at the Academy of Fine Arts under the master August Alleb√©. When he moved to Paris in 1910, Mondrian began to discover his potential. It was in Paris that he was introduced to Cubism, a major influence to his work. He is quoted as having said ‚Äúof all the abstraction artists, I felt only the Cubists had found the right path.‚Äù . He still found this style too naturalistic however, and began to dive even deeper into abstraction. A short visit back to the Netherlands led to an extended stay for five years due to the outbreak of World War 1 (1914). Although an unexpected turn of events, Mondrian made many important connections during this time that led to establishment of De Stijl. An encounter with fellow Dutch artist Bart van der Leck provided ground for Mondrian to exchange ideas. From van der Leck he received the concept of painting flat areas of pure color; a solution to Mondrian's problem of coloring ‚Äì he was then using color in what he considered an Impressionist way, which was too restless and emotional. In return, van der Leck adopted Mondrian's concept of crossed vertical and horizontal lines as a basis for composition. These two technical elements are consistent throughout all of Mondrian's work. Shortly after the formation of Mondrian and van der Leck's working relationship, they were contacted by Theo van Doesburg, a painter who frequently wrote about art for different periodicals and who is considered the propagandist of the De Stijl movement. He invited Mondrian and van der Leck to join his initiative to start an artistic review periodical. They agreed and the result of this was the journal entitled De Stijl. De Stijl Together they formed an artistic collective that consisted not only of painters but also architects; the movement was confined to strictly Dutch areas due to war. These artists cannot be considered the same. For example, not all De Stijl artists produced work that mimicked Mondrian. It was more a group of individual artists/architects who applied similar and distinct techniques to their work in hopes of achieving a similar, theoretical goal. Mondrian attempts to define the ambition of De Stijl artists in his personal artistic manifesto, Neo-Plasticist in Painting (1917). To create the essence of life itself through abstraction, which relies on what he refers to as the universal means of expression: straight lines and primary colors. This essence of life can be illustrated by transcending the particular to express the universal. Mondrian claimed the particular to be associated with a Romantic, subjective appeal. Thus, the universal must be something that goes beyond the surface of nature. Mondrian's art also had a clear spiritual quality to it. He practiced Theosophy, a self-styled universal religion rooted in mystic, oriental interpretation that promoted opposites as a form of unity. Theosophical philosophy informing Mondrian's art is evidence of their shared terminology. Nieuwe Beelding, a word used in Theosophical teachings, makes an appearance in Mondrian's work in a major way: as an alternative title to De Stijl, Nieuwe Beelding translates to Neo-Plasticism, a term used in Mondrian's personal essays to describe his art. Individual efforts Examining Composition with Red Blue and Yellow, Mondrian's De Stijl practices are in full effect. The contrasting horizontal and vertical lines represent to Mondrian an active relationship in which he intended to mimic the rhythm and vibrations of life that transcends symbolic knowledge. The reduced colours of red blue and yellow and accentuated thick, black lines that cross over each other are similarly rendered. His depiction of inner reality (essence of life), is believed to be found through the interplay of contrasting pictorial elements. It is arguable that all elements found within Composition are contrasting and thus indicative of the inner harmony of life that lies beneath the surface. Mondrian theories do not accumulate in Composition; he did not even consider this is a success. He called it ‚Äústatic.‚Äù He continued to progress and refine his work, and it is in his final pieces of work before his death (1944) that he achieves some satisfaction. Despite De Stijl being a movement confined to Dutch regions, many credit the movement, and specifically Mondrian, as having played a major role in articulating the abstract landscape and defining the current terms for the art world today.

The union originated in 1873 in Sheffield as a federation of local unions, from Birmingham, Kingston-upon-Hull, Liverpool, Newcastle, Nottingham, South Shields, Stockton- on-Tees, Sunderland and York. In 1885, the federation was reconstituted as an amalgamated union named the Amalgamated Slaters of England Provident Society, by which time it was based in Newcastle, and had only a very low membership - just 167 workers in 1887.Arthur Marsh and Victoria Ryan, Historical Directory of British Trade Unions, vol.3, p.94 In its early years, the union focused on the welfare of its members, and secondarily on regulation of the trade, to prevent too many people competing for work. In order to encourage this, men aged under twenty-one could join the union for free, but older men had to pay increasingly high entry fees. Membership of the union grew steadily, reaching 318 in 1890, 1,039 by 1896 and peaking at 1,497 in 1900. Around this time, it changed its name to the Amalgamated Slaters and Tilers Provident Society of England and Ireland, but it generally remained known by its earlier title. In 1906, R. Wilson was appointed as its first full-time general secretary, but he was unable to aid with recruitment, membership falling below 1,000 by 1910.

It has been a Grade II* listed building since 1951. As a traditional catholic parish, it is a member of Forward in Faith and receives alternative episcopal oversight from the Bishop of Ebbsfleet (currently Jonathan Goodall). History The church from the west The earliest record of a parish church in Torrington is of 1259, when a vicar was appointed, but there was probably an earlier church on the site. The oldest surviving parts of the building date to the 13th or 14th century. In February 1646 the bell tower was blown up in the Battle of Torrington, a battle of the First English Civil War. The Royalists who held the town had stored some 80 barrels of gunpowder in the church. The Parliamentarians as they captured the town shut their prisoners in the church and somehow the powder was detonated with great loss of life. The blast is believed to have come from the south transept (the old tower) in a north-westerly direction, destroying several pillars and the fire that followed destroyed old furnishings and monuments.The Parish Church of St Michael and All Angels, Torrington: a brief guide (ND) The church had to be rebuilt and this was completed in 1651. Design Organ Memorial monument to Judith Hancock Stevens The fine wagon roof is of a pattern typical for this part of England, while the window tracery to the nave, aisles and chancel are Geometric dating to about 1861 and are by William White. The current tower and spire date were completed in 1828. The tower has a ring of eight bells. Abraham Rudhall of Gloucester cast five of them in 1716. They were rehung in 1884. John Taylor & Co of Loughborough cast the tenor, treble and second bells in 1934. The clock bell from the old tower was cast in 1632. It survived the explosion of 1646 and now hangs in the spire. The carved octagonal red-veined marble baptismal font with its quatrefoil panels was made in 1914. Opposite this in an oak cabinet is an original wax impression of the Great Seal of England from the reign of James I. This was probably once attached to the Charter granted to the borough in this reign and was restored at the Victoria and Albert Museum in 1929. The war memorial contains fragments of glass salvaged from Westminster Chapter House after bomb damage during World War II. Around the church are a beautiful set of the Stations of the Cross which originally belonged to a convent chapel and which were given to the church by an anonymous donor. On the north wall are two monuments, one to Mrs Penelope Johnson and another to Mrs Palmer (partly behind the organ), both of whom were relations of Sir Joshua Reynolds. He used to regularly visit them, and on one occasion brought the great Dr Samuel Johnson with him. The Wills Organ is one of the finest in the West Country and is the twin of the organ in Truro Cathedral. The pulpit with its carved cherubs, wreaths and gilding is typically 17th-century. During the restoration of 1861-64 (when the old galleries and box pews were removed) the pulpit was moved and the matching sounding board was thrown out. The latter was rescued from a builder's yard and given to the Victoria and Albert Museum in London. There it remained until 1960 when it was restored to the church \\"on loan\\". The Crucifix on the pillar behind the pulpit was carved at Oberammergau in 1934 by Willy Bierling, who played St John the Evangelist in the Oberammergau Passion Play that year. The rood hanging in the chancel arch was added in 2002 and was formerly in St Oswald's Church, Small Heath in Birmingham where it had been given as a war memorial. The stone and marble reredos was made in 1878 and is carved with a relief of the Last Supper by the sculptor Harry Hems. The wooden figure of the Virgin Mary to the right of the altar steps was carved by French nuns, while the bronze figure of St Michael to the right of the chancel steps is by Mother Concordia of St Mildred's Abbey in Thanet. At the east end of the south aisle is a small Tudor room that survived the 1646 blast and now used as the vestry; this may be the Tudor library mentioned in records, the books from which have long disappeared. Chapel of St James The Chapel of St James font made in 1914 The pulpit is typically 17th-century The stone and marble reredos made in 1878 The Chapel of St James in the South Transept is named after the demolished chapel at Torrington Castle, and was furnished as a memorial to Frank Emlyn Jones, Vicar 1894-1934 and latterly Archdeacon of Barnstaple. This is where the original tower stood before the rebuilding of the early 19th-century. The chapel altar is 17th-century, while the figures on the reredos are (from left to right): St Michael (for Great Torrington), St Giles (for Little Torrington), St Mary the Virgin, St James, St Mary Magdalene (for Taddiport), and St Gabriel (for St Gabriel's Mission in the town, which no longer exists). The oil painting above the altar is a copy of Caravaggio's 'Ecce Homo'. The icon to the left of the altar is a version of Our Lady of Czƒôstochowa, the original being in Poland. It hangs here as a result of a court case which made legal history. The Chancellor of the Diocese, David Calcutt, refused permission for its installation but in 1984 the parish appealed to the Court of Ecclesiastical Causes Reserved, which had never sat before, and the Chancellor's decision was reversed. The window in the chapel is a memorial to the apothecary and inventor Thomas Fowler. The border shows two of his inventions: the thermosiphon (the founder of the central heating systems) and a calculating machine, a forerunner of the modern computer, and which was admired by his contemporary Charles Babbage. Exterior Some of the victims of the 1646 blast lie in a mass grave under the cobbled mound opposite the main entrance, while a stone commemorating the disaster is to the entrance's right. The current tower and spire were built in 1828, about which time the old tower was taken down. The tower is the work of W.B. Cock, a local builder who also designed the nearby Pannier Market; his initials are set into the cobbles of the path outside the South West door. The carved stone heads by the West door are 19th-century and represent Cardinal Thomas Wolsey and Lady Margaret Beaufort, the mother of Henry VII. The churchyard has been closed to burials since 1850.

The citadel is locally known as the \\"Citadel of Usama\\", named after Usama ibn Munqidh. History Julia Domna, daughter of the high-priest Julius Bassianus, has contributed to improve the city of Emesa and its citadel during the Roman Syria era. At that time, the citadel was able to contain accommodation, warehouses and administrative buildings surrounded by semi-circular walls. However, today the Citadel is in ruinous state as a result of massive demolition started by the Egyptian army of Ibr√¢h√Æm Pasha in the 1830s. This was followed by leveling and extensive new construction carried out when the site was used as a military base by the French army during the Mandate period and thereafter by the Syrian army.

History  The musical project was founded by musicians Eugenio Bennato, Carlo D‚ÄôAngi√≤ and Giovanni Mauriello with the aim of research and spread ancient traditional music from Campania and more generally from South Italy. Thanks to the encounter with the ethnomusicologist Roberto De Simone, the group eventually focused their research on Neapolitan vocal genres from the 15th and 16th centuries such as tammuriate, fronne and serenate.Alessia Pistolini. \\"Nuova Compagnia di Canto Popolare\\".

Nuova Compagnia di Canto Popolare in 1976 NCCP made their discographic debut in 1971 with a self-titled critically acclaimed album, in which they recuperated lost songs which had survived only in the form of ancient manuscripts and used forgotten musical instruments such as tammorra and mandoloncello. In 1972 they made their live debut at the Festival of Two Worlds in Spoleto and then started an intense theatrical activity. While new components joined the project, the same year D'angi√≤ left the group, followed by the departure of Bennato in 1976. The same year the couple founded the musical project Musicanova, while NCCP got a large success thanks to the De Simone's musical \\"La Gatta Cenerentola\\". Passing through various lineup changes, in the 1980s NCCP slowed their activities, recording only an album in eleven years. They had a resurgence in the early 1990s, in conjunction with the rise of the world music genre, when they upstaged their activity of research and embraced a production of original music. In 1992 NCCP entered the competition at the 42nd edition of the Sanremo Music Festival, winning the critic's award with the song \\"Pe' dispietto\\". In the following years, collaborated with several artists including Angelo Branduardi and Zul√π, participated to the 48th Sanremo Music Festival with the song \\"Sotto il velo del cielo\\", and toured extensively.

While consistently using the acronym IUE, it took on several full names during its history, originally the International Union of Electrical, Radio and Machine Workers and after 1987, the International Union of Electronic, Electrical, Technical, Salaried, Machine and Furniture Workers. Founding The IUE grew out of a dispute in the United Electrical, Radio and Machine Workers of America (UE). The UE had been founded in 1936 and was given the first Congress of Industrial Organizations (CIO) charter in 1938. As in many of the new CIO unions organized in the 1930s, the membership and leaders of UE included a variety of radicals, including socialists and communists, as well as New Deal liberals and Catholics. Concerned about the rise of fascism, these diverse forces put aside differences to form a \\"Popular Front.\\" The UE's first President was James Carey, a follower of Catholic Social teaching, and Secretary-Treasurer Julius Emspak was allied with the Communist Party. In 1941, however, the Communist faction moved to take total control and voted Carey out as President. Opposition emerged with Socialist and New Deal elements forming \\"UE Members for Democratic Action\\", modeled on the liberal, anti-Communist \\"Americans for Democratic Action.\\" The Catholic element worked with the Association of Catholic Trade Unionists. Between 1946 and 1949, the so-called \\"right wing\\" (as the anti-Communist faction was referred to) led an effort to win back leadership of the UE. While the anti-Communists built support, with the expulsion of the UE from the CIO in 1949, a new tactic was used of forming a new union -- the IUE -- with Carey as its leader. With the support of the CIO, over 300,000 former UE members joined the IUE in its first three years. By the mid-1950s, the IUE had easily overtaken the UE as the dominate union in electrical manufacturing.Ronald W. Schatz (1983), \\"The Electrical Workers: A History of Labor at General Electric and Westinghouse.\\"  _Boulwarism_  As the major union at the General Electric Co., IUE confronted \\"Boulwarism.\\" Lemuel Boulware was GE‚Äôs vice president for labor relations from 1947 to 1960. Under Boulware, GE would present the company‚Äôs contract offer to the union and no revisions would be made. The point was to make collective bargaining meaningless and lessen the value of the union in the eyes of its members. In 1964, the National Labor Relations Board declared such tactics to be unfair labor practices. https://www.assemblymag.com/articles/93762-a-century-of-ge-appliance- manufacturing Later Activities IUE played a leading role in the 1963 March on Washington The IUE was one of the leading forces in the civil rights movement. IUE President James Carey chaired the AFL-CIO Civil Rights Committee and the IUE played a leading role in the 1963 March on Washington. In 1972 IUE filed a discrimination lawsuit against Westinghouse Electric, claiming that Westinghouse's wage structure resulted in less pay for women than men earned for comparable jobs. Women at Westinghouse earned only 80 percent of that of men doing similar work.

The store's first location was on Telegraph Avenue in Berkeley, California. In 1973 Comics & Comix helped organize the first Bay Area comics convention, Berkeleycon 73, in the Pauley Ballroom in the ASUC Building on the University of California, Berkeley campus. At that show, C&C; acquired over 4,000 Golden Age comic books owned by Tom Reilly. The phenomenal sales of the Reilly collection enabled Comics & Comix to open more retail locations, first in San Francisco (May 1973), on Columbus Avenue (down from the North Beach area on the way to Fisherman's Wharf), and later in San Jose and Sacramento, making it the first comic book chain store in America. In 1974, Comics & Comix organized Berkeleycon 74, also held at Berkeley's Pauley Ballroom.

The different types of balls of wind were commonly used to play a variety of ball games that were popular on that particular period of time. Today, although many of the existing balls are inflated with air, the modern name is simplified to \\"ball,\\" regardless of the system.  History  Portrait of Alfonso d'Este by Titian. Antonio Scaino dedicated his work on the ball game. There are studies that deal with this issue in some depth, citing numerous documents from famous authors (Alfonso X of Castile who banned the \\"juego de pelota\\" with imprisonment, Desiderius Erasmus, Rabelais, Calderon de la Barca, Baltasar de Castiglione, Antonio da Sal√≤ Scaino).Trattato del giuoco della palla di messer Antonio Scaino da Sal√≤, diuiso in tre parti.

The ancient Greeks played ball but it is documented that they used balls wind but it seems likely. At time of the Roman Empire had balls wind, with the larger balls called \\"follis\\" and the smaller balls called \\"follicis.\\" The air chamber was made of animal bladders, preferably that of a pig. When mentioning the Mesoamerican Ballgame (specifically Mexican) chroniclers used to compare the different consistency of the indigenous caoutchouc solid balls with the European air-filled balls. One of the most important testimonies as regarding to the details, is the one by Luis Vives (1493-1540). Vives wrote a comparison between the Jeu de Paume (played with hard balls and rackets with gut stringing -although it means \\"played with te palm\\") and the Spanish ball game (similar to the actual pilota valenciana and played with \\"balls of wind\\". struck with the palm of the hand). In his testimony, Joan Llu√≠s Vives explains the Jeu de Paume comparing the strings of the racquet from that game, played in Paris with drones gut of the sixth string of a guitar. The demands of a tennis racket stringing regard to the determine the strings of animal intestine are well suited for this use. According to a book of 1840, Barcelona had a place for playing a \\"joc de pilota\\", but it is not clear what kind of game or games were played in that place. The arrival of the discovery of rubber and synthetic polymers similar properties allowed an improvement in the performance of many games and sports balls.  Scaino Antonio and his work on the ball game  At the request of Alfonso d'Este, Antonio da Sal√≤ Scaino (priest, theologian and writer) wrote a remarkable work on the ball game. With reference balls of wind, he described in detail how the bladder and the small tube and a kind of Check valve (or retention) based packing, allowing the bellows to properly inflate the ball in a similar way of the one being used today. He also mentioned the habit of adding some wine inside the chamber so the balls could keep its characteristics (its flexibility) over the time. The system of \\"Check valve\\" employed in the balls of wind made of bladder, was described by Juan Valverde de Amusco and \\"Fray Luis de Granada.\\"  Construction  The usual ball of wind was the bladder of an animal. Its outer surface was coated with leather and, once covered, the bladder was filled with air under pressure, using a dedicated type of bellows to inflate it.

It was an early member of the Labour Representation Committee, and also joined the Trades Union Congress.Arthur Marsh and Victoria Ryan, Historical Directory of British Trade Unions, vol.3, p.129 In 1902, the union took part in a merger conference with the Navvies, Bricklayers' Labourers and General Labourers Union, the Hull and District Builders' Labourers Union, the National Amalgamated Union of Labour, the London Amalgamated Plumbers' Mates Society, the United Order of General Labourers of London and the National Union of Gas Workers and General Labourers. The meetings lasted several months, but no agreement was reached, and a legacy of distrust between the unions resulted. In 1920, the United Builders' Labourers applied to join the National Federation of Building Trade Operatives. As a condition of membership, the federation insisted it attend a merger conference with its main rivals, by now the National Association of Builders' Labourers, the United Order of General Labourers of Great Britain and Ireland, and the Navvies', Bricklayers' Labourers' and General Labourers' Union. This was not successful; the Navvies and the United Order had little interest in amalgamation, while the National and the United Builders could not agree on a way forward. Instead, the United Builders reconstituted itself as the National Builders' Labourers and Constructional Workers' Society (NBLCWS). This survived until 1952, when it merged into the Amalgamated Union of Building Trade Workers. General Secretaries :1889: W.

Engineering at University of Rajshahi (RU) in 1979. He returned to RU in 1984 as a lecturer, and would continue to teach there as the four engineering colleges under RU were combined into Bangladesh Institute of Technology (BIT) in 1986 and then renamed RUET in 2003. Meanwhile, he earned a M.Sc.Eng. from Bangladesh University of Engineering and Technology (BUET) in 1987, and a Ph.D. from Jadavpur University in Kolkata in 1997. His research focus is on internal combustion engines, including the combustion behavior and pollution control of, and use of alternative fuels in, ceramic coated diesel engines. At what is now RUET, Beg served four terms as the head of the Department of Mechanical Engineering, and was the dean of the Faculty of Mechanical Engineering from 2008 to 2010. He was appointed to a four-year term as vice chancellor on May 28, 2014. For nearly a day, starting on 4 February 2017, Beg and 15 other teachers were confined by students who had since 28 January been boycotting classes in protest against the imposition of the \\"33 credit system\\". The system required that students complete a minimum of 33 credits in order to avoid repeating the year. Prior to the introduction of the system, students who completed fewer credits could still continue to the next session, and could catch up on credits later. Beg was freed and students agreed to return to classes after the academic council voted to revoke the \\"33 credit system\\". The same afternoon, however, the RUET Teachers Association called a strike protesting the students' conduct towards the teachers. They remained on strike for nearly two weeks.

She is professor of social psychology at the University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA) where she directs the Social and Affective Neuroscience Laboratory and co-directs the Social Cognitive Science laboratory. Eisenberger was the 2012 winner of the IUPsyS Young Investigator Award in Applied Science and the 2013 winner of the American Psychological Association Award for Distinguished Scientific Early Career Contributions to Psychology (area: Social Psychology).\\" Her award citation noted that \\"Eisenberger's innovative program of research has brought together neural, experiential, genetic and physiological measures to better define the role that social ties play in individuals‚Äô emotional and physical well-being. Her discovery that the neural bases of social pain overlap with the neural bases of physical pain is a landmark finding in social neuroscience.  Biography  Eisenberger grew up in San Francisco. She completed her undergraduate and graduate studies at UCLA, where she was mentored by Margaret Kemeny and Shelley Taylor. Eisenberger is married to professor Matthew Lieberman and they have a son. Together they have co-authored several research papers.  Research  Eisenberger's main interests (as listed on her personal website) are the neural basis of social rejection and social connection, and the relationship between social support and physical health. Her work in this area has emphasized the profound impact of social relationships on emotional and physical well-being. Her work suggests a connection between rejection and actual physical pain. For example, after a break up, one or both parties often complain of a broken heart. Her most cited work explores social rejection and the neural regions it activates. According to Eisenberger, the same neural regions that are activated in response to physical pain are also activated when one feels socially excluded. The feeling of social exclusion can be caused by exclusion from one person or a group of people. Her paper Does Rejection Hurt? An fMRI study of social exclusion, tested the hypothesis that the brain bases of social pain are similar to those of physical pain by examining the brain activity of participants who were excluded while playing a virtual ball tossing game. Participants were subject to FMRI scans while playing the virtual ball game and experiencing social exclusion, with analyses focusing on activity in the anterior cingulate cortex. The anterior cingulate cortex is activated when an automatic response is \\"inappropriate\\". The automatic response caused by physical pain is a frequent activator of the anterior cingulate cortex. The participants' scans showed that the anterior cingulate cortex was more active during the game when they were excluded than when they were included. The study also showed that the right ventral prefrontal cortex was active during exclusion and regulated the distress of social exclusion by disrupting activity in the anterior cingulate cortex. Almost identical results were found in studying brain activity associated with self-regulation of physical pain, suggesting a correlation between the neural mechanisms underlying social pain and physical pain, in support of Eisenberger's hypothesis.

He was married in 1866 and, in 1872, purchased a studio in D√ºsseldorf that formerly belonged to Adolph Tidemand. He lived there until his death from an abdominal ailment, twenty years later. His home eventually became a museum, but was destroyed during the Second World War. For many years he provided drawings for numerous German, Norwegian and Swedish magazines; notably '. In 1879, he was one of the illustrators for Norske Folke- og Huldre-Eventyr i Udvalg, a collection of folk-tales published by Peter Christen Asbj√∏rnsen. In addition, he wrote and illustrated his own humorous tales, satires and travelogues, many of them for children, which were published in two volumes as Sm√• Billeder for Store B√∂rn (Small Pictures for Big Children). He was also known as a cartoonist, and created popular pictures of churches and monasteries that featured caricatures of merry priests and monks. Later, he painted 18th century interiors with figures and did a series of works on themes from the plays of Ludvig Holberg. His half-sister, Valborg Lerche, was the first female theologian in Norway.

It is seen in approximately 0.5 to 1% pregnancies. It is mostly diagnosed ultrasonically in the second trimester of pregnancy. Large chorioangiomas are known to cause complications in pregnancy, while the smaller ones are asymptomatic. Presentation =Complications= Large or multiple chorioangiomas may lead to complications. The complications are polyhydramnios, preterm labour, hemolytic anemia, fetal cardiomegaly, fetal thrombocytopenia, intrauterine growth retardation, preeclampsia, abruption of placenta and congenital anomalies. Pathogenesis The origin of chorioangioma is from primitive chorionic mesenchyme. It develops when the blood vessels and stroma undergo rapid proliferation independent of the surrounding tissue. Based on histological features, chorioangioma is classified by Marchetti into three types: *Cellular type : This type is immature and contains mostly cellular elements packed compactly. * Angiomatous (vascular) type : This is the most common type of choriocarcinoma. It is distinguished by the presence of numerous small blood vessels. * Degenerative type : This is the mature type with degenerative changes. Each type is believed to represent a phase of tumor development. Chorioangioma has no malignant potential. Diagnosis Most chorioangiomas are asymptomatic. They are generally picked up in second trimester scan. Chorioangioma is seen as a hypo- or hyperechoic circumscribed mass that is distinct from the placenta at gray-scale US examination. Large lesions may contain fibrous septa. It is seen protruding into the amniotic cavity near the insertion of the cord. Doppler examination shows anechoic cystic areas, with pulsatile flow in spectral analysis. Some chorioangiomas may be solid masses, and may not be identifiable in gray-scale imaging. Therefore, the investigation of choice is Colour Doppler, which also distinguishes it from placental hematoma. Management Expectant management is recommended for chorioangioma as majority of them are asymptomatic. Large tumors are monitored with ultrasonogram every 1‚Äì2 weeks. In case of maternal or foetal complications, possible interventions are serial foetal transfusions, fetoscopic laser coagulation of vessels supplying the tumor, endoscopic surgical devascularization and chemosclerosis using absolute alcohol. Prognosis Large chorioangiomas with decreased echogenicity, decreased tumor volume and decreased blood flow in colour doppler images are may undergo spontaneous infarction. When chorioangiomas have deceased blood flow, fetal hemodynamics and clinical outcome are found to be improved. Epidemiology It is the most common tumor of the placenta. Chorioangiomas over the size of 5 cm in diameter are rare, and occur at a rate of 1:3500 to 1:16,000 births. Smaller chorioangiomas are more frequent, with an incidence of 14‚Äë139:10,000 births. However, many small chorioangiomas may not be sonologically visible and hence go unreported. In a clinical study, more than half of all tumors were discovered only by histological techniques.

He developed indirect methods for estimating mortality and fertility in populations with inaccurate or incomplete data, often dubbed \\"Brass methods\\" after him. Early life and education Brass was born in Edinburgh, where he went to school at the Royal High School and earned a Master's degree in mathematics and natural philosophy from the University of Edinburgh in 1947; during the Second World War he served in the Royal Navy Scientific Service. Career Brass's career as a demographer began in 1948 when he worked as a statistician, then as deputy director, for the East African Statistical Department in Nairobi, which collected and analysed data on Kenya, Uganda, Tanganyika and Zanzibar. During his time there, the department conducted the first comprehensive census in East Africa, and Brass designed and analysed the East African Medical Survey. From 1955 to 1964 he was a lecturer in statistics at the University of Aberdeen; he was promoted to Senior Lecturer in 1963. He spent a sabbatical year at Princeton University, where he worked with Ansley J. Coale and others at the Office of Population Research on methods for overcoming the unsatisfactory demographic data for Africa, leading to The Demography of Tropical Africa, published in 1968. From 1965 until retiring in 1988, he was Reader in Medical Demography and then Professor at the London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine; the first demographer there, he established the Centre for Population Studies, established a master's course in medical demography and taught many of its courses, headed the Department of Medical Statistics and Epidemiology from 1977 to 1981 and was chairman of the division from 1981 to 1985. In retirement he spent time working at the Netherlands Institute for Advanced Study and the Australian National University, and chaired the working group on Kenya for the Committee on Population and Demography of the US National Academy of Sciences. Research contributions Beginning with his work in East Africa, Brass developed what he called indirect estimation, techniques for deriving statistics on fertility, mortality and population growth from imperfect and incomplete data, including devising and working from simple questions such as the number of living children and living parents a respondent has. These form the basis of modern estimates of world population growth and are informally called \\"Brass methods\\", \\"Brass techniques\\" or \\"Brass estimates\\" after him. He also worked on population modelling and on British demography, for example analysing the role of female employment and predicting that the high birth rate amongst immigrants in the 1970s would not continue.

She was Joint Editor for many years of the International Journal of Radiation Biology and Deputy Director of Paterson Laboratories in Manchester. She made a \\"fundamental contribution to cell biology\\" in collaboration with physicist Stephen Pelc when they \\"were the first to ascribe a timeframe to cellular life,\\" creating the concept of the cell cycle. Their nomenclature for the stages of cell replication is used universally and appears in every textbook of biology and pathology. She married twice after the start of her career but published, and was generally known in the scientific community, under her maiden name.  Biography  = Early life and education = Alma Clavering Howard was born in Montr√©al on 23 October 1913, the fourth and youngest child of barrister Eratus Edwin Howard and Evalyn Isobel Peverley. Her paternal aunt was the mother of Northrop Frye, a cousin who would become one of the twentieth century's most influential literary critics and theorists. First educated at the Trafalgar School for Girls, she attended McGill University, graduating in 1934 with an Hons. B.Sc. in Botany and Zoology. She then completed graduate studies at McGill in the Department of Genetics under Charles Leonard Huskins. Her Ph.D. thesis was The correlation between chromosome behaviour and susceptibility to mammary gland cancer in mice (1938), for which she won the Governor General's Academic Medal for graduate work in science. = Career = In 1939 Howard married Patrick William Rolleston and took up a Finney-Howell Research Fellowship at McGill. She was demonstrator in Genetics at McGill into 1940 and \\"in the course of this work she discovered a new murine mutation.\\" In 1940, her first son, Francis, was born, followed by a second son, Patrick, in 1942. After World War II, she moved with her husband and children to England. However, her husband died in 1947 and her colleague Jack Boag would later note that she \\"had to find work which would allow her freedom to bring up her two young sons.\\" At the same time, Louis Harold Gray was looking for a cytologist to work in his radiobiology team at the UK Medical Research Council's Radiotherapeutic Research Unit at Hammersmith Hospital. By \\"fortunate chance he was introduced to Dr. Howard and flexible working arrangements were readily agreed.\\" On a preliminary visit to the Radiotherapeutic Research Unit, she met physicist Stephen Pelc who had developed a variant autoradiograph technique and \\"was much interested in his use of radioactive iodine for the autoradiography of rat thyroid slices.\\" By 1949, her youngest son was old enough to start prep- school and Howard joined the staff at Hammersmith, becoming part of Gray's team of scientists dedicated to studying the biological effects of ionizing radiation and to developing the use of radioactive isotopes. As a geneticist, Howard already recognized the importance of DNA, and although the double helix structure would not be discovered for a few more years, \\"the idea that chromosomes are made of DNA was generally agreed on.\\" On her first day, she suggested to Stephen Pelc that radioactive phosphorus taken into the cell might be incorporated into DNA and give some information on the replication and synthesis of this important substance. They injected a mouse with phosphorus-32 to study the rate at which the isotope incorporated into the DNA of dividing cells in the testis and the resulting autoradiographs were promising. However, in animal cells and tissues the background radioactivity from remaining Phosphorus-32 made it impossible to obtain an autoradiograph localized down to individual chromosomes and parts of chromosomes. There were a limited number of radioactive isotopes available in the early 1950s but Howard and Pelc switched to a botanical experimental system well established in Gray's lab, the bean root Vicia faba, and they were then able to continue their research with Phosphorus-32. In plant cells, unlike animal tissues, the radioactive phosphorus is incorporated into fewer complex compounds. By chance they discovered a simple acid digestion removed most of the Phosphorus-32 not synthesized into DNA. Looking at the uptake of Phosphorus-32 into the nucleus of dividing cells in the meristem of the broad bean root demonstrated the then \\"surprising conclusion that DNA replication occurs during a limited period in interphase, which they called \\"S-phase\\", the preceding \\"gap\\" was termed G1, the subsequent one G2.\\" Howard and Pelc published this finding in 1953, the same year Watson and Crick published Molecular Structure of Nucleic Acids: A Structure for Deoxyribose Nucleic Acid. While Howard and Pelc were sure of the significance of their findings, \\"the relevance of cell-cycle studies in the bean root to either cancer or medicine was not immediately accepted.\\" However, by 1957 [3H]-thymidine and [14C]-adenine radioligands became available, enabling animal studies, and consequently the whole basis of cell kinetics was developed from their original concepts. While at Hammersmith, Howard also worked with Michael Ebert. They discovered that \\"excess pressures of the rare gases xenon, krypton and argon could suppress the oxygen enhancement effect on the radiation killing of Vicia faba cells.\\" In 1956 Howard left Hammersmith and joined the new radiobiology research unit Gray was setting up at Mount Vernon Hospital. In 1958 she married Michael Ebert. In 1960 she was appointed Secretary-General of the 2nd International Radiation Research Congress, which was held in Harrogate in 1962. In 1963 both Howard and Ebert moved to Paterson Laboratories, where Howard was Head of the Radiobiology Group. They started, as joint editors, the journal Current Topics in Radiation Research. In 1966, Howard became Deputy Director at the Paterson Laboratories and also Joint Editor of International Journal of Radiation Biology, the later position held until her death. She \\"served the research community well by her rigorous standards of scientific accuracy and of literary style.\\" Additional appointments included Chairman of the Association of Radiation Research and of the British Association for Cancer Research, and as Secretary and later Chairman of the L.H. Gray Trust. Alma Howard began to suffer from progressive lameness around 1969 and her condition was eventually diagnosed as Multiple sclerosis. She \\"remained mobile\\" and carried on both her scientific work and hosted visiting scientists, postgraduate students and family friends from many countries at her home with Ebert in Chinley, White Hall. Both she and her husband Michael Ebert retired from active research in 1976. On 28 December 1982, while vacationing with his wife and family in Seefeld in Tirol, Michael Ebert died suddenly. Howard returned to England. She died on 1 April 1984 from cancer of the liver after a short terminal illness. A contemporary from her days at McGill remembered her as a \\"strikingly handsome girl who took a lively part in the intense arguments that went on, but always managed to 'keep her cool' and to maintain an attitude of friendly respect combined with gracious dignity.\\" Later colleague Jack Boag stated in her obituary that these \\"character traits remained with her throughout her life.\\"  Legacy  Howard was author or joint author of some 94 papers in the fields of genetics and radiobiology. On 24‚Äì25 July 1985, a Symposium in memory of Alma Howard, entitled The cell cycle concept and its applications, was held in Manchester and the papers published in a special issue of the International Journal of Radiation Biology. Following her death, the annual Alma Howard Memorial Lecture was inaugurated at McGill. The fiftieth anniversary of Watson and Crick's publication of the double helix structure of DNA was in 2003 and their discovery was widely celebrated in the scientific community. However, some also noted that Howard and Pelc's discovery was \\"in danger of slipping past unmarked\\" and that their \\"paper, also published in 1953, ... set the scene for the model of the cell cycle as we know it today.\\" While their findings are \\"now common place, the inventors are largely forgotten and rarely quoted.\\" Despite this, \\"cell-cycle studies have flourished ... the concept was later developed and the checkpoints in cell-cycle regulation and universal control mechanisms were determined by using genetics and molecular biology.\\" Shirley Hornsey explained the clinical impact in her 1984 obituary of Alma Howard: \\"... the whole basis of cell kinetics was developed from their original concepts. These developments have led to our present understanding of the growth and turnover of tissues in health and disease and in the production and use of the cell-cycle based chemotherapeutic agents in the treatment of cancer.\\"  See also  * Timeline of women in science  References   External links  * http://www.nature.com/celldivision/milestones/full/milestone03.html McGill University alumni Canadian women biologists Women radiobiologists Women geneticists Radiobiologists 20th-century British women scientists 1913 births 1984 deaths ","title":"Alma Howard"},{"id":"52533398","text":"Dragutin Aleksiƒá (Serbian Cyrillic: –î—Ä–∞–≥—É—Ç–∏–Ω –ê–ª–µ–∫—Å–∏—õ; 8 March 1947 ‚Äì 8 October 2011), Serbian naive art and outsider art (also used terms: marginal art, brut art) sculptor.

Artistic style  His preoccupation with existential problems of farmers, highlanders, miners is visible in the structures of extraordinary expressive force, achieved by a specific manner of procession, more with forceful cuts in the wood by an axe than by a sculptor‚Äôs chisel. Led by a strong instinct and robust character, he processed the wood rustically, transmitting his raw energy into a wooden mass, emphasizing a predominant force of a man ‚Äì highlander, who seizes from the nature in his fight for survival. In his sculptures with multiplied figures, central figures or events are rare. While doing sculpture Aleksiƒá liberates a thought, not a tale, hence the intensity of expression is most pronounced in the mere procedure of cutting, quick and capricious, in order to make his idea visible as soon as possible. With deeper, abrupt, unexpected incision in wood he creates dynamic light effects in which the dance of light and shadow provides an additional dynamics to the whole work. He is an artist of action and instinct without pictorial deliberation. Therefore, his idea is raw, uncultivated, but direct, suggestive, sometimes schematically given but intensive and complete. From whole mass of monumental logs, heads and busts emerge, rarely whole human and animal figures and vegetation. In sculptural treatment, Dragutin Aleksiƒá‚Äôs work has a touch of art brut, or more precisely, is on the borderline between na√Øve art and art brut.

He served in the Peace Corps in Ethiopia from 1962-1964, and earned his Ph.D. from Princeton University in 1967. Mirkin aroused controversy with his article \\"The Pattern of Sexual Politics,\\" published in 1999 in the Journal of Homosexuality. The article claimed that in some other cultures, sex between children and adults was permissible or even encouraged, and that the current societal view of pedophiles is comparable to how women and gay men were viewed in the past. It further claimed that the present taboo on pedophilia was just a social construction, not based on anything real; and that pedophiles might be on their way to acceptance. This prompted the Missouri House of Representatives to reduce the university's budget by the amount of Mirkin's salary, as a gesture of non-support for Mirkin's work. Writing in The New Yorker, Louis Menand criticized the legislature's action as harmful to academic freedom, stating that error is a necessary part of the process. Menand further criticized Mirkin's article, calling it silly, and compared cultures that accepted pedophilia to the many cultures that accepted slavery. He also stated that it is the prohibition of pedophilia that is part of civil and sexual freedom, including the freedom of children from adults who hold authority over them.

Unlike in the Marvel Universe, she is weightless and cannot become visible. She is related to the alchemical element of air as stated by Neil Gaiman. At the start of Marvel 1602: Fantastick Four, Susan is visibly pregnant with Sir Richard Reed's child. He forbids her to join him in his pursuit of Otto von Doom while in this condition, but she goes anyway. Much to Miss Doris Evans' shock, Sir Richard and Susan are not married. Adam Warlock On Counter Earth, counterparts of the Fantastic Four hijack an experimental spaceship in order to be the first humans in space. Man-Beast negates the effects of the cosmic radiation for all of them except Reed Richards who succumbs to the effects a decade later. When their craft crashes, Sue Storm falls into a coma from which she does not awake.Warlock vol. 1 #6 (June 1973) Age of Apocalypse In the alternate reality known as the Age of Apocalypse, Susan never became the Invisible Woman, but instead helped her boyfriend Reed Richards in his attempt to evacuate a large group of humans from Manhattan when Apocalypse came into power. Along with Ben Grimm as the pilot and her brother Johnny as crew, they used one of Reed's prototype rockets to fly off the island. However, a mutant sabotaged the launch and both Reed and Johnny sacrificed themselves to let the others blast off safely.X-Universe #1 Susie and Ben join the Human High Council as hired muscle. They are sent to the Eurasian Security Field Command Center to retrieve Bruce Banner, the scientist who worked on the nuclear warhead project that made the Council's pre-emptive nuclear strike possible. They found the facilities barraged by a Thing. The two are able to defeat the monster and retrieve Banner so they can board Mikhail Rasputin's mothership as one of a few select representatives allowed to board the Horseman's vessel as part of a false peace convoy. The humans are hoodwinked and held captive on the ship until Tony Stark, another captive on Mikhail's vessel, short circuits the craft with his mechanized heart.

Wolverine, however, believes they should go back in time and kill Hank Pym before he creates Ultron, arguing Pym would see a warning not to create the robot as a challenge, and create Ultron regardless. The group decides against this, and several members go to the future.Age of Ultron 5 Wolverine then goes to the past, with the intent of assassinating Pym. Invisible Woman stows away with him in hopes of convincing him otherwise. When Wolverine attacks Pym, Invisible Woman creates a force field to stop the killing blow. Torn between Hank's pleas for help, and Woverine's reminders of what will happen if he lives, Sue allows Wolverine to kill Pym.Age of Ultron 6 After the consequences of this decision were realized, Wolverine went back to this point again and convinced his past self to stand down. The Wolverines and Sue manage to help Pym create a backdoor in Ultron's programming that will stop him before he can launch his attack in the first place.Age of Ultron #12 Age of X In the Age of X reality where mutants are hunted, Sue is the only free member of the Fantastic Four left after she betrayed the other three to the government for harboring a mutant after the mutant attacked Franklin.

Sioux projects a tall \\"invisible friend\\" constructed from her invisible force fields. The team fights Godzilla-sized monsters from various alien xenocultures that attack Earth in order to put an end to experiments that endanger all of reality.

The Ultimate Marvel version of Susan Storm is an eighteen-year-old biochemistry prodigy who grew up in the Baxter Building in the gifted and talented program supervised by her father. Though her newfound fame and beauty has brought her unsought attention from the likes of billionaire playboy Tony Stark, the former Baxter Building scientist turned villain, Mole Man, the Atlantean criminal Namor, and even her own friend and teammate, Ben Grimm, she remains romantically attached to Reed Richards despite her concerns about his over devotion to science. Throughout the series, Sue has been a major player in events such as Ultimate Secret and Ultimate Power. In Ultimate Salem's Seven, Sue Storm leaves Reed Richards and moves to Oregon to study a bizarre sentient organism. It has been shown that this organism is responsible for creating the Salem's Seven.Ultimate Fantastic Four #54-56 She returns to Oregon to destroy the creature with Namor and the rest of her team. In the ensuing explosion Reed is trapped by molten lava. When Sue saves him with her invisible force field, they reconcile. She would later play a part in the Ultimatum event where she pushes back a tidal wave that floods New York with a colossal psionic field. She saves the city, but the mental strain puts her into a deep coma. She would later be awoken from her coma through the combined efforts of Mole Man and the Thing, during the course of which it is revealed that Ben harbors romantic feelings towards Susan. After the Ultimatum Sue breaks up with Reed and follows in her mother's footsteps after proposing to Ben. She is later assaulted, along with other heroes, by Reed, who had turned to villainy. This version of Sue Storm is an accomplished scientist in her own right. Reed even describes her as \\"just a teeny bit smarter than him\\",Ultimate Mystery #3, pg. 25 but when Reed once mentioned this to Ben, Susan responded with \\"Reed is an idiot,\\" as she always envies Reed's abilities and considers him the \\"king of physics\\".Ultimate Fantastic Four Vol. 1 (See Ultimate Fantastic Four Quotes) It is Sue who does research into the biomolecular basis of the Fantastic Four's powers and she manages to understand how Reed's and her brother Johnny's powers as Mister Fantastic and the Human Torch work. What If?  Marvel's What If? comic book series featured several alternate versions of Sue Storm and the Fantastic Four. =Spider-Man in the FF= On the world designated Earth-772, in What If?, Spider-Man joined the Fantastic Four, but his presence resulted in Sue feeling increasingly sidelined in favour of the four male members of the team, resulting in her leaving the team to marry the Sub-Mariner.What If? vol.1 #1 Although Reed was briefly driven insane and declared war on Atlantis, he eventually recoveredWhat If? vol.1 #21 and the two apparently reconciled, resulting in the 'Fantastic Five' reforming once again in time to confront Annihilus in the Negative Zone to help Susan give birth.What If? vol.2 #35 =Vol. I #6= In What If? #6 (Dec 1977), after the team are exposed to cosmic rays, they develop powers based on their personalities.

He photographed the life and residents of South Beach, with a particular focus on the Jewish community, many of them Holocaust survivors. Sweet also captured the carefree young people who made Miami Beach their second home. The Oxford American wrote a story on his vision of capturing a disappearing Jewish Community in Miami Beach. His violent death and the following trials were covered extensively in the media. The son of a prominent Miami Beach family, the gruesome nature of his death diverted attention from his art just when his work was gaining a following. By mischance, his negatives were lost, leaving only the prints he had made as his legacy, their colors slowly fading away. In 2006, Ellen Sweet Moss' partner, Stan Hughes, found a trove of color ‚Äòwork prints‚Äô Sweet made prior to printing full-size prints, Hughes realized that digital technology could be used to restore the fading colors back to the original color that Andy Sweet intended by using color photography instead of the black and white photography that was popular during this era. The discovery of Sweet's test prints in a family storage unit has garnered new interest in his documentary photography. Some of his surviving prints have been restored over the last decade. A documentary on his life and photography was released in 2018. The Andy Sweet Photo Legacy Foundation, founded by his sister and artist Ellen Sweet Moss, is dedicated to increasing awareness of his photography and organizing exhibits of his work. Early life Sweet was born in Miami Beach and attended Miami Beach Senior High School. Sweet and his family had ties to the Miami Beach Community. Sweet's grandfather Nat Hankoff was one of the founders of Temple Emanu-El in Miami Beach. Sweet had his bar- mitzvah and funeral at the temple. His uncle Ted Hankoff (1922‚Äì2016) was a graduate of Cornell University and was a second lieutenant in the US Navy during World War II. Hankoff was best known for being the general manager of many Miami Beach hotels during the 1950s, 1960s, 1970s and early 1980s and the World Wide Discount Travel Club. Andy and Ellen's family built the Monte Carlo and the Royal Palm along with the Roses. Sweet graduated from Miami Beach Senior High School. After completing a master's degree from the University of Colorado in Fine Arts (with a focus on photography) in 1977, Sweet along with his friend and fellow university graduate Gary Monroe decided to devote the next ten years of their lives to the \\"Miami Beach Photographic Project\\". Sweet spent every day of the next five years photographing a fading era of Miami Beach before the city became gentrified. Monroe recounted that Sweet told him that if one of them died, the other would have to continue the project. Early on, the project received much recognition and Sweet and Monroe were awarded grants of $135,000 from the National Endowment of the Arts, Housing and Urban Development and the Department of Labor. Monroe was featured by NPR: ‚ÄúA Photographer's Ode To Unsung Artists‚Äù. Death Sweet was murdered in 1982, when he was 28 years old. He was stabbed 29 times in his Miami Beach apartment. The Miami Herald Tropic Magazine ran a cover story on his death and documentary photography, \\"Andy Sweet: A Portrait\\". \\"Though young, Sweet was virtually an institution on the Beach, having made thousands of images of the place and the people. He had once done a series on city employees and among them is the photo of one of the detectives assigned to probe his homicide...\\". For years the Sweet family tried to get the murderers convicted. The media covered the trials over the years. Sweet's father, Nelan \\"Chick\\" Sweet, was a municipal judge and past president of the Miami Beach Bar Association. He stopped practicing law, losing faith that his son's murderers would ever be justly prosecuted. Two men were later convicted of his murder. Jesus Ortiz, 31, a drifter from Austin, Texas, and John Taylor, 24, a Miami native, claimed to have killed Sweet in a search for cocaine. A third suspect, Marko Dukanovic, a homeless drifter, was later indicted in 1999 with DNA evidence that showed an extra set of fingerprints. But after 12 years in state psychiatric facilities, he was released. The media covered the long process of the trials. Restoring lost photos For years the family was too distraught to deal with the issue of how to preserve the thousands of negatives and color prints that Sweet left behind. In 1986 Sweet's parents had those negatives stored in a professional warehouse only to find out ten years later that the only five existing boxes of negatives were lost. Devastated that the storage company was only willing to compensate them $5.00 for their son's life work, the Sweets took the company to court. The settlement money was later used to preserve his existing work. Meanwhile, in 1991 the book Miami Beach was finally published with the work the two photographers originally started in 1977. It included a foreword by Isaac Bashevis Singer. It was not until 2006 when thirty boxes with contact sheets of Sweet's work were accidentally discovered in a family storage unit by Andy's sister Ellen Sweet Moss's partner and photographer, Stan Hughes. Since the discovery, Stan Hughes has been restoring hundreds of these prints. The family created the Andy Sweet Photo Legacy, a 501(c)3 charitable foundation, with funds gained from the storage facility that lost Sweet's negatives. The Andy Sweet Photo Legacy Foundation was created to support, promote, and educate the public about the work Sweet created. Recognition Sweet's work was appreciated by other documentary photographers. \\"When nationally famed photographer Mary Ellen Mark came to town, she asked the young Sweet to show her around town. She fell for his style, praising his \\"strong, humorous, and beautiful images.\\" She'd later write that his body of work was \\"unprecedented for someone so young...He definitely would have gone on to make many more wonderful images and to become a real photographic force.\\" The Miami Beach Commission voted on Wednesday, December 14, 2016, to have a plaque erected in the Art Deco District in honor of Sweet. Influences and awards \\"Our early interest in photographing a city we love was like a magnet that kept drawing us back...a city that could be observed and preserved through photographic documentation\\", Sweet told The Miami News. Sweet's portrayal of the aging Jewish seniors in the Art Deco District, many of them Holocaust survivors. Sweet felt passionate about giving a \\"voice\\" to these survivors and that nostalgic time. Through Sweet's photos, it was clear these quirky seniors intended to savor every moment of life in this close-knit community. He had insight to capture them before the district ultimately became touristy, sterile and gentrified. Ed Christin serves as Andy Sweet's archivist. Andy Sweet documented the Jewish community on South Beach, starting in 1977 through 1982. It was where he grew up, and where he recognized a unique time in history, when the Jewish residents of Miami Beach brought their cultural touchstones with them. They converted hotels into makeshift synagogues, supported each other, and kept their traditions alive. Many were Holocaust survivors who were drawn to the warm weather of South Florida. Sweet was awarded two grants from the National Endowment for the Arts for the Miami Beach Project.

Turkish forces were also claimed to enter the Syrian territory at a depth of 250 meters in the northern countryside of Aleppo province. The Turkish forces also repeated the move in the northwestern province of Idlib, saying that the Turkish forces captured six acres of lands with the same aim to build the wall. Syrian government officials said that any unilateral international actions without the consent of the Syrian government will be dealt with as violations to Syria's sovereignty.

The federation's origins lay in the Civil Service National Whitley Council, a joint bargaining organisation consisting of trade unions and representatives of the civil service as an employer. By the 1970s, most unions were unsatisfied with the arrangement, feeling that the trade union members of the council were unrepresentative, and that it was an overly bureaucratic system. As a result, in 1980, they formed the independent \\"Council of Civil Service Unions\\".Jack Eaton and Colin Gill, The Trade Union Directory (1979), p.4 The founding members of the federation, with the number of seats they initially held, were: * Association of First Division Civil Servants (2 associate members) * Association of Government Supervisors and Radio Officers (2) * Association of Her Majesty's Inspectors of Taxes (2 associate members) * Civil and Public Services Association (20) * Civil Service Union (6) * Inland Revenue Staff Federation (8) * Institution of Professional Civil Servants (11) * Prison Officers' Association (3) * Society of Civil and Public Servants (11) The council led a campaign against the government's prohibition of staff at the Government Communications Headquarters from joining a trade union. This landmark case, Council of Civil Service Unions v Minister for the Civil Service, was ultimately lost in the House of Lords. Over the years, many of the civil service unions merged and, in 1998, the Public and Commercial Services Union (PCS) was formed, representing for the first time a majority of civil service trade unionists. With many of the council's functions having been delegated to other bodies, it agreed thereafter to proceed only on the basis of consensus among all members. By 2010, the following unions held membership of the council:Public and Commercial Services Union, \\"Council of Civil Service Unions (CSSU) dissolved \\", 20 December 2010 * FDA * Northern Ireland Public Service Alliance * Prison Officers' Association * Prospect * Public and Commercial Services Union The consensus-based approach led to dissatisfaction, the PCS complaining that decisions were subject to the veto of even very small unions. The FDA, meanwhile, opposed the PCS's specific recommendations for change, arguing that this would effectively give the PCS the final say on all civil service matters.FDA, \\"Break-up of the Council of Civil Service Unions \\" In 2010, unable to agree a way forward for the federation, it was dissolved.

It was then a three-storey building. The fourth storey was added in 1846. Jonathan Balling, who worked for the Royal Greenland Trade Department, lived in the building until his death in 1829. He was one of Hans Christian Andersen's first benefactors in Copenhagen. Andersem spent Christmas with Balling in 1822.

Mieses was a fluent Hebrew writer and a strong opponent of Hasidism.

In this work Mieses pleads for pure Judaism free from all superstitious belief in spirits, dreams, demons, witchcraft, metempsychosis, etc., which in the course of time had obscured the light of the sublime religion. He sharply criticizes the zaddik for spreading the grossest superstition among the Hasidim, and for exploiting the credulity of the ignorant masses. The author evinces a wide acquaintance with Jewish and general literature; and he appends to his book, under the title \\"Likkute Ferahim,\\" extracts from the writings of Judah ha-Levi, Ibn Ezra, Kimhi, Albo, Abravanel, Joseph Delmedigo, and others, in support of his own views.

She lived with her husband in Chile in 1822‚Äì27, but separated from him in 1828, lived with her brother John in Great Britain in 1828‚Äì29, and returned to Sweden in 1829. =Educational career= She was for a time employed as a teacher at the Societetsskolan in Gothenburg, before being given the position as principal of the Kjellbergska flickskolan in 1835.Kullgren, Thyra, Stiftelsen Kjellbergska flickskolan 1835-1935 ['Foundation of the Kjellbergska Girl School'], Kjellbergska flickskolan, G√∂teborg, 1935, p. 25 (in Swedish) The school was founded that same year by a charity board and financed by a will, and she was employed by the board. Essentially, she was given salary and school material from the board, but otherwise entrusted with the foundation and organisation of a pioneer secondary school for girls age 15‚Äì16. Helena Eldrup had no formal education, but this was not an obstacle, as there was almost no formal education to be had for a woman at that time. She was estimated by the board to have sufficient informal education for the task, in addition to being an intelligent, religious but compassionate woman as a person. She succeeded with the task given her by the board, and the first examination for her students was hosted in 1836, upon which she was praised by the school board. Initially, the school was a small one with a moderate number of students, and moved between various addresses until it was finally given a permanent school building in 1870. Helena Eldrup was the only full time teacher for the first seven years, until educated (male) teachers were employed. Eldrup herself remained as English language teacher, speaking the language perfectly. She died in 1872 and was succeeded by Therese Kamph, who expanded and developed the school considerably. In 1911, 113 former students collected money to commission a portrait of the de facto school founder, Helena Eldrup, made by one of her students, Jenny Nystr√∂m.

Watercolour on paper, 1993. Kelvingrove Art Gallery and Museum, Glasgow. Windows in the West is a 1993 watercolour painting by the Scottish artist Avril Paton. The painting was bought by the city of Glasgow for the Glasgow Gallery of Modern Art, and is currently on display at the Kelvingrove Art Gallery and Museum. Description 35 Saltoun Street in September 2016. The painting depicts the external profile of a 4-storey yellow sandstone tenement building during winter; the residents of the building can be seen doing various activities, with a mother and child, a man at a computer, and someone pulling aside curtains to look out at the snow outside. Paton depicted herself standing outside the door of the building in the painting, and later found out that a cat she thought she had seen was actually made from china. The painting is painted in gouache, egg tempera and watercolour, measures and took six months to complete. The Scotsman newspaper wrote of Windows in the West in 2005 that \\"There was something cosily familiar about the painting's cheery, glowing character, the snow-covered roof and the warm yellow stone, the embracing perspective. ...It carries a nostalgic, storybook charm; Katie Morag in Glasgow's West End\\". The building depicted in the painting is located at 35 Saltoun Street on the corner of Roxburgh Street in the Dowanhill district in Glasgow's West End, and is a Category B listed building. It was built in 1897. History Paton was living as a caretaker of a top floor flat opposite the building on Saltoun Street on 11 January 1993, when at 5.30 pm, during a heavy blizzard, she saw 35 Saltoun Street \\"transformed\\" with a \\"lilac pink sky, lighted windows, clarity of whiteness, lots of people at home\\" according to Melanie Reid who interviewed Paton in 2005 for The Herald. The preliminary drawings for the paintings were completed in February and Windows in the West was finally finished in June. Paton had not set out to create such a large work, originally intending to paint the architectural detail of the building's drum windows. Paton said in 2005 that she had \\"realised I had made a mistake with the size of the paper. At that time I was terribly poor ... Buying art materials was difficult. I was upset that the paper was the wrong size\\", but was galvanised to finish the work by her son who said \\"Oh it would be great if you could pull it off!\\" It was originally planned to show the painting at Anne Mendelow's Gatehouse Gallery at Glasgow's Rouken Glen Park but Mendelow proposed that it was loaned to Glasgow Royal Concert Hall in the intervening period as it was taking up so much space in Paton's flat. The popularity of Windows in the West at the Royal Concert Hall bought it to the attention of the director of Glasgow's museums, Julian Spalding, who purchased it for the city in 1996. Spalding subsequently said that \\"What it caught was that moment when it was nearly dark, but people haven't drawn the curtains yet, and you can walk along the street and look into windows, and there's the light inside, and the light outside. People are going about their business in a private way; at the same time they have not yet hidden their private world. There is the balance between the inner life and the outer life that is just beautifully caught\\". Paton's 1988 painting The Barras had previously been bought by Glasgow Art Galleries and Museums and as her major sale it had established her as an artist. Paton subsequently described the residents as having been \\"thrilled to be in the painting ... That building was a community in itself. They were colourful characters, who were always having parties\\". Paton has described her surprise at the popularity of the work, saying in a 2005 interview that \\"I find that quite amazing, because I don't understand it at all. I wasn't aware that it was going to be anything other than just another painting for an exhibition. I lived there for four to six years before I started the painting. I used to look at that building continually and enjoy it. I enjoyed seeing what people were doing. I would stand in the window, drink a cup of tea. Once it was painted, I never looked at it again\\". In a May 2007 article for the Evening Times, Shelia Hamilton interviewed residents of the building depicted in Windows in the West who recalled their memories of Paton and the effect of the painting on their lives. Hamilton wrote that \\"Maybe the day will come when there's a plaque on the wall ... and we get guided tours. But for now, all most of us can do is wander along the street just round the corner from the Byres Road and have a quick peek as we pass by and wonder what it's like to live inside a painting\\" and described the building as \\"probably the most famous tenement in the world\\". Hamilton attributed the painting's appeal to the fact that \\"they are real people living real lives and the reason why this picture has such a hold on the public's imagination. Outside, it may be icy in the painting but inside the rooms they are cocooned forever in safety and warmth\\". Paton said in a 2005 interview that \\"I haven't distanced myself from it; the picture has distanced itself from me. It's like a child. It goes off and leads its own life\\". Paton has sold almost 30,000 prints and 100,000 cards of reproductions of the painting; in 2005 it was the top selling print in Glasgow's Gallery of Modern Art shop. Windows in the West featured in a 2005 poll by The Herald newspaper to find Scotland's favourite painting, and as a result of which subsequently inspired a poem by the Poet Laureate of Scotland, Edwin Morgan.

It uses a dropper to establish a permanent backdoor while exploiting MacOS vulnerabilities and security features like Gatekeeper, iCloud Keychain and the file naming system. It was first detected in early July 2016 by ESET researchers, who also found it being distributed through a compromised version of Transmission Bit Torrent Client.  Technical Details  = Download and Installation = OSX.Keydnap is initially downloaded as a Zip archive. This archive contains a single Mach-O file and a Resource fork containing an icon for the executable file, which is typically a JPEG or text file image. Additionally, the dropper takes advantage of how OS X handles file extensions by putting a space behind the extension of the file name for example ‚Äì as ‚Äúkeydnap.jpg ‚Äù instead of ‚Äúkeydnap.jpg‚Äù. Usually commonly seen icon images and names are used to exploit users' willingness to click on benign looking files. When the file is opened, the Mach-O executable runs by default in the Terminal instead of an image viewer like the user would expect. This initial execution does three things. First, it downloads and executes the backdoor component. Second, it downloads and opens a decoy document to match what the dropper file is pretending to be. Finally, it quits the Terminal to cover up that it was ever open. The terminal is only opened momentarily. = Establishing the Backdoor Connection = Since the downloader is not persistent, the downloaded backdoor component spawns a process named \\"icloudsyncd\\" that runs at all times. It also adds an entry to the LaunchAgents directory to survive reboots. The icloudsyncd process is used to communicate with a command & control server via an onion.to address, establishing the backdoor. It then attempts to capture passwords from the iCloud Keychain, using the proof-of-concept Keychaindump, and transmits them back to the server. Keychaindump reads securityd‚Äôs memory and searches for the decryption key for the user‚Äôs keychain as described in ‚ÄúKeychain Analysis with Mac OS X Memory Forensics‚Äù by K. Lee and H. Koo. = Gatekeeper Signing Workaround = Mac OS uses Gatekeeper to verify if an application is signed with a valid Apple Developer ID certificate preventing OSX.Keydnap from running. Further, even if the user does have Gatekeeper turned off, they will see a warning that the file is an application downloaded from the Internet giving the user an option to not execute the application. However, by packing OSX.Keydnap with a legitimate signing key as in the case of the compromised Transmission app, it successfully bypasses Gatekeeper protection.  Detection and Removal  Activating Gatekeeper is an easy way to prevent accidental installation of OSX.Keydnap. If the user's Mac has Gatekeeper activated, the malicious file will not be executed and a warning will be displayed to the user. This is because the malicious Mach-O file is unsigned, which automatically triggers a warning in Gatekeeper.

The game was developed by author Michael Crichton's Timeline Computer Entertainment (initially formed as Timeline Studios), and is based on Crichton's 1999 novel of the same name. Crichton was directly involved in the game's creation. Gameplay Timeline is played from a first- person perspective, with a focus on adventure and puzzle-solving. The plot of Timeline is largely similar to the novel, with some changes that include the absence of the novel's scientific aspect and character development, and the removal of characters such as Andre Marek. In the game, a group of scientists discover a method of time travel and ventures to 14th century France to conduct research. When one of the scientists, Edward Johnston, does not return from the trip, a graduate student named Christopher Hughes travels to the time era to search for Johnston. The player controls Hughes, and is accompanied by Kate, who provides hints to the player throughout the game. The game is divided into various chapters, which include the player participating in a jousting tournament. Enemies cannot be killed in the game, as doing so could disrupt Hughes' future timeline. Killing an enemy results in the player being forced to restart from the last save point. The game includes a free-roaming tour mode, in which the player can observe the environment while Michael Crichton provides narration to explain the history of the area. Development and release In April 1999, Crichton announced the formation of his own video game development company, Timeline Studios, which would develop games based on Crichton's previous projects. In May 1999, publishing company Eidos Interactive announced that it had invested a stake in Timeline Studios as part of a publishing deal. Development began that month on Timeline's first project, an unspecified video game planned for the first half of 2000. On June 21, 2000, Eidos announced that the company's first game with Timeline Computer Entertainment would be Timeline, based on Crichton's 1999 novel of the same name. Eidos had hoped that Timeline would break new ground with its emphasis on diverse environments, interactivity, and story. Crichton worked on the game as director and as a game designer. Crichton often held video conferences with the development team to approve and disapprove of gameplay elements. On the game's official website, Crichton described Timeline as \\"a game for people that don't usually play games.\\" The development team hoped to create a game that would be easy enough for new players, but still challenging enough for more experienced players. Paul Wirth, a producer on the game, said, \\"One of the design objectives was making it so the average person could finish the whole experience.\\" An orchestral score was composed for the game by Bill Brown. Timeline was released on November 10, 2000. Copies of the game included a free copy of the novel. Timeline was the only video game developed by Timeline Computer Entertainment. Reception Timeline received \\"generally unfavorable reviews\\" according to the review aggregation website Metacritic. Several reviewers criticized the game's character, Kate, for providing hints to the player throughout the game. Michael Tresca of AllGame criticized the game's short length and the \\"mediocre\\" sound effects, but noted the \\"exceptional\\" music. Tresca wrote that the arcade sequences, \\"While a refreshing change of pace,\\" can become repetitive, particularly because of the game's \\"imprecise\\" controls. Considering that the game is about knights, Tresca expected more sword combat: \\"What little there is, though, is really nothing more than a simple button-clicking exercise. Even then, you can't actually kill anyone. These elements make gameplay seem artificial within the story's context.\\" Tresca concluded that Timeline ultimately \\"seems less like a time-travel experiment gone awry and more like a game design gone bad. The battles, the excitement, and the potential mix of science fiction with history, is all lost in a stilted game environment that was obviously crafted by Crichton's vision of what the game should be vs. the ultimate goal of creating a good game.\\" Jonathan Houghton of The Adrenaline Vault wrote that overall, Timeline \\"just doesn't stand up as anything more than a slightly entertaining diversion. Though there are minor problems with the graphics system, control scheme and interface, the primary drawback is that an experienced player can fly through it in around three hours and thirty minutes.\\" Houghton, who praised the novel, felt as if he \\"had been robbed of what promised to be a wondrous encounter. Why Mr. Crichton felt the need to remove more than half of the storyline, I suppose we'll never know.

Bailey wrote that the game lacks the \\"essential elements\\" that were common in Crichton's novels, stating that it was devoid of action, tension, and challenges; Bailey attributed these problems to the \\"dumbing-down of gameplay,\\" which he felt would \\"test only the most inexperienced gamer.\\" Scott Steinberg of IGN, who praised the music and voice- overs, wrote that the game was \\"way too patronizing for any adult to take seriously,\\" and that the \\"slow-moving, semi-mature\\" story was not suitable for younger children.

Maxwell does not differentiate between dynamical systems and social systems. Therefore, a singularity refers to a context in which a small change can cause a large effect. The existence of singularities is primarily an argument against determinism and absolute causality for Maxwell. Indeed, following the same initial conditions will always achieve the same results, but such a statement is of little value in a world in which the same initial conditions are never repeated.  Characteristics  In summary, singularities are determined by the following characteristics which can vary in strength: # Instability: Singularities are related to effect in which small causes produce great effects. # System relatedness: Singularities represent a peculiarity based on a system and affect its identity. # Uniqueness: Singularities do not stand out from quantitative singularity, but rather by qualitative uniqueness. # Irreversibility: The caused changes of systems are largely irreversible. # Subjectivity: The awareness is dependent on the human perception and experience. # Randomness: Singularities are often considered as random because generally either the causes or their effects are not well known. # Complexity: Their occurrence is often connected to the complexity of the system and its environment. # Interaction: Singularities often arise when unexpected interactions occur between two systems.  In dynamical systems  A further development of Maxwell's thoughts in relation to dynamic systems was carried out first by the French mathematician Henri Poincar√©. Poincar√© distinguished four different simple singularities (points singuliers) of differential equations. These are the node (les noeuds), the saddle (les cols), the focus (les foyers) and the center (les centers). In recent times, the chaos theory found special attention. However, deterministic chaos is just a special case of a singularity, in which a small cause produces a large observable effect due to a nonlinear dynamic behavior. In contrast the singularities raised by Maxwell, such as a loose rock at a singular point on a slope, show a linear dynamic behavior as it was demonstrated by Poincar√©. Singularities are the common staple of the chaos theory, catastrophe theory and bifurcation theory.  In social systems  In social systems, a deterministic chaos is unlikely, because the elements of the system are some individuals that engage with awareness, will and foresight purposefully into the dynamic behavior of the system.Weizs√§cker, C. C. von: Ordnung und Chaos in der Wirtschaft, in: W. Gerock/ H. Haken u.a. (Hrsg.): Ordnung und Chaos in der unbelebten und belebten Natur. Stuttgart 1989. S. 46. However, this does not exclude that approaches deterministic chaos in social systems are available. Rather, there is also an increase in the social development of nonlinear dynamics and instabilities .B√ºhl, W.L.: Sozialer Wandel im Ungleichgewicht: Zyklen, Fluktuationen, Katastrophen, Stuttgart 1990, S. 207. Chaos in the colloquial sense of complete disorder or confusion, however, is to be found. It is often the basis for singularities, where cause-and-effect relationships are not clear. There are already numerous examples of singularities in social systems with Maxwell and Poincar√©. Maxwell states that a word can start a war and all the great discoveries of man based on singular states. Poincar√© gives the example of a roofer who drops a brick and randomly kills a passing man.  In natural history  The development of systems provides the science currently so before that by a singular Big Bang uniformly dispersed plasma spread after the creation of the universe in space, which is cooled with increasing expansion, so that formed atoms and finally for very small (singular) fluctuations in the uniform density inhomogeneities created self-reinforcing. They subsequently led to the formation of galaxies, stars and other systems in the universe, from which humans emerged at the end. Even if the singularity of the Big Bang can be avoided in the mathematical models, singularities remain an essential element of history. The evolutionary history shows that not only successful mutations can be perceived as positive singularities, but the humanization and the human becoming, the singular most important event in the evolution and represents a jump from the continuum of past evolutionary development of the planet Earth.Hagemann, R.: Mutationen als produktive Singularit√§ten, in: J.-H. Scharf (Hrsg.): Singularit√§ten, Nova Acta Leopoldina, Abhandlungen der Deutschen Akademie der Naturforscher Leopoldina, Vortr√§ge anl√§√ülich der Jahresversammlung vom 30. M√§rz bis 2.

Recently, Ward and Kirschvink show that the history of life has been more influenced by disasters than by continuous evolution.Ward, P., Kirschvink, J .: A New History of Life, Munich 2016, S.30. Disasters are here first destructive singularities that create space for new developments in the sense of innovations as productive singularities.Holzk√§mpfer, H .: Management of Singularities and Chaos, Wiesbaden 1996, pp. 133ff and 139ff.  Singularities and complexity Closely related is the notion of singularity with the concept of complexity. J.C. Maxwell has already pointed out that a system has all the more singular points, the more complex it is. Complexity is also the basis of perceived chaos and singularities. Suppose a seemingly insignificant event that produces a great effect, even in a simple context, how difficult would it be to detect the reason in a complex situation with tremendously many elements and relationships. Complexity that is kind of a breeding ground for singularities, shows the downfall of ancient cultures. Causes such as intruders, internal conflicts or natural disasters are not sufficient alone to justify the destruction of a culture. Rather requirement is an increasing complexity and associated declining marginal returns.Tainter, J.A.: The Collapse of Complex Societies, Cambridge, New York u.a. 1988, S. 42ff. The financial crisis of 2007-2008 shows how difficult decisions are in a very complex environment. Thus, the complexity of financial systems and financial products is a major challenge of the financial markets and institutions to look at.Landau, J.-P.: Complexity and the financial crisis, Introductory remarks at the Conference on The Macroeconomy and Financial Systems in Normal Times and in Times of Stress, jointly organized by Banque de france and the Bundesbank, 8. June, 2009. One solution is to reduce complexity and increase the potential for adaptation and robustness. In a complex world with increasing singularities, it is therefore necessary to abandon optimization potential to gain adaptability to external shocks and disasters.Conrad, M.: Adaptability: The Significance of Variability from Molecule to Ecosystem, New York, London 1983.

Life Cohen was born in Kreis Meseritz. As a teenager, he went to Berlin, where he studied with Naphtali Hirz Wessely and developed an appreciation of Hebrew poetry. He was soon regarded as an outstanding stylist of Hebrew. From 1800 to 1808, he taught Hebrew and religion at the Jewish Free School in Berlin, founded by David Friedl√§nder. In 1808, he founded the Society of Friends of the Hebrew Language (Gesellschaft der Freunde der hebr√§ischen Sprache). From 1809 to 1811, he was the last editor of the first Hebrew literary journal Ha-Meassef, which he tried unsuccessfully to revive. Cohen also lived in Altona, Hamburg, Dessau, and London before settling in Hamburg. In 1820, he went to Vienna, where he founded the first Hebrew journal in Austria, the literary magazine Bikkurej ha-ittim (\\"First Fruits of the Times\\"). In 1810, he translated the biblical book of Jeremiah into German; and from 1824 to 1827, he completed a German edition of the Old Testament in Hamburg. He died in Hamburg.

Their victims are believed to have numbered at least in the hundreds. They were made famous by the 1857 novel The Companions of Jehu by Alexandre Dumas which presented a highly romanticised account of them. Origins of the name Jehu was an Old Testament character,Emil G. Hirsch, M. Seligsohn (1906) \\"Jehu\\" in The Jewish Encyclopedia immortalised in Racine's drama Athalie. He was famous for having killed Jezebel by throwing her out of a window. According to the Books of Kings Jezebel was responsible for inciting her husband King Ahab to abandon the worship of the true God and follow the cult of Baal instead. She also brought false testimony against Naboth and had him killed, and was the cause of much violence and bloodshed.Emil G. Hirsch, Ira Maurice Price (1906) \\"Jezebel\\" in The Jewish Encyclopedia By analogy, Jezebel represented the Jacobins of France, responsible for turning France away from the Catholic religion, bringing false testimony against patriotic citizens and executing them, and spreading violence and bloodshed through the Reign of Terror. By the same analogy, Jehu was the force of righteous retribution, come to restore the true religion, and kill Jezebel, her children and all those who had turned away from the Lord.Charles Nodier, Souvenirs et portraits de la R√©volution, Charpentier 1841 vol. VIII, page 79 The reference to Jehu was not universally understood however, and through misunderstanding, uncertain repetition and assimilation with the broader idea of religious restoration, many people referred to the Companions of Jesus instead of the Companions of Jehu, despite this name being essentially meaningless, as was pointed out by Louis Blanc.Andr√© Castelot, Pr√©sence de l‚Äôhistoire, 1969, p. 205 The first reference to their existence appears in the records of the National Convention in a report presented on 25 June 1795 from Marie-Joseph Ch√©nier on the recent killings in Lyons. His account says: Activities On 4 May 1795, 99 Jacobin prisoners were massacred in the town prisons by members of the companions. Over the following days the violence became more widespread and more murders took place as Jacobins were drowned, beaten to death and had their throats cut in their own homes or in the streets. The newspapers encouraged the murder of Terrorists and Drinkers of Blood, and a list of people to be targeted, ninety pages long, was published in Lausanne and openly circulated. This phase of the White Terror continued until the army re-established control and various ringleaders were arrested and brought before the criminal court of Is√®re. The number of victims of the Companions of Jehu is impossible to know, because there is no reliable way of distinguishing between organised murders and more chaotic lynchings. An order of 23 May 1796 by General Mointchoisy directed that \\"to prevent the assassinations committed by the Companions of Jesus, it is forbidden to all citizens under any pretext whatsoever to carry swordsticks, throwing sticks, or batons weighted with lead or iron.\\" Questions over their existence Some historians, including Jacques Godechot, have argued that the Companions of Jehu never actually existed. According to Lenotre,G.Lenotre, La compagnie de J√©hu: les vengeurs fant√¥mes, Perrin, 1931 the Directory sought to identify and punish royalists, emigres and refractory priests, and actively looked for people associated with the Companions of Jehu. However although various criminals were arrested, none of them was a priest, emigre or royalist. All those arrested for murder and other serious crimes had been acting independently and there was no organised movement or any coordination between them. The tribunal, under Legris, concluded that there were no registers or membership lists for the Companions of Jehu. Later, under Louis XVIII, many royalists who had played very minor parts in resisting the revolution received pensions or decorations, but nobody ever came forward and claimed to have been a member of the Company of Jehu. Les Compagnies du Soleil While the Companions of Jehu were organised in and around Lyon, a similar group known as 'les Compagnies du Soleil' (The Companions of the Sun) formed and was active in Provence and Gard. The company's members considered it a sign of strength to carry the symbol of a splash of blood on their hands.John Paxton, Companion to the French Revolution, Facts on File Books 1988 p.54 During the White Terror a group of Jacobins was able to take control of the city of Toulon from 17‚Äì23 May 1795,Chronicle of the French Revolution, Longman 1989 p.479 and the Companions of the Sun were particularly associated with the repression and reprisals which took place after the army under General Pactod regained control of the city.

Like Hartman, Hammond has been considered one of SNL's best political impersonators, and on the show he parodied several other American politicians. SNL's ratings rose at the peak of the Lewinsky-scandal, and when Monica Lewinsky guested the show in 1999, she appeared with Hammond's Clinton. In the sketch, Clinton dreams of the life after his presidency, and Lewinsky is his wife. In 1997, he appeared as Clinton at the Radio and Television Correspondents' Association dinner. According to Hammond, he met Clinton at the White House before the event \\"in full Clinton drag\\". Telling Clinton that he felt foolish, the president replied \\"I think you look terrific.\\" He also did an impression of Clinton as part of a 2001 White House Correspondents' Association dinner performance, after Clinton left office. Hammond has returned as Clinton several times since he left the cast, and has played the part on the show over 90 times. Others A 1994 sketch had several cast members auditioning to play Clinton, including Chris Farley, David Spade, Chris Elliott, Adam Sandler, and Tim Meadows. Michael McKean briefly played Clinton after Hartman, at the end of 1994. Dana Carvey once appeared as a \\"young Clinton\\" in a 1996 sketch where Bob Dole (Norm Macdonald) uses a time- machine. Beck Bennett played Clinton once, in 2013.

Naming of Ship The Legare was named in honor of Hugh Swinton Legare, the 16th Attorney General of the United States. Born in Charleston, South Carolina, on January 2, 1797, he graduated from the College of South Carolina in 1814. For the next three years he studied law, then traveled in Europe, studying French in Paris, Roman law, philosophy, math and chemistry in Edinborough. Upon his return to South Carolina in 1820, he was elected to the South Carolina State Legislature. He served until 1822, and from 1824 to 1830 when he was elected State attorney general. In 1832, he was Charg√© d'Affaires at Brussels. Upon his return to the United States, he was elected to Congress. He served from 1837 until 1839. President Tyler appointed him Attorney General of the United States in 1841. He died in Boston, Massachusetts, on June 20, 1843, while attending ceremonies at the unveiling of the Bunker Hill Monument. Class History This class of vessels was one of the most useful and long- lasting in Coast Guard service with 16 cutters still in use in the 1960s. The last to be decommissioned from active service was the Morris in 1970; the last in actual service was the Cuyahoga, which sank after an accidental collision in 1978. They were designed for trailing the \\"mother ships\\" along the outer line of patrol during Prohibition. They were constructed at a cost of $63,173 each. They gained a reputation for durability that was only enhanced by their re-engining in the late 1930s; their original 6-cylinder diesels were replaced by significantly more powerful 8-cylinder units that used the original engine beds and gave the vessels 3 additional knots. All served in World War II, but two, the Jackson and Bedloe, were lost in a storm in 1944. Ten were refitted as buoy tenders during the war and reverted to patrol work afterward. Cutter History USCGC Legare, a patrol craft of the 125-foot class, was built by American Brown Boveri Electrical Corp., Camden, New Jersey. She commissioned 17 March 1927 and patrolled out of New London, Connecticut as part of the Coast Guard's campaign against rumrunners. In 1929, the Legare pursued and seized a rumrunner, the Flor Del Mar, which was promptly abandoned by its crew. In 1931 she transferred to Pascagoula, Mississippi, to patrol the gulf coast. In pre- World War II years Legare was stationed at Norfolk, Virginia. After the United States' entry into World War Two, in accordance with Executive Order 8929 of 1 November 1941, she began to operate as part of the Navy. Fitted out to tend lighthouses, buoys, and other aids to navigation, she operated in inland and east coast waters. She also served on coastal patrol and rescue duty. While on patrol 19 March 1942 Legare received word of a submarine contact eight miles south of Hatteras. She steamed to the area, made contact, and attacked with all eight of her depth charges. Oil, debris, and air bubbles were observed on the scene, but the sinking of a submarine at this position on this date was not confirmed by captured documents examined after the war. Legare picked up three survivors from SS David H. Atwater 2 to 3 April and steamed to Chincoteague with them. On 25 June she was ordered to patrol and convoy escort duty under the Caribbean sea frontier command, and so served until the end of hostilities. Executive Order 9606 returned Legare to the Treasury Department 1 January 1946\\\\. She served as buoy tender out of Brownsville, Texas. She performed patrol as well as search and rescue duties while stationed in New Bedford, Massachusetts; and Freeport, Massachusetts. On July 26, 1956, the Legare responded in the early morning hours from her homeport of New Bedford, Massachusetts, to the SOS distress signal from the , a large Italian luxury passenger liner. On July 25, 1956, at 11:10 p.m., 45 miles south of Nantucket Island, the Andrea Doria and the Swedish ocean liner MS Stockholm collided in a heavy Atlantic fog. The Stockholm‚Äôs special ice cutting designed bow struck the Andrea Doria amidships, which ripped a great hole in the broad side of the Italian vessel. The Legare was the first U.S. Coast Guard Cutter to respond to and arrive at the scene of the disaster. The Legare was one of many ships that responded to this maritime disaster. The Legare and her crew rescued survivors of the crew and passengers from the Andrea Doria‚Äôs lifeboats. The Legare then transported the survivors to larger vessels that had also arrived at the scene in response to the SOS. Vessels like the French Line's SS √éle de France that had been eastbound from New York en route to her home port of Le Havre, France. The Legare was present for the entire rescue operation. After the rescue operation had concluded, the Legare, along with other Coast Guard cutters, used her deck guns to sink abandoned lifeboats from the then sunken Andrea Doria. These lifeboats had been declared a menace to navigation by maritime authorities.Former US Coast Guardsman serving on Legare in 1956 She was redesignated WMEC-144 in 1966 and was reclassified as a Medium Endurance Cutter. She served honorably until she was decommissioned in 1968. References Cutter History File. USCG Historian's Office, USCG HQ, Washington, D.C. Dictionary of American Naval Fighting Ships.

Biography Rostgaard came from peasant stock. From age 12 he was brought up at the home of his uncle, Hans Rostgaard, a tax collector, who had been rewarded with Krogerup Manor, for his attempt in 1659 to liberate Kronborg Castle from the Swedes during the Second Northern War. Rostgaard went to school in Helsing√∏r, and later served as a clerk under his uncle. In a fight, Rostgaard killed a soldier of the garrison, but was acquitted for manslaughter, both by the local court, and by the Supreme Court. He then served in a regiment from Courland in service of the Dutch Republic, reaching the rank of sergeant. When the Scanian War began, he returned to Denmark, and was commissioned into the Zealand Life Regiment, where he served until 1680, when his resignation was accepted. Rostgaard then served as his old uncle's deputy, until 1684, when he succeeded him in his offices as tax collector and local administrator for Kronborg amt. During the Great Northern War, the Swedish army landed at Humleb√¶k, and Rostgaard led the local militia in a doomed attempt to stop the superior Swedish forces at the beach. He was rewarded with the position of R√•dmand (alderman) in Copenhagen, and was from 1703 war commissary and tax commissioner for Sj√¶lland, M√∏n, and Lolland- Falster. During the plague outbreak he was one of the commissioners in charge of maintaining a cordon sanitaire around Helsing√∏r.

As of 2018, 88% of working-age women are employed, 65% of students attending university are female, and 41% of members of parliament are women. Nevertheless, women still earn about 14% less than men, though these statistics do not take into account the hours worked, over-time and choices of employment. Iceland has the world's highest proportion of women in the labour market, significant child care allocations for working women, and three months' parental leave for both men and women. Iceland is arguably one of the world's most feminist countries, having been awarded this status in 2011 for the second year in a row. Iceland was the first country to have a female president, Vigd√≠s Finnbogad√≥ttir, elected in 1980. It also has the world's first female and openly gay head of government, J√≥hanna Sigur√∞ard√≥ttir, who was elected prime minister in 2009. Iceland enjoys the smallest overall gender gap, according to the World Economic Forum ranking Global Gender Gap Report, a position it has held since 2009. In 2020 Iceland had a 12.2% gap, as measured across four categories: health, education, economic participation and opportunity, and political advancement. The pay gap between women and men is decreasing at a rate which would lead to parity in 2068. Women earn about 72% of men's salaries on average, and are still subject to domestic and sexual violence.  History  = Viking age (793‚Äì1066 AD)=  Age of settlement (c. 870‚Äì930)  Both Norse men and Norse women colonised England, the Shetland and Orkney Islands, and Iceland during Viking Age migrations from Scandinavia. Norse women journeyed with men as explorers, and later as settlers in the Settlement of Iceland. The settler Aud the Deep-Minded was one of the earliest known Icelandic women. She was one of the four main settlers in early Icelandic history. Other notable early Icelanders include the explorer Gudrid Thorbjarnard√≥ttir, the poet Steinunn Refsd√≥ttir, and Thorgerd Egilsdottir wife of Olaf the Peacock. The age of settlement is considered to have ended in the year 930 with the establishment of Al√æingi. Early Commonwealth Era During the Viking Age, Norse women worked in farming and commerce alongside men, and were often left in charge while their husbands were away or had been killed. Women's workshops for making woolen textiles have been found in Iceland. Textiles were used as a form of currency in medieval Iceland, and there were regulations as to what was legal tender in the oldest (11th- century) part of the Gr√°g√°s laws. Iceland exported shaggy cloaks to Europe. Viking Age society was male-dominated, with defined gender roles. The dead were buried with some of their possessions: men were buried with tools and weapons, women with needlework, jewelry, rings of keys, and household items, although beads have been found in both male and female burials. Viking Age women could own their own property, ask for a divorce and were entitled to reclaim their dowries. If a woman's husband died, she would take his place on a permanent basis; in this way, women were often running farms or trading businesses. The Icelandic Sagas make reference to women acting as nurses and midwives, and attending to the wounds of men injured in battle. = Women's suffrage = Icelanders celebrating women's suffrage in 1915. Icelandic women first got the right to vote in parliamentary elections in 1915. In 1845 the vote was limited to men above a certain age who owned property and paid taxes. These restrictions were lifted over time, and in 1903 all men could vote except farm labourers. In 1907 the right to vote in municipal elections was extended to all women, having been granted to widows and single women of independent means in 1882. A women's movement was founded by Br√≠et Bjarnh√©√∞insd√≥ttir in 1894, and a women's suffrage organsation was founded in 1907. A bill for women's suffrage was agreed on by the Althing in 1911, ratified by the Althing in 1913, and enacted on 19 June 1915 by the Danish king but only granted the vote to women over 40, and did not grant the right to vote to servants. At the time this was around 12,000 Icelandic women. In 1920 these restrictions were lifted after Iceland became an independent state under the Danish crown in 1918. = 1975 women's strike = It is said that in 1975, women in the workplace made 60% less than their male counterparts. Many were unable to work as they had to stay at home to do the housework and raise the children. On Friday, October 24, women left their formal and informal work at 14:05 (2:05 p.m.), the time at which they would have earned their day's wage had they been paid at the same average rate as men. The scale of the event was very large, involving 25,000 women in a country with just 220,000 inhabitants. In Reykjavik, almost 90% of the women participated. The first strike in 1975 affected many things. Many schoolteachers were women, so schools closed or nearly so. The walkout disrupted the telephone service, and halted the printing of newspapers, as the typesetters were all women. Daycares were mostly closed, because the daycare workers were women, so men had to take their children to work. Easy-to-cook meals ran out in many stores, as did sweets and items to distract children. The strike continued until midnight, when women returned to work. The typesetters returned to set newspapers which were almost entirely devoted to the women's strike. Woman achieved their intended goal, basically shutting down Iceland for the day. Men referred to this day as \\"the Long Friday\\". Vigd√≠s says she would not have become president without the strike which she said was the \\"first step for women's emancipation in Iceland\\", which \\"completely paralysed the country and opened the eyes of many men\\". In the year following the strike, Iceland set up the Gender Equality Council, and passed the Gender Equality Act, which prohibited gender discrimination in the workplace and in schools. = 21st century = The strike was repeated; in 1975, 2005, 2010, and 2016 women in Iceland walked out in accordance to the time of day that they would stop being paid if their wage was the same as men. On October 24, 2016 women left work at 2:38pm, for the 41st anniversary of the original women's day off. This indicated that women have gained only a half an hour more in pay in 11 years, that is slightly less than three minutes per year. The International Women's Strike, a global version inspired by the Icelandic strike, spread in 2017 and 2018. Education and employment 45.5% of the Icelandic formal workforce was women in 2010. In the 2000s, just under 80% of Icelandic women were in formal employment, the highest rate in the OECD (about 86% of men were in formal employment).OECD data, percentage, year: 77.4 (2000) 77.3 (2001) 76.7 (2002) 78.3 (2003) 76.3 (2004) 77.8 (2005) 78.5 (2006) 78.6 (2007) 77.7 (2008) 77.1 (2009) 77.6 (2010) OECD Stats. Employment: Labour force participation rate, by sex and age group Rates of mothers in work are also high, perhaps due to high childcare coverage and generous parental leave policies. Women were in formal work for an average of 35 hours a week, compared to 44 hours for men. In 2008, 65% of women working were doing so full-time, compared to 90% of men. (also available in Icelandic). 14% of Icelandic families have single mothers, while 2% have single fathers. 40% have both parents, while the remainder of families are childless. Among those not in formal employment, a 2010 survey found that 95% of those describing themselves as homemakers were women. The survey also found 1200 people on unpaid family leave, all of them women. In 1987 Icelandic fathers were given the right to share some of the mother's six month family entitlement. This was enacted due to the passing of similar laws in Norway and Sweden. In 2000, Iceland passed a law for a father's quota; three months of paid leave were reserved for the father, three for the mother, and the remaining three could be used by either parent. This was enacted in stages, with the amount of leave increased each year, being fully implemented in 2003. After the law was brought in, more than 90% of fathers used their paternal leave. Research found that this put men and women on a more equal footing in the workplace, but did not seem to affect the pay gap. In 2012, there were plans to gradually increase the leave to be five months for each parent, plus two months of transferable leave, by 2016. The Icelandic labour market is strongly gender-segregated, with substantial differences in gender ratios in different sectors. Women in Iceland are more likely to get university degrees than men, up to the PhD level. They made up forty percent of tertiary graduates in science, mathematics and computing, and 35% of graduates in engineering, manufacturing, and construction, in 2012/2013. Over 80% of health graduates, and over 70% of veterinary, agricultural, and education graduates, are women. Less than a quarter of those working as plant and machine operators and in crafts and trades, agriculture, fisheries, and management are women (although, against this trend, 60% of managers in the civil society sector are women). Women are more likely to work in the public sector, men in the private sector, which means women's employment is not as strongly affected by economic fluctuations. Women are less likely to get trade and vocational qualifications. Journalists are slightly less likely to be women than men, but less than one in three interviewees in news programs is a woman. In the wake of the 2008‚Äì2011 Icelandic financial crisis, there was a swing towards female leadership. Women had been all but absent from pre-crisis banking boards; after the crisis, they were appointed to the new boards, and two-thirds of the bank managers appointed after nationalization were female. Women were also more successful in running for political office, with the proportion of women in parliament rising to a record 43%. = Gender pay gap = Women working in fish factory in Reykjav√≠k around 1910 Iceland is arguably one of the world's most gender-equal countries. It is listed as number one in the 2016 best places to work by The Economist's women index. It has been named the most feminist country in the world, and has been listed number one on the World Economic Forum gender pay gap index since 2009. For the past eight years \\"Iceland has finished first of more than a hundred countries in the World Economic Forum‚Äôs annual Global Gender Gap ranking, which quantifies disparities between men and women in health, politics, education, and employment (the higher a country‚Äôs ranking, the smaller its gender disparities).\\" In Iceland women are paid about 18% less than their male counterparts, if working in the same job with the same level of experience; for comparison, the average European wage gap is 16.2%. Excluding ranking, position, and hours worked, the average annual income for women is 28% less than men. In rural areas, the pay gap is generally larger. At the current rate, women will not experience equal pay until 2068. The Icelandic government has said it aims to close the gender pay gap in Iceland by 2022. In 2018, Iceland made unequal pay for equal work illegal; companies and government agencies with over 25 employees face heavy fines.  Government  Iceland became the third modern democratic country in which women gained the vote in 1915. However, by 1975, there were only three parliamentarians (5% of all parliamentarians), and there had only been nine female parliamentarians in total. Other Nordic countries had 16%-23%. After the 1975 Icelandic women's strike, more women were elected. In 2015, 28 parliamentarians (44%) were female. Iceland has had a woman as either president or prime minister for 20 of the last 36 years. In the 2016 parliamentary election covering 63 seats, 30 women were elected, increasing the number of females in the Al√æingi to over 47%. Compared to the United States which sits at twenty percent, Iceland was said to have the \\"most equal parliament\\" in the world when women won 48% of the seats in 2016. = Vigd√≠s Finnbogad√≥ttir = Vigd√≠s Finnbogad√≥ttir On June 29, 1980 Vigd√≠s Finnbogad√≥ttir was voted in as the first female president of Iceland, and the fourth president of the republic. She was the first woman to be elected head of state in a national election, and the world's first democratically elected female president. After becoming president without opposition in 1984, 1988, and 1992, she retired from the presidency in 1996. Vigdis also was an artistic Director of the Reykjav√≠k Theatre Company, she was a teacher of French at the University of Iceland, and was the press officer at the National Theatre of Iceland (1954-1957 and 1961-1964). She broadcast lectures on local television, and trained local tour guides. During her time as president she used her position to focus on youth and to support forestry, while promoting Icelandic language and culture. After her retirement as president in 1996, Vigdis went on to become \\"founding chair of the Council of Women World Leaders at the John F. Kennedy School of Government at Harvard University\\". Two years later, in 1998, she was appointed president of the Unesco World Commission on the Ethics of Scientific Knowledge and Technology. = J√≥hanna Sigur√∞ard√≥ttir = J√≥hanna Sigur√∞ard√≥ttir In 2003 J√≥hanna Sigur√∞ard√≥ttir was elected as the first female Prime Minister of Iceland as well as the world's first openly lesbian head of government. She held that position for 16 years and used her leadership to attempt to ban strip clubs \\"explaining it as a necessary measure to bring about justice, which is impossible, as she concluded, when women are treated like commodities\\". Before this J√≥hanna Sigur√∞ard√≥ttir was already a very active member of government. In 1978 she was elected into the Althing as a member of the Social Democratic Party. She became minister of social affairs in 1987, a position she held until 1994. She started her own party in 1994 called National Movement, which joined with the Social Democratic Party, Women‚Äôs Alliance and the People‚Äôs Alliance in 1999, and in 2000 merged to become the Social Democratic Alliance. On June 27, 2010 Iceland declared same-sex marriage legal, and J√≥hanna and her partner J√≥n√≠na Le√≥sd√≥ttir were officially married. = Katr√≠n Jakobsd√≥ttir = Katrin Jakobsdottir Katr√≠n Jakobsd√≥ttir, a member of the left-leaning Left- Green Movement, became Iceland's second female prime minister. One of her actions as prime minister was to organise a new law which requires Icelandic companies to demonstrate that they pay men and women equally. Katr√≠n is the youngest female leader in Europe. She became a member of the Althing aged 31, the Minister of Education, Science and Culture at 33, and the leader of the Left-Green Movement at 37.  Religion  Before the Icelandic Reformation, Iceland had two convents for women: Kirkjub√¶jar Abbey and Reynista√∞arklaustur. The Church of Iceland, Iceland's established church, elected its first female bishop, Agnes M. Sigur√∞ard√≥ttir, in 2012.  Sport  Iceland women's national football team in 2012 Iceland has national women's teams for basketball, handball, volleyball, and the women's national football team which represents Iceland in international women's football. Women's football clubs in Iceland include Brei√∞ablik, Grindav√≠k, Haukar, √ç√ær√≥ttabandalag Vestmannaeyja, Knattspyrnuf√©lag Reykjav√≠kur, Stjarnan, and Valur. The √örvalsdeild kvenna is the top-tier women's football league in Iceland. It features 10 teams that play a double round robin to decide the champion, which qualifies for a spot in the UEFA Women's Champions League. The 2018 champion was Brei√∞ablik. The women's national football team has successfully qualified for and competed in the UEFA Women's Championship's in 2009, 2013, and 2017.

As a medication, it is used to cause contraction of the uterus to start labor, increase the speed of labor, and to stop bleeding following delivery. For this purpose, it is given by injection either into a muscle or into a vein. The use of synthetic oxytocin as a medication can result in excessive contraction of the uterus that can risk the health of the baby. Common side effects in the mother include nausea and a slow heart rate. Serious side effects include rupture of the uterus and with excessive dose, water intoxication. Allergic reactions including anaphylaxis may also occur. The natural occurrence of oxytocin was discovered in 1906. It is on the World Health Organization's List of Essential Medicines. Medical uses Labor induction: An intravenous infusion of oxytocin is used to induce labor and to support labor in case of slow childbirth if the oxytocin challenge test fails. Whether a high dose is better than a standard dose for labor induction is unclear. It has largely replaced ergometrine as the principal agent to increase uterine tone in acute postpartum hemorrhage. Oxytocin is also used in veterinary medicine to facilitate birth and to stimulate milk release. The tocolytic agent atosiban (Tractocile) acts as an antagonist of oxytocin receptors; this drug is registered in many countries to suppress premature labor between 24 and 33 weeks of gestation. It has fewer side effects than drugs previously used for this purpose (ritodrine, salbutamol, and terbutaline). Oxytocin has not been found to be useful for improving breastfeeding success. Contraindications Oxytocin injection (synthetic) is contraindicated in any of these conditions: * Substantial cephalopelvic disproportion * Unfavorable fetal position or presentation (e.g., transverse lies) undeliverable without conversion before delivery * Obstetric emergencies where maternal or fetal risk-to-benefit ratio favors surgery * Fetal distress when delivery is not imminent * Umbilical cord prolapse * Uterine activity fails to progress adequately * Hyperactive or hypertonic uterus * Vaginal delivery is contraindicated (e.g., invasive cervical carcinoma, active genital herpes infection, total placenta previa, vasa previa, cord presentation or prolapse) * Uterine or cervical scarring from previous cesarean section or major cervical or uterine (e.g., transfundal) surgery * Unengaged fetal head * History of hypersensitivity to oxytocin or any ingredient in the formulation Side effects Oxytocin is relatively safe when used at recommended doses, and side effects are uncommon. These maternal events have been reported: * Subarachnoid hemorrhage * Increased blood pressure * Cardiac arrhythmia including increased or decreased heart rate, and premature ventricular contraction * Impaired uterine blood flow * Pelvic hematoma * Afibrinogenemia * Anaphylaxis * Nausea and vomiting * Increase fetal blood flow Excessive dosage or long-term administration (over a period of 24 hours or longer) has been known to result in tetanic uterine contractions, uterine rupture, postpartum hemorrhage, and water intoxication, sometimes fatal. Oxytocin was added to the Institute for Safe Medication Practices's list of High Alert Medications in Acute Care Settings in 2012. The list includes medications that have a high risk for harm if administered incorrectly. During pregnancy, increased uterine motility has led to decreased heart rate, cardiac arrhythmia, seizures, brain damage, and death in the fetus or neonate. Use is linked to an increased risk of postpartum depression in the mother. Certain learning and memory functions are impaired by centrally administered oxytocin. Also, systemic oxytocin administration can impair memory retrieval in certain aversive memory tasks. However, oxytocin does seem to facilitate learning and memory specifically for social information. Healthy males administered intranasal oxytocin show improved memory for human faces, in particular happy faces. Pharmacokinetics =Routes of administration= A bag of oxytocin for intravenous infusion One IU of oxytocin is the equivalent of about 2 Œºg or mcg of pure peptide. * Injection: Clinical doses of oxytocin are given by injection either into a muscle or into a vein to cause contraction of the uterus. Very small amounts (< 1%) do appear to enter the central nervous system in humans when peripherally administered. The compound has a half life of typically about 3 minutes in the blood when given intravenously. Intravenous administration requires 40 minutes to reach a steady-state concentration and achieve maximum uterine contraction response. * Buccal: Oxytocin was delivered in buccal tablets, but this is not common practice any more. * Under the tongue: Oxytocin is poorly absorbed sublingually. * Nasal administration: Oxytocin is effectively distributed to the brain when administered intranasally via a nasal spray, after which it reliably crosses the blood‚Äìbrain barrier and exhibits psychoactive effects in humans. No serious adverse effects with short-term application of oxytocin with 18~40 IU (36‚Äì80 mcg) have been recorded. Intranasal oxytocin has a central duration of at least 2.25 hours and as long as 4 hours. * Oral: Oxytocin is destroyed in the gastrointestinal tract, so it is not active orally. History Its uterine-contracting properties were discovered by British pharmacologist Sir Henry Hallett Dale in 1906. Oxytocin's milk ejection property was described by Ott and Scott in 1910 and by Schafer and Mackenzie in 1911. Oxytocin became the first polypeptide hormone to be sequenced or synthesized. Du Vigneaud was awarded the Nobel Prize in 1955 for his work. =Etymology= The word \\"oxytocin\\" was coined from the term oxytocic. Greek ·ΩÄŒæœçœÇ, oxys, and œÑœåŒ∫ŒøœÇ, tokos, meaning \\"quick birth\\"). Society and culture =Counterfeits= Oxytocin is marketed as a pheromone. Oxytocin in spray form is sold under the brands Attrakt and Connekt. It is not absorbed into the skin when used topically, but it may be inhaled in a manner similar to perfume applied to skin. Oxytocin sprays for insufflation are also sold, but often with little or no oxytocin at all. In African countries, some oxytocin products were found to be counterfeit medications. Research The trust-inducing property of oxytocin might help those with social anxiety and depression, anxiety, fear, and social dysfunctions, such as generalized anxiety disorder, post-traumatic stress disorder, and social anxiety disorder, as well as autism and schizophrenia, among others. However, in one meta-analysis only autism spectrum disorder showed a significant combined effect size. People using oxytocin show improved recognition for positive social cues over threatening social cues and improved recognition of fear. * Autism: Oxytocin may play a role in autism and may be an effective treatment for autism's repetitive and affiliative behaviors. * Relationship counseling: The use of oxytocin in relationship counseling for well-being has been suggested.

If an ontology wishes to permit the inclusion of compositional objects it must define which collections of objects are to be considered parts composing a whole. Mereology, the study of relationships between parts and their wholes, provides specifications on how parts must relate to one another in order to compose a whole.  Mereology of material objects  Ontological disputes do not revolve around what particular matter is present; rather, the center of disputation is what objects can be said to be instantiated by a given collection of matter. The token objects posited by a given ontology may be classified as instances of one or more distinct object types. As the types of objects accepted proliferate, so do the possible tokens that a given collection of matter can be said to instantiate. This creates variations in size between ontologies, which serve as an arena for disputes among philosophers. The ontologies of present concern are those that include compositional objects among posited types. Compositional objects are objects made of a collection of one or more parts . These objects seem to be included in any intuitively constructed ontology as objects ordinarily encountered are doubtless composed of parts. For example, any ontology that affirms the existence of tables, rabbits, or rocks necessarily commits to the inclusion of some compositional objects. The specification of ‚Äòsome‚Äô compositional objects foretells the point of attack suffered by these theories. Clarification demands that these theories provide a means to account for which compositional objects are included and which are excluded. One may include tables and, presumably, chairs, but what about the composition of the table and surrounding chairs? What characteristics of a collection of parts determine that they form a whole? = Mereological nihilism = Mereological nihilism is an extreme eliminative position. Mereological nihilism denies that any objects actually instantiate the parthood relation appealed to in theoretical descriptions of mereology. If there are no relationships that count as parthood relationships, then there are no composite objects. One may initially seek to reject such a position by pointing to its counterintuitive conclusions. However, there are other mereological positions that prove equally counterintuitive and so a more substantial rebuttal is required. A principled rejection of mereological nihilism is put forward those committed to atomless gunk. A mereology is gunky if every part is itself a whole composed of further parts. There is no end to the decomposition of objects, no fundamental part or mereological atom. There is no place for the atoms posited by mereological nihilism in gunky ontologies. This causes a problem because if all that exists are atoms, but there is nothing like an atom that exists within an ontology, then nothing can be said to exist (Van Cleve, 2008). Noting the appeal of accepting that things do exist, one must reject mereological nihilism in order to maintain a gunky ontology. Not everyone will strive to maintain a gunky ontology and so mereological nihilism is still potentially a viable position. = Conservative theories = There are various attempts to conserve the existence of parthood relationships. These theories all attempt to specify characteristics that a collection of objects must possess in order to compose a whole. Characteristics may derive from some principle or be proposed as brute fact.  Principled accounts  A principled account of the composition relationship will appeal to a general characteristic which is sufficient to instantiate the relationship. Many of these accounts appeal to characteristics derived from intuitive notions about what does or does not allow objects to function as parts in a whole. Two such proposed restricting characteristics are connection and cohesion (Van Cleve, 2008). First, connection is the stipulation that objects must be spatially continuous to some degree in order to be considered parts composing a whole. Objects like tables are made of legs connected to tops. Tables and legs are in direct contact with one another, the parts are spatially contiguous. Yet, the chairs are only in proximity to the table and so do not compose a table set. In order to maintain the standard of absolute contiguity one would have to recruit the air molecules bridging span between the table and chairs. This is unsatisfactory though because it fails to exclude extraordinary objects such as the table, the air molecules, and the dog's nose as he begs for food. It seems that it is necessary to redefine connection as some degree of proximity between parts within a whole . By abandoning the extreme of direct contact, any account of connection acquires the burden of defining what degree of proximity instantiates composition. It will not do to leave specification of degree for future theorists if one cannot even show it is possible to provide such a determination in a principled manner. The continuum of the spatial dimension is a three dimensional axes composed of distinct ordered points. Suppose absolute succession of points along a dimension corresponds to direct contact of parts. According to a moderate formulation of connection, composition is instantiated by two objects separated by a countable number of discrete points (x), where (x) need not be one, but cannot be unbounded. Unfortunately, even the more moderate formulation is untenable. Criticizing the possibility of bounding degree, Sider (2001) takes as given these premises: (1) On a continuum of discrete points, if there are both instances of both composition and not, then the series of points instantiating composition (e.g. (1, 2, 3, 4)) is continuous with any series not (e.g. (5, 6, 7)). (2) There is no principled way determine a cutoff for composition along such continuums (no non-arbitrary way to determine between (1, 2, 3) and (1, 2, 3, 4)). (3) Since the nature of existence does not allow for indeterminacy a cutoff must be specified (a failure to determine between (1, 2, 3) and (1, 2, 3, 4) leaves (4) in a position between existence and non-existence that does not exist). Conclusion: If composition is to be non-arbitrary then it must either always occur or never. Sider's rejection of any bounding of degree is not particular to spatial proximity. Degree of cohesion can also be represented as a continuum. Much like absolute spatial contiguity was determined too strict, absolute cohesion is also rejected. To illustrate Van Cleve (2008) describes how a rod and line compose a fishing rod. The line must move with the rod to some degree. In order to accomplish this knots of line are tied around the rod. As the knots are tightened the line becomes more and more fixed to the rod. There is a cutoff where the line could be tighter, yet is tight enough to compose the fishing rod. Any variable represented on a continuum will fail to provide a principled determination of this cutoff.  Brute accounts  = Van Inwagen's 'Life' = According to Van Inwagen a collection of objects are considered parts composing a whole when that whole demonstrates life (Van Cleeve, 2008). This approach guarantees the existence of you and me, while ruling out extraordinary objects consistent with other conservative theories. Detractors of the 'life' criterion point out the difficulty of defining when life is present. It is not clear if a virion, a virus particle composed of nucleic acid and surrounding capsid, is a compositional object or not. Additionally, in some formerly paradigmatic cases of life it can be difficult to identify when it is no longer present, and thus the compositional object is no longer extant (e.g. brain death). = Mereological universalism = Mereological universalism is an extreme permissive position. Essentially, mereological universalism contends that any collection of objects constitutes a whole. This secures the existence of any compositional objects intuitively thought to exist. However, by the same light that ordinary objects exist, so do much stranger ones. For example, there exists both the object composed of my key ring and keys and the object composed of the moon and six pennies located on James Van Cleve's desk (Van Cleve, 2008). Motivation for such a counterintuitive position is not immediately apparent, but arises from the ability to reject all alternatives. Despite little intuitive appeal, mereological universalism seems less susceptible to principled rejection than any of its alternatives.

It was built, because at the time, white home care institutions would not accept black children in need. In the 1960s segregation was coming to an end, and black people were being integrated into white institutions. In the present day, the building is used as a meeting place for community groups. The home came under fire when many former residents came forward with allegations of abuse they experienced during their time at the home, which ended in a class action lawsuit, and an apology from the Premier of Nova Scotia. History The home opened in Halifax, Nova Scotia on June 6, 1921 to accept black children in need of care who, at the time, were not permitted in white institutions. A crowd of 3000 spectators, the largest gathering of black Nova Scotians since 1783, celebrated the opening of the home. During the end of segregation and into the 1970s the home became an institution for children of all races and ethnic backgrounds. The home came under fire when many former residents reported physical and sexual abuse they suffered during their time at the home. On October 10, 2014, the premier of Nova Scotia, Stephen McNeil, gave an apology to those who suffered due to the Nova Scotia Home for Colored Children. A class action lawsuit with the province of Nova Scotia was settled in July 2014, which awarded 300 former residents $29 million on top of $5 million settled in the summer of 2013 with the Nova Scotia Home for Colored Children. Unfortunately, many of the former residents are still waiting for the money awarded to them. The former schoolhouse is now used as a meeting place for local community groups. In 2006, author, teacher, artist and community activist Delvina Bernard, whose father had grown up in the home, contributed a piece of wood from the building to the Six String Nation project. Parts of that material are used as a finger brace and a reinforcing strip on the interior of Voyageur, the guitar at the heart of the project. Apology An official apology was made in the provincial legislature by the Premier to the former residents and community leaders of the Nova Scotia Home for Colored Children. Premier Stephen McNeill apologised for the mistreatment, mental, psychological and sexual abuse inflicted on the orphans by staff members for almost a 50-year period. This abuse was discontinued in the 1980s. McNeil noted that this was one of the most horrific events that took place in the province and the cries of the people fell on deaf ears for so long. McNeil also noted that he is thankful to the former residents for their courage and ability to share their stories and bring awareness and inspiration to other African Nova Scotia communities, and all Nova Scotians. Tony Smith, a former resident of the Nova Scotia Home for Colored Children, was thankful to the persons who advocated for many years to bring awareness of the abuse and mistreatment that the blacks received, and this took a lot of time, effort and energy to bring this project together and now people are becoming aware. Tony Smith has been ordained by his friends and co-workers to be their ‚Äúvoice‚Äù, and bring awareness throughout the community. This is only the tip of the iceberg though, persons need to be aware of what really happened why it happened and how the overall decisions affected Black Nova Scotians. Due to these issue racism and inequality will continue for generations until there are put to a stop. An implementation of a process that will not bring further harm to the already open wound, should implore all voices that want to be heard, and potential build healthy relationships with one another in-order to live in peace and harmony. Theoretical perspective Understanding the reason for the existence of the Nova Scotia Home for Colored Children stems from the history of racism and racial segregation in Nova Scotia as well as Canada. There are infamous cases of segregation related issues in Nova Scotia and Canada, such as Viola Desmond, the historic treatment of Chinese immigrants, the placement of Japanese Canadians in internment camps during World War 2, and the historic and contemporary treatment of the indigenous population. Segregation on the basis of race is rooted in the belief that there are distinct differences between people of different skin colors. Majority of anthropologists and biologists have abandoned the notion of racial categories and any attempts to prove the existence of race on a biological level. Social scientists have come to understand race as a social construct, forming from what is called racial formation. This formation of the concept of race creates a separation between those in power, white people, and those subjugated to said power, persons of color, and an exclusion of persons of color from aspects of society. Those that produce the knowledge and determine what is moral in society are part of the traditional power holding white culture. The racial knowledge created by these knowledge producers aids in the creation and maintenance of the concept of the other. Racial knowledge establishes an understanding of what it means to be the other, a specific set of behaviors, guiding ideas and ideologies of otherness. This concept of the other denies autonomy to those labeled as such and extends power, control, authority, domination over them.

He was appointed the Superintendent of the Oakland Unified School District in Oakland, California, in 2014, and resigned effective February 2017. On December 20, 2016, he was confirmed as Chancellor of the District of Columbia Public Schools in Washington, D.C. He began his new position on February 1, 2017. Wilson resigned as DCPS chancellor on February 20, 2018, after media reports that he had bypassed the school system's lottery process to win a place at a prestigious school for one of his children. Early life and education Wilson was born in Wichita, Kansas, about 1972. He has one younger brother and one younger sister. He grew up in Wichita and in Lincoln, Nebraska, and for most of this time his mother was single. The family was very poor, and Wilson's mother had to work several jobs to support her children. He often lived in areas where drug use and drug dealing, violence, and gangs were common. Antwan was, by his own admission, shy and somewhat insecure as a child. He attended local public schools in Wichita and Lincoln, and the family moved frequently so that the Wilson children could attend better schools. He graduated from Lincoln High School (where he was one of only a handful of minority students). Wilson's mother broke her back in a workplace injury when he was a senior in high school. He decided to attend college at a local institution of higher learning so that he could remain at home and assist with her recovery while getting a degree. He attended Nebraska Wesleyan University, where he received a Bachelor of Arts degree in history-social science education. Wilson entered college intending to be a pre-law major, with the goal of attending law school and becoming a civil rights attorney. But in his sophomore year, he and a close friend began discussing how education plays a role in ending poverty and racism. During spring break, they traveled to Chicago, Illinois, where they observed the classroom teaching style of Linda Murray, an award-winning educator at Hyde Park Career Academy. Wilson began adding education classes, and in time switched his major. In 2000, Wilson received his master's degree in educational leadership from Friends University in Wichita. Wilson graduated in 2014 from Broad Superintendents Academy, an unaccredited private certification program established by billionaire Eli Broad to train urban educational administrators in leadership skills.; Early career =Wichita and Lincoln= After graduation, Wilson resolved to teach for at least five years. He spent a year teaching in Raleigh, North Carolina, and then three years teaching at a high school in Wichita. He also coached basketball and track. In 1999, Wilson accepted a job as an assistant principal at Lincoln High School in Lincoln, Nebraska, but left after a year to take a position as assistant principal at Wichita South High School. Wilson was appointed principal at Wichita's Pleasant Valley Middle School, the first time he taught in a school where most of the students came from poverty- stricken backgrounds and were under-performing. Wilson adopted the motto \\"Success for all. No excuses.\\" during his time at Pleasant Valley, and implemented a number of programs for students, faculty, and parents to boost attendance, reduce discipline problems, and improve learning. =Denver= In 2005, Wilson accepted a position as principal at Montbello High School in Denver, Colorado. The school, which opened in 1980 in a poverty- and violence- ridden area of the city, had the nickname \\"Mont-ghetto\\". Students at Montbello had struggled to do well, and attendance, graduation rates, and state test scores were all low. Discipline problems were rife at the school, and teacher turnover was high. Wilson initially implemented a program of strict discipline, in which students were not allowed to skip classes, hang out in hallways, or form large groups in hallways. Students who did not turn in assignments were required to spend part of their lunch time doing homework, and suspensions were largely replaced with in-school detention combined with intense academic work. Later, Wilson encouraged faculty to focus on teaching basic skills, improving critical thinking, and using a more interactive teaching approach. This included building community spirit at Montbello as well as extensive assessment. Testing was viewed as a means of identifying what skills and knowledge needed to be taught, rather than as a way of seeing which students were not achieving. State test scores improved and suspensions decreased during Wilson's tenure at Montbello. In 2008, Wilson was appointed High School Instructional Superintendent for the Denver Public Schools. A year later, he was promoted to Assistant Superintendent for Post-Secondary Readiness. During his tenure as assistant superintendent, Wilson co-founded a program titled \\"Denver Summit Schools\\" that targeted the school district's 11 worst-performing schools. Each school received a theme (such an international studies or culinary arts), assistance with discipline and behavioral issues, and began offering Advanced Placement courses. Teachers received new instructional training and additional support. Enrollment at the schools soared, the dropout rate fell by 60 percent, and test scores rose (most significantly for racial minorities). Oakland In 2014, Wilson was named the superintendent of the Oakland Unified School District in Oakland, California. He succeeded Dr. Gary Yee, the acting superintendent. His reputation for turning around low-performing schools in Denver attracted him to the Oakland search committee. Wilson was selected from a pool of 20 candidates, five of which were finalists for the position. The school board voted to hire him unanimously. He was given a four-year contract, with a start date of July 1, 2014. =Initiatives= While working in Oakland, Wilson implemented several administrative changes. He established a new teacher and leader evaluation system, and improved each school's autonomy regarding staffing and the adoption of teaching innovations. Wilson centralized other operations, particularly in the area of finance. This allowed the district to close its books and complete a financial audit for the first time in a decade. This led to a significant improvement in the school district's credit rating, which led to savings on interest rates and freed money for new spending. Wilson also began sending more money to each local school, and spending less on central administration. Wilson also hired Lance Jackson, chief operating officer for SGI Construction Management, to act as the school district's interim facilities manager in order to fill a position which had been empty for several years. As he did as assistant superintendent in Denver, Wilson focused a good deal of attention on the worst-performing schools. He implemented a program at the five most troubled schools, replacing their principals, revamping the curriculum, and adding enrichment and extracurricular activities (such as art, choir, and speech and debate). He also collaborated with a wide range of public education stakeholders to create \\"Oakland Promise\\", an initiative to triple in 10 years the number of Oakland public school students successfully entering college. The program won national attention. Another of Wilson's emphases as superintendent was a commitment to social-emotional learning. Wilson also worked to integrate Oakland's charter schools more closely with the public school system. In 2015, Wilson began an initiative to have the charter schools and public schools adopt the same curriculum, teaching methods, staff development, and administrative procedures. The following year, Wilson attempted to require use of a single form for parents to use when applying for their child's enrollment at a public school or charter school. His goal was to eliminate cherry picking by charter schools, and make charter school admissions more transparent. Under Wilson, the Oakland school district also negotiated a new collective bargaining agreement with its teacher and education paraprofessional unions in 2016. It was the first time since 2009 that the two sides had been able to reach an agreement. =Criticisms= Wilson's tenure in Oakland was described as \\"rocky\\" by the press. His low-performing school reconstitution initiative proved controversial. The single-form initiative for charter and public school enrollment was strongly opposed by some teachers and parents, who saw it as an attempt to turn public schools into charter schools. Some parents felt this would segregate African American students into the lowest-performing public schools, and drain public schools of much-needed funds. Several people claimed Wilson was \\"the face of new Jim Crow\\" an \\"Uncle Tom\\", and a stooge of \\"corporate oligarchy\\". Parents of special needs students accused Wilson of attempting to mainstream their children without providing adequate personnel or funds to mainstream teachers, thereby harming their children's health and education. Wilson's certification by the Broad Superintendents Academy generated controversy as well, for his critics felt that Wilson now advocated Eli Broad's plan to close all but the top-performing public schools and transform the education system into charter schools. Although some members of the Oakland school board, the city's teachers' union, and some community groups criticized Wilson for moving too fast and ignoring community concerns. Wilson's decision to hire Jackson as interim facilities director also was criticized for creating a conflict of interest, as SGI Construction Management also oversaw the school district's construction program. The use of racist epithets and the level of anger toward Wilson became so bad that African American clergy and local NAACP officials began appearing at school board meetings to help keep calm, encourage civility, and defend (to some degree) Wilson. The strength of the public attacks on Wilson declined afterward. Despite the criticisms, a large bloc of school board members gave Wilson their vocal and constant support during his tenure in the city. Wilson was strongly criticized for leaving the school district with a $30 million budget deficit. The deficit, made public just a month before his departure, was caused by rapid expansion in programs, cost overruns in existing programs, and a $10 million loss in state funding due to lower enrollment, among other factors. Wilson defended the budget, arguing that he had balanced OUSD's budget every year in the past, and that asking for full funding of programs and making cuts later was a normal part of the budget process. Washington, D.C. On November 21, 2016, Washington, D.C., Mayor Muriel Bowser nominated Wilson to be the Chancellor of the District of Columbia Public Schools. Bowser said Wilson was a \\"proven manager\\" who \\"was bold and strategic and open and transparent\\". She highlighted Wilson's ability to bring fiscal stability to the school district. Wilson announced the same day that he was resigning as superintendent of the Oakland school district, effective in February 2017. Wilson's nomination required approval by the Council of the District of Columbia. DCPS analyst Mary Levy later noted that Bowser had provided \\"no public information\\" about the process she used to identify potential candidates, nor who she had considered. At a confirmation hearing on December 7, 2016, the D.C. city council questioned Wilson about how he would approach problems faced by the city schools. Wilson advocated longer school days, tutoring, and other resources for struggling children. He also promoted more extracurricular activities for middle schoolers. Some individuals and groups voiced concern over his nomination, arguing that his programs have been only moderately successful in Denver and Oakland. His nomination was unanimously confirmed by the council on December 20, and his first day on the job was February 1, 2017. In November 2017, The Washington Post reported that Wilson had left the Oakland public school system in an unresolved financial crisis. Wilson, the newspaper said, had downplayed Oakland's $30 million budget deficit to D.C. officials and the public. Carmelita Reyes, principal of Oakland International High School, co-chair of Oakland's Principals Advisory Committee, and a member of the Oakland School District Budget Advisory Committee, said that shortly after Wilson announced his resignation, all school district budgets in Oakland were frozen due to the emerging financial crisis. The Post disclosed that: * Wilson hired dozens of new executive staff, created new positions and departments that were not budgeted, and paid these individuals more than usual salary offered by the Oakland school district. * In his last year in office in Oakland, Wilson overspent his budget for classified supervisors and administrators by $11.8 million (more than double what was budgeted), and his budget for professional and consulting services by $6.8 million (almost a third more than what was budgeted). * During the two- and-a-half years Wilson was employed as Oakland superintendent, the Oakland school district chronically underspent the budget for books and classroom supplies. In the 2015-2016 school year, only $12.3 million was spent (about a third less than budgeted), and the spending dropped to just $6.8 million in the 2016-2017 school year (two-thirds less than budgeted). * In a potential conflict of interest, Wilson hired the head of a consulting firm which was already doing business for the Oakland school district. This individual was paid $30,000 a month. * The Wilson administration in Oakland overestimated the number of students it would enroll for the 2016-2017 school year. When the actual enrollment numbers came in low, the school district should have laid off several dozen teachers. It declined to do so, which cost the district $3.2 million. The fiscal crisis in Oakland was so severe, that on August 15, 2017, the state-run Fiscal Crisis and Management Assistance Team (FCMAT, which assists the district in managing its affairs), said the Oakland public school district had \\"lost control of its spending, [and] allow[ed] school sites and departments to ignore and override board policies by spending beyond their budgets.\\" FCMAT also concluded that during Wilson's tenure as superintendent, \\"this behavior has permeated to the site administration, causing a lack of consistency in appropriate site size, staffing, class offerings and budgets.\\" Auditors for the state of California concluded in another report that, under Wilson, the Oakland school district had \\"lost control of its spending\\". On November 8, 2015, the Oakland Board of Education ordered $15.1 million in emergency budget cuts, even though the budget had already been significantly cut earlier in the year. Both Superintendent Wilson and Mayor Bowser declined to comment on the Oakland crisis when questioned by the media in late November 2017. Principal Reyes said that the school board shared responsibility with Wilson for budget overruns, excessive new supervisory hires, excessive salaries, and the lack of both software and staff to oversee spending. The Washington Post noted that most D.C. school system observers had \\"no firm opinions\\" about Wilson's tenure in the District of Columbia. =Resignation= In April 2017, local news media reported that several D.C. government and DCPS officials had won special permission to transfer their children to other schools without going through the admissions lottery. Any student seeking to enroll at a school outside their assigned school boundary must enter this lottery (although some exceptions for discretionary transfers exist), which ensures fairness in awarding positions. These special permissions had been granted by Wilson's predecessor, Kaya Henderson. In the summer of 2017, Wilson established a new policy prohibiting the DCPS chancellor from granting non- lottery admissions without following the exceptions procedures. On February 16, 2018, Wilson admitted in an interview with WAMU, a local public radio station, that he asked then-Deputy Mayor for Education Jennifer Niles to exempt his daughter from the admissions lottery and immediately transfer her from Duke Ellington School of the Arts (where she was having personal and academic problems) to Woodrow Wilson High School. The request was granted. A wide range of public and private individuals called for Wilson's resignation. Wilson initially refused. By Tuesday morning, February 20, seven of the 13 members of the D.C. Council had joined the call for Wilson's resignation. Mayor Muriel Bower placed Wilson on administrative leave and asked for his resignation. Wilson resigned, effectively immediately, later that afternoon. Dr. Amanda Alexander, head of the DCPS Office of Elementary Schools, was appointed interim chancellor. Wilson's contract potentially provides for severance pay and an in-lieu salary payout. Mayor Bowser said these financial arrangements will be negotiated by the school district and Wilson shortly. Professional organizations While superintendent in Oakland, Wilson joined the National Commission on Social, Emotional, and Academic Development and Chiefs for Change. He is listed as an advisor to Code.org, the educational platform that runs the popular Hour of Code program. Personal life Wilson married his wife, Tresa (also an educator), while working in Wichita from 2000 to 2003. The couple had a daughter, and twin daughters. Wilson is well known for waking every day at 3 A.M. to exercise, meditate, and prepare for the day. His role models include his mother; his mentor and former teacher, Tim Carroll; Barack and Michelle Obama; football coach Vince Lombardi; and former basketball player Magic Johnson.

It is an erect shrub with branches covered with greyish, rusty- coloured hairs, leaves with a blistered appearance and with white, pink or purple flowers over an extended period. Description Hemiphora bartlingii is shrub which grows to a height of about and has branches that are densely covered with greyish, rusty-coloured hairs. The leaves are linear to lance- shaped, but often appear almost cylindrical because their edges are strongly turned under. The leaves are long, wide with a blistered upper surface and a hairy lower surface. The flowers are arranged singly or in groups of up to three in leaf axils near the ends of the branches, on woolly stalks long. The flowers are surrounded by leafy, linear to lance-shaped, woolly bracts and bracteoles which are densely woolly on the outer surface, less so on the inner side. The bracts are long and longer than the sepals. The five sepals are long, linear to lance-shaped, woolly on their outer surface and joined to form a short tube near their bases. The petals are long and joined for most of their length to form a broad tube which is white, pink or purple with purple spots inside. The outside of the petal tube has a few short hairs but glabrous on the inside except for a narrow ring of hairs around the ovary. There are five lobes on the end of the tube, the lower, central lobe elliptic to almost round, long and wide and much larger than the other lobes which are a similar size and shape to each other. The four stamens are shorter than the tube, the lower pair slightly longer than the upper ones. Flowering occurs in most months and the fruit is oval-shaped and with the sepals remaining attached.Woolly dragon flowers Taxonomy and naming This species was first formally described in 1844 by Johann Lehmann and given the name Chloanthes bartlingii. The description was published in Delectus Seminum quae in Horto Hamburgensium botanico e collectione. In 1870 George Bentham changed the name to Pityrodia bartlingii and in 2011, Barry Conn, Murray Henwood and Nicola Streiber changed it to the present name. The specific epithet (bartlingii) honours the German botanist Friedrich Gottlieb Bartling. Distribution Woolly dragon mostly occurs to the north of Perth but is found between Busselton and the Murchison River, sometimes as far east as Yellowdine. It grows in sandy kwongan and woodland in the Geraldton Sandplains, Swan Coastal Plain, Avon Wheatbelt, Jarrah Forest and Mallee biogeographic regions.

Its is incorporated in Singapore, but its operational headquarters are in Edinburgh, Scotland, United Kingdom. Initially, it was a developer of the tidal power turbines and projects, but after becoming a part of GFG Alliance it has expanded its business also to the waste-to-energy and hydropower.  History  In February 2014, Atlantis became the world's first tidal energy company to float on the LSE's AIM and commenced construction on MeyGen, Europe's largest tidal power project in the Pentland Firth. On 20 February 2017, the company announced that it had completed the phase 1a of the Meygen project. This phase included the design, manufacture and deployment of four 1.5 MW turbines. The project received ¬£1.5 million Scottish Government grant in 2020. A number of strategic investments and acquisitions occurred in late 2015 and throughout 2016. In 2017, GFG Alliance acquired 49.99% stake in the company in return of the coal-fired Uskmouth power station, which will be converted to the waste-to-energy plant. Consequently, Atlantis Resources was renamed SIMEC Atlantis Energy. In 2019, it acquired the Scottish hydro developer Green Highland Renewables. In 2020, it created a subsidiary Atlantis Operations Japan, which will build a tidal turbine between the southern Japanese islands of Hisaka and Naru islands for Kyuden Mirai Energy.  Operations  Atlantis has commercial and project development teams based in Edinburgh, an operations base located at Nigg Energy Park in Invergordon and the turbine and engineering services division is located in Bristol. Through its subsidiaries, the company develops or operates the 6 MW Meygen tidal turbine array in Pentland Firth, Scotland, a 160 MW Wyre tidal barrage on the River Wyre, and the 220 MW waste-to-energy Uskmouth power project. In the cooperation with the China Shipbuilding Industry Corporation and the China Three Gorges Corporation, it helped to design the 500-kilowatt tidal-stream turbine which was installed between Putuoshan and Huludao islands in the Zhoushan archipelago, China.

The player controls a young woman named Kay who suffers from such strong loneliness that her inner feelings of hopelessness, anger and worthlessness turn to the outside and she becomes a monster. As Kay the player explores a seemingly empty, flooded city and its scaly red-eyed creatures in order to reveal why Kay herself has turned into a monster. The emotions of her manifest into giant monsters standing in her way, trying to help but also destroy her. Kay needs to interact with and understand their underlying intentions in order to overcome the negative effects of those emotions. The game is in the core an inner dialogue of a person trying to come to terms with their own shortcomings. The quarrels between her parents, the emotional isolation of a friend and the terrible experiences of her brother being bullied are presented on a metaphorical level - the experiences hunt her as enormous monsters she now has to face, representing feelings like loneliness, depression, as well as fear and loss of attachment. The city where the game takes place is based on Berlin. The developers announced the game online in February 2015. Its creative director, Cornelia Geppert, described the project, even though several parts of the game are not from her own past, as her most personal and artistic, in how it led her to probe her own fears and emotions following an emotional abusive relationship from 2014 to 2017. In March 2019, The New York Times highlighted the game as part of a growing trend in the video game industry towards tackling mental health issues. Sea of Solitude is not meant to be fun in the classical meaning, its focus is on letting players experience what it feels like to be affected by loneliness, bullying, toxic relationships, depression and a troubling past. Gamers are put in the midst of the conflict, with a call to not only feel the effects but also to influence and change the actions. Electronic Arts published the game under its indie game program EA Originals. The game's release was postponed from spring to summer of 2019 before having a set release date of July 5, 2019. Reception Sea of Solitude received \\"mixed or average reviews\\", according to review aggregator Metacritic. Destructoid wrote that \\"Sea of Solitude' stands out as heartfelt, almost painfully sincere, so much so that I hesitated to actually put a score on this review at all. It felt almost crass to do so, like being allowed to read a relative's diary, only to give it a thumbs-up or -down.\\" Game Informer said that \\"Sea of Solitude\\" provides an insightful look at how mental health devastates the lives of not just those it affects, but also loved ones on the outside. Kay learns a lot about herself by understanding the value of listening, coming to term with her flaws, and not just empathizing with family but also accepting that a simple fix isn't always possible.\\" Vice Media said \\"The kind of story Sea of Solitude is trying to tell is deeply ambitious. It's the kind of game that might take an indie studio numerous attempts, even with the support of a giant like EA. Sea of Solitude may have drawbacks, but at the end of the day the game is still a stunning accomplishment.\\". The Guardian describes Sea of Solitude \\"a dazzling and cathartic exploration of mental health\\" and \\" a rare and audacious game that tackles depression and its causes head-on\\". Other reviews were more mixed. IGN summarised the game by saying that \\"Sea of Solitude gives you a beautiful world and an intriguing story but the gameplay fails to evolve enough to make this a compelling adventure\\", while Game Revolution wrote \\"In essence, it‚Äôs a boat that looks nice from the outside until you jump inside and notice all the holes actively trying to sink the whole thing.\\" The game was nominated for \\"Games for Impact\\" at The Game Awards 2019, for \\"Game, Special Class\\" at the NAVGTR Awards, and for the Matthew Crump Cultural Innovation Award at the SXSW Gaming Awards. Five months after its initial release, the Creative Director Cornelia Geppert held an official Ted Talk about Sea of Solitude detailing the story of loneliness, the many metaphors in the game and the personal background that lead to creating the title. The game won the Unity (game engine) Award for Best 3D Visuals.

Knowlys was born in London, the fourth son of William Knowlys, a merchant of London. He was educated at Botesdale and at Christ's College, Cambridge but left before taking his degree. Knowlys was admitted to the Middle Temple in 1774 and called to the Bar in 1782. He began to practise at the Central Criminal Court (the Old Bailey) immediately after his call to the Bar and between 1783 and 1803 he was engaged in over 1300 cases there. During the 1790s Knowlys shared the leadership of Old Bailey practice with Jerome William Knapp. Knowlys was made a Bencher of the Middle Temple in 1817, Reader in 1819 and Treasurer in 1826.John Venn (editor), Alumni Cantabrigienses: A Biographical List of All Known Students, Graduates and Holders of Office at the University of Cambridge, from the Earliest Times to 1900 Volume 2: from 1752 to 1900, Cambridge University Press (2011) - Google Books pg 68 He was elected Common Serjeant of London (1803-1811), the second most senior permanent judge of the Central Criminal Court and Recorder of London (1822‚Äì33), the senior Circuit Judge at the Central Criminal Court. hearing trials of criminal offences.Allyson N.

The Times had been against his election, disparagingly describing him as \\"a mere practitioner in the courts\\"The Times 1 April 1822 adding that he lacked the personal dignity and legal ability required for the role. Like John Silvester before him Knowlys was against reforming England's severe criminal law. Knowlys was forced to resign in 1833 after issuing a warrant for the execution for Job Cox, a postman in the service of the General Post Office who was charged with stealing the contents of a letter entrusted to him for delivery. Knowlys had sentenced Cox to death and later sent the warrant for his execution even though Cox in the meantime had received a Royal Pardon commuting his sentence to transportation for life. On the error being discovered it was reported that: > \\"Mr Knowlys, who at this time filled the office of Recorder, was immediately > called upon to explain to the Common Hall of the City of London the > circumstances which attended the very remarkable error into which he had > fallen.

Located in the town of Grimsby in the Regional Municipality of Niagara, it would be a stop on the Lakeshore West line, east of the proposed Confederation GO Station in Hamilton. It was expected to open in 2021 and would have been the first station to open in the planned Niagara extension, which will also include stops at and stations. Three potential sites for the station along the Grimsby Subdivision Canadian National Railway track were considered. The three sites were at Bartlett Avenue in the east, at Victoria Avenue in the town centre adjacent to the Grimsby railway station used by Via Rail, and at Casablanca Boulevard in the west. In November 2018, Metrolinx sent a letter to the government of the Regional Municipality of Niagara stating that it was halting the delivery process for this station and other stations in the Niagara extension, as the Government of Ontario was instead seeking private financing of their construction. Site research As part of an environmental assessment for the broader rail expansion project to Niagara Region, three potential sites in Grimsby were evaluated for the cultural heritage impact of construction of a train station building and associated facilities such as parking and platforms. This included reviewing the book 1876 illustrated Historical Atlas of the Counties of Lincoln and Welland, Ontario, for features in Lincoln County and Welland County, historic counties in the province now part of Niagara Region; none of the three sites were found to have features of historic value requiring preservation by document review. Field reviews were undertaken in January and March 2010 to identify and photograph cultural heritage resources within or near each potential station site. These identified six cultural heritage resources that may incur an impact from a railway station, all adjacent to the Victoria Avenue site. The April 2011 Niagara Rail Service Expansion Environmental Study Report recommended the Casablanca Avenue site as the preferred option for a train station in Grimsby. Among the reasons cited were that adjacent lands are primarily commercial, there are no cultural or natural heritage features to protect, no watercourses are impacted, and GO Transit already operates a GO Bus service at the site. =Bartlett Avenue site= The Bartlett Avenue site (LA8) is part of Lots 1 and 2 of Concession 1 of the historic Lincoln County. The vacant site is on the east side of Bartlett Avenue and south of the Queen Elizabeth Way, at mile 25.67 of the Grimsby Subdivision. The site is within the provincial Greenbelt of the Golden Horseshoe, officially designated as \\"Tender Fruit and Grape Lands\\" provincially and a \\"Specialty Crop Area\\" municipally. =Victoria Avenue site= Great Western Railway station in Grimsby, built in 1853 and seen here when used by Randall and Falconbridge Fruit Dealers circa 1908. The station is protected by the Ontario Heritage Act. The Victoria Avenue site (LA9) is adjacent to the site of the Grimsby railway station built in the 1990s, on the site of the second and third stations in Grimsby that were destroyed by fire. It is part of Lots 9 and 10 of Concession 1 in the historic Lincoln County. The site is on the south side of the Canadian National Railway tracks, extending west of Ontario Street and east of Maple Avenue. It is surrounded by developed areas consisting of residential structures from the late 19th century and early 20th century, as well as commercial and industrial buildings. Of the six cultural heritage resources identified adjacent to the site, the only one protected by the Ontario Heritage Act is the former Great Western Railway station built in 1853. Land at this site is municipally designated for commercial development. The site is at mile 27.4 of the Grimsby Subdivision. =Casablanca Boulevard site= The Casablanca Boulevard site (LA10) is part of Lots 19 and 20 at Concession 1 Lincoln of the historic Lincoln County. The site required an additional field review for cultural heritage resources in September 2010 after the site under consideration was expanded. It is a vacant 5.4 hectare parcel of land that straddles the Canadian National Railway tracks west of Casablanca Boulevard, and is at mile 29.37 of the Grimsby Subdivision. North of the railway tracks, the lands are designated for commercial development. The land to the south is within the Greenbelt, and is officially designated as \\"Tender Fruit and Grape Lands\\" provincially and a \\"Specialty Crop Area\\" municipally. The site may also have unidentified or unexplored archaeological resources. The level crossing at Casablanca Boulevard may require grade separation in the future. As of 2011, the site will require a capital investment of $10 million for development, excluding track improvements and grade separation, and future expansion will cost $12.6 million. Services The Niagara Rail Service Expansion Environmental Study Report specified the developed site will include a station building on the north side of the Canadian National Railway tracks, a parking lot with 470 spaces, a kiss and ride and taxi drop-off area, and bus bays. These will be linked by a pedestrian tunnel to a platform on the south side of the tracks. The site can accommodate an additional 970 parking spaces on the south side of the tracks, and a platform on the north side of the tracks for future development. There is currently no local transit service in Grimsby for connector services, though the Town of Grimsby Official Plan (2009) states the town intends to \\"explore opportunities for the provision of public transit\\". GO Transit operates a park and ride stop at Casablanca Boulevard on hourly service between Burlington GO Station and Niagara Falls.

Cultivation and sale of cannabis remains illegal. Cultivation Georgia illegally cultivates some small amounts of cannabis, mostly for local consumption. As of 2005, Georgia also served as a transit route for drugs coming from Central Asia, headed for Russia and Europe. Enforcement Before Georgia legalized cannabis it had a strict anti-drug policy, under which offenders could have been jailed for up to 14 years. The advocacy group White Noise Movement states that over 100 people are drug tested by Georgian police daily. Following the 2006 strengthening of the drug laws, Georgia collected $11.3 million in drug- related fines in the first year. Reform Beginning in 2013 there were calls from various advocacy groups and opposition politicians to decriminalize cannabis, but the government remained opposed. In October 2015, the Constitutional Court of Georgia ruled that the norm of the country's Constitution about imprisonment for personal use of cannabis was \\"too strict\\" and needed to be relaxed. In December 2016, the Court further declared that imprisonment for use of small amounts of cannabis, as well as its purchase, retention, and production for personal use, was unconstitutional. On 30 July 2018, the Constitutional Court of Georgia ruled that \\"consumption of marijuana is an action protected by the right to free personality\\" and that \\"[Marijuana] can only harm the user's health, making that user him/herself responsible for the outcome. The responsibility for such actions does not cause dangerous consequences for the public.\\" The ruling made legal the use and possession of cannabis in Georgia but kept in place penalties for cultivation and sale of the drug. Actions which also remain illegal include public consumption and use in the presence of children. =Protests= In December 2016 the White Noise Movement held a protest outside the Parliament building calling for decriminalization of drugs, including cannabis. On New Year's Eve of 2016, Girchi Party activists planted cannabis plants in 84 pots in the party's Tbilisi headquarters, in defiance of Georgian drug policy. Georgian police officers arrived and confiscated the plants, but did not charge party members with any criminal offense. On 20 October 2018 Girchi Party activists held the Cannabis Legalization Festival in the downtown of Tbilisi protesting the new aim of Parliament to pass a bill restricting the consumption of cannabis.

He was born on the Peigan Nation, SW of Fort Macleod, Alta on 7 November 1898, of a traditional Cree family who were among the last to settle on their allotted reserve at Hobbema in central Alberta. A Treaty 6 nation location between Calgary and Edmonton and located on oil and gas reserves. Smallboy became a hunter, trapper, farmer, and eventually chief of the Ermineskin Band from 1959 to 1969. In 1968, to escape deteriorating social and political conditions on the reserve, he moved to a bush camp on the Kootenay Plains. He attributed the alcoholism, drug abuse and suicide that he saw in his community to living modern lives on the reserve. Accompanied by approximately 125 people and with help from other elders he moved his community. Despite factional splits, the return of many residents to Hobbema, and the group's failure to obtain permanent land tenure, Smallboy Camp persisted into the 1980s as a working community used as a retreat by Plains and Woodlands Indians from western Canada and the US. Smallboy received the Order of Canada in 1979. Early life Smallboy was born in 1898. He was named Kesayo (Bobtail) by his famous Grand Father (Bobtail). An Order of Canada Certificate and Medical Scholarship established in his honour are both in the name of Robert Smallboy and Smallboy (Cree name Apitchitchiw). A baptism certificate names the chief as \\"Johnny Smallboy\\". He married Louisa Headman in Hobbema at Our Lady of the Seven Sorrows Church 1918. Smallboy was descended from two great families of the Cree Nation. He inherited his natural ability for the leadership from Big Bear & Bobtail. He was a farmer 1920s. Smallboy Camp or Mountain Cree Camp Smallboy became Chief of the Ermineskin Cree Nation in 1959. He led a delegation to Ottawa after becoming a chief. He used this opportunity to address with the Canadian Government about the problems of his people. The issues that he laid out were: a need for more land, unemployment, the breaking down of family units, rampant alcoholism, child neglect was common, and children were performing poorly in school. There was great loss of pride, dignity, religion, and social order. This left people with little meaning in their lives, his pleas for help fell on deaf ears. As oil development and modernization engulfed his reserve, Chief Smallboy was saddened by the increasing use of alcohol and drugs, his people's loss of language due to television and their movement away from traditional rituals and medicines. As oil revenue increased, people gave up farming. While domestic disputes, suicides and traffic deaths increased dramatically Chief Smallboy could only find one solution and that was to take his followers away from this harmful environment and to embrace a more natural way of life. Based upon the principles of his Forefathers, he made a decision to abandon the Ermineskin Reserve for the future of his children and grandchildren and for a good, peaceful life for them in a place far from the evil influences of the modern world. In the summer of 1968, Chief Small Boy, together with Simon Omeasoo, Lazarus Roan, Alex Shortneck, and some 140 people left the Ermineskin Reserve. They established a camp in the wilderness of the Kootenay Plains near the Rocky Mountains. They pitched a large council teepee, twenty tents and a portable classroom. They had no intention of reverting to the role of nomadic plains men. But sought isolation, while at the same time providing an acceptable level of education for their children. Chief Smallboy was adamant in maintaining the integrity of his camp and successfully avoided government efforts to close it down. The camp was inspiration to other Indigenous people in Canada and the United States and became a centre for learning about Cree Spiritual life. While there were disagreements and break aways, Chief Smallboy was the undisputed chief. Smallboy camp was constituted under the Pearson administration and led directly to Smallboy and his followers abandoning their reserve at Hobbema and moving to the Kootenay Plains. ‚ÄòThe treaty process had been a fraud,‚Äô Chief Smallboy declared, this land has not been ceded to queen Victoria, the collected chiefs, who signed Treaty Six, in 1876 and Treaty Seven in 1877, had no idea what they were giving up land in the treaty 6 & 7\\\\. The undeveloped crown lands east of the Rocky mountains, where he then residing had not been included in Treaty six or Treaty seven. The Federal Government sees the camp as occupying crown land. David Thompson had recognized that the Kootenay Plains were Sacred Indian Land. Despite the inclusion of that strip of land, as the anomalous panhandle of treaty eight, it remained sacred Indian land. It would be occupied by Smallboy‚Äòs Band and any Indian who chose to follow. It was in 1968 that Chief Smallboy pitched his tent along with another dozen tents and tee pees on the Kootenay Plains North of Abraham Lake. In 1970s the Smallboy Camp split into two, one ‚Äì third of the membership following Joseph Mackinaw to the Buck Lake Region, which is in the boundaries of Treaty 6. The 1970s death of Simon Omeasoo and Lazarus Roan made a number of their relatives return to Hobbema. The remaining members of Smallboy band retained their status in the Ermineskin Band. They were not deprived of their share of the oil royalties that occurred in 1970‚Äôs & 1980's and gave each member of Ermineskin Band, man, woman, & child five hundred dollars a month. Smallboy had initially taken his band to the foothills to help alleviate poverty, however the Ermineskin band soon became the richest band in the land.  Legacy and Artistic Tributes  In 1996, Tony Isaacs of the Taos, New Mexico based label Indian House Records traveled to the remote location of the Smallboy Camp to make sound recordings. Visual artist Joane Cardinal-Schubert created several artworks related to Smallboy and the tragedy of his death. Cardinal-Schubert also wrote a poem about Smallboy's death.  Kisiko Awasis Kiskinhamawin in Mountain Cree Camp  The Mountain Cree Camp School was established on the Smallboy Camp in 1967. The school was not recognized by the province of Alberta or the Federal Government until 2009. Starting in 2005, Alberta Education started negotiations to establish a program with the school. In 2009, a formal agreement was struck by Alberta Education for the Edmonton Catholic School Board to provide educational support to the school.  Death  On a visit to Banff in the winter of 1984 Chief Smallboy was refused from several hotels and had to stay the night outdoors. He suffered frostbite in his feet, which eventually led to gangrene and ultimately caused Smallboy‚Äôs death months later on July 8, 1984 at Smallboy Camp near Nordegg, Alta.

The fleet when formed was made up of five river gunboats, the Lisui, Liji, Jiangqing, Jiangping, and the Jiangtong. The Japanese later reinforced it with four more gunboats, the Shuntian, Yangmin, Dingbian, Qinren, Datong, Limin, Xichun, Yangchun, Xingya, and the Xingren, along with eighteen patrol boats, several supply vessels and three marine battalions, and supplied 2000 men in 1940. Almost all of the officers and some of the ratings came from the Imperial Japanese Navy. History =Political history= In February 1939, the Japanese navy ceased to have political influence over Manchukuo, and many of its naval instructors were forced to withdraw. After this, the River Defence Fleet was renamed the Jiang Shangjun (River Army). Its new commander from Manchukuo, Yin Zuoqian, was promoted to lieutenant general, he was succeeded by Li Wenlong (March 1941 ‚Äì September 1942), Xian Yuan (September 1942 ‚Äì March 1944) and Cao Bingsen (March 1944 ‚Äì August 1945). =Operation history= The River Defence Fleet was made out of the remainder of the Chinese Songha River Fleet on 15 of February, 1932, after it surrendered to Japan. It originally held five gunboats, the Lisui, Liji, Jiangqing, Jiangping, and the Jiangtong. But the Japanese later chose to reinforce it with the Shuntian, Yangmin, Dingbian, Qinren, Datong, Limin, Xichun, Yangchun, Xingya, and the Xingren. The Imperial Japanese Navy also choose to supply their own officers, and ratings. The River Defence Fleet was primarily used to ensure Japanese control of the river, and to support the army against the Chinese rebels, along with defending the border with the USSR in the Songha, Heilongjiang (Amur) and Wusuli (Ussuri) rivers. The fleet was involved in several border skirmishes, such as the dispute of the Ganchazi (in Japanese) or Bolshoi (in Russian) island, over the period of 19‚Äì30 June 1937, in which they managed to sink a Soviet gunboat. They also served in the skirmish of Donganzhen on 27 May 1939, where they lost one patrol boat and had another one captured from them by the Soviets. They were also involved in the skirmish of Xingkai Lake, in May 1942, in which two Soviet airplanes strafed two Manchukuo patrol boats. In 1942 many of the remaining Japanese sailors left the River Defence Fleet and rejoined the Imperial Japanese Navy, severely limiting the Defence Fleet's operation efficiency. On 9 August 1945, Manchukuo was invaded by the Soviets. The crew of four gunboats and three patrol boats mutinied and surrendered to the Soviets or the Chinese. What was left of the fleet was captured by the Soviets after they seized Harbin on 20 August 1945.

The Senate then passed the measure in a conference report on December 8 by a tally of 92‚Äì7. On , President Obama signed the 2017 National Defense Authorization Act into law. History Video of U.S. Senators Republican Rob Portman and Democrat Chris Murphy speaking about the bipartisan bill The bipartisan bill was written in March 2016 by U.S. Senators Republican Rob Portman and Democrat Chris Murphy. It was introduced by Senator Portman under its initial name Countering Information Warfare Act, on as S.2692. It was introduced as the Countering Foreign Propaganda and Disinformation Act in the United States House of Representatives on as H.R.5181, co-sponsored by Republican Congressman Adam Kinzinger along with Democratic Congressman Ted Lieu. The bill was introduced as the Countering Foreign Propaganda and Disinformation Act in the United States Senate on sponsored by Senator Rob Portman as S.3274. The Washington Post and the International Business Times reported that after the 2016 United States presidential election, worries grew that propaganda spread and organized by the Russian government swayed the outcome of the election, and representatives in the United States Congress took action to safeguard the National security of the United States by advancing legislation to monitor incoming propaganda from external threats. On November 30, 2016, legislators approved a measure within the National Defense Authorization Act to ask the U.S. State Department to take action against foreign propaganda through an interagency panel. The legislation authorized funding of $160 million over a two-year-period. Portman urged more U.S. government action to counter disinformation and propaganda. Murphy said that after the election it was apparent the U.S. needed additional tactics to fight Russian disinformation. Senator Ron Wyden, a member of the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence, told The Washington Post: \\"There is definitely bipartisan concern about the Russian government engaging in covert influence activities of this nature.\\" The bill advanced in the U.S. House of Representatives on , when the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2017 conference report to S. 2943 passed in that chamber, including the Countering Foreign Propaganda and Disinformation Act. In a speech to lawmakers on , Hillary Clinton called attention to the issue, saying pending legislation before the U.S. Congress would \\"boost the government's response to foreign propaganda.\\" She called on trendsetters in society to work together on the problem: \\"It's imperative that leaders in both the private sector and the public sector step up to protect our democracy, and innocent lives.\\" On , the Countering Foreign Propaganda and Disinformation Act passed a vote in the U.S. Senate by a wide margin. It was included together with the National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA) Conference Report for fiscal year 2017, which passed in the U.S. Senate with a final tally of 92 to 7. In the version of the bill incorporated into the 2017 National Defense Authorization Act, the U.S. Congress would ask the United States Secretary of State to collaborate with the United States Secretary of Defense and other relevant Federal agencies to create a \\"Global Engagement Center\\" (GEC) to fight against propaganda from foreign governments, and publicize the nature of ongoing foreign propaganda and disinformation operations against the United States and other countries. The bill said this inter-agency effort should: \\"counter foreign propaganda and disinformation directed against United States national security interests and proactively advance fact-based narratives that support United States allies and interests.\\" Supporters of the resolution inside the Defense Department have publicly expressed their desire to weaken the interpretation of domestic propaganda protections, laws which prevent the United States Department of State from gathering information necessary to develop targeted propaganda messaging and prevent them from explicitly attempting to influence opinions. According to reporting by The New York Times, two thirds of the funding allocated to the Department of State under the bill meant to be transferred by the Pentagon to the State Department was never transferred.

The attack is special because a modest bandwidth of 20Mbit/s can be effective for disrupting a victim's network. The attack consists of sending Destination Unreachable packets to a destination. This works because these packets caused the destination to consume resources at a relatively high rate relative to the traffic.  Discovery  The attack was first discovered by researchers Lenny Hansson and Kenneth Bjerregard J√∏rgensen at the Security Operations Center of the Danish Telecom operator TDC. The researchers goal is to protect customers on that telecom network from DDoS attacks and other cyber threats. The team noted in their release about the attack: > The BlackNurse attack attracted our attention, because in our anti-DDoS > solution we experienced that even though traffic speed and packets per > second were very low, this attack could keep our customers' operations down. > This even applied to customers with large internet uplinks and large > enterprise firewalls in place. We had expected that professional firewall > equipment would be able to handle the attack.  DOS attacks  Denial of service is typically accomplished by flooding the targeted machine or resource with superfluous requests in an attempt to overload systems and prevent some or all legitimate requests from being fulfilled. Commonly, such an attack is done in a distributed manner, where many clients will send requests to a given server. The sum of all the client's traffic is often enough to overwhelm the destination and cause the service to go offline or become unavailable. Attack  In the case of the BlackNurse attack, instead of flooding a remote system's internet traffic with superfluous traffic, the attack takes advantage of an imbalance between the resources required to send traffic and the resources required to process it. Namely, the BlackNurse attacks uses ICMP with Type 3 Code 3 packets. This is a packet that is meant to be sent when a destination's port is unreachable. Unlike previous attacks using the ICMP protocol--Smurf Attack, Ping flood, Ping of death--BlackNurse does not flood the destination with traffic. Instead, the researchers realized that the \\"Destination Port Unreachable\\" packet causes high CPU usage in the firewall that processes it. Using a relatively small bandwidth of 15-18Mbit/s, an attacker can cause CPU usage to spike in a target firewall, causing that firewall to become unable to process more requests.  Determining vulnerability  To test if your device is vulnerable, you can send the ICMP packet to your network using the following commands. It is recommended to run these commands from the WAN side of your firewall. * hping3 -1 -C 3 -K 3 -i u20 * hping3 -1 -C 3 -K 3 --flood While running the test, attempt to use the network normally while watching the CPU usage of the firewall.  Reasons for efficacy  Because of the history of ICMP attacks (like Smurf Attack, Ping flood, Ping of death), many ICMP packets are commonly blocked on firewalls. However some ICMP packets are necessary to allow the network to work properly. Destination port unreachable is one of those packets that is required. Typically however, an attack will only be effective if the incoming traffic is greater than the bandwidth of the victim machine. In the case of BlackNurse however, the attack takes advantage of the processing logic in many firewalls for handling this traffic. This attack is important because it leverages a necessary component of internet traffic and because it doesn't require the use of a botnet to execute attacks.  Impact  Due to the low cost for the attack, because low bandwidth connections are common, this attack can be used very effectively. The original researchers at SOC TDC have noted that the attack is currently being used against clients on their own network.  Origins of the name  The attack was named BlackNurse as a joke because two of its principal researchers were a former blacksmith and a former nurse. The media picked up on this name before it could be changed.

The National Association Opposed to Women Suffrage (NAOWS) was founded in the United States by women opposed to the suffrage movement in 1911. It was the most popular anti-suffrage organization in northeastern cities. NAOWS had influential local chapters in many states, including Texas and Virginia.  History  The National Association Opposed to Women Suffrage (NAOWS) was established by Josephine Jewell Dodge in New York City in 1911. Dodge had the first meeting at her house and women came from New York and surrounding states. Dodge was currently the president of the New York State Association Opposed to Woman Suffrage (NYSAOWS). Dodge resigned from NYSAOWS to take over as president of NAOWS. Shortly after formation, state branches of NAOWS began to form. Headquarters in Washington, D.C. were opened in 1913, giving the organization a front in both New York and the U.S. Capital. Like other anti- suffrage organizations, NAOWS published a newsletter as well as other publications, containing their opinions on the current political issues of the time. The newsletter of the association was called Woman's Protest (later renamed Woman Patriot in 1918). Dodge also toured the country, spreading anti- suffrage views to other states. Members of the NAOWS typically belonged to wealthy families who feared suffrage would upset the status quo. In the South, the NAOWS gained support from many plantation owners who believed rights for women would lead to rights for minorities. Josephine Dodge, the founding president, was replaced in 1917, by Alice Hay Wadsworth, wife of U.S. Senator James W. Wadsworth, Jr. from New York. Upon amendment to the New York State Constitution granting women the right to vote, the focus of the NAOWS shifted from the state level to the federal level. The organization also began to see more men join NAOWS than before. The headquarters were moved solely to Washington D.C. and they merged with the Woman Patriot Publishing Company. The organization disbanded in 1920 as a result of the passage of the Nineteenth Amendment. = Texas Association Opposed to Woman Suffrage = In March 1916, the Texas Association Opposed to Woman Suffrage (TAOWS) was created as a chapter of NAOWS in Houston with Pauline Wells as the president. The chapter in Texas also connected the increase in African Americans voting to women's suffrage and they stoked fears of \\"domination by the black race in the South.\\" They also believed that women's suffrage was linked to \\"feminism, sex antagonism, socialism, anarchy and Mormonism.\\" Like their parent organization, TAOWS had local chapters in major Texas cities. TAOWS fought against the Texas Equal Suffrage Association who were pushing for Texas women's right to vote in Texas primary elections in 1918. In April 1919, headquarters were moved to Fort Worth. In 1919, TAOWS successfully campaigned against a state measure for women's vote which was defeated by 25,000 votes in May. However, in June 1919, Texas passed a suffrage amendment, allowing women to vote and the TAOWS stopped fighting against women's suffrage. = Virginia Association Opposed to Woman Suffrage = Virginia Association Opposed to Woman Suffrage broadside, 1917 A group, the Virginia Association Opposed to Woman Suffrage (VAOWS) formed in Richmond in March 1912 and affiliated with NAOWS. Jane Rutherford served as the president of VAOWS. Local branches in different cities formed by 1913 and the organization distributed anti-suffrage literature. In 1915, VAOWS helped raise money for the Belgian Relief Fund during World War I. By May 1917, VAOWS had doubled in size and continued to grow through 1918. Around 8,000 women had signed up with the anti-suffrage cause in Richmond by 1919. Like the Texas Association Opposed to Woman Suffrage, VAOWS also suggested that race riots, the black vote and women's suffrage were connected. In a sponsored editorial published in The Richmond Times-Dispatch on September 2, 1919, VAOWS exclaimed, \\"Race riots will increase if there is more politics between the races and if women are mixed up in politics!\\" One anti-suffragist in Virginia said it would be harder to keep Black women from the polls than Black men saying that Black women were \\"exempt from fear and physical consequences.\\" VAOWS also threatened that if women were given the vote, it would lead to socialism. Linking socialism to women's suffrage brought class issues into the debate on the vote for women. Virginia had already worked to disenfranchise Black voters, poor white voters, and Republicans in 1902. VAOWS worked to make sure that this supremacy over the poor and over differing political ideologies was maintained. VAOWS appealed to state's rights as a means to oppose federal oversight of their voting practices.  Political views  Household hints pamphlet distributed by the National Association Opposed to Woman Suffrage (NAOWS). circa 1910 One of NAOWS' publications included a pamphlet, Some Reasons Why We Oppose Votes for Women, which, as the title suggests, outlines some of the reasons why they are opposed to women suffrage. They believed it was irrelevant to the success of the country, as stated in their pamphlet: \\"Because the great advance of women in the last century‚Äî moral, intellectual and economic‚Äî has been made without the vote; which goes to prove that it is not needed for their further advancement along the same lines.\\" The National Association Opposed to Women Suffrage opposed women's right to vote because they said that the majority of women did not want the right to vote, and because they believed that the men in their lives accurately represented the political will of women around the United States. NAOWS submitted pamphlets like these to the general public as well as directing them to government officials so that political figures would see that women opposed the then-unratified nineteenth amendment. They did this in order to counteract the rhetoric of the suffragettes of the time. According to the NAOWS and the state-based organizations that it inspired, voting would severely and negatively affect the true submissive and domestic state of the feminine. These organizations were championed by women who thought themselves the prime examples of true womanhood‚Äîquiet, dignified, and regal. They looked with disdain at the outward protests of suffragettes. NAOWS wanted to appeal to conservative and traditional members of their community, including other women and religious figures. They positioned themselves as being in opposition of \\"the militant suffragette\\" and militant or \\"hysterical\\" tactics. NAOWS also believed that women's involvement in politics would interfere with their \\"civic duties for which they are peculiarly adapted.\\" NAOWS believed that women were equal to men, but had different duties and \\"functions.\\" = Quotes from Some Reasons Why We Oppose Votes For Women = \\"We believe that political equality will deprive us of special privileges hitherto accorded to us by law.\\" \\"[We oppose suffrage] Because it means simply doubling the vote, and especially the undesirable and corrupt vote of our large cities.\\" \\"[We oppose suffrage] Because our present duties fill up the whole measure of our time and ability, and are such as none but ourselves can perform.\\"  Notable members  * Josephine Jewell Dodge * Ida Tarbell. * Alice Hay Wadsworth * Kate Douglas Wiggin. * Minnie Bronson References = Citations = = Sources =  Further reading  * Conservative organizations in the United States Anti-suffragist organizations 1911 establishments in New York (state) ","title":"National Association Opposed to Woman Suffrage"},{"id":"52538652","text":"The Chapel of St John the Evangelist is a small Roman Catholic church located in the now uninhibited area known as ƒ¶al Millieri which today forms part of the village of ≈ªurrieq in Malta. ƒ¶al Millieri Interior of the Chapel The village of ƒ¶al Millieri is believed to have been a very old habitat dating back to Roman times.

At La Crosse, Berthrong began a liberal arts curriculum with the intention of becoming a physician. During his second year in school World War II began and Berthrong volunteered soon after for the army. It was during his time in the military that Berthrong realized that he wanted to further his education in the social sciences. He would go on to receive his Bachelor's and Master's degrees from the University of Wisconsin in 1947 and 1948 respectively. Berthrong, in an interview with Ronald McCoy in 1990 stated that, ‚ÄúWisconsin had a superior group of scholars, especially in United States history--headed by scholars like Merle Curti, Merrill Jensen, Howard K. Beale--a whole group, and I was stimulated to go on for a Ph.D. So there was no break. I looked upon my undergraduate history as preparation for my Ph.D. because those who taught undergraduate courses were also the principal mentors at Wisconsin. Merle Curti accepted me as one of his students. I became involved in social and intellectual history--in those days they were woven together--and completed my Ph.D. in January 1952.‚Äù Berthrong received his Ph.D. in labor history and constitutional law. Although Berthrong trained in social and intellectual history during his time at the University of Wisconsin, he also received an introduction to Frederick Jackson Turner and Western history under Vernon Carstensen. Due to the significant influence of ‚ÄúTurnerians‚Äù in Berthrong‚Äôs youth, he would be swayed to study Western history for the majority of his remaining career. =Academic career= During 1951-1952, Berthrong served as an instructor at the University of Kansas City, now the University of Missouri, Kansas City. After receiving his doctorate, he accepted a professorship at the University of Oklahoma. He remained employed at the University of Oklahoma between 1952 and 1970 as a professor and eventually served as Chair of the Department of History during his last four years. In 1970, Berthrong accepted a position as Head of the Department of History at Purdue University, a position he occupied until stepping down to resume full- time teaching duties in 1985. =Death= Donald J. Berthrong died on July 30, 2012 in Alexandria, Virginia from pneumonia. He is buried at the Columbarium at Arlington National Cemetery next to his wife, Rhio Berthrong. Writings Donald Berthrong's accomplishments include noteworthy and significant contributions to the history of the American West such as The Southern Cheyennes (1963) and The Cheyenne and Arapaho Ordeal: Reservation and Agency Life in the Indian Territory, 1875-1907 (1976). Berthrong‚Äôs The Southern Cheyennes is a detailed ethnohistory of the Southern Cheyennes between 1840 and 1875. His work serves as a challenge and a supplement to George Bird Grinnell‚Äôs work, The Fighting Cheyennes. The book primarily addresses the history of the Southern Cheyenne and their relations with white, Anglo- Americans, both in trade, treaties, and military policies and actions. Other main topics discussed are the Southern Cheyennes government, their religion, and their general way of life on the Great Plains. Berthrong‚Äôs The Cheyenne and Arapaho Ordeal: Reservation and Agency Life in the Indian Territory, 1875-1907 serves as a sequel to his book, The Southern Cheyennes. Berthrong writes that this particular book ‚Äúconcentrates on the struggle of the Southern Cheyennes to maintain themselves as a people during this period [the reservation period].‚Äù Beginning where Berthrong‚Äôs previous work left off, this book addresses the history of the Southern Cheyenne once they had been removed to reservations, until 1907, the year that Oklahoma officially became a state. Berthrong‚Äôs work shows the impact and significance of the United States‚Äô government‚Äôs attempt to assimilate the Cheyenne.

Kinda Funny creates content on two YouTube channels: The primary Kinda Funny channel features comedy videos such as Kinda Funny: The Animated Series, as well as Kinda Funny's flagship podcast 'The Kinda Funny Podcast' (formerly 'The GameOverGreggy Show'), while Kinda Funny Games is the company's video game arm focusing on Let's Plays and weekly podcast The Kinda Funny Gamescast. Since June 19, 2017, the Kinda Funny Games arm of the company has produced a live, daily, video games news podcast, for YouTube and the streaming website, Twitch, under the name \\"Kinda Funny Games Daily\\". History RTX in 2015alt=left300x300px IGN editors Greg Miller and Colin Moriarty created The GameOverGreggy Show in 2013 as a side project. Video producers Nick Scarpino and Tim Gettys, also from IGN, later joined the team. In fall of 2014, they launched a Patreon for the channel and rebranded it as Kinda Funny. They received $10,000 in funding within the first 24 hours. On January 5, 2015, the Kinda Funny team left IGN to start their own entertainment venture. The new company was funded primarily through viewer support and crowdfunding on Patreon. The channel covers games, film, television, and comics, as was covered at IGN, but often touches on other topics such as politics and snack foods. Their crowdfunding had raised $30,000 in the months leading up to their decision, and $10,000 the day of their announcement. Soon after, raised close to $35,000 a month between two Patreon accounts. Ben Kuchera of Polygon viewed the news as evidence that fan-funded content had reached new levels, and remarked that content-creators served to make more money when fans paid creators directly rather than the creators using advertising to raise money from fans. The team also continued to freelance for IGN after they left. On March 30, 2016, Kinda Funny formed a partnership with Rooster Teeth by joining the LetsPlay Network and now occasionally appear in video content on the LetsPlay channel, as well as selling merchandise through the Rooster Teeth online store and participate in LetsPlay events. New Kinda Funny content featured during one of GameSpot two stage shows at the 2016 Electronic Entertainment Expo. Greg Miller was named \\"Trending Gamer\\" at the 2015 The Game Awards and \\"Most Entertaining Online Personality\\" at the 2016 SXSW Gaming Awards. On March 13, 2017, Colin Moriarty announced his resignation from the company following a difference in creative vision with the rest of the Kinda Funny co-founders. In January 2019, Kinda Funny announced Kinda Funny 4.0. This included the end of The Morning Show and the beginning of many new weekly shows. These include Internet Explorerz, KF/AF, Screencast, Party Mode, and Debatable. The group also retooled their podcast lineup; most notably they retired the long running GameOverGreggy Podcast and replaced it with The Kinda Funny Podcast. The Kinda Funny initiative was kicked off with a month long Patreon fundraiser drive. The month was so successful that Kinda Funny was able to kick off a Kinda Funny World Tour 2019.

Stevenson (August 15, 1835 - October 1, 1898) was an African Methodist Episcopal (AME) Church minister. He was the financier and builder of the Metropolitan African Methodist Episcopal Church in Washington, DC, which was the largest black church in the country at the time of its building. He was a talented fundraiser and built a number of other churches and was pastor of many churches in Maryland, New Jersey, Pennsylvania, New York, and New England. He was an important figure in the church and eventually held the position of presiding Elder of the New York district. Early life Stevenson was born in Baltimore, Maryland, on August 15, 1835, to John and Ann Stevenson. In 1840, the couple and their six children moved to Trinidad where Stevenson's father died within a year. His mother returned to Baltimore, with the six children and a seventh child which had been born to them during the passage. Stevenson was then bound out to work on the farm of J. P. Stamly. Stevenson was not considered well behaved and was sold four times until, at eighteen, he succeeded in purchasing his own times with earnings of extra labor. He moved to Philadelphia and took worth with a barber, and then a porter at the drug store of Henry Kollock. Stevenson showed himself to be talented and store clerks William Kearney and his brother began to teach him. Kollock sent Stevenson to a black physician practicing in the city, Dr. Wilson, so that Stevenson could learn medicine. Wilson sent Stevenson to the Philadelphia University of Eclectic Medicine where he took lessons from Professor Woodward.Tanner, Benj. T. An Apology for African Methodism\\" Baltimore, 1867 p183-186 Ministry In 1858, Stevenson felt he should follow a different path and was licensed to preach by Rev. Joshua Woodlin and became the adopted son of Bishop Jabez Pitt Campbell. He was also influenced by Bishop Willis Nazrey. Stevenson was sent to West Chester, Pennsylvania, and then to Freehold, New Jersey, where he worked as an itinerant preacher and physician. He was ordained a deacon in 1864 and attended the general conference of the A. M. E. church. He was then sent to the Oxford, Pennsylvania circuit. He took classes at Lincoln University in Oxford for three years, studying under Bishop Matthew Simpson. Stevenson was a noted financier of churches, having built six churches by 1867. He wrote a pamphlet about his work and about the financing of church buildings.selections from pamphlet and from Tanner's biography are in Simmons, William J., and Henry McNeal Turner. Men of Mark: Eminent, Progressive and Rising. GM Rewell & Company, 1887. p820-828 In this pamphlet, he describes the circuit preaching he did and the churches he built. The first church he built was in West Chester, Pennsylvania, in 1859. He later moved to a new circuit and built two more in Snow Hill, New Jersey, and Milford, New Jersey, with the support of Ezra Evans, a Quaker. He then moved on to the Delaware Circuit headquartered at Camden, Delaware. There he started a church at Dover, Delaware, with only the foundation laid when he moved to Wilkes Barre, Pennsylvania, where he completed the financing and building of a church there. While that work was ongoing he moved to Bloomsburg, Pennsylvania, where he built another church. In 1874 he moved to Burlington, New Jersey, where in a place called Mount Holly he built a church and a school house and remodeled another church. Three years later he moved to Trenton, New Jersey, where there existed a church called,\\"Old Mount Zion.\\" This church was to be taken down and a new, larger structure built. During this time he also built a church in Yardley, Pennsylvania, across the Delaware River from Trenton. Stevenson was then appointed presiding elder of the eastern district of New Jersey with headquarters at Trenton; a district which included Princeton, Pennington, Rahway, New Brunswick, Elizabeth, Newark, Orange, Paterson, Washington, Morristown, Freehold, and Jersey City. Stevenson worked with churches at those places to relieve debt and build, particularly helping finance a new chapel at Washington. In 1880, he was appointed by Bishop Daniel Payne to Union Bethel Church in Washington DC for the purpose of building a new church, which would become Metropolitan African Methodist Episcopal Church and was dedicated on May 30, 1886. The cornerstone was laid in September, 1881.

While we know for a fact that Commedia dell'Arte Troupes did perform in indoor spaces, there is no real evidence of use for outdoor spaces aside from depictions of various artists.  Indoor stages  The building of new theaters in the Renaissance came from the attempts of rich scholars to rediscover the classical theatre of Greece and Rome. Some theaters were built in the homes of the lesser gentry in Italy while some were built in public spaces such as apothecary shops and local inns. Other public places that were commonly used for performances were \\"stanzas\\" which were multi purpose meeting rooms. The theaters built in these public buildings were used for longer amounts of time and were more available for public performances. All of these indoor spaces had the facilities for scenery and design, mostly perspective scenery. They also had scene changing equipment and special effect machines which Commedia dell'Arte companies did not need but when it was available, would make use of it. Italian theaters developed slowly throughout the renaissance helping with Commedia dell'Arte Troupes, although the developments were mostly thanks to the Opera. By 1637 theaters in Venice had evolved into having a pit, box, gallery, and proscenium arch. Traveling Commedia dell'Arte Troupes used theaters where they found them, sometimes would help create them, and sometimes would have to make do without them. = Examples of indoor stages =  Baldracca  In 1547 the Medici built a public theatre, the Baldracca, as a venue for professional entertainers traveling to the city.

As said earlier, this theatre was built in an attempt to revive classical theatre and the interesting thing about this theatre is that the set was built permanently and specifically for Oedipus, no other set can be built there. The scenic design in Teatro Olimpico is a good example of the kind of designs which were used during this time. Because Oedipus is a tragic play the set is built with classical architecture. Also common at the time, the set is designed in forced perspective.

The design for this set is differs from the Teatro Olimpico as the set is built for comic scenes rather than for tragic scenes, so instead of having classical buildings they have an urban contemporary renaissance exterior. Similarly to the Teatro Olimpico, it is in forced perspective. Similarly to all Commedia sets, the setting is an urban street scene. Duke Vespasiano Gonzaga Colonna was the patron of Teatro all'Antica at Sabbioneta and hired a commedia troupe to perform in it. He intended to have this company in residence for two months every year, but unfortunately his plans never succeeded because he died before they could take action.

The stages in these depictions often appear to be elevated by six foot tall scaffolding with audience members standing on three sides of the stage. Simple curtains often are depicted hanging behind the actors sometimes painted with an urban background, similar to a backdrop. Sometimes actors were depicted peeking through behind them, and sometimes there would be slits in the curtain indicating doors and windows.

If members of a successful Commedia dell'Arte company were seen in a market square it could have been because they were trying to raise extra funds to pay for a trip to perform in another city or because they were showing a preview to a ticket performance in a private venue to try to convince audience members to go see it.

It was one of the richest and most influential religious institutions in the medieval County of Flanders. It later relocated to the city of Bruges. History A religious community was founded in the dunes near Koksijde by the hermit Ligerius in 1107. In 1120 the community took the Rule of St Benedict as its rule of life, and in 1139 it became affiliated to the Cistercian Order. Partly through donations and partly through land reclamation work in the dunes and polders, the monastery developed extensive landholdings on which the lay brothers reared sheep, producing wool for the cloth trade. A dependent house was established at Eastchurch, in Kent, to export wool from England, but was later sold to Boxley Abbey.M.-A.

The daughter house Ter Doest Abbey was founded in 1175 and also became rich and influential. New buildings were begun in 1214 and completed in 1237, to house a community of approximately 400 monks and lay brothers. The new church was consecrated by the bishops of Th√©rouanne and Tournai on 13 October 1262. The church was vandalised by iconoclasts in 1566, and the monastery was sacked by rebel forces in 1578. The community was scattered but regrouped in 1583. After decades in temporary accommodation the community was established in Bruges in 1627, in a house that had been the refugium of Ter Doest, which had been re- amalgamated to Ten Duinen in 1624.

Location Tuwana occupied roughly the same area as the later region of Tyanitis. The name derives from the earlier city of in the \\"Lower Land\\" of the Hittite empire in the 2nd millennium BC, which was subsequently known as Tyana in the Hellenistic and Roman periods and is now the town of Kemerhisar in Niƒüde Province, Turkey. This town was presumably the capital of Tuwana. In the south, the kingdom extended to the Cilician Gates and the kingdom of Quw√™. In the north lay the region of Tabal, which is sometimes considered part of Tuwana. History In the second half of the 8th century BC, Warpalawas II, son of Muwaharani I was king in Tuwana. At this time, Tabal and Tuwana were tributaries of the Assyrian Empire of Tiglath-Pileser III. Simultaneously, strong influence from the kingdom of Mushki, ruled by King Mita (who is often identified with Midas of Phrygia, known from Greek sources) is evident. The Phyrgian evidence is seen in two Old Phrygian inscriptions, which were found in Kemrhisar, and by bronze objects of clear Phrygian origin in a tumulus at Kaynarca, seven kilometres northeast of Tyana. In a letter of 715 BC, Sargon II describes how King Mita of Mushki had sent emissaries to the Assyrian governor in Quw√™, A≈°ur-≈†arru-Usur, asking for an exchange of ambassadors. The accompanying ambassadors of Warpalawas II (Akkadian: Urballa) are there described as messengers of one of Mita's vassals. A report of A≈°ur- ≈†arru-Usur to Sargon II indicates that Warpalawas conquered Bit Buruta≈° (part of Tabal) in 713 BC after King Ambaris of Tabal had been deposed and deported to Assyria. ƒ∞vriz relief a stele of Tar·∏´unz with a Luwian-Phoenician bilingual text, which was found in 1986, shows that the North-Syrian Aramaic cultural area had a strong influence on the area as well. The Niƒüde Stele, which was erected by Warapalawas‚Äô son, Muwaharani II, is clearly modelled on Assyrian steles. In the subsequent period, when both the Phrygian kingdom and the kingdom of Urartu to the east fell to the Cimmerians, there are no further traces of Tuwana. = RulersTrevor Bryce: The World of the Neo-Hittite Kingdoms; A Political and Military History.

Early life and career  Born in Dronero, Cuneo province, in 1886, Lombardi entered the Italian Naval Academy of Livorno in 1905 and graduated three years later with the rank of ensign.Dizionario Biografico Uomini della Marina. With the rank of sub-lieutenant, he took part in the Italo-Turkish war, distinguishing himself in Tripoli, where he fought in a landing company of the battleship Sicilia, receiving a Silver Medal of Military Valor. During World War I Lombardi, with the rank of lieutenant, was executive officer of the destroyer Francesco Stocco; during the war he received a War Cross for Military Valor. In 1923, after becoming lieutenant commander, he participated in the landing at Corfu during the crisis between Italy and Greece. Later, having been promoted to commander, he was commanding officer of the destroyer Luca Tarigo and then, from 1932 to 1935, he served as naval attach√© in Spain and Portugal. After promotion to Captain, Lombardi became commander of the scout cruiser Quarto and of the Naval High Command Far East. He then commanded the cruiser Bari in Red Sea and later, between 1935 and 1937, the heavy cruiser Bolzano and the light cruiser Emanuele Filiberto Duca d'Aosta. In 1938 he was promoted to rear admiral and appointed commander of the La Spezia Naval Base; he then became commander of the naval forces in Dodecanese, with headquarters in Rhodes.  World War II  Having been repatriated in 1940, Lombardi was promoted to vice admiral when Italy had already entered World War II. For about a year he headed the intelligence service of Regia Marina (Servizio Informazioni Segrete, SIS); he was then placed in command of the 8th Naval Division, participating in several combat missions in the Mediterranean. In November 1941, his flagship, the light cruiser Luigi di Savoia Duca degli Abruzzi, was torpedoed and badly damaged by British torpedo bombers during an escort mission to Libya.Aldo Cocchia, La difesa del traffico con l'Africa Settentrionale dall'1.10.1941 al 30.9.1942, pp. 88 to 94. In 1942, Lombardi was appointed Superior Naval Commander in Libya, with headquarters in Tobruk. In this role, between 13 and 14 September 1942, he directed the Italian-German resistance to a British assault aimed at temporarily occupying Tobruk, known as Operation Agreement; the forces under his command repulsed all attacks by land and by sea, sealing the complete failure of \\"Agreement\\" and inflicting on the attackers almost 1,400 casualties at a cost of 66 killed and wounded.L'operazione \\"Daffodil\\" nel piano \\"Agreement\\". For this feat, Lombardi was awarded the Knight's Cross of the Military Order of Savoy. In August 1943 he was given command of the Western Greece Naval Command (Marimorea), headquartered in Patras. After 8 September 1943 armistice, while the German forces moved to occupy Patras and the surrounding area, Lombardi ordered the departure of all vessels in the ports under his jurisdiction, allowing nearly all of them to safely reach Italy; then, faced with the choice of collaborating with the Germans and joining the Republic of Salo, he refused any collaboration, along with all his subordinates.Giuseppe Fioravanzo, La Marina italiana dall'8 settembre 1943 alla fine del conflitto, p. 216-218.

Environment The park is mostly covered in dense montane rainforest in various stages of regeneration that started at the end of the 19th century when the land was acquired for the water supply of the city of S√£o Paulo. Most of the forest is in the middle stage of regeneration. There are few significant areas of forest in advanced or mature stages. Of the flora, 678 species have been identified in 338 genera and 120 families. 650 species are angiosperms (Magnoliophyta), one is gymnosperm (Pinophyta) and 27 are pteridophytes (Pteridophyta). There are an estimated 866 species of fauna in the park. There are 388 species of vertebrates of which 97 are mammals, 233 are birds, 28 are amphibians, 20 are reptiles and 10 are fish. 478 species of invertebrates have been recorded including 91 of bees, 303 arachnids, 62 of ants and 22 species of culicidae. The urban areas that surround the park and the roads that cut through it result in waste disposal in the park and other forms of degradation. History Studies as early as 1852 indicated that springs in the mountains to the north of S√£o Paulo could be used to avoid any problems with water supply for the city. By 1870 the city had 20,000 people. The Cantareira Company was founded in 1878 to supply a city expected to have 60,000 inhabitants by the end of the century. The 1892 census showed there were 120,000 inhabitants. The governor of the state cancelled the Cantareira Company's contract, bought its properties in the mountains and expanded the protected area to support construction of a series of dams: Cuca, Olaria, Itagussu, Divisa, Manino, Bispo, Guara√∫, Cassununga and Engordador. By 1899 the population had grown to 240,000 inhabitants, and the protected area had been defined as a \\"forest reserve\\". State law 6.884 of 1962 transformed it into the Cantareira State Park. The state park was created on 29 August 1962, confirmed by decree 41,626 of 30 January 1963. State law 10.228 of 24 September 1968 provided for the creation of the Cantareira Tourist State Park. UNESCO recognized the park on 9 June 1994 as the nucleus of the Biosphere Reserve of the Green Belt of the City of S√£o Paulo. The consultative council was created on 1 April 2003. As of 2009 the park was receiving about 60,000 visitors each year. As of 2016 the Cantareira water system, now operated by Sabesp, was one of the largest in the world, serving about 8.8 million people with 33,000 liters of water per second.

The company has been recognised by the International Network for Contemporary Performing Arts] (IETM) and the French Coalition for Art and Sustainable Development (COAL) for \\"creating cultural responses to climate change, forced migration and globalisation using technology to extend their reach to new audiences\\".  Background  Doppelgangster formed in July 2015 with support from National Theatre Wales, under the joint creative direction of Tobias Manderson-Galvin and Wales based ecological raconteur Dr. Tom Payne. The company's flagship performance Doppelgangster's TITANIC featured in Paris in December 2015 as part of a multi-strand programme of work created in response to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (COP21). Productions = All Productions = = Doppelgangster's TITANIC = Doppegangster's TITANIC is a satirical re-working of James Cameron's 1997 Hollywood blockbuster Titanic. The performance was originally conceived at a National Theatre Wales retreat in mid Wales. A developmental version was premiered at Experimentica15 at the Chapter Arts Centre in Cardiff in November 2015. The performance takes place in or and around a 20-foot shipping container and has since been staged in Wales, Paris and Melbourne. The first performance received a single one star review which described it as 'totally disrespectful to the victims of the disaster'. At a showing in Aberystwyth the performance was controversially cancelled for being 'deemed too dangerous to perform'. In Melbourne Australia the performance received critical acclaim in the Australian media which described it as a 'restless, utterly original indie performance' and 'Filled with cheeky academic dissection, hilarious moments of anti-theatre and astute commentary on climate change and migration, this show is active, present, high energy, funny and politically on point'. = COPpelgangster21 = One of the company's first projects involved a multi-strand programme of work for ArtCOP21, a global festival of cultural activity on climate change that ran parallel to COP21 in Paris in December 2015. This work was created in partnership with the Climate Change Commission for Wales, Mapme.com and festival co-organisers Cape Farewell, who describe the company's project as \\"provocative\\". COPpelgangster21 included Doppelgangster's TITANIC, The Oxygen Travelling Sales Team, The Eleventh Hour, DEAD, and COPout. This work took place shortly after the November 2015 terrorist attacks which led to the imposition of a national state of emergency. Reflecting upon Doppelgangster's project, Australian arts critic Ben Neutze highlights the challenges that the company faced when \\"making art during the Paris Climate Conference, in the midst of a heightened security state, just weeks after the November 13 terrorist attacks in the city\\".  Doppelgangster's TITANIC  This staging of the performance was originally intended to take place in an outdoor location on the banks of the River Seine, but following the November 2015 terrorist attacks and the subsequent imposition of a national state of emergency in France, which prevented outdoor public gatherings, the performance was relocated inside La Generale, a former power substation and one time Nazi boot factory in the 11th Arrondissement. Reflecting upon Doppelgangster's TITANIC with reference to the theme of global warming, American academic and activist Judee Burr explains that 'Titanic poses the central question for us: are we all on a sinking ship, H.M.S. Mother Earth? Right now, we in the United States are in first class, with full access to the lifeboats. Third class is already filling up with water, and we‚Äôre enjoying the orchestra, still left with time to deny that our boat is really in trouble'.  Doppelgangster (DEAD)  Doppelgangster (DEAD) was an online video series which was broadcast daily throughout COP21. It connected events taking place in the city with international audiences on Twitter and Facebook.  The Eleventh Hour  The Eleventh Hour was a chat show performance that took place at Ty'n yr Helyg Barn in mid Wales in November 2015 in the weeks leading up to COP21.  Oxygen Support  The Oxygen Travelling Sales Team was singled out as one of \\"21 Unmissable Environmental Arts Events at COP21\\". Ironically the performance in its intended form never took place, due to the limitations on outdoor gatherings. It was adapted instead in partnership with Art For Change 21, where it became the radical protest performance Oxygen Support. This controversial performance took place in the Grand Palais at the closing of the COP21 Solutions Exposition, which featured exhibits from Engie, Renault Nissan and Coca-Cola. = Baby = Baby was a co-production with MKA: Theatre of New Writing and it premiered at Vault Festival beneath Waterloo Station in January 2016. It tells the true story of a Russian pilot who crash landed on an iceberg and encountered a polar bear. The performance was described by critics as a 'supreme WTF of a show', and 'a seventy-five minute joke no one except the performers are in on' and Manderson-Galvin and Payne were accused of 'purposely confusing the audience, dissecting the conventions of theatre and then beating some life back into it'. Other critics drew greater significance from the work, describing it as 'a show with many layers, with hints to the current migration situation in Syria, and the extremes people are being forced to endure to survive'.

The tunnel consists of a central hall, which is connected by two passageways to Mesniƒçka Street in the west and Stjepan Radiƒá Street in the east, and four passageways extending to the south. It was built during World War II by the Usta≈°e government to serve both as a bomb shelter and a promenade, but following the war it quickly fell into disrepair and disuse. The tunnel saw renewed use only in the 1990s, hosting one of the first raves in Croatia, and functioning as a shelter during the Croatian War of Independence. In 2016, the tunnel was remodeled and opened to the public, serving as a tourist attraction and hosting cultural events. Planned expansions include a museum and a lift.  Description  The tunnel spans from Mesniƒçka Street to Stjepan Radiƒá Street, and measures in width. The central hall measures around in length and in width. The tunnel has six exits ‚Äì the western one in Mesniƒçka Street, the eastern in a yard at Radiƒá Street 19, and four branches extending southwards to back yards in Ilica Street and Tomiƒá Street. One of these exits leads to Tomiƒá Street 5a (Art Park), one to Ilica 8, and the two between them are unfinished as of December 2016, leading to Ilica 28 and 30. The tunnel's floor surface encompasses around . The tunnel is open for public access every day from 9 a.m. to 9 p.m. Two sets of public toilets, remodeled in 2016, are placed near two of the tunnel exits. Parts of the original signage remain, but they were not fully restored in the 2016 remodeling.  History  = Construction = Inside the Griƒç Tunnel In 1943, due to fear of Allied bombing, the prime minister of the Independent State of Croatia (NDH), Nikola Mandiƒá, ordered the creation of a public bomb shelter under the hill of Gornji Grad. The said shelter was to be connected to an east-west corridor spanning the entirety of the hill. A sum of 141.2 million NDH kuna was allocated for planning and construction of the tunnel. The project was assigned to engineers Abramoviƒá, Senjakoviƒá and Vajda. The plan was to construct the tunnel in 90 working days, but the cost rose to 490 million kuna (partly due to high wartime inflation) and the date of opening was delayed into 1944. The project soon came under criticism. In February 1944, the Construction Committee of Zagreb, which was responsible for urban planning, issued a statement saying that the \\"creation of a shelter as a transport link is completely inappropriate,\\" and that \\"too much attention has been devoted to it.\\" Another argument was that in its function as a shelter, the tunnel only had a capacity of 5,000 people. At the time of the statement, the costs amounted to 60,000 kuna per person, which was deemed too expensive by the committee. Nevertheless, the construction continued, albeit parts of the project were scrapped. In May, the mayor of Zagreb, Ivan Werner, rejected the plans for a large central underground hall; instead, only the east-west corridor was built. The tunnel was built mostly using locally-sourced materials, including gravel from Zagreb area and wood from Bosnia. Following the end of World War II, the tunnel was renovated in 1947. Additional work was performed to secure the structure against water damage. In 1949, the tunnel was used as a warehouse by Malina, a food production company. A document dating to 31 October 1949 proposed the construction of another corridor connecting the existing one to the area of Gupƒçeva Zvijezda, about to the north. There is no evidence that this corridor was ever constructed. However, the NDH plan's central hall, measuring almost in length, was built sometime after. Emil Mate≈°iƒá, the director of the Cultural Informative Centre of Zagreb (), believed that its construction was driven by the Cold War tensions and carried out in secret with some documents concerning the tunnel not having been released by the Croatian Ministry of Defence as of July 2016. = Fall into obscurity = Map of Griƒç Tunnel and surrounding area From the mid-20th century, the tunnel fell into disuse. It became popular with homeless people and drug users. A police report from around 1950 stated that squatters used the edifice for warmth and shelter from elements, as well as a hideout and a meeting place. The Yugoslav Government's lack of transparency regarding the tunnel led to the rise of a number of urban legends, including the purported existence of walled-off corridors leading towards the Croatian Parliament palace on St. Mark's Square (in the centre of Gornji Grad), and towards Zagreb Observatory (the northernmost point of the neighbourhood) and on to Gupƒçeva Zvijezda. Griƒç Tunnel was not mentioned again in media until 1993, when it served as the site of the Under City Rave, one of the first raves in Croatia, which was organized by the staff of the TV show Top DJ Mag, and featured DJs from as far as Germany and the UK. At the time, the tunnel was under ownership of the Museum of Contemporary Art. The event was attended by over 3,000 people, far more than the organisers planned for and the tunnel infrastructure allowed for. In 1994, it was part of an exhibition celebrating Earth Day. During the Croatian War of Independence (1991‚Äì95), the tunnel saw some use in its intended capacity as an air raid shelter. During this time, temporary toilets were built at the Radiƒá Street exit. = Renovation = View from the central hall In the early 21st century, there were several proposals to remodel the tunnel. Proposals included a \\"museum of senses\\", and a lift to allow people to reach Gornji Grad from the Tu≈°kanac parking garage without climbing the steep hill on foot. Both proposals were shelved. A renovation plan was finally announced in April 2015. The work began on 18 April 2016. It was to be done in three phases: the first phase was the renovation of the tunnel, the second phase the addition of a lift to Gornji Grad surface, and the third phase adding cultural facilities to attract tourists. A sum of 1,350,000 kuna () was allocated for the first phase. The renovation phase was completed on 6 July and the Griƒç Tunnel was officially opened to the public. Only the Mesniƒçka Street entrance, Art Park exit and Tomiƒá Street exit were opened at the time; Radiƒá Street and Ilica 28 and 30 entrances remained closed. The execution of the renovation was criticised for not following safety precautions; the tunnel was said to be damp and to lack smoke detectors, fire doors, sprinklers, or a mechanical ventilation system, and the fire escape route was problematic because two exits were narrowed to allow space for toilets.  Cultural content  The Museum of Senses () is a planned museum in the Griƒç Tunnel. The project will use display screens, video projectors and holograms to exhibit the history of Zagreb, while the central hall would be used for temporary exhibitions, concerts and other events. Additionally, two glass lifts are planned to connect the central hall with the Vranyczany Meadow overhead. Both ideas were considered by the city government as of 2005, but were eventually shelved for more than a decade. The 2016 opening of the tunnel was followed by several performances, including fashion shows and an Advent celebration.

Racial segregation of churches in the United States is a pattern of Christian churches having segregated congregations based on race. As of 2001, as many as 87% of Christian churches in the United States were completely made up of only White or African-American parishioners. Racially segregated churches have existed within the United States since before it became a country, and it lasted well through the post-slavery era into the modern age. There are many reasons for the history and continued prevalence of racial segregation in U.S. churches, including racism, denominational differences, and isolation.Emerson, Michael O., and Christian Smith. Divided by faith: Evangelical religion and the problem of race in America. Oxford University Press, USA, 2000. This segregation also affects individuals and the larger society, including increased racism and segregation outside of the church. However, segregated black churches have also been a positive place for community organizing for civil rights and other issues, as well as offering a respite for black individuals from the racism which they face in integrated society.  History  Union Bethel African Methodist Episcopal Church (2012) - Cascade County, Montana = Pre-Civil War = Before the American Civil War, churches in both the Northern and Southern United States were segregated, both socially and legally. The first black church was founded in 1773 in South Carolina. In the 19th century, both the African Methodist Episcopal Church and the African Methodist Episcopal Zion Church were founded by African Americans, and they also had African American leaders as well as control of their own property.  Northern states  By the 1830s, many Northern White Christians had become abolitionists. Many of them felt that slavery went against many of the ideals that they had fought for in the American Revolutionary War. However, while many Northern Christians began to speak out against slavery, they did not speak out against racism and many of them held fears of \\"miscegenation\\" and felt that interracial relationships were unchristian. Due to this fear, church leaders frequently called for the establishment of segregated congregations and they resisted instilling black people into the church leadership or elders. In addition to the segregation of black people, the spread of Christianity in the Northern States also affected Native Americans in seventeenth-century New England, referred to as Praying Indians. Puritans viewed Praying Indians as inferior and forced them to abandon their culture in favor of the former's concept of civilization. Ministers like John Eliot defended this technique by stating that Native Americans should adopt the mannerisms and customs of English people before earning the privilege of becoming Christian. According to historian Neal Salisbury, John Eliot prompted Native Americans' rapid conversion to Christianity by isolating the Praying Indians into fourteen \\"praying towns\\" from the mid-to-late seventeenth century, hence the name. One of Eliot's most successful towns was Natick, Massachusetts, where the missionary considered the Native Americans' rapid conversion to be a transformational change in favor of civilization. These towns were so effective that by 1675, almost one- fourth of the Native Americans had converted to Christianity, though contrary to popular belief, some opted to do so at their own will.  Southern states  In the 18th century, many White Protestants did not believe that African Americans were fully human and as a result, they did not believe that African Americans had souls. When this view changed, White Christians began to try to convert slaves to Christianity, although slave owners resisted their conversion because they were afraid of slave revolts. In trying to convert slaves to Christianity, Christian leaders encouraged slavery as well as any means of punishment that was used against slaves who revolted. Some Christian leaders even claimed that slavery was a good thing in that it allowed, or oftentimes forced, slaves to become Christians. In the South, church leaders and Christians began to defend slavery by using the Bible and church doctrine. This involved making use of biblical, charitable, evangelistic, social, and political rationalizations, such as the fact that Biblical figures owned slaves and the argument that slavery allowed African Americans to become Christians. Another prominent reason which was used to justify slavery was the belief that Christians should focus on evangelism, stay out of politics, and follow the law. By 1860, one year before the start of the American Civil War, 11% of African Americans were members of Christian churches. = Reconstruction = After the American Civil War and the emancipation of slaves in the United States, many Northern African American religious groups created missionary church plants in the South, to connect newly freed African Americans with the African-American denominations of the North. By 1870, attendance at the African Methodist Episcopal Church and the Christian Methodist Episcopal Church had grown significantly. In urban areas after the 1870s, there was a large push towards multi-denominational evangelism with both White and African American congregations. However, while White evangelicals focused on textual interpretation and history, African American groups focused on social injustices and racism. It was especially during this time that African Americans began forming their own churches, in part because of the unequal treatment they were facing in integrated churches in both the North and the South. Christian theology was often used to justify this split, with the implication that it was God's plan to have people separated by race. = Jim Crow era = A survey was conducted of African American churchgoers in 1948 found that 94% of African Americans were part of predominantly African American congregations. Of the other 6% who were part of integrated denominations, 99% went to segregated churches. During this time African American churches did not focus on critiquing or challenging segregation and racism, but rather focused on the promise of a better life after death. = Civil Rights era = During the Civil Rights Movement, African American churchgoers used their presence in church to unite people on civil rights issues. This was significantly more successful in the South than in the North, as Southern problems of legal segregation were easier to identify and fix in comparison to problems in the North such as emerging ghettos. An image of Martin Luther King Jr., a Baptist pastor during the Civil Rights Era. While at the beginning of the Civil Rights Era there was some push from White Christians to integrate churches, after there was \\"a white backlash against black progress,\\" the push ended as White Americans were less inclined to push for social segregation. However, many historians have noted that religion was an important motivator for people to be in favor of civil rights, because they believed that racism was sinful or unchristian.Dailey, Jane. \\"Sex, segregation, and the sacred after Brown.\\" The Journal of American History 91, no. 1 (2004): 119-144. Sermons influenced the views of congregation members on segregation, which, during this time period, shifted largely from supporting segregation to opposing it. This may have varied widely by region, as Southern pastors were much more racist than their Northern counterparts.Dougherty, Kevin D. \\"How monochromatic is church membership? Racial-ethnic diversity in religious community.\\" Sociology of religion 64, no. 1 (2003): 65-85. Additionally, many evangelical Christians believed that integration and equality may be impossible, as they believed that the world was descending into chaos as a precursor to \\"the second coming,\\" when Jesus would return to the Earth as described in the Book of Revelation. During this era, primarily black churches were an important place for social organizing. African-American church members and leaders played a large role in the Civil Rights Movement, which also gave the movement distinct religious undertones. Appealing to the public using religious reasoning and doctrine was incredibly common.  Variations among denominations  = Nontraditional denominations =  Black Hebrew Israelites   Mormonism  = Protestantism =  Pentecostalism  George. H. Clements giving Holy Communion, Chicago, 1973.In the United States Pentecostalism grew out of the Holiness movement. Pentecostalism and Holiness were especially attractive to African Americans from the South because the focus on personal religious experiences rather than the focus on reading texts or believing religious doctrines was more similar to the way in which Christianity was practiced during the era of slavery. Pentecostalism is marked by a charismatic approach to Christianity, and while modern Pentecostalism has become more segregated, it has a history of being very integrated even while segregation remained the norm in certain other denominations. The early 20th century Evangelist Maria Woodworth Etter warned Southern Congregations that she would not preach in segregated services when she visited them.Signs And Wonders 1916 by Maria Woodworth Etter and Lee A Howard Another important charismatic figure was Charles Finney, who ran popular church revivals and preached abolitionist views as he toured the South. Pentecostalism also underwent a resurgence within the United States in the 1970s, and it was very integrated at this time. Some partly attribute the diversity which existed within the charismatic movement to the Civil Rights Movement of the prior decade.  Baptists  Baptists came to the Southern United States to preach the gospel to White people and African Americans during the Revolutionary War. The Baptist message was largely focused on individual experience and salvation. At the beginning of the Baptist movement, many congregations were integrated. Despite this, African American members of the church often sat in separate areas and had little say in church affairs. African Americans could be leaders in the church, but in separate quarters consisting only of their own race. After the Civil War, African Americans started their own churches, an idea that was supported by both white and black southerners. Additionally, though Northern Baptists morally objected to slavery more than Southern Baptists, who regarded slavery as a fact of life, both were worried about the divide that these opposite views on slavery could cause. Today, Baptists make up the largest African American denominational group in the United States.  Methodism  In the antebellum North, many Methodists were very supportive of converting African Americans. The prominent English Methodist leader John Wesley was invested in the abolition of slavery, and he visited Georgia to proselytize to slaves who appreciated his \\"plain doctrine and good discipline.\\" At the same time, however, Methodist religious leaders in Philadelphia's St. George church forced African Americans out of their congregation. In the antebellum South, Methodism was largely connected to slave owning. All of the bishops within the Methodist Episcopal Church were slave owners from 1846 until slavery was abolished, and many members of the church were slave owners as well. Methodists comprised two of the largest postbellum Southern churches the African Methodist Episcopal church and the African Methodist Episcopal Zion church. African American Methodists from the North saw it as their duty both to evangelize to and educate African Americans in the South.William E. Mathews, Jr., \\"An Address Delivered in Baltimore on the Occasion of Our Semi-Centenary,\\" 1866, in Rev. Benjamin T. Tanner, An Apology for African Methodism, 1867 nationalhumanitiescenter.org/pds/maai2/institutions/text6/mathews.pdf  Non-denominational  Thousands of non-denominational, Protestant congregations have emerged in recent decades. Many of these in large metropolitan areas have highly integrated, multi-racial congregations and staff, regardless of their location in the North or the South. Some of the largest churches in the country, whose services are regularly broadcast on national television networks, belong to this category. = Catholicism = Catholicism has generally been less segregated than other denominations. In his journal article \\"Racial Segregation in American Churches and Its Implications for School Vouchers\\", Robert K. Vischer says the Catholic Church did not have an obvious racial split, as did other denominations. In 1940 only 63.7% of African Americans went to segregated Catholic churches, as compared to 94% of Protestants. Vischer says that the smaller rates of segregation may be due in part to the fact that Catholic churches are more religiously focused in comparison to Protestant churches, which are more socially focused. Theologically, Catholic churches also emphasize unity among races. In 1984 American bishops disseminated a letter calling for even further inclusion of racial and ethnic minorities into Catholic churches. According to the Pew Research Center, , about 59% of Catholics are white. The majority of other major Christian denominations have a much higher percentage of white members. The Catholic Church continues to face criticism due to biases against black converts. In his article \\"Black Catholic Conversion and the Burden of Black Religion\\", Matthew Cressler says that scholars have often questioned why African-Americans convert to Catholicism. Two primary causes have been identified. Black priest Lawrence Lucas states the first, saying that Catholicism is a white religion and attracts African-Americans due to their ‚Äúsubconscious desire to be white.‚Äù The second reason, offered by sociologists, is that Catholicism provides socioeconomic mobility for black Americans. However, black converts themselves say they converted because of a variety of reasons, many unrelated to those listed above. , the number of black Catholics has been growing. According to Cressler, between 1940 and 1975, the number of African-American Catholics has increased by 208%. Additionally, according to Shannen Dee Williams, 300 million Catholics are black. This statistic, updated , indicates that approximately a quarter of Catholics are black.  Effects and implications  = Segregation = One effect of segregation in churches may be continued segregation in other parts of U.S. society. As religious segregation furthers in-group homogeneity, it makes the racial divisions throughout all of society even more pronounced. Another example of religious segregation causing greater society wide segregation can be seen in private schools. When parents choose to send their children to private schools, they are often religious institutions, and because religious institutions are often racially segregated, this means that students are in turn in racially segregated classrooms. There is some concern that an increase in the use of school vouchers in the United States will also then increase the number of students in segregated schools, as school vouchers are generally used to send children to private religious institutions.Vischer, Robert K. \\"Racial Segregation in American Churches and Its Implications for School Vouchers.\\" Fla. L. Rev. 53 (2001): 193. = Racism = A 1999 study showed that among churchgoers, those who go to segregated or primarily white churches are more likely to exhibit racist behaviors or to have prejudiced ideas about African Americans.Yancey, George. \\"An examination of the effects of residential and church integration on racial attitudes of whites.\\" Sociological Perspectives 42, no. 2 (1999): 279-304. Those who attend integrated churches are about equal in racial attitudes to those who do not attend church at all, but those who attend racially segregated churches are more likely to be both covertly and overtly racist than either group. It is difficult to posit whether this intolerance is caused by attending a segregated church, or if those who hold prejudiced views are more likely to seek out a segregated church. In a study of White Protestant Christians from the 1990s, it was found that those who had more contact with African Americans, especially a personal or more intimate relationship, were more likely to believe in structural inequality and racial discrimination than their counterparts with few or no African American contacts, who more so blamed African Americans for \\"not working hard enough,\\" as being the cause of racial inequality. = Community organization = Many have noted that primarily black churches were an integral part of the civil rights movement and a popular way to dispense information about boycotts and other activist ideas. Black churches continue to be important for bonding and community building in African American communities, as well as a place where African Americans are safe and free to grieve about the racism they face. Liturgical rituals are important for activist and community organizing in African American communities, whether or not the causes are expressly religious.Pattillo-McCoy, Mary. \\"Church culture as a strategy of action in the black community.\\" American Sociological Review (1998): 767-784. Civil Rights March on Washington, D.C., on August 28, 1963. Women in black churches also organized for rights and representation for women and African Americans. Women's African American church groups fought for women's suffrage, prohibition, and participated in the Civil Rights Movement. Despite all their work both within and outside of the church, African American women are still very rarely church leaders, even in segregated churches.

It was founded in 1971. Founding Having begun in April 1971, Christians for Socialism first gained notoriety when a collection of eighty Chilean priests, known as the \\"Group of 80\\", publicly declared their support of the construction of socialism along the lines being followed by then-President Salvador Allende. The Secretariat of Christians for Socialism was formally established in September 1973. The group was predominantly composed of Roman Catholic members of the Christian left who were inspired and spurred on by the Second Vatican Council. Project CPS was founded to counteract a presumption that Christian institutions were inherently opposed to socialism. While its founders found aspects of socialist programs that they wished to critique, they wanted to do so as insiders within the socialist movement, rather than as adversaries. From their beginnings as supporters of Allende, CPS has been associated with firm support for socialist leaders. Accordingly, CPS leaders cultivated strong ties with Cuban Marxist politician Fidel Castro. It was intended as a movement of active political involvement and participation, and involved discussions bringing together current political events and church documents in light of each other. CPS inspired a series of social programs in the public sector. Priests in CPS led union units and organized peasant federations. Antecedents In Chile the immediate antecedent to CPS was the ' movement. In Italy, many of the young people who had been involved in the Italian student and worker protests of 1968 joined the movement, and the Christian Associations of Italian Workers (ACLI) was very supportive. Leaders L√≥pez Trujillo considers a major leader of CPS. Another prominent leader was the Salesian priest , who was also a significant figure in the Italian Catholic resistance during World War II. In Spain, Alfonso Carlos Com√≠n was a key leader in establishing the movement. The theologian Gustavo Guti√©rrez was also a member and led sessions at all the major conferences. Suppression CPS faced opposition from the start. Left- leaning priests from Brazil and Bolivia were supportive but unable to participate in gatherings due to severe police control. CPS was short-lived in Chile, due to strong resistance from the Episcopal Conference of Chile under the direction of its secretary general, bishop Carlos Oviedo Cavada. In their letter condemning the movement, the bishops there argued that while the church speaks to \\"politics insofar as it underlies every social reality\\", it should not be involved in \\"partisan activity\\". Chilean clergy involved in the movement were banned from political participation altogether in April 1973. The movement was suppressed by the Chilean military government after the coup of 1973. Father , one of the most active members of CPS, left Chile at this time. Gatherings A number of important gatherings have been held under the auspices of Christians for Socialism. In 1972, 400 members met for a week at a textile union hall, urging \\"class struggle [as] the only valid course to necessary social change in Latin America.\\" CPS brought together similar Latin American movements in the Latin American Meeting of Christians for Socialism 1974 in Santiago, Chile. In 1975, the Christians for Socialism conference in Detroit, Michigan, formally introduced liberation theology to the United States. This event was a significant convergence where black, feminist, and third-world anti-imperialist movements joined together and recognized each other as peers in the same process of liberation, while also strongly critiquing one another. A detailed account of the meeting was published. Christians for Socialism groups sprung up in France, Italy, and West Germany. In Germany, CPS was a radical rival to Enlightenment liberalism and \\"German idealism's aspirations to freedom\\". Present day The CPS group has as fundamental milestone the celebration of its annual conferences that are held in Spain, alternately in Madrid and Barcelona. CPS has a presence mainly in Madrid, Catalonia, Menorca and with individuals in different autonomous communities, such as Andalusia, Galicia, Aragon and others. At present, the CPS group remains within a larger movement called \\"Christian Networks\\", as a critical and reflective encounter in relation to the church, society, and politics. In the United States, Christians for Socialism was most active through the 1970s and early 1980s. After the election of Ronald Reagan, the movement lost some of its momentum and disbanded. However, in January 2018, Christians for Socialism: North America restarted its struggle for a Christian left organized around the same ideas from the movement started in Chile in 1972. Korneel Van Gent, a member of a Belgian chapter of Christians for Socialism, created the Facebook group Rebuild Christians for Socialism in February of 2020 to revitalize the aging movement with an organized online presence and to reach younger generations. The group has over 1,000 members as of September 2020. Its mission statement is given as follows: > \\"We commit to taking up the mission of Christians for Socialism, recognizing > the Church as God's incarnate body for the sacred work of feeding, clothing, > housing, and caring for the world. In so doing, we relinquish private > ownership of our goods and cleanse ourselves from the mortal sins of selfish > greed, discrimination, and exclusion. We understand the teachings of Yeshua > the Messiah to be inclusive of all God's children, regardless of their > external differences. We therefore extend our camaraderie to all who share > the socialist vision for a better planet and more humane societies, > welcoming all people in the Divine Spirit of solidarity. We accept the duty > of responsible stewardship not just for one another's wellbeing, but for all > life and all ecosystems on earth. We recognize the urgent need for action in > all spheres of human activity, from international politics and commerce to > the preservation of a peaceful future for the generations to come.\\" While retaining a focus on the ministry and teachings of Jesus as exemplary of socialist ideals, the modern online iteration of the movement is less solely focused on Christianity, and is closely allied with sister factions under the umbrella of the Abrahamic Faiths. These specifically include the groups Jewish Comrades for Socialism and Muslims for Socialism. Critiques L√≥pez Trujillo has critiqued CPS for holding an understanding of liberation too strongly influenced by Marxist political theory rather than the integral Christian liberation stance espoused by the Latin American Episcopal Conference. It has been said that for some members of Christians for Socialism, there is \\"no salvation incarnate outside of class struggle.\\" See also * Christian democracy * Catholic social teaching * Christian socialism * Socialism with a human face References =Notes= =Bibliography= : : : : : : : : : : : : : : : : : : : Further reading : : Encuentro Latinoamericano de Cristianos por el Socialismo, Latin American Working Group (Toronto, Ont.), & Student Christian Movement of Canada.

The system struck the Andaman and Nicobar Islands, as well as South India, before later affecting Somalia. Originating as a low pressure area near the Malay Peninsula on December 3, the storm was designated a depression on December 6. It gradually intensified into a Deep Depression on the following day, skirting off the Andaman and Nicobar Islands, and intensified into a Cyclonic Storm on December 8. Maintaining a generally westward track thereafter, Vardah consolidated into a Severe Cyclonic Storm on December 9, before peaking as a Very Severe Cyclonic Storm, with 3-minute sustained winds of , and a minimum central pressure of , on December 11. Weakening into a Severe Cyclonic Storm, Vardah made landfall close to Chennai on the following day, and degenerated into remnant low on December 13. The name Vardah, suggested by Pakistan, refers to the red rose. Meteorological history Under the influence of a persistent area of convection, a low-pressure area formed over the Malay Peninsula, adjoining north Sumatra, in early December 2016. The low pressure area gradually organized into a tropical disturbance over the next several days, as it slowly moved towards the southeast Bay of Bengal. On December 6, The IMD classified the system as Depression BOB 06, as the system had sufficiently organized itself, with winds of 45 km/h (30 mph). Owing to low wind shear and favorable sea surface temperatures, the storm gradually intensified into a Deep Depression on the following day. Skirting off the Andaman and Nicobar Islands as a Deep Depression, BOB 06 was upgraded to a Cyclonic Storm by the IMD and JTWC, in the early hours of December 8, and was assigned the name Vardah. With conditions favorable for further development, Vardah intensified into a Severe Cyclonic Storm on December 9. Although predicted to maintain its intensity, Vardah strengthened further, as it followed a generally west-northwestwards track, prompting the IMD to upgrade its intensity to Very Severe Cyclonic Storm status, on December 10. Gradually intensifying as it moved westward, Vardah reached its peak intensity on December 11, with maximum 3-minute sustained winds of 130 km/h (80 mph), and a minimum central pressure of . On December 12, Vardah weakened into a Severe Cyclonic Storm, before making landfall over the eastern coast of India, close to Chennai, Tamil Nadu, with winds of . Afterward, it rapidly weakened into a depression, due to land interaction, on 13 December. The depression caused overnight rainfall in Southern Karnataka on December 13. Due to land interaction, Vardah degenerated into a well-marked low on December 13, at around midday, local time. The remnants of Vardah crossed the Indian Subcontinent and entered the Arabian Sea on December 14. Owing to warm sea surface temperatures, the system regenerated into a depression on December 17, with the IMD assigning the storm a new identifier, ARB 02. On the next day, the system entered an area marked by colder sea surface temperatures and high wind shear, causing it to rapidly weaken into a well-marked low-pressure area, just off the coast of Somalia, before moving ashore and dissipating on December 19. Preparations and impact =Thailand= The precursor low of Cyclone Vardah caused severe flooding in Thailand, affecting half a million residents in the country's southern provinces. By the end of the week, more than of rainfall was observed in Nakhon Si Thammarat Province of the country. 21 people were reported to be killed due to the floods, and the damage were about US$25 million. =South India= Andaman and Nicobar Islands Vardah brought heavy rainfall to Andaman and Nicobar Islands as a Deep Depression. Hut Bay recorded of rainfall on December 6, while Port Blair recorded of rainfall on December 7. More than 1,400 tourists were stranded on the Havelock and Neil islands of the archipelago, during the storm. They were evacuated by the Indian Navy on December 9. Tamil Nadu Vardah making landfall over the coast of India More than 16,000 people were evacuated from low-lying areas, as a result of Vardah. The Indian Armed Forces were kept on standby for any relief operations. Two warships, INS Shivalik and INS Kadmatt, sailed out of Visakhapatnam to Chennai, carrying medical teams, divers, inflatable rubber boats, an integral helicopter, and material, including food, tents, clothes, medicines, and blankets to aid with relief efforts. Fifteen teams of the National Disaster Response Force were deployed in various coastal regions. The cyclone killed 24 people in the state, and caused ‚Çπ22,573 crore (US$3.35 billion) in damage. Vardah crossed the eastern coast of India close to Chennai in the afternoon hours of December 12, 2016. Winds were estimated at during landfall. The cyclone claimed over 18 lives, uprooted about 1 lakh trees in Chennai and its suburbs, and caused extensive damage to roads, supplies, and power infrastructure: over 10,000 electric poles were mangled and 800 transformers damaged. Carcasses of around 77 cows were found afloat in a lake in the Kancheepuram District. As many as 224 roads were blocked, and 24 huts were also damaged. More than ten people were reported to have been killed, due to events related to the storm. Public transportation was severely affected by Vardah. Chennai International Airport was closed at least until 11:00 pm IST (5:30 pm UTC) on December 12, in the wake of the storm, leaving about 500 passengers stranded. The Indian Railways suspended operations of all 17 outstation trains originating from Chennai, and suburban railway services were also cancelled.

Van Norden (born 1962) is a translator of Chinese philosophical texts, scholar of Chinese and comparative philosophy, and public intellectual. He has taught for twenty five years at Vassar College, United States, where he is currently James Monroe Taylor Chair in Philosophy. From 2017-2020 he was Kwan Im Thong Hood Cho Temple Professor at Yale-NUS College in Singapore. Biography  Van Norden's ancestors can be traced back to the 17th century in North America. They fought on both the Loyalist and Revolutionary sides in the Revolutionary War and served with both the Union and Confederate armies in the Civil War. Van Norden's father was an officer in the Navy in World War II and was a corporate secretary at Kennametal, an industrial tool company. In high school, Van Norden's interest in China was stimulated by the Kung-fu craze following the success of Bruce Lee's Enter the Dragon in 1973, and the opening of China to the West after the death of Mao Zedong in 1976. He became interested in philosophy while participating in interscholastic debate over the legitimacy of military conscription. At college, he studied both philosophy and Chinese language and culture. Although his interest in Chinese philosophy was discouraged by both philosophers and Sinologists, he decided to pursue Chinese philosophy in graduate school. Among Van Norden's hobbies are poker, and he has played in the World Series of Poker in Las Vegas. Academic career  Van Norden received his BA in philosophy from the University of Pennsylvania in 1981. Most facts in this section are from this source. He attended Stanford University on a Mellon Fellowship and was awarded a PhD in philosophy in 1991. Before he joined the faculty at Vassar, Van Norden was a Visiting Assistant Professor at the University of Vermont, and then at the University of Northern Iowa. Van Norden has been on the faculty at Vassar College since 1995, and has served as Chair of both the Philosophy Department and the Department of Chinese & Japanese. He has also been a Visiting Professor at Wuhan University in the spring of 2014 and the summer of 2016. He has been a member of both the Advisory Committee on Non-Western Philosophy and its Committee on the Status of Asian and Asian-American Philosophers and Philosophies of the American Philosophical Association. He is on the Editorial Board of Notre Dame Philosophical Reviews and the Advisory Board of the Philosophical Gourmet Report. Van Norden has been the winner of a number of competitive fellowships and awards. In 2005, he was a Fulbright scholar at Academia Sinica in Taipei, Taiwan. Van Norden was identified as one of the best 300 college or university professors in the US by the Princeton Review. In 2016, Van Norden was one of the winners of the 2016 American Philosophical Association Public Philosophy Op-Ed Contest for his essay, \\"Confucius on Gay Marriage.\\" Controversy over \\"If Philosophy Won't Diversify\\"  In May 2016, Jay L. Garfield and Bryan W. Van Norden published an opinion piece in The Stone column of The New York Times, entitled \\"If Philosophy Won't Diversify, Let's Call It What It Really Is.\\" In this article, they state: \\"we have urged our colleagues to look beyond the European canon in their own research and teaching.\\" However, \\"progress has been minimal.\\" Consequently, so long as \\"the profession as a whole remains resolutely Eurocentric,\\" Garfield and Van Norden \\"ask those who sincerely believe that it does make sense to organize our discipline entirely around European and American figures and texts to pursue this agenda with honesty and openness. We therefore suggest that any department that regularly offers courses only on Western philosophy should rename itself 'Department of European and American Philosophy.'\\" The article received 797 comments in just 12 hours. (None of the other Stone columns that month had over 500 comments.) In response to the controversy, an article was published the next day on the New York Times Editorial Page Editor's blog, summarizing the variety of opinions, pro and con, on this topic. Patricia McGuire, the President of Trinity Washington University spoke in favor of diversifying philosophy: \\"Let's face facts: there's a Muslim Mayor in London, signifying the fact that even those who revere All Things British need to catch up with the now-settled reality of great diversity in contemporary life. The canon of learning should reflect that, including Philosophy.\\" However, many readers expressed views similar to the following: \\"Please preserve us from your political correctness. ...there's a reason that Europe leaped ahead of the rest of the world. I do not believe that we should sacrifice that merely because of an ooshy gooshy need to pretend that all cultures are equally advanced.\\" Garfield and Van Norden's article was almost immediately translated into Chinese, and over twenty blogs in the English-speaking world have commented or hosted discussions, including Reddit.See notes below for some of the other websites Garfield and Van Norden's piece has continued to provoke strong reactions. Some have applauded their call for greater diversity in the US philosophical canon. In addition, their piece has been featured in several recent essays arguing for greater diversity in philosophy. However, there has also been extensive criticism of the Garfield and Van Norden article. Two conservative editorials criticized the piece for failing to acknowledge the superiority of Western philosophy. Two other articles argued that \\"philosophy\\" is, by definition, the tradition that grows out of Plato and Aristotle, so nothing outside that tradition could count as philosophy. The editor of the DailyNous blog suggested the following typology of other criticisms of the original article: the philosophical equivalent of the \\"All Lives Matter\\" (parts of Anglo-European philosophy are also neglected) criticism, the \\"Don't Be Presumptuous\\" (in projecting a Western conception of philosophy onto other cultures) criticism, the \\"Be More Radical\\" (by questioning the racist, sexist, and imperialist bases of philosophy in the West) criticism, the \\"Red Herring\\" (the canon isn't really the problem with philosophy) criticism, the \\"Up Periscope\\" response, and the \\"Pardon Me, Gentlemen\\" (but you are ignoring how androcentric Western philosophy is) criticism. Professor Amy Olberding of the University of Oklahoma wrote a detailed reply to critics of Garfield and Van Norden, arguing that criticisms fall into a stereotypical pattern that betrays a fundamental misunderstanding of the issues. Controversy Over \\"The Ignorant Do Not Have a Right to an Audience\\" In June 2018, Bryan W. Van Norden published an opinion piece in The Stone column of The New York Times, entitled \\"The Ignorant Do Not Have a Right to An Audience.\\" In the article, Van Norden makes the case against John Stuart Mill's defense of absolute free speech found in his seminal text \\"On Liberty.\\" Mill's argument, as rendered by Van Norden, amounts to the belief that every opinion someone holds can be categorized either completely true, somewhat true, or completely false, and that even the discussion of patently false beliefs is valuable. Mill believed in the ability of people to distinguish true beliefs from false ones through rational and open discourse with one another. Van Norden contends contra Mill, that there is no one universal method of rationality that all human beings may learn through proper education. Van Norden disagrees, arguing that if that were the case, people wouldn't believe a radio host when they deny that the mass shooting of Sandy Hook ever happened. Van Norden goes on to argue that the historical situation of the present differs considerably from that of Mill's. In the age of mass media, which seeks to attract the largest audience possible, networks will gravitate towards more controversial figures like former child actor Kirk Cameron, who was allowed to defend on television that we should not believe in evolutionary theory unless biologists can produce a 'crocoduck' as evidence. Van Norden argues that, in contrast, responsible intellectuals like Noam Chomsky or Martha Nussbaum are not platformed to the extent that those who espouse pseudo-scientific talking points are. Van Norden favourably cites the critique of Mill offered by the Frankfurt School philosopher Herbert Marcuse. However, Van Norden explicitly rejects Marcuse's suggestion that violence may be used to silence ignorant or extremist views. In addition, he rejects outright censorship of such voices on the grounds that Van Norden believes that the exercise of violence is immoral given that it amounts to acts of terrorism, and also impractical, given that the very nature of the Internet is such as to serve as a network of information that can't be blocked. Instead, Van Norden advocates a distinction between free speech and what he terms \\"just access.\\" According to Van Norden, access to the public through institutions is a finite resource and thus its allocation is a question of justice. Justice dictates that access be granted to opinions and people based on merit and benefit to the community. Van Norden argues just access is about institutions being mindful about the access to audiences they grant certain people and their ideologies, and should take into account both the former and the latter. For example, when Jenny Mccarthy's anti-vaccination beliefs get platformed Van Norden argues, what occurs isn't a demonstration of open-mindedness, but rather it suggests that such views are worthwhile to debate and discuss. Van Norden disagrees, declaring that such views are in fact rooted in ignorance and while people like Mccarthy have a right to free speech that should not be violated through the exercise of violence or censorship, that does not equate to a right to an audience afforded to her by institutions such as the media. This point for Van Norden, is what crucially distinguishes free speech from just access. Van Norden's essay received one thousand eighty-four comments on the New York Times website. The American Philosophical Association would award Van Norden's essay their Public Philosophy Op-Ed prize for 2019. The newspaper Florida Today ran an article favorably citing Van Norden's article titled \\"Donald Trump presents a new challenge for fair news coverage\\" written by Ross McCluney. In the article, McCluney claims that being fair and balanced ultimately means not platforming opinions we know to be false. However, Van Norden's piece was also subject to controversy and criticism. Most notably, Van Norden's quotation and criticism of Jordan Peterson's provoked responses from a variety of publications. Peterson himself accused Van Norden on Twitter of misrepresenting what he said. The online publication Campus Reform published an article recounting the incident written by Toni Airaksinen provocatively titled \\"Prof cherry-picks Jordan Peterson quotes for hit piece.\\" The article defended Peterson, claiming that Van Norden misunderstood Peterson's statements about men having no respect for someone they can't physically fight. Airaksinen argues that Peterson was not referring to relationships men have with women, but rather the relationships that men have with other men. Conversely, the progressive \\"The Majority Report with Sam Seder\\" uploaded a segment defending Van Norden's article and airing the video where Peterson made the remarks that Van Norden appropriated for his essay. Also defending Van Norden's opinion piece was Professor of Writing Katja Thieme in an article for Pyriscence titled \\"Jordan Peterson and Citational Practice.\\" In her article Thieme accused Peterson of insufficiently engaging the literature and thinkers associated with postmodernism, Marxism, etc. which he routinely criticizes. Thieme also defended Van Norden's quoting and paraphrasing of Peterson, stating that she verified the quotes herself and the paraphrasing was well within bounds. Beyond the Peterson debacle, criticisms were levied against Van Norden for his critique of John Stuart Mill's conception of free speech. Philosopher Massimo Pigliucci wrote for his blog Footnotes to Plato, a blog post titled \\"Should the ignorant be denied access to audiences?\\" Pigliucci questions how we are to reasonably and adequately determine what views and which proponents of them are to be afforded just access? Since, as Pigliucci points out, Van Norden rejects the notion of universal reason, such questions as the communal benefits of receiving certain opinions and the differing degree of merit among views, make such inquiries fall into a realm of arbitration. Other critics went even further than Pigliucci in their criticism of Van Norden's essay. Liam Warner, writing for the Conservative publication National Review in an article titled \\"If You‚Äôre Going to Oppose Free Speech, Please Do It Properly,\\" wrote that Van Norden's piece is a continuation of the Left's dissociation from the tradition of classical liberalism of which John Stuart Mill is a part. Warner argues that Van Norden makes the distinction that while Mill invoked free speech to argue for unpopular Progressive ideas such as abolition of slavery and women's suffrage, that today free speech is invoked to suppress progressive ideas and to saturate audiences with conservative ones. This, according to Warner, demonstrates that the Left of today is not committed to free speech as a formal principle the way that classical liberals are and the way the Right is today. Winston Smith wrote a blog post on his blog Philosoraptor titled: \\"Bryan W. Van Norden: The Ignorant Do Not Have A Right To An Audience.\\" In his blog post Smith expresses the opinion that Van Norden is anti free speech, and that his essay amounts to an argument for institutions to favor left wing views and to eschew right wing ones. Smith also puts forth an argument similar to the one made by Pigliucci, namely that what the Left defines as racist, sexist, etc. is a matter of arbitration, and that to endow the left with the power to dictate to whom institutions afford access, is to allow the ever growing PC culture to run wild.

Through his will he founded the French Protestant Hospital in Finsbury, London, the first voluntary hospital in England. Biography Gastigny was a Huguenot military refugee who fled to Holland following the Revocation of the Edict of Nantes in 1685. He was appointed Master of the Hounds to stadtholder William, then Prince of Orange. He followed William to England after the Glorious Revolution and fought alongside him in the Battle of the Boyne in 1690. He returned with William to England, although apparently, along with other Dutch courtiers of the new king, he did not wish to stay there. Many of those who followed William from Holland feared they would not be given positions at English court, and would be resented by the English. Constantijn Huygens Jr. recorded in his diary that Gastigny told him on 23 March 1689 \\"that he did not want to stay in London, and that most of the hatred and anger befell the favourite.\\" However, Gastigny was appointed Master of the Buckhounds to King William on 9 September 1689, staying in this position until 1698. He later appeared on the Patent Rolls as entitled to a ¬£500 pension each year. Gastigny died in London in 1708. Legacy Himself a refugee in Holland, Gastigny wanted to provide for the Huguenot refugees in England. He was a member of the French Committee responsible for distributing the Royal Bounty to the refugees. In his will dated April 1708, he originally left ¬£1,000 () to benefit poor French Protestants ‚Äì ¬£500 for an infirmary and ¬£500 for a pest house to be converted to a home for the aging. The funds were allowed to accrue interest. Philippe M√©nard, executor of Gastigny's estate, solicited for additional funds through public subscriptions for the hospital, known as La Providence. The hospital opened in 1718 by Royal Charter, with Henri de Massue, Earl of Galway serving as its first governor. A painting of Gastigny by Pierre Mignard, circa 1680, is in the collection of the French Hospital, now on display in the Huguenot Museum in Rochester, Kent. Gastigny Place, located near the original hospital location in St Luke's Parish, was named in his honour. It intersected Radnor Street and Galway Streets, just west of Moorfields Eye Hospital.

It stars Adrienne King, Daren Ackerman, Alexander Fraser, and Alicia Rose.  Premise  Devon, Garrett, and Becky are a group of friends who are considered outcasts. Devon becomes the target of a homophobic assault by a group of classmates, led by his former friend John. The assault is recorded and released online. Without much support from his family or the high school faculty, Devon is left to decide whether he‚Äôs going to let the bullying continue or put an end to it by standing up for himself. Becky encourages him to take action, leading to Devon plotting revenge, creating a viral video of his own, leading to more violence.  Cast  * Adrienne King as Principal Kane * Daren Ackerman as John Brooks * Alexander Fraser as Devon Manning * Alicia Rose as Becky * Dara Davey as Shelly Mulgrove * Patrick Ford as Mr. Taylor  Reception  The film has been criticized for its violent content with some critics saying that the graphic nature of the film overshadows the message the film was trying to convey. Grace Montgomery stated that \\"Although it seems like it's trying to make a statement about social media and bullying, most of what the film has to say is lost under the horrifying violence that has no resolution.\\" Justin Hamelin praised the film saying that \\"All American Bully does not simplify the terrible epidemic of bullying in our society these days, nor does it glorify the damage done either by the antagonist or to the victims. It is a reserved and respectful approach to a problem that desperately needs to stop. Perhaps the best compliment I can give this film is that it should be considered for discussion amongst high school classes across the country and while there is a very upsetting scene that I had trouble getting through towards the end of the film, this is the harsh reality we live in and by spreading awareness of the issues at hand, we can hopefully work towards a society where bullying becomes the exception, as opposed to the expected.\\" References ","title":"All American Bully"},{"id":"52540162","text":"Barbara Evelyn Bailey (born 14 March 1942) is an educator, writer and gender studies scholar from Kingston, Jamaica.

Description  It is a rare type of comet called a main-belt comet. Although most comets come from the Oort cloud or the Kuiper belt, main-belt comets are instead members of the asteroid belt that have a coma and tail. As of 2016, it is one of only 15 known main-belt comets. Precovery observations of 331P/Gibbs in Sloan Digital Sky Survey data were found dating to August 2004, in which the object was visible as a regular asteroid. Further observations in 2014 by the Keck Observatory showed that the comet was fractured into 5 pieces and rotating rapidly, with a rotation period of only 3.2 hours. Due to the YORP effect, P/2012 F5 had begun to spin so quickly that, being a likely rubble pile, parts began to be thrown off, leaving a very long dust trail. This is very similar to 311P/PANSTARRS, being the best-established cause for main-belt comets along with impacts between small asteroids (such as with 596 Scheila and P/2010 A2 (LINEAR)).

He has released four albums: Cruisin‚Ä≤ in 2010, Thank You For Giving Me the Blues in 2011, The Wick Sessions in 2013 and Steer the Wheel in 2014. Career Shaun Kirk was born in Melbourne and grew up in the city's outer eastern suburbs. He first picked up a guitar at age 16 after his mother left an old nylon string in his bedroom in the hope that it would spark some inspiration. It did and Kirk now often jokes at his shows about learning Deep Purple's 'Smoke on the Water' as his first song. He then broke his ankle at age 17 and wrote his first song in the hospital bed whilst waiting for surgery. Soon after he began singing and playing in front of small crowds at blues jam nights across Melbourne, initially as a folk singer before developing a feel for the blues music. Over the years he has matured his performance and now accompanies his guitar with harmonica, stomp box, tambourine, high hat, cymbal, kick and snare drum. In January 2010, Kirk launched his debut album, 'Cruisin', and shortly after embarked on his first national tour of Australia playing at many of the country's regional pubs, cafes and festivals. The album then went to win the 'Best Debut Album' award at the Melbourne Blues Appreciation Society's annual VIC/TAS Blues Music Awards. In August 2011 Shaun began working on his next album 'Thank You for Giving Me the Blues' with Western Australian percussionist/producer Arunachala Satgunasingam. The album was released in December 2011 and by January 2012 had climbed to #1 on the Australian Blues/Roots Airplay Charts. In December 2012 Kirk booked in a session at Melbourne's The Wick Studios to set about recording a live CD/DVD called The Wick Sessions that was released in March 2013. In 2013 Kirk issued his fifth release, an EP titled Giving. The EP included the track \\"Give to the Needy\\" which featured part of Charlie Chaplin's speech from The Great Dictator. Steer the Wheel, released in 2014, was recorded at The Wick Studios in Brunswick, Victoria and was Kirk's first recording with a band which included ARIA Award winning rhythm section Danny McKenna (drums) and Grant Cummerford (bass). The album debuted at #1 on the Australian Blues iTunes Charts and included 3 singles - 'Stitches', 'Give to the Needy' and 'Two Hands on the Wheel' (feat Halfway to Forth) which all received strong airplay across Australia and internationally. Since the birth of his career Kirk has received consistent airplay on national Australian Triple J radio and ABC Radio National, as well as on ABC Local across Australia; consistently toured throughout Australia and abroad selling out headline shows, as well as opening for artists including Joe Bonamassa, Beth Hart, Allen Stone, JJ Grey & Mofro, Diesel, Ash Grunwald, Mia Dyson and Matt Andersen. He's become a regular name on Australia's festival circuit appearing at some of the country's biggest such as Byron Bay Bluesfest, Woodford Folk Festival, Port Fairy Folk Festival, Queenscliff Music Festival, St Kilda Festival, Gympie Music Muster, Caloundra Music Festival and Blues on Broadbeach. Reception After witnessing Shaun's shows at the 2011 Woodford Folk Festival - Director of Bluesfest Byron Bay Peter Noble blogged about his performances calling him \\"a truly hot new artist on the blues scene\\". Reviewing Shaun Kirk's performance at Northcote Social Club in May 2014, critic Bradley Cowan wrote: \\"Shaun Kirk proved that blues is still very much in fashion with his stellar performance... His energetic strumming and deep raspy voice hit all the right notes, causing sporadic beaming and shouts to erupt throughout the audience.\\" Awards *2006: Winner of The Basin Music Festival Youth Songwriting Competition. *2010: VIC/TAS Blues Music Awards - Blues Debut Album for 'Cruisin' *2012: Blues at Bridgetown Youth People's Choice Award *2013: Semi Finalist - International Songwriting Competition for 'Drug Got A Hold Onto You' *2013: St Kilda Festival - Best New Artist Award Discography =Studio Albums= *2010: Cruisin‚Ä≤ *2011: Thank You For Giving Me the Blues *2014: Steer the Wheel =Live albums= *2013: The Wick Sessions (live in the studio CD/DVD package) =EPs= *2013: Giving EP *2019: Shaun Kirk EP References Australian male singers Australian songwriters Singers from Melbourne 1988 births Living people Australian blues guitarists Harmonica players 21st-century Australian singers 21st-century guitarists 21st-century male singers Australian male guitarists ","title":"Shaun Kirk"},{"id":"52540411","text":"Elena Mikhailovna Utkina (, maiden name Fomina, former name Konova;–§–æ–º–∏–Ω–∞ –ï–ª–µ–Ω–∞ –ú–∏—Ö–∞–π–ª–æ–≤–Ω–∞–í –õ–∞–¥–µ –Ω–æ–≤—ã–π –≤—Ä–∞—Ç–∞—Ä—å –ï–ª–µ–Ω–∞ –£—Ç–∫–∏–Ω–∞ born 29 May 1990) is a Russian handballer for CSKA Moscow and the Russian national team.–£—Ç–∫–∏–Ω–∞ –ï–ª–µ–Ω–∞ –ú–∏—Ö–∞–π–ª–æ–≤–Ω–∞ International honours *EHF Champions League: **Fourth Place: 2015 *EHF Cup Winners' Cup: **Finalist: 2016 **Semifinalist: 2012 References 1990 births Living people Sportspeople from Volgograd Russian female handball players Universiade medalists in handball Universiade gold medalists for Russia Medalists at the 2015 Summer Universiade ","title":"Elena Utkina"},{"id":"52540412","text":"The 1994 Air Force Falcons football team represented the United States Air Force Academy in the 1994 NCAA Division I-A football season.

Geography Cape Neupokoyev is located north of the Vilkitsky Strait and stretches out southwestwards into the Kara Sea. This headland is the southernmost point of Bolshevik Island and of Severnaya Zemlya. There are beach ridges and swales close to Cape Neupokoyev, with the Neupokoyev Lagoon () located right to the east of the headland. History Adolf Erik Nordenski√∂ld during the Vega Expedition in 1878 sailed very close to this cape but did not notice it. In 1882 Danish Arctic explorer and naval officer Andreas Peter Hovgaard, leader of the Dijmphna Expedition, sailed the waters of the Kara Sea in order to discover land north of the Taymyr Peninsula, but was unable to reach the peninsula's shores owing to thick ice. Later Nansen's Fram expedition in 1895, as well Eduard Toll's Russian polar expedition of 1900‚Äì02 on ship Zarya failed to note any traces of land to the north of the strait between the Kara Sea and the Laptev Sea.Nicholas II Land, Bulletin of the American Geographical Society Vol. 46, No. 2 (1914), pp. 117-120 The eastern shore of present-day Severnaya Zemlya was discovered by Boris Vilkitsky in 1913 during the Arctic Ocean Hydrographic Expedition, but he did not chart the western coast of Bolshevik Island. This headland was finally surveyed, mapped and named during the 1930‚Äì1932 expedition to the archipelago led by Georgy Ushakov and Nikolay Urvantsev. It was named after Konstantin Neupokoev (1884‚Äî1924), a naval officer, hydrographer and explorer of the Russian Hydrographic Service in Soviet times.–°–∏–Ω—é–∫–æ–≤, –í. –í. –ê–ª–µ–∫—Å–∞–Ω–¥—Ä –í–∞—Å–∏–ª—å–µ–≤–∏—á –ö–æ–ª—á–∞–∫ : –£—á—ë–Ω—ã–π –∏ –ø–∞—Ç—Ä–∏–æ—Ç : –≤ 2 —á. / –í. –í. –°–∏–Ω—é–∫–æ–≤; –æ—Ç–≤. —Ä–µ–¥. –ê. –ü. –õ–∏—Å–∏—Ü—ã–Ω ; –ò–Ω-—Ç –∏—Å—Ç–æ—Ä–∏–∏ –µ—Å—Ç–µ—Å—Ç–≤–æ–∑–Ω–∞–Ω–∏—è –∏ —Ç–µ—Ö–Ω–∏–∫–∏ –∏–º. –°. –ò. –í–∞–≤–∏–ª–æ–≤–∞ –†–ê–ù. ‚Äî –ú.: –ù–∞—É–∫–∞, 2009. ‚Äî (—á. 2), –°. 34 { - valign=\\"top\\" 1975 map showing Severnaya Zemlya and the Taymyr Peninsula Terra-MODIS image of Severnaya Zemlya in 2001 } References Neupokoyev Neupokoyev Neupokoyev ","title":"Cape Neupokoyev"},{"id":"52540432","title":"Cec√≠lia Eszterg√°lyos"},{"id":"52540444","text":"Tiffany Springs is a neighborhood of Kansas City, Missouri, United States.

Aside from building his landmark home of Tiffany Castle, his major real estate endeavor was to build a spa resort to rival the successful Excelsior Springs, Missouri.

Description Quoya cuneata is a spreading shrub which grows to a height of and which has its branches densely covered with pale white or brownish hairs. The leaves are egg-shaped or wedge-shaped, long and wide and lack a stalk. Both surfaces of the leaf are blistered and covered with woolly hairs. The flowers are arranged singly, sometimes in groups of up to three in leaf axils on woolly stalks long. The flowers are surrounded by bracts and bracteoles which are hairy on the outer surface and glabrous on the inside. The five sepals are long, with the egg-shaped lobes in two groups, five in one, two in the other with the upper three-lobed \\"lip\\" larger than the lower one. The sepals are densely woolly on the outside and mostly glabrous on the inside. The petals are long, forming a bell-shaped tube with five lobes. The petal tube is blue at first but turns white with purple spots inside. The outside of the tube has short hairs and is mostly glabrous inside except for the large lower lip and a dense ring of hairs around the ovary. The lower central lobe is broad elliptic to almost round, long, wide and larger than the other four lobes. The four stamens extend a short distance beyond the end of the tube. Flowering occurs from August to November or December and is followed by the fruit which is oval-shaped to almost spherical, in diameter with the sepals remaining attached. Taxonomy and naming This species was first formally described in 1828 by Charles Gaudichaud-Beaupr√© from a specimen collected in Shark Bay during the Bougainville expedition in the ships l'Uranie and la Physicienne from 1817 to 1820. The specific epithet (cuneata) is a Latin word meaning \\"wedge-shaped\\".

Background A new state constitution was adopted in 1890, which extended Stone's term to six years. Determined to keep control and maintain white supremacy, the Democratic-dominated legislature effectively disfranchised most African Americans in the state by adding a requirement to the constitution for voter registration for payment of poll taxes. Two years later, they passed laws requiring literacy tests (administered by white officials in a discriminatory way), and grandfather clauses (the latter benefited white citizens). These requirements, with additions in legislation of 1892, resulted in a 90% reduction in the number of blacks who voted in Mississippi.Michael Perman, Struggle for Mastery: Disfranchisement in the South, 1888-1908 (2000), ch 4 In every county a handful of prominent black ministers and local leaders were allowed to vote.

They are class GT22LC-2 from GMD and have a Co-Co wheel arrangement with 6 axles (12 wheels). In addition to interrupting railway traffic, the accident destroyed the pedestrian connection for local residents, who started to use small boats to ferry goods and people across the river.

Given the State of North Carolina nickname \\"Tar Heel\\", he was bred by William Reynolds at his Tanglewood Farm near Winston-Salem, North Carolina.Mi-Harness reprint from the July 1982 issue of the USTA's Hoof Beats magazine titled \\"The Legacy of Tar Heel\\" Retrieved October 9, 2016 Racing career Tar Heel was race conditioned for Reynolds by legendary trainer Delvin Miller and driven by 1974 Hall of Fame inductee, Del Cameron. At two, among Tar Heel's wins were the Review Stakes, Two Gaits Farm Pace, Geers 2YO Colt Stakes and American National 2YO Colt Pace. He recorded the fastest time for a two-year-old pacer over one mile with a 2:00 3/5 clocking in a time trial. At three in 1951, his biggest win came in the most prestigious race in American harness racing for pacers, the Little Brown Jug. In addition, Tar Heel won the Geers 3YO Colt Stakes and the American National 3YO Colt Pace. For the second straight year Tar Heel recorded the fastest time for pacers at his age over one mile, clocking of 1:57 2/5 in a time trial.Tar Heel bio at the Harness Racing Museum & Hall of Fame Retrieved October 7, 2016 At stud Following the death of owner William Reynolds in September 1951, Tar Heel was sold at auction to Lawrence B. Sheppard for $125,000, the then highest price for any Standardbred in history. When retired to stud, Tar Heel stood at Hanover Shoe Farms in Pennsylvania where he was a highly successful stallion. The sire of Little Brown Jug winners Laverne Hanover and Nansemond, Tar Heel was also an outstanding broodmare sire. His daughters most notably produced Romeo Hanover and Ralph Hanover, both winners of the United States Triple Crown for Pacers, as well as Bret Hanover, regarded as one of the greatest pacers in harness racing history. Death and Longevity Tar Heel died in his sleep after a brief age-related illness at the age of 34, which was during a time that the average lifespan for standardbred horses was 24 to 27 years. His son Waco Hanover (May 4, 1977 - February 9, 2019) became the longest lived standardbred on record and likely the longest lived of any racehorse, having lived 41 years and 281 days. Waco, as he was often called, had his story produced on CBS Sunday Morning at the beginning of 2017, and lived out his final days in Vermont as a companion horse with his caretaker and other younger horses. On June 17, 2018, Waco surpassed the previous longest lived record of 41 years and 45 days held by the standardbred New Zealand pacer stallion named Lighterman Tom (August 23, 1946 - October 5, 1987), who only won one race in his career, but produced a New Zealand Cup winner named Lightning Blue and lived 43 days past his 41st birthday.

He was known for his studies on structural geology of Precambrian era and was an elected fellow of the Indian National Science Academy, and the Indian Academy of Sciences. The Council of Scientific and Industrial Research, the apex agency of the Government of India for scientific research, awarded him the Shanti Swarup Bhatnagar Prize for Science and Technology, one of the highest Indian science awards for his contributions to Earth, Atmosphere, Ocean and Planetary Sciences in 1972.  Biography  The Hijli Detention Camp (photographed in 1951) served as IIT Kharagpur's first academic building Born on 2 January 1932 in Comilla, in the Bengal region of British India (presently in Bangladesh), Kshitindramohan Naha graduated in science from Presidency College, Kolkata and later completed his master's degree from the Rajabazar Science College where he continued at the same institution as a research scholar under the guidance of Santosh Kumar Ray. In 1958, he moved to the Indian Institute of Technology, Kharagpur as a member of faculty of the department of geology and geophysics and it was during his service there, he received the degree of Doctor of Science from the University of Calcutta in 1959. He rose in ranks at IIT Kharagapur and when he superannuated from service in 1992, he was holding the post of a professor. During this period, he had two stints abroad as a visiting professor at the University of California, Berkeley (1968) and La Trobe University (1975‚Äì76). Post retirement, he served as a CSIR Emeritus scientist of the institute till his death on 24 May 1996, at the age of 64.  Legacy  Naha was known to have made extensive studies on the structural geology of Precambrian era and was credited with compiling an integrated geological history of Precambrian rocks in Ghatsila in Singhbhum of Bihar and in Simla region. Through his studies, he estimated the time of formation and kinematic significance of deformation lamellae in quartz. Migmatites and its architecture, the geometry of reclined folds and the early precambrian terrance of the southern parts of India and central Rajasthan were some of the other foci of his studies. His studies also assisted in developing methodologies for the recognition of angular run conformity in metamorphic terraces as well as the coaxial refolding prior to non- coaxial deformation. His researches are available as several peer- reviewed articles and he was associated with the Indian Journal of Earth Science, Indian Journal of Geology and Precambrian Research as a member of their editorial boards. He chaired the Indian National Committee on Continental Lithosphere and served as a member of the council of the Indian National Science Academy during 1990‚Äì92.  Awards and honours  Naha received the S. L. Biswas Medal of the Asiatic Society in 1958 and the National Mineral Award in 1970. The Council of Scientific and Industrial Research awarded him the Shanti Swarup Bhatnagar Prize, one of the highest Indian science awards, in 1972. The Indian National Science Academy elected him as their fellow in 1977 and he became an elected fellow of Indian Academy of Sciences in 1983. He was also a fellow of the Mining and Metallurgical Society of India and the Geological Society of India. He delivered several award orations which included Professor K. P. Rode Memorial Lecture of the Indian Science Congress (1992), Professor H. C. Dasgupta Memorial Lecture of the Geological, Mining and Metallurgical Society of India (1992) and Dr. S.

Abandoned vehicles will be tagged with an official notice when found or reported. Criteria for \\"abandonment\\" may differ, and a minimum duration of abandonment in the order of a few days to weeks is required. When reporting such a vehicle, the required data will usually comprise the exact location, the make, colour and type, and - if available and readable - possibly the VIN and the licence plate. Costs for removal will as a rule be taken by public councils. Environmental impact Volkswagen abandoned in Greece Toyota Cressida abandoned in Saudi Arabia An abandoned car in Sri Lanka. Abandoned truck A long abandoned truck in an advanced state of decay. Abandoned cars use up space in the environment and, just like other waste, pose considerable risks for public health. Specific rules and regulations  A common definition is that the vehicle must have been left on private or public property for a minimum duration (‚â• 24 hours) or it hasn't been reclaimed after being impounded after a minimum number of days. =United States= The definition of an \\"abandoned vehicle\\" varies widely across the states and larger cities of the USA. In Iowa, for example, the following criteria apply: \\"Abandoned vehicle\\" means any of the following: #A vehicle that has been left unattended on public property for more than twenty-four hours and lacks current registration plates or two or more wheels or other parts which renders the vehicle totally inoperable. #A vehicle that has remained illegally on public property for more than twenty-four hours. #A vehicle that has been unlawfully parked on private property or has been placed on private property without the consent of the owner or person in control of the property for more than twenty-four hours. #A vehicle that has been legally impounded by order of a police authority and has not been reclaimed for a period of ten days. However, a police authority may declare the vehicle abandoned within the ten-day period by notifying the owner. #Any vehicle parked on the highway determined by a police authority to create a hazard to other vehicle traffic. #A vehicle that has been impounded by order of the court and whose owner has not paid the impoundment fees after notification by the person or agency responsible for carrying out the impoundment order. A number of differing criteria are listed here in no specific order: * Arizona: According to Arizona law, an \\"abandoned vehicle\\" is a vehicle, trailer or semitrailer that is subject to registration and has been abandoned on public or private property, whether lost, stolen, abandoned or otherwise unclaimed. * Boston: Abandoned vehicles are safety hazards and they blight our neighborhoods. If you abandon your car in Boston, we have the right to fine you, tow your vehicle, and take further action. The City of Boston can legally take possession of vehicles left standing on City streets for more than 72 hours. We enforce this regulation if 1)we receive a complaint from a resident, or 2) the vehicle poses a safety hazard. We don't automatically consider a vehicle parked on the same street for more than 72 hours abandoned. * Texas: A motor vehicle is abandoned if the motor vehicle: *# is inoperable, is more than five years old, and has been left unattended on public property for more than 48 hours; *# has remained illegally on public property for more than 48 hours; *# has remained on private property without the consent of the owner or person in charge of the property for more than 48 hours; *# has been left unattended on the right-of-way of a designated county, state, or federal highway for more than 48 hours; *# has been left unattended for more than 24 hours on the right-of-way of a turnpike project constructed and maintained by the Texas Turnpike Authority division of the Texas Department of Transportation or a controlled access highway * New York: With License Plates:You can report an abandoned vehicle with at least one fixed metal license plate or in-transit paper registration plate if it has been left on public property for at least 48 hours. Officers from your local police precinct will respond when they are not handling emergency situations. The vehicle's owner will be responsible for all towing and storage fees. Without License Plates: You can report a vehicle without license plates abandoned on a City street or sidewalk. The Department of Sanitation will investigate and tag the vehicle. Once it is tagged, it will be removed within three business days. *Seattle: An abandoned vehicle is defined as a vehicle within Seattle City Limits on a public street or city property for over 72 hours. =Australia= As in the US, there is not one single set of rules. Following is an arbitrary selection: *Queensland: It is an offence to leave a vehicle (a car, truck or motorbike) on the roadway or footpath once the vehicle registration has expired. Once your vehicle registration expires, move your vehicle onto private property to avoid an infringement and possible removal of your vehicle by the council. If your vehicle is registered and is not parked illegally or dangerously, it will not be considered abandoned. *City of Newcastle: The council classifies a vehicle as being abandoned when the vehicle is parked on a public street and the owner of the vehicle can not be identified. A vehicle may be unregistered and parked on a public street but not necessarily abandoned. Enquiries would be made to identify the owner, establish the reasons as to why the vehicle is parked on the street and the owner can be requested to remove the vehicle. *Northern Territory: There are two general types of abandoned vehicles: *# A vehicle that has been left unattended in a public place or on a road or road related area. *# A vehicle that has been abandoned on private property for more than six months.

The geology of the New Forest comprises a succession of largely flat-lying sedimentary rocks of Palaeogene age laid down between about 66 and about 34 million years ago, in the centre of a sedimentary basin known as the Hampshire Basin. These are overlain by a variety of superficial deposits. There are few rock exposures beyond limited outcrops in the banks of streams, the faces of working and abandoned gravel pits, and some low coastal cliffs. However, temporary exposures during construction works and boreholes have added to earth scientists‚Äô understanding of the area. In broad terms, the oldest rocks occupy the northern part of the area with progressively younger rocks seen to the south, approaching the Solent coast. As elsewhere, the names of particular rock strata (and higher level groups) sometimes change as geological knowledge expands and research correlates strata in one area with those of another. Older literature and maps may therefore refer to different names. Concealed older strata A borehole at Marchwood on the edge of the Test estuary just northeast of the national park found Jurassic and Triassic strata at depth, and penetrated what are thought to be Devonian rocks beneath.British Geological Survey 1:50,000 scale geological map series (England and Wales) sheet no 315 Southampton. 1987 Cretaceous The area is underlain at shallower depths by the pure marine limestones of the Chalk Group though, within the park, these rocks are not seen at the surface except in a very small area on its extreme northwestern margin in the parish of Hale where the Portsdown Chalk Formation is exposed. Elsewhere its presence has been proven in boreholes e.g. at Bunker's Hill, Copythorne. Palaeogene The Chalk is overlain unconformably by the clays and sands of the Reading Formation, which were deposited during the Palaeocene, the earliest part of the Palaeogene period. These rocks outcrop between Woodgreen and Redlynch. The formation forms a part of the Lambeth Group. This formation is in turn overlain by the London Clay Formation, the outcrop of which can be traced from the Fordingbridge area via Redlynch northeast to Whiteparish. It contains sandy units within it referred to as the Nursling Sand and Whitecliff Sand members. Typically around 100m thick, the formation forms a part of the Thames Group and is considered of early Eocene age. Both the Reading Formation and the London Clay are pebbly at their bases. The London Clay is unconformably overlain by the sands and clays of the Bracklesham Group, which is divided into several units; the Wittering, Marsh Farm and Poole formations and after a further break in deposition, the younger Branksome Sand, Boscombe Sand and Selsey Sand formations.British Geological Survey 1:50,000 scale geological map series (England and Wales) sheet no 314 Ringwood. 2004 The sands and clays of the Barton Group overlie those of the Bracklesham Group; in succession these are the Barton Clay, Chama Sand and Becton Sand formations. The Warren Hill Sand is a separately mappable ‚Äòmember‚Äô within the Barton Clay as is the Becton Bunny Member within the Becton Sand. The uppermost and hence youngest of all the ‚Äòsolid‚Äô rock units within the park is the Headon Formation (forming a part of the Solent Group, which comprises clays, silts, and sands laid down in freshwater conditions. However deposition under marine conditions is indicated by the Lyndhurst Member‚Äîa separately mappable rock unit that divides the formation into upper and lower parts. It forms much of the higher ground to the south and southeast of Lyndhurst. Geological structures The geology is overwhelmingly flat-lying with dips of no more than one or two degrees in a generally southerly direction. Some minor folding is seen in Barton Group and Headon Formation strata around Burley.British Geological Survey 1:50,000 scale geological map series (England and Wales) sheet no 329 Bournemouth. 1991 Though geological faults are known to affect the subsurface, few are evident at the surface. Superficial deposits A suite of unconsolidated materials have been deposited during the Quaternary period and include alluvial clays, silts, sands and gravels on the floors of the many smaller watercourses within the area. The main river valleys, including those of the Avon, Beaulieu and Lymington rivers, are floored by alluvium; sand and gravel laid down in the river channels themselves and silt and clay deposited as the rivers overflow their banks during times of flood. Much the most extensive deposits are those of river terraces of which fourteen are identified at successive levels across the area of the national park. Some are referred to as the 'Plateau Gravels'. Tidal flats composed of clay and silt along the Solent coast are extensive, particularly around the mouths of the Beaulieu and Lymington rivers. Similar deposits are found around Calshot at the end of Southampton Water. Patches of head are recorded in places, most especially on the steeper ground of the valley sides in the north and west of the national park. These deposits typically reflect the underlying solid geology and derive from solifluction and slope wash. There are chalybeate i.e. iron-rich springs in places, Irons Well (or, earlier ‚ÄòLepers Well‚Äô) near Fritham being one such example.

The alley Sankt Clemens Str√¶de leads to Immervad from the east. The street is situated in the historic Latin Quarter neighborhood and has existed as a road or street since the Viking Age when it was used as the eastern ford to cross the Aarhus River. Immervad is fairly short at just 110 meters long but it is one of the streets with the most foot traffic in Aarhus. At the southern section of the street is the bridge of Frederiksbroen, the first bridge built to cross the river in the city. Immervad is home to Magasin du Nord, one of the largest department stores in Aarhus, and runs next to the recreational space of Vadestedet (The Ford) on the street of √Öboulevarden which runs perpendicular to the southern end of Immervad.  Etymology  The name Immervad is unique as a street name in Danish cities. The ending \\"vad\\" refers to the Danish word \\"Vadested\\" (Ford) while \\"Immer\\" is of unknown origin. It is possible Immer is the German word meaning \\"Always\\", an allusion to a ford that can always be crossed. Another theory is that the original spelling Emmervad refers to a person named Emmer who may have lived by the ford. A third theory states that Emmer was the leftovers after creating slaked lime, used to stabilize the river floor at the ford. However, there are also indications that the name was not known in the Middle Ages as sources from 1512 mentions the street as \\"the street to the bridge\\".  Frederiks Bridge  Frederiksbroen across Aarhus River The southern section of Immervad is the bridge Frederiks Bro or Frederiksbroen. It is not known exactly when Frederiks Bro was built but it existed in the 1400s when Brobjerg on the south side of the bridge was settled. The bridge was early on known as Brobjerg Bro (Brobjerg Bridge) and from the 1600s to 1824 as Basballe Bro after one of the prominent merchant families that lived on Immervad at the time. In 1824 the street south of the bridge was renamed Frederiksgade after King Frederik VI who visited Aarhus at the time and at the same time the bridge was renamed to Frederiks Bro. In the 1930s the section of the river which runs through the city proper was paved over and the bridge was dismantled. In 1989 Aarhus City Council officially adopted a policy to reopen the river and between 2005 and 2008 the section from Immervad to Vester All√© was reopened and a bridge reestablished. The name Frederiks Bro is not a well-known in daily parlance as a much larger and more prominent bridge on Frederiks All√© carries the same name.  Buildings  Vadestedet. Immervad runs parallel to the Magasin department store. Bronze sculptue of former mayor Steffen Bernhardt Jensen with his ever present bicycle In the Middle Age the street was home to \\"hellig√•ndshuset\\" (House of the Holy Ghost), part hospital, part nursing home and part gust house, but the building fell into disrepair after the reformation and was eventually replaced by a large merchant's building. Immervad was situated close to some of the main thoroughfares in the city such as Vestergade and the river harbor so it was an ideal location for merchants to establish themselves. By the late Middle Ages Immervad was characterized by a number of large and prominent merchants mansions with warehouses, stables etc. Few of these buildings remain today although the adjacent Maren Smeds Gyde contains a warehouse from that period. The largest and most prominent mansion was built in 1597 and was through time inhabited by several of the mayors of the city until it was bought by the merchant Poul Pedersen Frausing in 1788. The building remained in the Frausing family until 1901 when it was taken down and moved to Tangkrogen for the Danish National Exhibition of 1909 to serve as a museum. It subsequently became the first building in the Old Town Museum, known as the Mayor's Mansion. In 1871 the store Magasin du Nord moved from Vestergade to Immervad where it has been situated ever since. The store has been expanded a number of times and in the 1960s the current complex was built, dominating the western side of the street. Today the street is dominated by the large department store from the 60s and 70s on the west side and older buildings on the east side.

They were meant to mimic and emulate the works of Terence and Plautus. Audiences could expect plentiful use of monologues, asides, over-hearing, misunderstandings, mistaken identity, and disguise. The comedy is derived at the expense of authority figures behaving foolishly or amorous young men. The audience were also entertained by the performers that helped create the carnivalesque atmosphere. Like the Roman comedy it comes from, commedia erudita is a festive experience. It was used for weddings and welcoming celebrities visiting town. Their shows were typically only for the members of the court, but sometimes it was opened up to lesser court servants. Beginning of commedia erudita = Rebirth of Plautus and Terence = The development of commedia erudita was widely anticipated by writers and audiences. Never before had there been an attempt to restore the comedies written by the Romans in the 2nd century B.C.E. A century prior to the creation of commedia erudita, twelve previously unknown Plautus plays were discovered by Nicholas Cusanus, and Donatus's commentary on Terence was uncovered by Giovanni Aurispa. These events spawned new interest in Plautus and Terence. Roman theatre took a century from rediscovery to restoration due to three major factors:  Antiquity  It was difficult for audiences to relate to many situations and themes expressed in the stories. Also, at this time there was still considerable ignorance of the Romans' stage structure, which was vastly different from fifteenth-century theater spaces.  Language  A century was spent by scholars transcribing, editing, translating, commenting, and performing the texts. Writers were slow and hesitant due to their uncertainty of Roman language and verse.  The Church  They resisted the movement because all other entertainment at the time had backing from the church and support from secular authorities. = Sacre rappresentazioni = The \\"Mystery Plays\\" were the only widespread scripted vernacular in Italy in the fourteenth century. These performances were for popular audiences with understanding of biblical stories and faith in the divine mysteries. Their entertainment relied heavily on spectacle. The sacre rappresentazioni plays had stagings of all kinds of frightful miracles and martyrdoms (ex. the skinning of St. Bartholomew with the use of adroit manipulation and flesh-colored lights). Because the public was already accustomed to this level of shock value, commedia erudita writers had to find a way to include spectacle in their shows as well. = Humanism = These didactic literary experiments were almost always prose pieces, written by students, teachers, and scholars calling out against authority. The contents of these outbursts were usually farcical and obscene. Their authors thought of them as light-hearted youthful compositions. = Piccolomini's Criside = Published in 1444, written in Latin by of Enea Silvio Piccolomini (future Pope Pius II), was the first humanistic work majorly inspired by Plautus. It is an erotic story about a rivalry between two men and it involves their prostitutes. Piccolomini's plot was not world-changing, but his play was. It could be staged on a single set and the dialogue was fairly witty. = Antonio Barzizza's La Cauteria = La Cauteria was written in 1420s Bologna and was inspired by the works of Terence. Barzizza decided to write about something that recently happened on his street where an adulterous woman is branded by her husband as punishment. Her lover arrives and threatens to brand the husband. What happens next is the reason the prose is interesting; the husband and wife are helped by two servants and at this time there is a conversation that contains clever cross-person dialogue ‚Äì much like the writings of Plautus. = Eteria = This play's author is anonymous. It has a complicated plot that focuses on two separate, but interrelated love stories; this is a huge step forward for a Latin playwright. As in Roman comedy, intrigue is created when a witty servant tricks the elderly authority figures into giving her their money. She does it so she can give it to the young men who were denied their ladies. The characters are believable. The dialogue flows. It even has a well-orchestrated disguise scene. In addition, never before had there been a published Latin play that explicitly borrowed pieces of Roman theatre.  Latin comedy  Before the Roman texts started being used for inspiration, there were many story-telling elements that the Latin writers had not figured out yet. There used to be a disregard for dramatic unity. Latin plays had a tendency to jump from scene to scene in a disjunct manner. It was jarring and hard for audiences to follow. Sometimes there were scenes written that they later realized were impossible to do on stage. Dialogue also had a tendency to be stiff and lengthy. Practical jokes were very popular in these shows, but they were only very simple tricks. The Roman comedies gave Latin writers a guide to make their own plays flow better. They were shown how to write a story with complex, interwoven storylines. Romans also had much more complicated practical jokes, such as cuckolding.  Developments of commedia erudita  = New character = The playwrights of commedia erudita invented a completely new comedic character. His job is to come out at the beginning and give the audience the prologue. While he gives the prologue he is also supposed to go around and be friendly to the audience members. He loosens up the crown and gives them valuable information at the same time. = Five act structure = This would become mandatory in Italian comedy and spread elsewhere. The purpose of breaking up the acts is to allow time for intermedi which are small intermissions and the chance to see spectacles, listen to music, and dance.  Themes  = Adultery = Many commedia erudita plays appealed to the baser instincts of the human beings watching them. Scripts were full of indecent remarks and behavior that was improper. Writers aimed to keep the attention of audience members by presenting to them sinful living. = Domestic life = An adventurous young man of a good family has a harsh father, but he gets help from a clever servant who then uses deception and intrigue to save the day, and then the young man gets married and lives happily ever after.  Dramaturgy  For the most part the Latins tried to imitate the Romans dramaturgically. They used a unitary stage in a restricted outdoor setting. Their time scale was limited. There was a single list of dramatic personae.  Aretino's La Cortigiana  This commedia erudita play attacks members of the court by depicting them villainously. It is a devastatingly dark comedy, full of biting satire.  Perception  Historians often look back on commedia erudita and make the conclusion that it was an artistic failure. Critics of these plays complain that they are immoral and lack any form of didactic purpose. Benedetto Varchi argues that the issue with the commedia erudita plays was that their comedy was not honest. Vachi condemns the writers for only focusing on trying to get laughs. He complains that by always trying to amuse the audience, the characters are limited to just the most unrealistic situations imaginable. Vachi adds that it is troubling because these kinds of dishonest situations are not only written by common men with poor judgement, but also by learned men. The erudite comedies did have a few small victories, however. Commedia erudita was constantly trying to overcome their competition, the church (see sacre rappresentazioni). The religious performances were quite lengthy in nature, some taking place over two tedious days. The brevity of commedia erudita plays made them more favorable.
