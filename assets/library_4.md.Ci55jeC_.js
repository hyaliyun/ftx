For three years, she served as president of the Woman's Relief Corps of the Grand Army of the Republic. She enjoyed a reputation as an elocutionist; and was the author of three volumes of poetry. She was born and died in Utica, New York. Early years and education Jane Elizabeth Dexter's great-grandfather, Gregor (or George) Grant), chieftain of Clan Grant, from Abernethy, Scotland, came to the United States in 1774. He joined the Continental Army and served during the American Revolutionary War. Dexter's mother was the daughter of William W. Williams, an architect of Albany, New York. Dexter's father was born in Paris, New York, his parents having removed to that town from Mansfield, Connecticut in the latter part of the 18th century. Conklin was born in Utica and received her education in the Utica Female Academy and in Mrs. Brinkerhof's School for Young Ladies in Albany. Her first composition was written in verse. When she was 14 years old, her poems were first published, and after that time, she wrote continuously. Career While none of her poems were strictly hymns, many of them were sung in religious meetings. She was, for many years, a contributor to the Utica Gospel Messenger. She also wrote prose and poetry for a New York City weekly, and for several local papers. In 1884, she published a book of poems, which was favorably received. In 1897, she was preparing a second volume of poems, ultimately publishing three books of poetry in total. Conklin was also remembered as an elocutionist. Personal life In December, 1865, she married Cramer H. Conklin, a veteran of the American Civil War, and they subsequently lived in Binghamton, New York. Conklin took great interest in the American Civil War and in the defenders of the Republic. When the Grand Army of the Republic post to which her husband belonged formed a Relief Corps of wives and daughters, she was one of the first to sign a call for a charter. Shortly after the Corps was organized, she was elected its president, and for three years, she held that office. Conklin died at her home in Utica on December 19, 1914.

It is centered around Buckingham Square, laid out in 1830 on the site of an early colonial-era church. The district includes a concentration of well-preserved Victorian architecture from the 1860s to 1890s. It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1977, and slightly enlarged in 1982. Description and history The Buckingham Square area is part of Hartford's earliest settlement, with Main and Buckingham Streets appearing on maps as early as 1640. That intersection was the site of a church built in 1670 by congregants who split from the city's First Congregational Church. When that church was demolished in the early 19th century, its site became Buckingham Park. The area between the park and Main Street was built out in the second half of the 19th century with mixed commercial-residential construction, while the roads stretching westward remained predominantly residential, with mainly brick and brownstone row houses lining the streets. The core of the historic district consists of two city blocks, bounded on the east by Main Street, the north by Capitol Avenue, the west by Hudson Street, and the south by Buckingham Street. It extends from this core to include buildings between Capitol Avenue and Linden Place, and a portion of the south side of Buckingham between John and Hudson Streets. The district was extended in 1982 to also include a single building facing Hudson Street just south of Buckingham. The buildings are stylistically diverse, with early buildings in the Italianate style, and later constructions in the Second Empire, Romanesque, and Gothic Revival.

After the Mataram conquest of Surabaya he was forced to live in Mataram court. He was executed in 1659 under the orders of Mataram's King Amangkurat I, who suspected him of conspiracy. Family and ancestry Pangeran Pekik was born into the ruling house of the Duchy of Surabaya. His father, Jayalengkara (), was the Duke of Surabaya at the time of Surabaya's conquest by Mataram (1625). The House of Surabaya claimed to be descendants of Sunan Ampel (1401‚Äì1481), one of the nine saints (wali songo) credited with the spread of Islam in Java. However, deGraaf wrote that there was no evidence for this claim although he considered it likely that the ruling family were distantly related to Sunan Ampel. Biography =Fall of Surabaya= At the time of Mataram's campaign of conquest against Surabaya (1619‚Äì1625), Pekik's father the duke was already blind and aged. Pekik was one of the leader of the defending forces and mobilised Surabaya's allies against Mataram. After several years of war, Surabaya surrendered in 1625. Pangeran Pekik was exiled to an ascetic life at the grave of Sunan Ngampel-Denta near Surabaya. = Move to Mataram court = In 1633, Mataram's Sultan Agung recalled Pangeran Pekik from Ampel. Pekik married Agung's sister and henceforth lived at court, while Agung's son and heir (later Amangkurat I) married Pekik's daughter. While at court, he \\"did much to civilize the Court\\" of Mataram, according to Dutch historian H. J. de Graaf. He brought culture from the court of Surabaya, which had been a centre of culture and Islamic Old Javanese literature since the second half of the 16th century, to the relatively new court of Mataram. Agung's decision to institute the Javanese calendar was probably the result of Pekik's influence. = Campaign against Giri = In 1636, Pekik was ordered by Sultan Agung to lead a Mataram army in a reconquest of Giri. Giri was a religious site, ruled by religious men who traced their lineage to Sunan Giri, one of the nine wali (saints) credited with spreading Islam in Java, and became a centre of opposition against Mataram. Agung hesitated to attack it, and he might have been worried that his men would not be willing to fight the holy men of Giri. Pekik's standing and his family's relation to the line of Sunan Ampel, a more senior wali than Sunan Giri, provided legitimacy to this campaign and help ensure the soldiers' loyalty. The fortified town of Giri was taken by Mataram troops under Pekik in 1636. = Amangkurat I's reign and assassination = Sultan Agung died in 1646 and was succeeded by Amangkurat I, who was married to one of Pekik's daughters. Around 1649, she died soon after giving birth to her third child, who was designated the crown prince (he later became King Amangkurat II). In 1659 Amangkurat I suspected that Pangeran Pekik was leading a conspiracy against his life. Subsequently, Pekik and his relatives, including those living in Surabaya, were killed under Amangkurat I's order. The massacre of Pekik's family, East Java's most important princely house, created a rift between Amangkurat and his East Javanese subjects. It also caused a conflict with his son, the crown prince, who was close to Pekik (his maternal grandfather) and the rest of his mother's family.

It is used in biological pest control of western flower thrips (Frankliniella occidentalis)in greenhouse or indoor grown crops. Description The adult T. swirskii has a pear-shaped body and is about in length. It has four pairs of legs, the front pair of which points forward, and a small number of paired bristles on the unsegmented body. The colour varies with the diet, being pale yellow or tan when thrips and whitefly are eaten, and reddish on some other diets. It is difficult to distinguish one species of predatory mite from another in the field. Distribution and habitat T. swirskii is native to the eastern Mediterranean region where its range includes Italy, Cyprus, Greece, Turkey, Israel and Egypt. It is used as an agent of biological control on crops such as apple, apricot, citrus, cotton and vegetables. It has been introduced to other parts of the world, where the climate is suitable, including much of Europe, northern Africa, North America, Argentina, China and Japan. Biology The life cycle consists of the egg stage, one larval stage, two nymphal stages and an adult stage. The eggs are laid on the undersides of leaves, usually on hairs near the junction of veins. They are oval, whitish and about long. They hatch into whitish, non-feeding, semi-transparent larvae with three pairs of legs. These soon develop into the four-legged nymphal stages, and then become adults, both nymphs and adults being predatory. The life cycle takes about five days at , and the mites can tolerate temperatures between , with 60 percent humidity. Host range The host range includes the immature stages of western flower thrips, common blossom thrips, onion thrips, melon thrips and chilli thrips, as well as those of silverleaf whitefly and greenhouse whitefly. It can also consume Asian citrus psyllid, broad mites, and other herbivorous mites. When these prey species are not available, it is able to survive and reproduce on a diet of pollen and plant exudates, although its fecundity and growth rates are reduced under these circumstances. Where two prey species are available, it will prey on the most available one. For example, in a 2016 research project on field grown cucumber plants, it was successful in controlling melon thrips on the leaves, but not common blossom thrips on the flowers of the same plants. Use in biocontrol Typhlodromips swirskii is used commercially in Europe and North America for biocontrol of whitefly and thrips in vegetables and ornamentals grown under cover. The cultured mites can be mixed with bran and sprinkled on the crop or spread by air blast. When multiple species of pest are present, it may effectively control one but not another; for example, in field grown cucumbers, it was found to control melon thrips on leaves, but failed to control common blossom thrips on flowers.

It was designed in a New Classical style by Robert A.M. Stern Architects. The building consists of 43 apartments, including two duplex townhomes, one maisonette and two penthouses. History 20 East End Avenue was developed by Edward Baquero of Corigin Real Estate Group. An entry-level, two-bedroom apartment was initially priced at approximately $4.5 million and one of the two penthouses at $39 million. Renderings for the building were released in late 2014. Construction began in early 2015, and the building topped out in November 2015. Facade installation was complete in mid-2016, and residents moved into the building later that year. Location The building is located between 80th and 81st Streets, near Carl Schurz Park, on East End Avenue in Yorkville, Manhattan, a neighborhood in the Upper East Side. East End Avenue, on the eastern edge of the Upper East Side, has long been home to some of the city's richest residents including the late Vincent Astor and Gloria Vanderbilt. Architecture The building is similar to several others designed by Robert A. M. Stern. It was inspired by buildings constructed in the 1920s and 1930s and other pre-war buildings, particularly those designed by J.E.R. Carpenter and Rosario Candela. The building includes features often found in pre-war buildings, such as a porte- coch√®re, setbacks, and a brick and Indiana limestone fa√ßade. In 2019 the building won the distinguished Stanford White Award for residential architecture. The ceremony was held at the Metropolitan Club on New Yorks 5th Avenue which was designed by Stanford White in 1894. This is the second time Robert A.M. Stern has won this prize.

Ecology Corals can survive in areas that are temperate or tropical. Shallow-water reefs are only found in areas 30¬∞ N to 30¬∞ S from the equator. While past depths of 50 meters tropical corals will not grow. The best temperature for coral reefs is 26‚Äì27 ¬∞C, although they can adapt to grow at temperatures of 13 ¬∞C or 18 ¬∞C. They need to live in areas where enough sunlight can come through the water so photosynthesis can take place. They get about 90% of nutrients from symbiont relationships such as the mutualism one they share with zooxanthellae. How large and strong a coral is, is dependent on the area it grew in. aside from their symbiont relationships they can also receive nutrients from the water itself.Coral Reefs - MarineBio.org. MarineBio Conservation Society. Retrieved from http://marinebio.org/oceans/coral-reefs/ Coral reefs are usually found in specific zones. These zones depict different habitats.

Coral reefs that are found surrounding islands were created when islands recede into the ocean.  Benefits  The benefits of these reefs include tourism, fisheries, and coastline protection. They give protection to the shorelines by absorbing wave energy and each year approximately six million tons of fish are taken out of the reefs. They also add biodiversity to oceans. They shelter various marine life and provide recreational activities for locals and tourists. They even provide potential medicines.Adey, W. H. (1977).

Threats However, many of them are now in danger. They are undergoing coral bleaching and other diseases. Coral bleaching occurs when the water becomes too warm. The increased water temperature triggers the coral to release its zooxanthellae. The loss of its symbiotic algae results in the discoloration of the coral tissue. They can loss zooxanthellae for a little while, however if more than a couple weeks pass then death occurs. They also have been found to have black band disease, white band disease, white plague disease. These diseases result of death of patches with few survivors if any.Coral Reef Bleaching & Disease in the U.S. Virgin Islands. (2017, January 26). Retrieved from https://science.nature.nps.gov/im/units/sfcn/monitor/marine/coralbleach.cfm These diseases aren't the only things affecting corals. Their population is declining because of coral mining, agricultural runoff, pollution, overfishing, and canal digging. They are also affected by temperature increase, pH change, excess sediments, rising of the sea level, and human activity. Many are trying to find ways to stop the decline of coral reefs or at the very least to find a way to slow down the decline. One recovery method includes coral aquaculture or coral farming/gardening. In this method, they grow the corals in a nursery and when they are old enough they replant them. They are also trying to provide substrates allowing corals to find a home. Substrates could be anything from car tires to oil rigs.

David Berlo created this model, which separated Shannon and Weaver's linear model into clear parts, in 1960. It has been expanded upon by other scholars. Berlo described factors affecting the individual components in the communication making the communication more efficient.  Background  Berlo's model of communication developed from Claude Shannon and Warren Weaver's mathematical model, which was first published in Bell System Technical Journal in 1948. The model was primary designed to improve the technical communication, but was later widely applied in different fields of communication. According to the Shannon-Weaver model, communication includes the following concepts: sender, encoder, channel, decoder, receiver and feedback. Furthermore, there is also concept of ‚Äúnoise‚Äù, which affects the communication process going through the channel and makes the message more difficult to understand by the receiver. Each of those concepts are defined as follows: Sender: the originator of message. Encoder: the transmitter which converts the message into signals (the way message is changed into signals, for example sound waves). Channel: the signal carrier or medium Decoder: the reception place of the signal which converts signals into message. Decoding is done by the receiver when he gets the message. Receiver: the recipient of the message from the sender. He usually gives feedback to the sender in order to make sure that the message was properly received. Noise and Feedback: the message, transferred through a channel, can be interrupted by external noise (for instance, conversation may be interrupted by thunder or crowd noise). Thus, the receiver can get an inaccurate message. This is why feedback from the receiver is important in case the message is not properly received. Furthermore, the noise can also affect the decoding of the message by the receiver. Practical Example of Shannon-Weaver model of communication: Thomson made call to his assistant ‚Äúcome here I want to see you.‚Äù During his call, noise appeared (transmission error) and his assistant received ‚ÄúI want‚Äù only. Again Assistant asked Thomson (feedback) ‚Äúwhat do you want Thomson?‚Äù # Sender: Thomson # Encoder: Telephone (Thomson) # Channel: Cable # Noise: Distraction in voice # Decoder: Telephone (Assistant) # Receiver: Assistant. Berlo's model was first published in 1960 in the book entitled El Proceso de la Comunicaci√≥n (The Process of Communication). The model includes four components to describe the communication process: sender, message, channel, and receiver, each of them affected by many factors. The model also focuses on encoding and decoding, which happens before the sender sends the message and before the receiver receives the message respectively. The main feature from the previous Shannon-Weaver model is the focus on the purpose and objectives of communication. Berlo's model also includes verbal and non-verbal communications, and it considers the emotional aspects of the message.  Components of the SMCR model  The SMCR model explains the various components in the communication process. The four basic components are sender (or source), message, channel and receiver. = S-Sender = Sender is the source of the message or the person who originates the message and sends it to the receiver. The sender transfers the information using the following factors: * Communication Skills (ability to read, write, speak, and listen) directly affect the communication process. An individual must possess excellent communication skills to make his communication effective and create an impact on the listeners. He should know how to speak and how pronounce a word correctly, where to take pauses and where to repeat, and so on. Similarly, if the receiver does not understand the message, the communication will be ineffective. * Attitudes towards the audience and subject The attitude of the sender and the receiver affects the message. The person's attitude towards the receiver and the environment changes the meaning and effect of the message. * Knowledge In this context, knowledge is not the level of education. It is the clarity of the information which the sender wants to convey to the receiver. Familiarity with the subject of the message makes it easier to understand. *Social Systems. Values, beliefs, religion, laws, rules and general understanding of society affect the sender's way of communicating the message. *Culture Culture refers to the cultural background of the sender or receiver. = M-Message = The step of creating a message (also called encoding) is the transformation of thoughts into words that sender sends to receiver. It can be in the form of voice, audio, text, video or other media. Any message comprises the following elements: * Content is the thing, which the whole message from beginning to end contains. * Elements are the non- verbal basics like language, gestures, body language etc. Content is accompanied by some elements. * Treatment is the way in which the message is transferred to the receiver. Treatment also effects the feedback of the receiver. * Structure of the message is the way it has been structured into various parts or arranged. It influences the effectiveness of the message. * Code is the form in which the message is sent. It might be in the form of language, text, video, etc. = C-Channel = Channel refers to the medium used to send the message. In mass communication technical machines might be used as a channel like telephone, internet, etc. But in general communication, the five senses of a human being is the channel for the communication flow and it affects the effectiveness of the channel: *Hearing - We receive the message through hearing. *Seeing - We perceive through seeing. We also get non-verbal messages by seeing. *Touching - Many of the non-verbal communication happens from touching like holding hands. *Smelling - We collect information from smelling. *Tasting - Taste also provides the information to be sent as a message. = R-Receiver = Receiver is the person who gets the message and tries to understand what the sender actually wants to convey and then responds accordingly. This is also called as decoding. Berlo's model believes that the effective communication can be achieved if the sender and the receiver are on the same level. The message might not have the same effect as intended if the receiver and sender are not similar. The receiver must also have a very good listening skill. Other factors are similar to that of the sender: * Communication skills * Attitudes * Knowledge * Social Systems * Culture  Criticisms of Berlo's SMCR Model  #There is no concept of feedback, so the effect is not considered. #There is no concept of noise or any kind of barriers in communication process. #It is a linear model of communication, there is no two way communication. #Both of the people must be similar (on same level for communication) according to all the factors mentioned above. Thus, the model is not practical in real life. #Main drawback of the model is that the model omits the usage of sixth sense as a channel which is actually a gift to the human beings (thinking, understanding, analyzing etc.). Berlo's model was further developed in 1973 by W. Schramm, who used a relational model instead of linear. Schramm also used the effects and effects analysis components from Berlo's model and suggested an interaction component in relation with active, selective and manipulative audience. He argued that the most dramatic change in communication theory in the last 40 years has been the abandonment of the idea of passive audience. Audience is a full partner in the process of communication.

In particular, those associated with this interpretation, such as Cora Diamond, Alice Crary, and James F. Conant, understand Wittgenstein to have avoided putting forth a \\"positive\\" metaphysical program, and understand him to be advocating philosophy as a form of \\"therapy.\\" Under this interpretation, Wittgenstein's program is dominated by the idea that philosophical problems are symptoms of illusions or \\"bewitchments by language,\\" and that attempts at a \\"narrow\\" solution to philosophical problems, that do not take into account larger questions of how the questioner conducts his life, interacts with other people, and uses language generally, are doomed to failure.  Overview  According to the introduction to the anthology The New Wittgenstein (): > Wittgenstein's primary aim in philosophy is ‚Äì to use a word he himself > employs in characterizing his later philosophical procedures ‚Äì a therapeutic > one. These papers have in common an understanding of Wittgenstein as > aspiring, not to advance metaphysical theories, but rather to help us work > ourselves out of confusions we become entangled in when philosophizing.Alice > Crary, \\"Introduction\\", The New Wittgenstein, Routledge, 2000, p. 1 While many philosophers have suggested variants of such ideas in readings of the work of late(r) Wittgenstein, namely the author of Philosophical Investigations, a notable aspect of the New Wittgenstein interpretation is a view that the work of early Wittgenstein, exemplified by the Tractatus Logico- Philosophicus, and the Investigations, are actually more deeply connected, and in less opposition, to each other than usually understood. This view is in direct conflict with the long-standing, if somewhat old-fashioned, interpretation of the Tractatus Logico-Philosophicus advocated by the logical positivists associated with the Vienna Circle. The therapeutic approach of the New Wittgenstein scholars is not without critics: Hans-Johann Glock argues that the \\"plain nonsense\\" reading of the Tractatus \\"is at odds with the external evidence, writings and conversations in which Wittgenstein states that the Tractatus is committed to the idea of ineffable insight\\". There is no unitary \\"New Wittgenstein\\" interpretation, and proponents differ deeply amongst themselves. Philosophers often associated with the interpretation include a number of influential philosophers, mostly associated with (although sometimes antagonistic to) the traditions of analytic philosophy, including Stanley Cavell, James F. Conant, John McDowell, Matthew B. Ostrow, Thomas Ricketts, Warren Goldfarb, Hilary Putnam, Stephen Mulhall, Alice Crary, and Cora Diamond. Explicit critics of the \\"New Wittgenstein\\" interpretation include P. M. S. Hacker, Ian Proops and Genia Sch√∂nbaumsfeld.  References   Further reading  * The New Wittgenstein, eds.

Guns salvaged from scrapped ships found a second life as coastal artillery. It is believed none were in service during World War II. History The 254 mm 45 caliber Pattern 1891 was the product of an agreement between the Imperial Russian Army and Navy to standardize calibers and ammunition during 1892. The gun originally envisioned in 1892 was a 45 caliber gun, with a shell, a muzzle velocity of and a brown powder propellant charge. In 1893 a new scaled up 45 caliber gun, weighing , with a Army shell, a muzzle velocity of and a smokeless powder propellant charge was specified. The weights and dimensions of the new gun were expected to be as close to the original specifications as possible to remain compatible with the ships they were intended to arm. This compromise in design objectives was to have negative effects on the finished product. Testing in 1895 found that the guns were too lightly built to be able to achieve the specified muzzle velocity even with lower power brown powder. Stress cracks were found and the barrels already produced had to be sent back to the factory to be strengthened and weight grew from to . The strengthened barrels were not ready until 1897 and after testing in 1899 a lower muzzle velocity of with reduced charges was accepted. Barrel life was estimated to be 250 rounds. The elevation range for the gun turrets of the Ushakov, Seniavin, Rostislav was -5¬∞ to +15¬∞. The elevation range for gun turrets of the Apraksin, Pobeda, Peresvet and Oslyabya was -5¬∞ to +30¬∞. The rate of fire was 120 seconds for Admiral Seniavin, 107 seconds for Ushakov, 93 seconds for Apraksin, but only 80 seconds for Peresvet, Oslyabya and Pobeda.  Construction  The 254 mm 45 caliber Pattern 1891 is believed to be constructed in the same manner as the larger 305mm 40 caliber Pattern 1895 guns of the same period. They were constructed of an A tube and three layers of reinforcing hoops and a jacket. By 1901 the Obukhov State Plant had delivered 30 guns of which 27 were installed on ships. In addition to the guns installed on ships some were employed as coastal artillery, including one battery of five guns at Port Arthur in 1904 and another in the Moon sound area in 1917.

He is also known by his Latin name, Adrianus Schrieckius.  Life  Adriaan van Schrieck was born in Bruges. After his earliest education in his native city, he attended the University of Paris to study philosophy and law. There he came into contact with famous people such as the French statesman and Chancellor of the Kingdom of Navarre, Henri de Mesmes, and Fran√ßois Pithou. Upon return to his homeland, he met Gerard Horne, count of Baucigny, and Nicolas de Montmorency, count of Estaires, by whose offices he was appointed bailiff of Cassel, Estaires, La Bass√©e and Loker. Later he was appointed councillor to the Archdukes Albert and Isabella. Finally, between 1609 and 1619 he was chancellor of the city of Ypres, where he spent his last years until he died of a stroke in December 1621. In his spare time he devoted himself to historical research, supported by a network of humanist scholars in the Habsburg Netherlands and the Dutch Republic that included Nicolaas Cromhout, Erycius Puteanus and Josse de Rycke (nl).

Port Gibbon began as a town surveyed in 1916 and whose name was derived from Captain J H Gibbon who was the ‚ÄúSenior Nautical Warden of the (South Australian) Marine Board.‚Äù Following lobbying of the state government by local residents, a jetty and an associated cutting in the adjoining cliff line were constructed in 1915 to replace a pair of chutes installed by private companies used to move bags of grain to the beach for loading onto small boats for conveyance to larger vessel anchored off the coastline. It operated as a commercial facility until 1950 and as of 2005, had been demolished with the exception of a section on the beach which is used as a shelter. Boundaries for the locality were created in 1998 and include both the Port Gibbon shack site and the Government Town of Port Gibbon. Port Gibbon consists of land on the coastline with Spencer Gulf which extends from a headland called Point Gibbon (formerly Point Price) in the south for a distance of about along the southern end of an unnamed bay whose northern end terminates at a headland called The Knob in the adjoining locality of Cowell. The coastline consists of a series of beaches backing onto a cliff line of ‚Äúred bluffs composed of Pleistocene alluvium‚Äù with heights up to . A settlement is located at the middle of the bay behind the cliff line. A road runs along the coast both south and north of the settlement. Land use in Port Gibbon is divided between primary industry, conservation and residential with the former being represented by ‚Äúbroadacre farming of cereals and livestock‚Äù, the second being represented by the zoning of the land adjoining the coastline with Spencer Gulf and the latter consisting of the settlement mentioned above.

Often contrasted with traditional single-library dead code elimination techniques common to minifiers, tree shaking eliminates unused functions from across the bundle by starting at the entry point and only including functions that may be executed . It is succinctly described as \\"live code inclusion\\".  History  Dead code elimination in dynamic languages is a much harder problem than in static languages. The idea of a \\"treeshaker\\" originated in LISPcomp.lang.lisp What's a treeshaker? in the 1990s. The idea is that all possible execution flows of a program can be represented as a tree of function calls, so that functions that are never called can be eliminated.

Florida voters chose ten electors, or representatives to the Electoral College, who voted for president and vice president. Background Excepting the 1928 election when fierce anti-Catholicism and Prohibitionism caused Herbert Hoover to defeat the wet Catholic Al Smith,Doherty, Herbert J. (junior); 'Florida and the Presidential Election of 1928'; The Florida Historical Quarterly, vol. 26, no. 2 (October 1947), pp. 174-186 Florida since the end of Reconstruction had been a classic Southern one-party state dominated by the Democratic Party. Disfranchisement of African-Americans and many poor whites had virtually eliminated the Republican Party ‚Äì only nine Republicans were ever elected to the state legislature between 1890 and 1950 ‚Äì while Democratic primaries were the sole competitive elections. Under the influence of Senator Claude Pepper, Florida abolished the poll tax in 1937, leading to steady increases in voter turnout during the following several elections;Poll Taxes: Hearings Before the United States Senate Committee on the Judiciary, Subcommittee on S. 1280, Seventy-Seventh Congress, Second Session, Parts 1-2, p. 289 however, there was no marked increase in African- American voting and Democratic hegemony remained unchallenged: FDR did not lose a single county in the state during his four elections.Menendez, Albert J.; The Geography of Presidential Elections in the United States, 1868-2004, p. 164-165 However, the following two elections would see a rapid trend away from Democratic hegemony towards Republican dominance in newer, more liberal South Florida. The regions shifting rapidly towards the GOP in these two elections lacked a history of slave-based plantation farming,See Doherty, Herbert J. (junior); 'Liberal and Conservative Politics in Florida'; The Journal of Politics, vol. 14, no. 3 (August 1952), pp. 403-417 and saw Eisenhower as more favourable to business than the Democratic Party.Strong, Donald S.; 'The Presidential Election in the South, 1952'; The Journal of Politics, vol. 17, no. 3, pp. 343-389 They also had seen a very large inflow of elderly migrants from the Northern states who were attracted by Florida's hot climate. Consequently, Eisenhower was able to carry the Sunshine State by a double-digit margin in 1952, in spite of losing badly in the \\"Hoovercrat\\" pineywoods and Black Belt of the Panhandle. Vote The 1956 election saw, in general, little change from trends established during the previous two elections, with the most significant exception being a marked (though temporary) trend towards Eisenhower amongst the small but increasing number of Negro voters in the state.Roady, Elston E.; 'The Expansion of Negro Suffrage in Florida', The Journal of Negro Education, vol. 26, no. 3, ('The Negro Voter in the South) (Summer, 1957), pp. 297-306 Eisenhower, aided further by increased Northerner migration, won against his rematch opponent Adlai Stevenson II by 163,474 votes or 14.54%.

This steamer operated from 1865 to 1880 for various owners, and was a considered a profitable vessel. The steamer was named for the daughter of businessman Edwin N Cook, Frances Mary \\"Fannie\\" Cooke (1837‚Äì1886), who married Thomas McFadden Patton in 1854. Edwin N. Cook was one of the principals of the People's Transportation Company. Construction Fannie Patton was built at Canemah, Oregon, a location on the east side of the Willamette River, a short distance upstream from Willamette Falls. The boat was built for the People‚Äôs Transportation Company and launched on August 25, 1865. The builder was John T. Thomas (1808-1882). Machinery The machinery for Fannie Patton came from the dismantled steamer Onward. The boat was driven by two horizontally-mounted single-cylinder steam engines. Each cylinder had a bore of 17 (or 16) inches, with a piston stroke of 60 inches. The engines generated 74 nominal horsepower. Design Fannie Patton was built to handle extreme low water conditions in the upper Willamette River, drawing only 15 inches of water when unloaded. Dimensions According to one source, Fannie Patton was feet long, measured over the hull only, and excluding the extension of the main deck over the stern, called the \\"fantail\\", on which the stern-wheel was mounted. The beam was feet and depth of hold was feet. According to another source, Fannie Patton‚Äôs dimensions were 131 feet length, 26.5 feet beam, and 4 feet depth of hold. According to one source, the tonnage of the vessel was 368 tons, which is a measure of size and not weight. The official steamboat registry number was 9615. According to another source, the vessel measured out at 298 tons. Ownership Fannie Patton was originally built and owned by the People‚Äôs Transportation Company. In 1874, Fannie Patton came under the control of the Oregon Steamship Company, a Ben Holladay concern, which had four other river boats, E.N. Cooke, Alice, Dayton, and Albany. As of February 1, 1874, and continuing for some time thereafter, all five of these boats operated out of Oregon City, with Fannie Patton running for Albany and intermediate points twice every week. John D. Biles was the Oregon City agent for all five steamers. In April 1877, Bernard \\"Barney\\" Goldsmith and J.N. Teal were reported to have sold their interest in the Willamette Transportation and Locks Company to Henry W. Corbett and Henry Failing. Fannie Patton was among a number steamboats and other assets that changed hands in the transaction. The Oregon Steam Navigation Company still kept its controlling interest in the Willamette Locks and Transportation concern. By 1879, Fannie Patton had come under the control of the Oregon Steam Navigation Company. In 1880 it was sold to the newly formed Oregon Railway and Navigation Company along with all the other assets of O.S.N. Operations As of December 15, 1866, Fannie Patton was operating on the upper Willamette River, running from Oregon City every Tuesday and Friday for Corvallis, Oregon. Fannie Patton was reported to have done a very profitable business on the upper Willamette River. On Monday, January 14, 1867, Fannie Patton was reported to have arrived in the boat basin at Oregon City \\"loaded to the guards\\", that is, so heavily laden that the protective timbers around the edges of the hull, called \\"guards\\" were at water level. On Thursday March 26, 1868, the Oregon City delegates to the Union Party convention in Salem returned to Oregon City on board the Fannie Patton. The convention had nominated David Logan for the Union Party‚Äôs nominee for Oregon‚Äôs seat in Congress, as well as other candidates, including the slate of electors for Ulysses S. Grant, the party‚Äôs nominee for the presidency. Upon return to Oregon City on the Fannie Patton, the conventioneers were greeted with cheers by a crowd on the wharf, as well as an escort from the Oregon City Brass Band. On December 30, 1868, J.H. Foster & Co. of Magnolia Mills in Albany, shipped out on Fannie Patton the largest single lot shipment of flour every sent out from Albany. The shipment consisted of 4,400 sacks of flour, the equivalent of 1,100 barrels. The flour mills were then reported to be running \\"night and day.\\". On Sunday, May 7, 1870, Fannie Patton was scheduled to carry an excursion from Albany to Corvallis for the benefit of the Albany fire company. The \\"magnificent steamer\\" Fannie Patton was scheduled to depart Albany at 7:30 a.m. and, returning, leave from Corvallis at 2:30 p.m. The Albany fire company was to take along their fire engine to make a demonstration in Corvallis. Tickets were 50 cents for adults, and free for children under 12, with the Albany Brass Band coming along. In late June 1870, a newspaper reported that Fannie Patton was to be brought into drydock for the purpose of lengthening the steamer‚Äôs hull, so that upon completion of the work, the boat would be 150 feet long. On Monday, February 17, 1873, Fannie Patton brought upriver to Corvallis thirty-eight cases of oil and other lighthouse supplies for the Yaquina Head Lighthouse, then under construction, and known as the Cape Foulweather Lighthouse. These supplies were transported overland to Elk City, Oregon, in Lincoln County on the Yaquina River, starting with one shipment on Thursday, February 20, 1873, hauled by drovers Hamlin and Stanford, and with the rest scheduled to be transported on Saturday, February 22, by Brown and Emrick. In late January 1876, Fannie Patton raced upriver against its competitor, the City of Salem from Salem to Albany. The engineer of Fannie Patton disputed claims that the City of Salem won the race, stating that the rival vessel had departed Salem twenty minutes early, but Fannie Patton still caught up, and would have passed the City of Salem but for the fact that the City of Salem locked sides with Fannie Patton. According to the engineer, City of Salem was only able to reach Albany first because Fannie Patton had had to stop at Independence, Oregon along the way. On Tuesday, November 28, 1876, Fannie Patton was the first steamboat of the winter navigation season to reach Lafayette, Oregon, on the Yamhill River, where its arrival was greeted enthusiastically by the residents of the town. Crew and incidents The first captain of Fannie Patton, in 1865, was George Jerome, who, according to one source, remained in charge for most of the boat‚Äôs career. For a few years George A. Pease and James D. Miller were in charge. The well-known river man Sherman V. Short (1856-1915) began his career as a deckhand on the Fannie Patton. On Wednesday, June 18, 1873, a crewman on Fannie Patton, Norman Warner, aged 16, was drowned when he had tried to draw water from the river using a bucket. The bucket pulled the boy into the water, and although he swam for a while, he eventually went under the water before the boat could be stopped or help rendered. The drowning was reported to have occurred near Champoeg, Oregon. The body was not recovered for two weeks, when it was found floating in the water at Butteville The steamer Governor Grover carried the body upriver to Salem. Lucien E. Pratt (1824-1899), a director of the People‚Äôs Transportation Company, was also a captain of Fannie Patton. In December 1873, Pratt was reported to have been placed in charge of Fannie Patton. A newspaper of the time described Pratt as \\"one of the oldest, as well as most popular steamboatmen on the Willamette.\\" Pratt was in command when, in 1874, the steamer Shoshone sank in the Willamette River and Fannie Patton rescued the Shoshone‚Äôs passengers. According to one steamboatman‚Äôs reminiscences 15 years later, Fannie Patton had been racing with Shoshone, during which Shoshone ran into a snag, causing the sinking. Early criticism In December 1866, Martin H. Abbott, editor of the State Rights Democrat, an Albany newspaper, and an opponent of the People‚Äôs Transportation Company, criticized the meal service on board Fanny Patton, stating, in part, as follows: Disposition In August 1880 the useful components of the steamer were stripped out and the vessel was converted to a barge. In March 1881, Col. William S. Button, of Roseburg, Oregon was supervising the removal of the machinery of the Fannie Patton so that it could be installed in the Lake Pend Oreille steamer Henry Villard.

He was a respected Hungarian legitimist politician during the two World Wars period. Life Coat of arms of the Hungarian noble family Farkas de Boldogfa Dr. Tibor Farkas de Boldogfa wearing his Hussar Captain uniform. Tibor J√≥zsef Imre Farkas de Boldogfa was born in Fels≈ëbagod in the county of Zala, Kingdom of Hungary, as the member of the ancient Roman Catholic Hungarian noble family Farkas de Boldogfa (in Hungarian: boldogfai Farkas csal√°d). His father was J√≥zsef Farkas de Boldogfa (1857‚Äì1951) landowner, politician, Member of the Hungarian Parliament, and his mother was Roz√°lia S√ºmeghy de Lov√°sz et Szentmargitha (1857‚Äì1924). His father J√≥zsef Farkas de Boldogfa was very active in the Hungarian politics since the 1890s, working along with count Alad√°r Zichy, and count N√°ndor Zichy within the newly created Hungarian Katolikus N√©pp√°rt (Catholic People's Party). Tibor Farkas de Boldogfa's paternal grandparents were Imre Farkas de Boldogfa (1811‚Äì1876), jurist, landowner, chief magistrate of the district of Zalaegerszeg (f≈ëszolgab√≠r√≥), and Alojzia Horv√°th (1831‚Äì1919). His maternal grandparents were Ferenc S√ºmeghy de Lov√°sz et Szentmargitha (1819‚Äì1869), jurist, landowner, politician, member of the Hungarian Parliament (who was a very good friend of Ferenc De√°k), and Magdolna S√©llyey de S√©llye (1822‚Äì1901). Tibor's younger brother was D√©nes Farkas de Boldogfa (1884‚Äì1973), landowner, politician, also member of the Hungarian Parliament. In the other hand Tibor's older brother was K√°lm√°n Farkas de Boldogfa (1880‚Äì1944), landowner, supreme chief magistrate of the district of Zalaszentgr√≥t (f≈ëszolgab√≠r√≥) in the county of Zala. Tibor Farkas de Boldogfa finished his general studies of school and high-school with particular teachers and in the Theresianum in Wien. Later he studied law in Wien and in Budapest, where he obtained his PhD degree and approved his lawyer exam in 1910. Then he traveled to England and studied law in the Cambridge University for 3 years. He taught law in the London School of Economics, and traveled actively around England studying the legal part of the industrial sector of that time as well the strikes policies.Balatonvid√©k, 1911 (15. √©vfolyam, 27‚Äì53. sz√°m) ‚Ä¢ 24 September 1911 / 39. sz√°m He moved back to Hungary in 1913, however in February 1914 the Hungarian Minister of Justice sent him back to England for researching further the strike law. The break of the First World War interrupted his researches, and went back to Hungary for serving as a Hussar Captain. He fought in the Italian and in the Russian front and after the War he was invested with the Signum Laudis medal and the Karl Troop Cross. After the World War I the Treaty of Trianon was implemented and Hungary lost the 70% of its lands. At the same time the King Charles IV of Hungary was not allowed to continue on the Hungarian throne and instead of him the admiral Mikl√≥s Horthy de Nagyb√°nya was elected as regent of the Kingdom. Tibor's father, who was over 63 years old for that time, retreated from the politics. Tibor Farkas became one of the most energetic defenders of the Monarchy and of the House of Habsburg in Zala county and in Hungary itself. Tibor had a close friendship with the Marquis Gy√∂rgy Pallavicini, the Count Antal Sigray and Count J√°nos Zichy, who were the most relevant legitimist politicians between the two World Wars in Hungary.K√©pvisel≈ëh√°zi napl√≥, 1931.

He strongly criticized the government of prime minister count Istv√°n Bethlen and the high cult to regent Mikl√≥s Horthy, considering that these demonstrations of honor and respect actually belonged to the Hungarian King, who was not sitting in the throne for that time. In 1925, at the Zala County general assemble session, the legitimate representative Tibor Farkas de Boldogfa disapproved the celebration of Horthy's birthday and name-day. Tibor emphasized that \\"all celebrations with splendor must be avoided when the country is a truncated kingdom without a king. If it was a holiday, it would just be a funeral.\\" Tibor Farkas also was against all Nazi politics, considering them anti-Christians, anti-monarchists and absolutely against all ethic and moral; his only goal was to reestablish continuity and see the Habsburgs in the Hungarian throne, and ensure the healthy development and growing of Hungarian agriculturists' way of life.Zalamegyei Ujs√°g, 1940. janu√°r-m√°rcius (23. √©vfolyam, 1‚Äì72. sz√°m)1940-03-26 / 68. sz√°m Tibor himself stated that: \\"I cannot imagine a kingdom without a king, nor can I imagine a golden peng≈ë without gold, nor can I imagine a national unity without the unity of souls\\". He married on 28 December 1929 Judith P√°lffy de P√°lfiszegh (1909‚Äì1993), daughter of the Hungarian nobleman L√°szl√≥ P√°lffy de P√°lfiszegh (1872‚Äì1946), jurist, landowner, and chief magistrate of the district of Pacsa in Zala county, and Ilona V√©ssey de V√©sse (1882‚Äì1956). P√°lffy Judith gave birth to two children: Elek and Erzs√©bet. These two children never had offspring.

Many theories have been put forward regarding his disappearance, with police surmising that he either killed himself or met with an accident, whereas his family maintains that a third party was involved. Despite repeated appeals for witnesses to come forward, Bohling's disappearance remains unsolved. Day of the disappearance On the morning of 2 March 2010, Bohling left the family home at West Ella to attend Bishop Burton College in Beverley, where he was studying bricklaying. It is not known if he actually attended college that day, but his Renault Clio was found away at Bempton Cliffs, near to a former Royal Air Force bunker at Bempton on the East Yorkshire coast. Bohling's car was noted by an RSPB worker at 5:00 pm on 2 March 2010 and was still there when the worker returned the next morning. It had a ticket on it that had been paid for a full day's parking having been bought at 11:30 am the morning of 2 March. Discovery and initial investigation In the initial searches of the area, the former RAF bunker was checked for a living human only, something that Bohling's family would go on to criticize. The Humberside Fire and Rescue Service (HF&RS;) undertook their first search using heat-sensitive cameras and torches, which would be ineffective if Bohling was dead at that point. Firefighters went back and, as a training exercise, conducted a more detailed search of the bunker in December 2012. When this search was conducted, Bohling's family was present at the briefing and stayed there for the full three hours that the HF&RS; were inside the bunker. This search cost the family ¬£1,200 for the bunker's concrete to be opened up as it had been sealed because of illegal use. Searches were also undertaken on land around the bunker and Bempton Cliffs, which is a known suicide spot. The Coastguard also helped by searching at sea and from the air. Bohling's family later started court proceedings regarding the thoroughness of the search, but the case was thrown out when the Recorder presiding over the case said that it was not up to the courts to determine whether or not an investigation had been 'handled well'. Searches were also carried out at the Bohling family's holiday home at Ravenscar in North Yorkshire. Two years after Bohling's disappearance, his family found his best pair of training shoes at the holiday home, which they are convinced he was wearing on the day he disappeared. Subsequent investigations Police were eager to determine what Bohling's movements were three days before his disappearance. He had left home and returned without informing anyone of where he had been or what he had done. Investigations later established that he had visited York, Bradford and Bridlington, but no indication of why or what he did there. It emerged that Bohling had logged on to an RAF Bempton website at 7:30am on the morning that he disappeared and had also looked at a webpage about Ravenscar. His father indicated that his son had been interested in the erotic and satanic artwork that had been left on the bunker walls by a cult in the 1970s, well after the bunker had been closed. Bohling had kept the information on the drawings on a USB stick which did not 'match that of his computer and those at his college.' The USB stick was not found during searches. Bohling's family insist that a third party was involved in the disappearance, pointing to the fact that his car had only of fuel in it, so it would be impossible to reach the Bempton area without refuelling. The family recreated the journeys he undertook after his car was refuelled on 1 March 2010, determining that the car ran out of fuel at Brandesburton, which is short of Bempton. Bohling's debit card had not been used and he had very little cash on him, which the family claims is indicative of someone else being with Bohling when he drove to Bempton. The family also maintain that a ¬£300,000 payment that his father was set to give him, so that he could start up a business, may also be behind his disappearance. Bohling has a speech and language disorder where, when people ask him if he is all right, he would reply 'yes' even if he wasn't. His family say that this makes him vulnerable. The police also think Bohling killed himself because of a tape they had found that he had recorded intimating suicide. The family were at pains to point out that this was a three-year-old tape that Bohling had recorded when he was 15 and anxious about his exams. Subsequent events Bohling's disappearance was featured as an appeal on the BBC programme Crimewatch in the summer of 2010. When the possessions that Bohling had taken with him on the day he disappeared were checked by his family, it was discovered that his brown, steel-capped boots were missing. Human feet were found on the banks of the Humber Estuary in August and September 2010. The second find was a human foot encased in a brown, steel-capped boot. After extensive investigation it was found that the feet were not connected to Bohling's disappearance. Bohling's father was subsequently convicted of possessing child pornography when police searched the computer he had given to them in the unsuccessful hope it might reveal clues to his son's whereabouts.

Constructed in 1936, it is considered the \\"centerpiece\\" of the university's main Rose Hill campus, and is the home to the university's Graduate School of Arts and Sciences. History After the establishment of Fordham University in 1841, the construction of Keating began in the 1930s on a proposed budget of $65,500 and was named after Joseph Keating, S.J., the university treasurer from 1910 to 1948. The architecture, characterized as Collegiate Gothic, was influenced by Gasson Hall at Boston College. The tower of Keating hall was a feature insisted upon by Father Hogan, the university's president, at a proposed additional cost of $25,000 (the tower ultimately cost $343,000 to erect). The construction ultimately cost $1.3 million, two to three times the original estimated cost. The building's original intention when constructed under the supervision of Father Hogan, was to be the home for the Graduate School of Arts and Sciences, which it still serves today. Upon its completion, the university hosted its first commencement ceremony on Edwards Parade, the grassy field in front of Keating Hall, on June 10, 1936. The university's commencement ceremonies have taken place on the front steps of Keating ever since. In addition to housing the Graduate School of Arts and Sciences offices, the building also houses three auditoriums, as well as the Blue Chapel on the third floor. During World War II, the Keating Hall was designated by the city of New York as an air raid shelter, and its tower was used as the official lookout post for the northeast Bronx. Until 1960 upon the completion of the McGinley Center, Keating Hall's basement was home to the university cafeteria. In the 1990s during the construction of the William D. Walsh Family Library, the basement space of Keating Hall was used to store 300,000 books. On April 14, 2019, Fordham University senior Sydney Monfries fell to her death from the Keating Hall clocktower. Architectural features The front steps leading up to the fa√ßade of Keating Hall are engraved with the names of the presidents of nations that have received degrees from Fordham, called the \\"Terrace of the Presidents.\\" In popular culture Keating Hall has appeared in several films: The basement of Keating was also used as a filming location for William Friedkin's The Exorcist (1973) and Ron Howard's A Beautiful Mind (2001). The spacious auditoriums in Keating have also been used in several films: The first-floor auditorium was used as a filming location for a scene in Wall Street 2: Money Never Sleeps (2010) and Fair Game (2010), while the building's third-floor auditorium appeared in a scene from Quiz Show (1994). Additionally, a scene from The Adjustment Bureau (2011) was shot on the exterior steps of Keating Hall, and the exterior of the building can be seen in Love Story (1970).

God is the \\"sovereign Lord of all by an incontestable right [as the] creator . . . owner and possessor of heaven and earth.\\" Sovereignty is an Attribute of God based upon the premise that God as the creator of heaven and earth has absolute right and full authority to do or allow whatever He desires. The protestant position is described in the Westminster Confession of Faith, which states, \\"God, from all eternity, did, by the most wise and holy counsel of His own will, freely, and unchangeably ordain whatever comes to pass.\\". The Catholic position is similar, \\"And so we see the Holy Spirit, the principal author of Sacred Scripture, often attributing actions to God without mentioning any secondary causes. This is not a ‚Äúprimitive mode of speech‚Äù, but a profound way of recalling God‚Äôs primacy and absolute Lordship over history and the world.\\" Easton's Bible Dictionary defines God's Sovereignty as His \\"absolute right to do all things according to his own good pleasure.\\" Nave's Topical Bible lists well over 100 verses in the Christian Bible under the entry \\"Sovereign\\". Limitations Natural and self-imposed limitations to the Sovereignty of God have been a source of debate. God may have the power to act, but choose not to act. \\"Ultimately God is in complete control of all things, though He may choose to let certain events happen according to natural laws which He has ordained.\\" \\"God has created a world in which freedom is a real possibility. His permissive will provides for human freedom and the laws of nature.\\" \\"However, even though God is all powerful, He sovereignly chose to self-limit His power by delegating authority to mankind in the Garden of Eden. 'Then God said, Let Us make man in Our image, according to Our likeness; let them have dominion . . .'\\" =Sovereignty and Free Will= The question whether God's sovereignty is consistent with meaningful human decisions which are free from compulsion is a significant theological question in Christianity.K√ÑRKK√ÑINEN, V. (2017). Human Action within the Sovereignty of God: Christian Perspectives. In MOSHER L. & MARSHALL D. (Eds.), God's Creativity and Human Action: Christian and Muslim Perspectives (pp. 139-148). Washington, DC: Georgetown University Press. Retrieved January 14, 2020, from www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt1trkk09.14 The debate was first clearly expressed by Augustine in the 4th century. The debate continues today. \\"We know that humans have a free will, but we also know that God is sovereign. How those two truths relate to each other is hard for us to understand.\\" \\"The doctrine of divine sovereignty raises the problem of the relation of God‚Äôs sovereign action to human activity. If God is in complete control, how can we be truly free in the decisions we make? In other words, for free will to be meaningful, there must be some things that lie outside of God‚Äôs sovereign control‚Äîe.g., the contingency of human choice.\\" The relationship between free will and the Sovereignty of God is relevant not only in the Calvinist-Arminian debate (see below #Implications_on_Calvinist- Arminian_Debate) but also in the philosophical Theodicy. If God is perfect and good, how could He create beings that are evil? If God did not embed free will into humanity, it is difficult to reconcile God‚Äôs omnipotence and God's omnibenevolence with a seemingly imperfect creation that includes evil. As stated by Alvin Plantinga, Theodicy is the \\"answer to the question of why God permits evil\\"., Plantinga argues that human free will explains the existence of evil without threatening the existence of an omnipotent and omnibenevolent God. Plantinga's argument is consistent with Augustinian theology which teaches that ‚ÄúThe entry of evil into the world is generally explained as punishment for sin and its continued presence due to humans' misuse of free will. God's goodness and benevolence, according to the Augustinian theodicy, remain perfect and without responsibility for evil or suffering.‚ÄùAugustinian theology Plantinga relies on the free will of humanity to take ultimate responsibility for evil rather than attributing all actions of all creatures, whether, good or evil, to God. The sin of Satan, the sin of Adam and the sin of David each represent a permissible consequence of God's sovereign decision to create humanity with free will, rather than the directive of a sovereign God for which the sovereign God is sovereignly and directly responsible. (See general discussion of Theodicy). When Adam chose to disobey God, God did not excuse Adam, claiming that God was the source of the disobedience. Rather God held Adam responsible for Adam‚Äôs exercise of his will. The division stems from the question whether free will is compatible with an omniscient God who knows everything, past, present and future? If God knows the future, does that foreknowledge preclude human free will because it would be impossible to freely make a choice contrary to the future God foreknows? One position is that \\"Those who argue in this manner make the mistake of thinking that because God possesses knowledge about a specific matter, then he has influenced it. That does not follow at all. Just because God can foresee which choice you will make, it does not mean you couldn‚Äôt still freely choose the other option.\\" =Sovereignty and Salvation= This difficulty which arises when considering a sovereign God's knowledge of future events has been most divisive when considering the source of human salvation. Did God make a decision before creation to save individuals based upon His knowledge of their future actions or decision? If God in the distant past Elected some to salvation, did He do so based upon His knowledge of their future actions or decisions? Or did He decide to Elect individuals based upon partial knowledge, ignoring His knowledge of their future actions and decisions? Matthew Henry writes in reference to 1 Peter 2:19, which states that election was made \\"according to the foreknowledge of God\\", that \\"[t]his sort of foreknowledge is in God, who at one commanding view sees all things that ever were, or are, or ever will be\\". And if God did elect persons for eternal life according to this foreknowledge, the question which arises is what foreknowledge of the future was of primary significance to God? Was it His knowledge of how a person would respond to the gospel of His son? Calvinism answers these questions with the doctrine of Unconditional election, which contends that God did not consider His knowledge of future events when He decided who would or would not be given eternal life because doing so would compromise His sovereignty. Arminianism answers these questions differently, believing it foolish to conclude that God ignored what He knew and decided whom to Elect for eternal life based upon only partial knowledge, rather than His full knowledge of past, present and future. In the manner that Jesus was ordained as the savior \\"before the foundation of the world\\" in response to God's knowledge of future sin, Arminianism contends that God Elected those for eternal life whom God knew would repent, believe and endure. =Sovereignty and Via Negativa= Moses ben Maimon, a Jewish philosopher of the 12th Century, demonstrates the problem of describing God with positive attributes, which would include the attribute of omnipotence or the statement that \\"God is sovereign.\\" Rather, \\"the negative attributes of God are the true attributes\\". Maimonides argues that any statement of a positive attribute implies polytheism and is inadequate. But negative attributes do not create any incorrect notion or deficiency. \\"If Maimonides is right, there can be no plurality of faculties, moral dispositions, or essential attributes in God. Even to say that God is all- knowing, all-powerful, and all-good is to introduce plurality, if one means thereby that these qualities are separate attributes whatever in reference to God. . . [but to] say that God does not lack power or possess it in a way comparable to other things is to say that God‚Äôs power is beyond our comprehension.\\" Relationship to Prayer If God is sovereign, and if sovereignty requires that God has determined all events, can prayer be effective and result in any change? Author A.W. Pink argued that prayer does not alter the course of events. \\"Prayer is not the requesting of God to alter His purpose or for Him to form a new one.\\" In this text Pink also argues that God did not love sinners and had deliberately created \\"unto damnation\\" those who would not accept Christ. According to this view, praying for the salvation of those God actively and deliberately chose for damnation will not change their destiny. This conclusion logically flows from the premise, if it is true, that God's sovereignty necessitates that God, rather than humans, determine salvation. Indeed, Pink directly states that \\"He [God] ordained that they should be damned. This view is sometimes referred to as \\"Double Predestination\\", which John Calvin embraced, believing that God actively chosen some people for damnation. \\"Those therefore whom God passes by [does not elect] He reprobates, and that for no other cause than He is pleased to exclude them.\\" Contrary to the view embraced by John Calvin and A.W. Pink, the more common view is that prayer includes petitions to God for favor and Supplication, expecting that God will hear and grant the petitions presented through prayer. Such prayers include petitions for salvation. As Charles Spurgeon stated: ‚ÄúIf sinners be damned, at least let them leap to Hell over our dead bodies. And if they perish, let them perish with our arms wrapped about their knees, imploring them to stay. If Hell must be filled, let it be filled in the teeth of our exertions, and let not one go unwarned and unprayed for.‚Äù Implications in Protestant debate In the Protestant tradition, the Five Points of Calvinism, which are the focal point of the Calvinist-Arminian debate have their foundation in the Sovereignty of God and its perceived incompatibility with free will. The existence or scope of human free will has a profound impact in this debate. \\"Calvinists say that humans never have that ability in spiritual matters (and possibly in any matters) . . . To the Arminian [such a limited] free will is no free will at all. To the Calvinist . . . [Arminian] free will is a myth; it simply cannot exist.\\" =Calvinist View= Calvinism argues that God cannot provide humanity with free will; to do so is to compromise the Sovereignty of God, at least in the exercise of faith or salvation. ‚ÄúWe say that he [man] is free, but his freedom is within limits, and those limits are defined by the sovereignty of God.‚Äù ‚ÄúOnly God has free will in the sense of ultimate self-determination.‚Äù The sovereignty of God was \\"Calvin‚Äôs most central doctrine. It means that nothing is left to chance or human free will.\\" \\"The heart of Calvinism is not the doctrine of predestination, or, for that matter, any one of the other Five Points of Calvinism. The central truth proclaimed by Calvinism, Calvinism that is faithful to its heritage, is the absolute sovereignty of God.\\" Calvin expressly taught that it is God's sovereign decision to determine whether an individual is saved or damned. He writes \\"By predestination we mean the eternal decree of God, by which he determined with himself whatever he wished to happen with regard to every man. All are not created on equal terms, but some are preordained to eternal life, others to eternal damnation; and, accordingly, as each has been created for one or other of these ends, we say that he has been predestinated to life or to death.\\" R.C. Sproul, an influential Calvinist, expresses God's sovereignty over salvation as follows: \\"If God has decided our destinies from all eternity, that strongly suggests that our free choices are but charades, empty exercises in predetermined playacting. It is as though God wrote the script for us in concrete and we are merely carrying out his scenario.\\" Similarly, Swiss reformer Huldrych Zwingli concludes that God is the \\"author, mover and instigator\\" of human sin. =Arminian View= The term ‚Äúpermissive free will‚Äù is sometimes used to distinguish between the direct actions of God and the free actions of humans who are granted by a sovereign God some degree of free will. Calvinism teaches that permissive free will can extend to certain decision, but not to salvation. As explained below, Arminianism rejects this limitation or any notion that God is limited in the free will which He can offer to humanity. Arminianism teaches Prevenient Grace as grace that \\"enables sinful man to believe.\\" Prevenient Grace Such God-given grace explains the ability of humans to respond to God's calls to repent and believe. As stated in 2 Peter 3:9, \\"The Lord is not slack concerning His promise, as some count slackness, but is longsuffering toward us, not willing that any should perish but that all should come to repentance. To Arminianism this verse and many similar verses evidence that the power to repent is within human free will as ordained by the sovereign God. Rather than accepting that \\"all\\" may repent, Calvinism teaches Limited Atonement to explain that 2 Peter 3:9 and similar salvation oriented verses, such as John 3:16, do not apply to \\"all\\" but only to those who God elected for salvation who must repent due to the Irresistibility of God's grace as directed to the elect. To Calvinists, the decision to believe and repent is a decision which must be determined by God if God is sovereign. To Arminians, the decision to believe and repent is a decision which a sovereign God granted to humanity so that ‚Äúall‚Äù is not limited to a limited group (as Limited Atonement teaches). The Arminian view finds its supported by the simple interpretation of many verses including the following: # Jesus promises that whosoever believes in him has everlasting life. # Peter proclaims that everyone who calls upon Jesus will be saved. # God calls all people everywhere to repent. , # God desires all people to be saved. :These verses are often cited in opposition to Calvinism in support of the Arminianism belief that the sovereign God gave humanity the free will to believe and repent. The Calvinist doctrine of Limited Atonement is a logical necessity for those that believe permissive free will excludes the power of humanity to believe in Jesus and repent. Calvinist teachings deny that this power to believe is available to all, considering it inconsistent with the sovereignty of God. Rather than believing God can provide a person with grace that \\"enables sinful man to believe\\", Calvinism concludes that only those who God has first Regenerated may believe, and such must believe because it is God's Unconditional election rested solely in God's sovereign will which causes them to believe in response to God's Irresistible Grace. Each of these Calvinist doctrines are premised upon the rejection of Prevenient Grace and the conclusion that Prevenient Grace is inconsistent with the sovereignty of God.

He led the rebel forces which overran and sacked Plered, Mataram's capital in June 1677. In September 1679, his forces were defeated by the combined Dutch, Javanese, and Bugis forces under Sindu Reja and Jan Albert Sloot in a battle in Mlambang, near Pajang. Kajoran surrendered but was executed under Sloot's orders.  Ancestors and family  is a settlement south of present-day Klaten, Central Java. Raden is a title of Javanese nobility, and the title \\"Raden Kajoran\\" signified his status as the head of the ruling family there. According to the Javanese tradition, Sayyid Kalkum, Raden Kajoran's great-grandfather was the first of his family to settle in Kajoran. He was a younger brother of a holy man known as Sunan Tembayat, who was one of the first to introduce Islam to inland Central Java. Kalkum came into control of extensive territories in Kajoran in the early 16th century. The family was intermarried with the royal families of Pajang and Mataram. By the time of Raden Kajoran, the family had become a powerful and influential family in Mataram, due to both their Islamic authority and royal marriage ties.  Biography  = Before Trunajaya's rebellion = King Amangkurat I's reign saw the execution of many noblemen for suspicion of treachery, including the entire family of Pangeran Pekik (the former ruling dynasty of Surabaya) in 1659 and many members of the royal family at court during the 1660s. This brutality alarmed Kajoran, who began to sympathize with the king's rivals. When Trunajaya, a Madurese nobleman who were forced to live at court after his country's annexation, fled the court, Raden Kajoran took him in Kajoran as prot√©g√© and let him marry one of his daughters. He also encouraged a friendship between Trunajaya and the Crown Prince of Mataram (Pangeran Adipati Anom, future Amangkurat II) who also had a grudge against his father the king. = Role in Trunajaya rebellion = The Trunajaya rebellion began in 1674 as Trunajaya's forces conducted raids against the cities under Mataram control. Kajoran joined the rebellion since at least 1676 after Trunajaya's victory at Gegodog in October. His knowledge of the internal Mataram affairs, as well as his reputation as a religious leader, provided support to Trunajaya and his Madurese warlords who were foreign to central Java. He joined rebel troops marching towards Mataram's capital ‚Äì led by Trunajaya's captains ‚Äì at Taji, east of the capital. These troops attacked the capital district (the district of Mataram) in January or February 1677 but was repulsed by loyalist troops led by the royal princes. The defeated forces retreated to Surabaya, where Raden Kajoran joined his son-in-law Trunajaya. Subsequently, Mataram forces burned his district of Kajoran. In April 1677, Kajoran started another attack on Mataram. His forces overran and sacked the capital Plered around 28 June 1677, marking the high point of the rebellion. There was talk that the western part of Trunajaya's realm (roughly today's Central Java), were to be declared a kingdom ruled by Kajoran, but he preferred to take the position of a spiritual lord rather than a king. Also, despite the proposal of dual rule, Trunajaya took all the treasuries captured from Plered for himself and denied it from Kajoran. The rebels later withdrew from the now-ruined capital and Raden Kajoran moved to Totombo, in the hills south of Trunajaya's capital at Kediri, East Java, at Trunajaya's summon. This move ‚Äì leaving central Java to be closer to Trunajaya ‚Äì and his lack of heir contributed to the decline of his prestige and his followers' loyalty. However, his followers were still active in central Java, including the coastal districts (e.g. Jepara) and inland (in Pajang, bordering the capital district). They mounted major offensives on the northern coast (also known as the Pasisir) in November 1677 and June‚ÄìJuly 1678. These activities frustrated both Mataram and its ally the Dutch East India Company (known by its Dutch acronym VOC), who also tried to establish a monopoly in the Pasisir. In November 1678, Kediri was taken by VOC-Mataram troops and Kajoran returned to Central Java and established his new base at Mlambang (in today's Gunungkidul Regency, Yogyakarta Special Region). He allied himself with Raja Namrud or Nimrod, a Makassarese warlord who was active in central Java, and won some victories there between April and August 1679. However, on 14 September, a combined VOC-Mataram forces under Dutch Captain Jan Albert Sloot and Mataram leader Sindureja marched on his fortress at Mlambang. The attack ended in VOC-Mataram victory, Kajoran surrendered but Sloot ordered his execution. Due to his reputation, no Javanese leader wanted to kill him, so Sloot ordered a Buginese to do it.  After his death  Kajoran's followers continued the resistance against Mataram after his death and Trunajaya's death in January 1680. They include members and relatives of the Kajoran family, religious men from Tembayat, and men from the Gunungkidul district. Their leaders include Kartapada, Kartanadi and Kartanagara.  Personal characters and other names  Raden Kajoran was also known as Panembahan Rama and reputed to be skilled in shakti (cosmic power) and tapa (ascetism). Javanese chronicles called him \\"Raden Kajoran Ambalik\\" (Raden Kajoran the Deserter) due to his role in Trunajaya rebellion, and Dutch admiral Cornelis Speelman (one of his opponents during the war) called him \\"that prophet of the devil\\". Speelman also wrote that he taught his followers that \\"God and his Prophet will never bless the Javanese land again, as long as the kaffers [unbelievers, i.e. the Dutch] will be accepted there.\\"  References  = Citations = = Bibliography =  1679 deaths People from Central Java People executed by the Dutch East India Company 17th-century executions by the Netherlands ","title":"Raden Kajoran"},{"id":"53733987","text":"Dutton Group is an Australian-based automotive company headquartered in Richmond, Victoria. The Group specializes in the automotive wholesale and the pre-owned automotive market. Dutton group consists of three major companies, Dutton Garage, Dutton Garage Wholesale, and Sell Your Car Fast. They were previously the parent company of True Value Solar before it was sold in 2011. Dutton Group is the largest car wholesaler in Australia, moving over 12,000 units in 2014. It also holds the largest classic and rare car collections in the southern hemisphere. History =Early history= In 1999, George Nakas and Gavin Fernandez established a private investment firm in Australia, under the name, Morgan Sachs Group. It later changed its name to the Dutton Group. During the next few years, the company owned a diverse range of business across the automotive, renewable energy and real estate markets. It established Melbourne Prestige, focusing on the wholesale market and became Australia's first national automotive dealer. From 2008 onwards, the group's operations grew rapidly. This began with the acquisition of the well-known Australian motoring-brand, James Lane Motors. The group reported wholesale sales of 5,000 for 2009, making it the leading automotive wholesale trader in Australia. During the same year, the company diversified its portfolio by moving into the renewable energy market, becoming a major shareholder in True Value Solar. Over the next couple of years, True Value Solar experienced rapid growth, becoming the largest solar provider in residential and commercial projects in Australia. True Value Solar completed over 60,000 installations, staff numbers grew to 240 by the end of 2011 and it had an estimated turnover of $200 million. In March 2011, the German-based company, M+W purchased a 65 percent stake in True Value Solar. It was reported in the media that the figure was ‚Äúnorth of $100 million.‚Äù The remaining 35 percent was then acquired by M+W a year later in March 2013. =LED and Automotive= In 2012, Dutton Group entered into its second energy venture, acquiring shares in LEDified Lighting Corporation. During the same year, the lighting firm became the major sponsor of St Kilda football club. The Group evolved its automotive operations by the end of 2012, adding a luxury automotive subsidiary to the portfolio, acquiring Dutton Sporting Cars, which became a wholly owned subsidiary of the Group. Dutton Sporting Cars would later operate under the name Dutton Garage. Dutton Garage became the luxury arm of the Group. With its headquarters in Melbourne, Dutton Garage specializes in the sale of luxury and classic sports cars to the retail markets worldwide. Dutton Motorsport, a division of Dutton Garage was also acquired through the purchase and added to the group portfolio. In 2013, the LEDified Lighting Corporation subsidiary reported revenues of $20 million. By July 2013, the Group continued its expansion within the Australian automotive space, establishing Sell Your Car Fast. The introduction of Sell Your Car Fast to the Australian market provided consumers with an alternative channel to sell their cars directly to the business. At the end of 2013, Dutton Group sold their shares in LEDified Lighting Corporation, which was described in the media as a \\"multi-million dollar deal\\". During 2013, the Group consolidated its group structure, the Group name was changed to Dutton Group, and the automotive division was restructured so that four major brand groups with differentiated profiles would be formed. Dutton Garage Wholesale focused on the automotive wholesale trade, Dutton Garage would become the retail arm of the business, focusing on the sale of the luxury and classic vehicles to the retail market. Dutton Motorsport focused on the Group‚Äôs global motorsport activities, as well the restoration and maintenance of specialized classic and motorsport vehicles. Sell Your Car Fast focused on the acquisition of passenger vehicles from the general consumer. In 2014, the Group‚Äôs automotive division generated $275 million in revenue. On 5 December 2014, Dutton Garage opened a new purpose-built retail showroom, located in Richmond, Victoria, Australia. The building cost $30 million and was designed by Karl Fender. It now houses some of the most collectible classic and modern sports cars in the world. Dutton Garage also holds a private collection of some of the rarest motorsport and classic cars in the world, including the 1974 Porsche 911 RSR IROC, Mark Donohue champion winning car, the Formula 2 Cooper T75-BRM piloted by Jackie Stewart in the 1960s, and the Blaupunkt Porsche 962C. In mid-2015, Dutton Garage made its first step expanding outside of its Australian operations, signing a joint- venture partnership with UK based classic car dealer, DD Classics. The partnership reflected the company‚Äôs international growth strategy and expanded its reach across Europe and Australasia. In FY16, the group reported $427.7 million in revenue. Ownership The Dutton Group is co-owned by Gavin Fernandez, George Nakas, and Champ Private Equity.

He participated in the successful invasion of East Java and the subsequent rebel victory at Battle of Gegodog (1676). He later broke out with Trunajaya, and built a stronghold in Kakaper, East Java. Dutch East India Company (VOC) and Bugis forces took Kakaper in October 1679, but Galesong escaped and rejoined Trunajaya. He died on 21 November 1679, either by illness or murdered by Trunajaya, before the rebellion ended.  Biography  = Early adventures = Makassar was the principal trading center east of Java. After the 1669 VOC victory over the Gowa Sultanate in the Makassar War, bands of Makassarese fighters fled Makassar, rejecting the terms of the Treaty of Bongaya imposed by the Dutch, and seeking their fortune elsewhere. Karaeng Galesong was a son of Sultan Hasanuddin, the defeated Sultan of Makassar who died in 1670. In early 1670s, Galesong led a band of Makassarese fighters and pirates to the Lesser Sunda Islands, and engaged in piracy there, especially in Sumbawa. On June 1673 he went to Bali and bought land to settle there. In either late 1674 or early 1675 Galesong moved to East Java and settled in Demung in the eastern salient of Java. = Alliance with Trunajaya = In 1675, Karaeng Galesong entered into an alliance with the Madurese prince Raden Trunajaya who was in rebellion against the Mataram Sultanate. The alliance was cemented by a marriage arrangement between Galesong and a niece of Trunajaya. As a condition for the marriage, Trunajaya asked Galesong and his followers to join a campaign against Mataram cities of Gresik and Surabaya in the northeastern coast of Java. By the end of 1675 both cities fell to the forces of Trunajaya and Galesong along with the areas between them, including the major port towns of Pasuruan, Pajarakan, Gombang and Gerongan. Having fulfilled the marriage condition, Karaeng Galesong married Trunajaya's niece in fall 1675. Galesong and his Makassarese followers hoped that by helping Trunajaya, in time Trunajaya would help them retake South Sulawesi from VOC and its Bugis allies. In May‚ÄìJuly 1676, Mataram and its ally the Dutch East India Company (VOC) counter-attacked and retook most of the rebel-held cities after hard fighting. Galesong fled from Panarukan in East Java to Trunajaya's base in Madura. In August or September, Trunajaya took the title Panembahan Maduretna, and granted the title Adipati Anom (a Javanese title usually given to the crown prince) to Galesong. Madura became a safe haven for the Makassarese to raid the nearby coasts and islands. In September 1676, Galesong and Trunajaya invaded East Java again with an army of 9,000. This army defeated a much larger army under Mataram's crown prince at the Battle of Gegodog in October. This victory was followed by an offensive along the north coast of Java, resulting in the rebel army taking of most Mataram cities there. = Later campaigns and death = However, at the same time as the rebel victories, Galesong quarreled with Trunajaya. By late 1676 and January 1677 this evolved into an open conflict between the followers of the two. Galesong then settled in Pasuruan and did not help Trunajaya when his capital Surabaya was taken by the VOC in May 1677. Nevertheless, he refused to submit to Mataram or the VOC's authority. During the subsequent VOC-Mataram campaign against Trunajaya's new capital in Kediri, Galesong's allegiance wavered. Initially, he sided with Mataram and unsuccessfully attacked Kediri from Pasuruan. However, he and 800 of his followers later broke with the VOC, established a fortification in Kakaper (or Keper) in East Java and pillaged the surrounding area. In October 1679, a combined VOC-Bugis troops took this stronghold after a five-week siege. Galesong escaped with 60 men and rejoined Trunajaya. At this point he was very ill and died on 21 November 1679, either due to his illness or murdered by Trunajaya for his treachery.  Aftermath  Before his death he designated his son Karaeng Mamampang as heir to the leadership of the Makassarese band. As per his father's wishes, Mamampang, 16 or 17 years old at the time, asked his men to capitulate and return to Makassar via Surabaya. 120 Makassarese heeded this request, but the rest joined Trunajaya's men and continued the rebellion. However, on 15 December, as Trunajaya was cornered in the mountains of East Java, 2,500 Makassarese choose to surrender to the VOC rather than be destroyed. Trunajaya himself was finally captured on 25 December, with 30 or less Makassarese still with him.  Legacy  He was buried in Ngantang, now part of Malang Regency, East Java, Indonesia. The grave was in the style of a Makassarese commoner instead of a nobleman. It was preserved, became a cultural site, and today attracts visitors and pilgrims. The epitaph, which was added later, reads in Arabic \\"Here lies a fighter in the way of God\\". On 2013, Indonesian former Vice President Jusuf Kalla ‚Äì who like Galesong is from South Sulawesi ‚Äì visited the grave along with other officials, and said that Galesong had shown that \\"people of South Sulawesi could be a fighter and be successful anywhere\\".

It is written in C++. The engine is an open source project at SourceForge.ChatScript, SourceForge and GitHub., GitHub ChatScript was written by Bruce Wilcox and originally released in 2011, after Suzette (written in ChatScript) won the 2010 Loebner Prize, fooling one of four human judges.Prizewinning chatbot steers the conversation, New Scientist, 27 October 2010  Features  In general ChatScript aims to author extremely concisely, since the limiting scalability of hand-authored chatbots is how much/fast one can write the script. Because ChatScript is designed for interactive conversation, it automatically maintains user state across volleys. A volley is any number of sentences the user inputs at once and the chatbots response. The basic element of scripting is the rule. A rule consists of a type, a label (optional), a pattern, and an output. There are three types of rules. Gambits are something a chatbot might say when it has control of the conversation. Rejoinders are rules that respond to a user remark tied to what the chatbot just said. Responders are rules that respond to arbitrary user input which is not necessarily tied to what the chatbot just said. Patterns describe conditions under which a rule may fire. Patterns range from extremely simplistic to deeply complex (analogous to Regex but aimed for NL). Heavy use is typically made of concept sets, which are lists of words sharing a meaning. ChatScript contains some 2000 predefined concepts and scripters can easily write their own. Output of a rule intermixes literal words to be sent to the user along with common C-style programming code. Rules are bundled into collections called topics. Topics can have keywords, which allows the engine to automatically search the topic for relevant rules based on user input.  Example code  Topic: ~food( ~fruit fruit food eat) t: What is your favorite food? a: (~fruit) I like fruit also. a: (~metal) I prefer listening to heavy metal music rather than eating it. ?: WHATMUSIC ( << what music you ~like >>) I prefer rock music. s: ( I * ~like * _~music_types) ^if (_0  country) {I don't like country.} else {So do I.} Words starting with ~ are concept sets. For example, ~fruit is the list of all known fruits. The simple pattern (~fruit) reacts if any fruit is mentioned immediately after the chatbot asks for favorite food. The slightly more complex pattern for the rule labelled WHATMUSIC requires all the words what, music, you and any word or phrase meaning to like, but they may occur in any order. Responders come in three types. ?: rules react to user questions. s: rules react to user statements. u: rules react to either. ChatScript code supports standard if-else, loops, user- defined functions and calls, and variable assignment and access.  Data  Some data in ChatScript is transient, meaning it will disappear at the end of the current volley. Other data is permanent, lasting forever until explicitly killed off. Data can be local to a single user or shared across all users at the bot level. Internally all data is represented as text and is automatically converted to a numeric form as needed. = Variables = User variables come in several kinds. Variables purely local to a topic or function are transient. Global variables can be declared as transient or permanent. A variable is generally declared merely by using it, and its type depends on its prefix ($, $$, $_). $_local = 1 is a local transient variable being assigned a 1 $$global1.value = ‚Äúhi‚Äù is a transient global variable which is a JSON object $global2 += 20 is a permanent global variable = Facts = In addition to variables, ChatScript supports facts ‚Äì triples of data, which can also be transient or permanent. Functions can query for facts having particular values of some of the fields, making them act like an in-memory database. Fact retrieval is very quick and efficient the number of available in-memory facts is largely constrained to the available memory of the machine running the ChatScript engine. Facts can represent record structures and are how ChatScript represents JSON internally. Tables of information can be defined to generate appropriate facts. table: ~inventors(^who ^what) createfact(^who invent ^what) DATA: \\"Johannes Gutenberg\\" \\"printing press\\" \\"Albert Einstein\\" [\\"Theory of Relativity\\" photon \\"Theory of General Relativity\\"] The above table links people to what they invented (1 per line) with Einstein getting a list of things he did.  External communication  ChatScript embeds the Curl library and can directly read and write facts in JSON to a website.  Server  A ChatScript engine can run in local or server mode.  Pos-tagging, parsing, and ontology  ChatScript comes with a copy of English WordNet embedded within, including its ontology, and creates and extends its own ontology via concept declarations. It has an English language pos-tagger and parser and supports integration with TreeTagger for pos-tagging a number of other languages (TreeTagger commercial license required).  Databases  In addition to an internal fact database, ChatScript supports PostgreSQL and MongoDB both for access by scripts, but also as a central filesystem if desired so ChatScript can be scaled horizontally. A common use case is to use a centralized database to host the user files and multiple servers to run the ChatScript engine.  JavaScript  ChatScript also embeds DukTape, ECMAScript E5/E5.1 compatibility, with some semantics updated from ES2015+.  Control Flow  A chatbot's control flow is managed by the control script. This is merely another ordinary topic of rules, that invokes API functions of the engine. Thus control is fully configurable by the scripter (and functions exist to allow introspection into the engine). There are pre-processing control flow and post-processing control flow options available, for special processing.

They are \\"flexible\\" because soldiers are not locked in pillboxes, but fight instead in easily replaceable open earth-wood maden positions, while bunkers serve only as shelters during bombardments.

The protective capacity would be provided by multiple lines of well-designed obstacles fitting into the environment and relief rather than bunkers. Every road passable by tanks and trucks was closed by hurdles, but the intermediate areas were unprotected. Ergo the hostile infantry and cavalry could surpass the fortified line, but every battlegroup without resupply quickly run out of ammo and food, after which a much smaller friendly mobile force could beat them. Thus the flexible line based on small, circularly defensible fortified zones and small but rapid pursuer troops, rather than a continuous impenetrable fortress-line. Most of the roads has been destroyed in forested, mountainous or swampy areas between forts. Therefore, the main task of defenders was to protect the obstacles, and not fight with the main attacking forces. Anti-tank obstacle in wood, Mannerheim Line The main manner of this type of field fortification was to close potential vehicular transport and attack routes with multiplied anti-tank ditches, hedgehogs, dragon's teeth and mine fields. These obstacle-zone are followed by a quite small but peculiarly complex system of ditches and barbed wire obstacles, which protects the anti-tank barrier against sappers, bridge- layer tanks and engineer teams. The semi-mobile engagement is the main point, soldiers fight in open firing positions, while bunkers served as only shelters during bombardments. Thus it is possible to quickly reallocate between the points of defense (manpower not locked in pillboxes), and counterattacks feasible by defense force. The main defense line usually lies at hilltop on the edge of a forest, divided into circularly defensible independent subsectors (platoon size) which allow a full 360¬∞ arc of fire. A sector includes 3 (or more) trench-rings and no more than a few ferro-concrete shelters surrounded by a wide zone of anti-personnel obstacles and 2 (or more) \\"V\\" or \\"U\\" shaped anti-tank trenches or dragon's teeth. 3-4 independent sectors connect by communication trenches into a defensive zone or fortress (company or battalion size). Damage caused by enemy's attacks on non-concrete elements of the line is easily repairable while main forces carry out short counterattacks. Therefore, it is not just a passive defense, but is also based on (and its method dependent upon) common counterattacks and infiltrator assaults. The flexibility of the line also means it is designed to help execution of offensive operations as rearguard and provide fire support to moving friendly groups. The necessary infrastructure elements have been built and multiple small rapid units were available (skier, rider and cyclist groups mainly) with strength from platoon to company size. Camouflaged bunker, Mannerheim Line Unlike the Maginot, Metaxas and Siegfried-type lines, the overall barrier and trench system of flexible defense lines were hard to detect. Ideally, defensive positions are in enfilade or reverse slope defence positions to avoid enemy's direct fire. It was a complex net of small objects, all of them entirely adapted to the natural topography (e.g.: natural steep slopes as anti-tank wall, trenches curving as isolines). All buildings, dugouts and obstacles are adapted to the landscape and objects (fallen trees, rocks, mounds and bushes), and there are no easily targeted large objects, while Maginot-like bunkers were impossible to be camouflaged enough. Concrete MG and Gun pillboxes in the Mannerheim and √Årp√°d lines were particularly well camouflaged, and almost all of them have enfilading field of fire (mostly enfilade-defilade combination) in order to defend anti-tank obstacles against sappers, thus none of them fires direct toward enemy's lines. Because these buildings were not exposed to the enemy's line-of-sight artillery they could have been made much thinner than the Maginot-type ones therefore vastly less installation of concrete is required per kilometer compared to other lines. Therefore, the enemy is forced to attack the defensive trenches with conventional infantry assault (as during World War I) at the cost of terrible losses, without assistance of armored forces or line-of-sight firing guns. Because of the possibility of redeployment, significantly less manpower is required than the Maginot-like defenses. The semi-mobile engagement is also more psychologically preferable than the claustrophobic feeling of Maginot- like bunkers in the long term. This type of defensive line required 5-10 times less manpower and concrete per kilometer than the Maginot or Siegfried line with equal (or more) effectiveness, but far more imagination was required from the builders because every part of the line had an inevitably unique design adapted to local conditions.  Comparison to conventional fortresses  Hungarian VKF-7/m commission (Headquarters of Fortifications) investigated events of the three current wars (Spanish Civil War, Finnish Winter War and World War II) in 1940. In addition to secondary analyses they carried out field research in the sites of previous battles (e.g. the Maginot line). According to their results the main differences between static and flexible lines could be summarized in the following points: *Fortress on the Maginot line. It is huge, expensive, identifiable from afar and contains vulnerable items.Maginot, Siegfried and Metaxas-like (later Atlantic Wall too) bunkers have lot of weaknesses. The modern and accurate guns, snipers and autocannons can hit small loopholes. Air inlets and most of loopholes were destructible by small groups of combat engineers. The Germans did not perform frontal assaults, they attacked the vulnerable entrances of the well-equipped fortresses with paratroopers and special units. At Sedan, a German sapper group was able to break through the massive and costly main defense within only 41 minutes. Pillboxes were too big (camouflage and costs), and could be blinded by small concentrated smoke screens. Conversely, the Mannerheim line proved that flexible defense lines are immune to a few sappers or small smoke screens, since they do not contain large objects. *Camouflaged trench in Finland Trench warfare is highly beneficial to the defender if the enemy could not use tanks and line-of-sight artillery. Thus flexible defense puts firepower into defensive fighting positions such as trenches, saps, firebays and earth-wooden made pillboxes. This was an advantage because since it was less extensive it formed a less obvious target for enemy force to be directed against. Thus, the task of defense force is to protect anti-tank obstacles against hostile sappers in order to coerce enemy to attack trenches with conventional infantry attack. In ideal case the entrenched defense can successfully facing with enemy up to ten times numerical superiority. * The Maginot line required a large number of fixed anti-tank artillery, which was easily disrupted by artillery shelling or smoke screens. Flexible lines use mixed natural and artificial anti-tank obstacles; tanks and other armored vehicles could not get through these well-planned defense lines on their own, especially if the design take advantage of the natural relief and objects. The most effective protection provided by double or triple U trenches on hillsides, because enemy's artillery can not destroy an indentation. Armored troops can only get through this line with AVLBs or extensive engineering operations, which is relatively easy to counteract. * Conventional fortresses are proved to be too stationary in the time of Blitzkrieg mechanized warfare. The soldiers locked in bunkers, thus they are not easily regroupable, therefore full-scale defense force must be available at every point of Line. In contrast, flexible defense make it possible to carry out to move and regroup own troops, quick switch between open firing positions and launch counter-attacks. For this reason, the entire system could be operated by much smaller manpower what could be concentrated on attacked locations. Thereby even in a smaller army remain sufficiently enough free manpower to organize mobile corps. * The diffuse objects of flexible lines are easily concealable, thus small and inexpensive bunkers are sufficient opposed to the Maginot-type bunkers with several meters thick walls. Even 5-10 times less concrete could be enough per kilometers if bunkers are not involved in direct firefight. However particularly effective camouflage is required, by reason of hiding and disguise provide protection against hostile heavy artillery and air force. It is important to emphasize quickly reachable shelters need to be built next to each fire point in case of sudden bombardments. * The main drawback of Flexible Defence is that these lines are effective only when they lie next to natural barriers. In addition to man-made obstacles Bar Lev Line and Mannerheim Line used water bodies (Suez Canal, numerous lakes) and √Årp√°d line adopted escarpments and benches as anti-tank blockade too. The methodology is quite useful next to great forests and marshland too, but at completely flat terrain its efficacy is low.  Theoretical layout of a typical fortress  = Blockade line = Closest to the enemy are several lines of anti-tank obstacles and minefields. Usually it means a V or U-trench and a wall or dragon's teeth row, while moats, hedgehogs and berms have been used very rarely because they are difficult to be camouflaged. Behind this lies an extensive, at least 30-meter-wide anti-infantry entanglement, which is a mixed system of apron fences, wire concertinas, electric fences, traps, mines, nail spikes and spike pits. Both elements are well camouflaged by good location (relief) and by plants (e.g. small height bushes in front of ditches). = The (circularly defensible) fortified zone = Bar Lev Line 150‚Äì300 meters away (effective firing range of machine guns) from the barrier have been built 2 or 3 rings or meandering lines of zigzagging trenches that are adapted terrain and natural objects (e.g. rocks and humps) at every point. Lots of individual opened fire positions are on both sides of trenches, which allows firing in all directions since enemy can bypass obstacles (all round defence). Every fortified point have a few heavy weapons, mainly not too many machine guns, medium mortars and a few anti-tank guns are typical. This operated by a company or a battalion sized force and each section have an own shelter. Machine gun and gun pillboxes are firing almost only enfilade direction, they usually protect obstacles from pioneers or guard the rear side of fortified point against flanking operations. = The area between the forts is unprotected = The flexible defence line is not intended to constitute an impenetrable barrier, just close roads passable by vehicles, in order to making the movement of tanks and trucks impossible. For this purpose all of roads in the intermediate woodlands, swamps and mountainous zones has been demolished or blockaded as irreversibly as possible. Hostile infantry (rarely cavalry too) easily passes through but without resupply they quickly run out of material. After this a small rapid pursuing unit is able to defeat attacker forces unit even up to a regiment size. These skier, riding, cycling or motorcycling mobile forces have strength of a company or less, and use only light arms. The Finnish and Hungarian border guards were able to destroy larger armored forces which passed through the main barrier successfully, but became immobilised by a blocked road. Two main defense lines following each other, first (stronger) at outer and second (slightly weaker) at inner periphery of the impassable zone, in a few cases a third belt has been built in the middle of the area. Since fortress line operated by relatively small staff, most of the army form infantry and mobile corps, thus they are free to be used in offensive operations. The flexible method based on and depends upon common counterattacks and infiltrator assaults. The effectiveness of the attacks of rapid units and main forces intensified by the advantage of strong rearguard (the line) where they can retreat to at any time.  Effectiveness  = Mannerheim Line = Unlike the French Maginot Line and other similar forts made with huge bunkers and lines of dragon's teeth, the Mannerheim Line was mostly built by utilizing the natural terrain. Many items such as fallen trees and boulders were incorporated into defensive positions. The Finns also mastered camouflage techniques, which they put to good use. The Mannerheim Line was not constructed at great expense, since it used predominantly local materials (wood, stones, earthworks). The line could stop Soviet attacks and almost every assault was without hope of success. As tanks and self-propelled guns were not able to effectively support the offensive, mass attacks suffered heavy casualties similarly to battles of the First World War. The system was effective where no anti-tank ditch had been built, due to hostile infantry being unable to get through obstacle lines, and intruding tanks without infantry support were destroyed after they run out of fuel or ammo. Western literature considered it to be a weak fortification because of the low amount of concrete used and small number of pillboxes. This demonstrates the common misunderstanding of the design principle of flexible lines. = √Årp√°d Line = With regard to effectiveness per cost rate it was the most potent fortification system during World War 2. The method of system requires complete alignment with the terrain, thus there is no standard layout and every fortress was unique. This fact increases efficacy, since it was not possible to beat different v√∂lgyz√°rs with uniformised methodology. All of buildings, dugouts and obstacles are adapted to the landscape and were especially effectively camouflaged, hence there are no easily targetable large objects in the line. The construction of √Årp√°d Line was 5-10 times cheaper per kilometer than the German and French counterexamples and it was able to hold off the enemy for an incomparably longer period. Despite the almost tenfold numerical superiority of Soviet forces they were unable to occupy the line and serious damage occurred in only a few \\"v√∂lgyz√°rs\\". In several cases (e.g. Gyimesb√ºk) the company-scaled defensive groups (250-400 border guards) successfully faced greater-than-division-sized Soviet forces (10000-15000 soldiers supported by heavy artillery). Hungarian mountain infantry groups fought as effective as Finnish skiers against invading hostile troops. Every fallen Hungarian border guard in Arpad Line demanded 483 killed Soviet, despite of the barely equipped status of \\"v√∂lgyz√°rs\\". However, due to a defeat at southern front Hungarian Army orderly retreated from the line later. = Bar Lev Line = This fortress evolved from a group of rudimentary fortifications placed along the canal line. Israel developed the fortifications into an elaborate defense system spanning 150 km along Suez Canal that were described as \\"one of the best anti-tank ditches in the world.\\" The Bar Lev Line incorporated a massive, continuous 20‚Äì25 metres height sand well to prevent amphibious landings. Behind this was the line of 35 circularly defensible fortified strongpoints manned by a platoon (the other two lines held companies at strongpoints, this was the second major mistake of Israeli planning). Behind the line was an armored division with various support formations to execute possible (and required) counterattacks. One of the forts in this fortification system has been named after the Hungarian capital, Budapest. In the Yom Kippur War some of the strongpoints stopped Egyptian forces, but the line was under-planned, and too few soldiers kept to the firing points. Because the sand wall proved to be surprisingly vulnerable to water cannons, the line delayed the assaulting forces for nine to sixteen hours instead of the expected 48 hours, but this delay was sufficient for to Israeli armour to mobilise. The few excavated passages did not allow Egyptian forces to transport sufficient resupply for attacking forces which significantly contributed to their defeat. Some defense lines used similar methodology during the Cold War (Viet Cong trenches), and even nowadays Kurdish People's Protection Units use trenches in a reminiscent manner.

She is remembered as a pioneer of \\"undercover reporting\\". Early years Maria Leitner came from a bilingual Jewish family. She was born, the eldest of her parents' three recorded children, on 19 January 1892 in Vara≈ædin, Austria-Hungary, today in Croatia. Her father, Leopold Leitner, ran a small building business. In 1896 the family relocated to Budapest where she grew up and attended \\"The Royal Senior Girls' School\\" between 1902 and 1910. It was probably here that she learned both her English and her French. She then studied art history in Vienna and Berlin, completing an internship in Paul Cassirer's Berlin gallery which resulted in a translation into German of William Hogarth's \\"Aufzeichnungen\\" (loosely: \\"notes\\") Career From 1913, she worked for the newspaper Az Est (\\"Evening\\"). After war broke out in the summer of 1914 she worked as a reporter - at one stage reporting for the Budapest newspapers from Stockholm. In 1920, she fled from Hungary to Germany because of her left-wing anti- militarist activities. In Germany, she wrote for various newspapers, and books reviews for the publishing house Ullstein. In her book Hotel Amerika, she describes poor America from within. As a result, she was a hired as a cleaning lady in luxury hotels. Her work was thus connected with the literary current of the Neue Sachlichkeit (\\"New Objectivity\\"), in vogue in the Weimar Republic.Volker Weidermann, 2009, Das Buch der verbrannten B√ºcher , btb- verlag, page 70 (in German) In 1933, after the Nazis came to power, Leitner, a Jew and a revolutionary, emigrated from Germany and went into exile. Her works were banned from publication in Nazi Germany. She earned her living by writing in the anti-Nazi magazine Das Wort published in Moscow.Wilhelm Sternfeld, Eva Tiedemann, 1970, Deutsche Exil-Litteratur 1933-1945 second edition expanded, Heidelberg, Verlag Lambert Schneider, page 301 (in German) In 1940, she was in France, and as with a number of exiles from Germany, she was interned at Gurs internment camp. She managed to escape but could not leave France. The conditions of her death are unclear. In July 1940, she wrote to Hubertus, Prince of L√∂wenstein-Wertheim-Freudenberg, founder of the American Guild for German Cultural Freedom.. In total she had already written at least twelve letters to the guild between 1938 and March 1941, seeking assistance: the letters have been kept by them in their \\"Archive of German Exiles\\". This last appeal for desperate help is Leitner's last known piece of writing. However, she was last seen in Marseille early in 1941 by Anna Seghers and Alexander Abusch. She may have died in exile: one source speculates that she died of hunger, isolated in Marseille. Another speculates that she was one of many Jewish political exiles from Germany who failed to obtain exit visas from the French authorities and were rounded up and deported to concentration camps in Germany where many were killed.

History In 1936, Enescu received a commission from the New York Philharmonic-Symphony orchestra for an orchestral composition to be premiered in January 1938. He began work in April 1937, though he incorporated into the new work sketches that had been made earlier. Although the score of the \\"Village\\" Suite was virtually completed in late 1937 or early 1938, Enescu was not yet satisfied that the score was quite yet ready, and postponed the performance . The final touches were put to the suite, according to a note in the manuscript, on 4 October 1938, at the composer's villa, Lumini»ô, in Sinaia . The delayed first performance took place on 2 February 1939 at Carnegie Hall in New York by the New York Philharmonic-Symphony Orchestra, conducted by the composer . Although contemporary reports at the time of the premiere said the score was also dedicated to the New York Philharmonic-Symphony (; ; ), the score as published in 1965 bears a dedication to the memory of Elena Bibescu . Analysis The suite is in five movements, each bearing a programmatic title in French: # \\"Renouveau champ√™tre\\" (Renewal [i.e., Spring] in the Country) # \\"Gamins en plein air\\" (Children Outdoors) # \\"La vieille maison de l‚Äôenfance, au soleil couchant; P√¢tre; Oiseaux migrateurs et corbeaux; Cloches vesp√©rales\\" (The Old Childhood Home at Sunset; Shepherd; Migratory Birds and Crows; Vesper Bells) # \\"Rivi√®re sous la lune\\" (River beneath the Moon) # \\"Danses rustiques\\" (Rustic Dances) The work follows a programme presenting a day-night-day sequence, as Enescu had done nearly forty years earlier in his Op. 1, Po√®me roumain, and would do again two years later in the suite Impressions d'enfance for violin and piano, Op. 28. Nevertheless, Enescu transforms his descriptive writing into the realm of absolute music in one of his most sophisticated orchestral compositions . Programme music, however, is rare in Enescu's output. Apart from the two works just mentioned, he touched on it in some of the Pi√®ces impromptues for piano (1913‚Äì16), and programmatic elements remain concealed in the Third Symphony and the tone poem Vox maris . There is considerable disagreement about the forms of some of the movements, as well as the larger question of whether Enescu employs cyclic procedures in this work .

After a single symbolic veto from China to show its support for a Secretary-General from the Third World, Waldheim easily defeated Luis Echeverr√≠a √Ålvarez in the balloting. The Security Council re- selected Kurt Waldheim as Secretary General for another five-year term beginning 1 January 1977.  Background  The Secretary-General of the United Nations is appointed by the General Assembly on the recommendation of the Security Council. Therefore, candidates for the office can be vetoed by any of the permanent members. As the end of Kurt Waldheim's first term approached, China asked several Third World countries to nominate a competing candidate. The Chinese expressed their dissatisfaction that a European would lead the United Nations, which had a Third World majority in its membership. Six people expressed interest in the job, but none of them seemed likely to defeat Waldheim.  Candidates  On 11 October 1976, Kurt Waldheim announced that he was running for re-selection. Although Waldheim had been opposed by three permanent members in the 1971 selection, Waldheim now enjoyed the support of both superpowers. One Asian diplomat explained, \\"The big powers all want a colorless administrator who does what he is told, and doesn't think he is Jesus Christ.\\" Expecting Waldheim to run unopposed, the Security Council prepared for an early vote. However, China and other Third World countries delayed the vote until December to give a chance for other candidates to step forward. Nevertheless, Chinese Foreign Minister Qiao Guanhua indicated that his country would not prevent Waldheim from being re-selected. Waldheim even received the support of the Organisation of African Unity. On 18 October 1976, outgoing Mexican President Luis Echeverr√≠a √Ålvarez announced his candidacy for the Secretary-Generalship. From his first year in office, Echeverr√≠a had criticized the United States and backed the aspirations of the Third World, increasing Mexico's diplomatic presence by establishing diplomatic relations with 62 additional countries. Echeverr√≠a maintained a high public profile until the end of his term, contrary to the usual Mexican practice of stepping back to pave the way for his chosen successor, Jos√© L√≥pez Portillo. Cynics claimed that Echeverr√≠a was courting Third World support so that he could become U.N. Secretary-General after leaving the Mexican Presidency. Portillo's aides expressed their hope that Echeverr√≠a could become Secretary-General so that he would be out of the country for most of Portillo's term. On 15 November 1976, Hamilton Shirley Amerasinghe of Sri Lanka announced that he would be willing to serve as Secretary-General if the Security Council voted for him unanimously. However, he would not put his name on the ballot alongside the two existing candidates. This maneuver would place him in contention as a compromise candidate in case the Security Council deadlocked between Waldheim and Echeverr√≠a. Amerasinghe was then the President of the General Assembly.  Voting  On 7 December 1976, the Security Council met to vote on the recommendation of a Secretary-General. In the first round, Waldheim easily outpolled Echeverr√≠a. China voted for Echeverr√≠a and cast a symbolic veto against Waldheim to demonstrate its support for a Third World candidate. The Soviet Union voted against Echeverr√≠a, and the other three permanent members abstained. The Security Council immediately conducted a second round of voting. China dropped its veto and voted for Waldheim, giving him a winning tally of 14-0-1. Echeverr√≠a received only 3 votes in favor. As a result, Kurt Waldheim was selected Secretary-General for a second five-year term beginning on 1 January 1977.

Abstract: One of the most important liberal theorists of his time, Claude Fr√©d√©ric Bastiat began as an economic journalist and lobbyist for the free-trade. It took him some years before he made the transition from journalist to theorist, when discovering he had both a facility for writing and some profound insights into how the free market operates. But then he ran out of time when his illness ended his life and he did not have time to flourish fully. Bastiat was indeed a superb writer. His brilliant and witty essays are remarkable to this very day. He was the first, and one of the very few, to be able to convincingly communicate the basic propositions of economics. Bastiat strongly believed that what was really needed was a science of economics that would explain the harmony of a free society. He made a major contribution to this end himself by publishing his incomplete magnum opus Harmonies of Political Economy In the book, Bastiat writes of \\"the measureless disproportion\\" between what each of us contributes to society and what each of us receives in return. The American economist Amasa Walker commented that, \\"Of all the writers on the subject, no one seems to have been more full and clear in the definition and illustration of value\\" than Bastiat, in the distinction he draws in Economic Harmonies between value and utility. Bastiat dedicated Harmonies of Political Economy to the youth of France.

The sides of the sculpture have silvered bumps and hollows; viewed from above, the top surface resolves into a blocky human body and face. It is described in Pevsner as \\"a silvered block with curved hollows, and rectangular shapes above\\". In late 2016, it was reported that the ownership of the sculpture was unclear. It was commissioned by British Rail, which was privatised in the 1990s, and the sculpture may have been inherited by Network Rail, who owns the freehold of the land on which it sits. However, Network Rail has denied ownership, saying that the land is leased to Sydney & London Properties, but the leaseholders have also denied any responsibility for the sculpture.

The bay was formed along the axis of a plunging syncline during the formation of the Chuckanut Mountains . It is situated on the east shore of the Salish Sea at the southeast end of Bellingham Bay. The bay was named Puerto del Socorro by Lieut. Juan Francisco de Eliza in 1791. The present name was chosen by Capt. Henry Roeder on December 1, 1852. The name 'Chuckanut' is derived from a native word for \\"Long beach far from a narrow entrance\\" Prominent natural features include Pleasant Bay located south of Chuckanut Bay, Mud Bay to the north and Chuckanut Island (aka Dot Island) and Chuckanut Rocks to the west. Other natural features include Teddy Bear Cove, Governors Point and Clark Point. The most prominent creeks that drain into the bay are Chuckanut Creek and Fragrance Lake Outlet. The bay is home to interesting tafoni formations found in the area. Communities Chuckanut Village, located near Mud Bay along the north shore of Chuckanut Creek, is the southernmost neighborhood in Bellingham. The Chuckanut Bay Community is further south of Chuckanut Village and had a population of 60 people in the 1940s. It was centered around a ferry landing for the San Juan Islands and Sydney, BC from 1935 to 1941. After the ferry closed, the landing became the foundation for the Chuckanut Bay Yacht Club. When the yacht club closed in 1946, the clubhouse was moved to LaConner WA and is now a waterfront restaurant there. The Chuckanut Bay Community Association (CBCA) currently has a membership of over 400 households. The CBCA is a non- profit organization committed to foster a spirit of community among residents in the Chuckanut Bay and Chuckanut Mountain area. The CBCA was initially formed in 1992 to support volunteer firefighters in their district, and continues today as a non-profit organization dedicated to serving the Chuckanut community. The communities are linked to Bellingham and Burlington by State Route 11, also known as Chuckanut Drive. Chuckanut Beaches Association (CBA) is a community association that shares five beaches among their membership. CBA was originally incorporated in 1954 as Chuckanut Beaches Inc. and was reincorporated in 1994 as Chuckanut Beaches Association. The five Chuckanut beaches were deeded from the Charles F. Larrabee estate (Larrabee State Park donor) to Chuckanut Beaches, Inc. in 1954. The quit-claim deed states: \\"Said land is hereby conveyed for park, boat haven, beach and playground purposes, or for one or more of the aforesaid purposes, but may be held in an undeveloped state by grantee, its successors or assigns\\". Selected History * The Chuckanut Stone Quarry was opened in 1880 and closed in 1908. * A salmon cannery opened in 1900, went bankrupt two years later, and became Astoria-Puget Sound Cannery. The cannery was moved to Excursion Outlet, Alaska after fish traps were outlawed in 1934. Old buildings were used as warehouses until 1948. * Chuckanut Mountain was logged in the 1890s and the bay was used to raft logs and to load ships. * Three and four masted sailing ships were built in the bay in the early 1900s. * A brick and tile plant was opened in 1915 and ran for several years before it shut down. * Moonshiners and rum runners used the bay during prohibition. * Coal was mined and stone quarried on the west side of Governors Point in 1921. * Pleasant Bay was used to overwinter moored sailing ships in 1902. * A chicken ranch was operated from 1936 to 1964 ‚Äì Source: Chuckanut Bay.jpgLooking West/South West With Northern End of Governor's Point and Eastern Shore of Lummi Island Chuckanut Island and Lion Rock.jpgNorthern End of Chuckanut Island Looking West Towards Portage Island Chuckanut Rock.jpgChuckanut Rock in Western Portion of Chuckanut Bay References Bays of Washington (state) Geography of Washington (state) ","title":"Chuckanut Bay"},{"id":"53734671","title":"List of songs recorded by Dolly Parton"},{"id":"53734674","text":"Educational inequality is the unequal access to education. The disparity in academics among children in the United States is a result of policy in government, the difference in schools attended by children, the amount of wealth a family holds, the parenting style, the race and ethnicity of the child, and the resources available to the child and school. Educational inequality also causes a number of problems in the United States, one of which is the increasing population in prisons.  History  The individuals who were more likely to have access to knowledge and learn how to read, write, and do arithmetic lived in the Northeastern (New England) region of the United States during the 17th century. During the Reconstruction Era the enrollment of black students began to evolve because of the increased population of freed blacks. Although the enrollment rate of black students would increase from that point in time onward, there is still evidence of unequal achievement between white students and students from non-white racial identities, as well as between students from low socioeconomic backgrounds and students from higher socioeconomic backgrounds. Due to poverty being a significant factor in determining academic achievement, students who reside in impoverished communities historically perform lower than students from affluent communities as a result of lack of parental and school resources, quality teachers, and updated teaching materials. Moreover, students who reside in communities with a low socioeconomic status are often students of color. In more recent research within the 21st century regarding education inequality, there is evidence that students who come from low socioeconomic backgrounds and communities of color are more likely to experience the juvenile justice system or incarceration at some point in their life; this is referred to as the school-to-prison pipeline. = Integration = In the United States, integration is the process of ending race-based segregation within public and private schools. While integration of schools is generally referred to in the context of the Civil Rights Movement, it continues to be a relevant issue in debate about modern American education. Integration has historically been employed as a method for reducing the achievement gap which exists between white and nonwhite students in the U.S. Students in integrated schools also learn to be more accepting of others which has been shown to reduce prejudice on the basis of race. Studies conducted in schools across the country have found that racial integration of schools is effective in reducing the achievement gap. In 1964, in accordance with the Civil Rights Act of that year, the United States Congress commissioned sociologist James Coleman to direct and conduct a study on school inequality in the U.S. The report, known colloquially as the Coleman Report, was a landmark study in the field of sociology and education. The report detailed the extreme levels of racial segregation in schools which still persisted in the Southern United States despite the ruling of the Supreme Court in Brown v. Board of Education. Coleman found that black students benefited greatly from learning in mixed- race schools. Therefore, Coleman argued that busing black students to white school districts to integrate would be more effective in reducing the disadvantages of black students as opposed to an increase in funding which the report had discovered impacted student achievement very little. These findings would serve as an influential factor in the creation of the practice known as desegregation busing.  Inequalities in different educational stages  = K-12 = Education at the K-12 level is important in setting students up for future success. However, in the United States there are persisting inequalities in elementary, junior high, and high school that lead to many detrimental effects for low-income students of color. One indicator of inequality is that Black children are more likely to be placed in special education. Teachers are disproportionately identifying African American students for developmental disorders: Black students \\"are about 16% of the school-age population yet are 26% and 34% of children receiving services under the SED [serious emotional disturbances] and MMR [mild mental retardation] developmental delay categories.\\" On the other hand, ADHD in Black children is more likely to go undiagnosed, and as a result, these students are often punished more severely than white students who have been recognized as having ADHD. One study shows that Black students with undiagnosed ADHD are seen as disruptive and taken out of class, reducing their learning opportunities and increasing the chances they will end up in prison. More evidence of inequality is that allocation of resources and quality of instruction are much worse for African American, Native American, and Latino students when compared to their white counterparts. An analysis by the Stanford University School of Education found that there is a high concentration of minority students in schools that are given fewer resources like books, laboratories, and computers. In addition, these schools often have larger student to teacher ratios and instructors with less qualifications and experience. Teachers who are unqualified and inexperienced are less likely to adapt to different learning methods and fail to implement higher-order learning strategies that constitute quality education. Students who are placed in gifted education often receive better instruction; it was discovered that Black children were 54% less likely to be placed in one of these programs and \\"were three times more likely to be referred for the programs if their teacher was black rather than white.\\" According to multiple studies, African American students are disadvantaged from the very beginning of elementary school. One survey reported that they have very high aspirations (much higher when compared to the white students) but usually face negative schooling experiences that discourage them. These disparities carry over into higher education and explain much of why many choose not to pursue a degree. = Higher education = Higher education encompasses undergraduate and postgraduate schooling and usually results in obtaining a higher-paying job. Not only do Black and Hispanic people have less access to universities, they face many inequities while they attend and while applying to postgraduate programs. For most of history, Black Americans were not admitted into these institutions and were generally dissuaded from pursuing higher education. Even though certain laws have been enacted to make access to higher education more equal, the numbers today still illustrate that racial inequalities prevent completely equal access. One study says that the social environment of universities makes African Americans feel more isolated and less connected to the school. They observed that \\"African American students at White institutions have higher attrition rates, lower grade point averages, lower satisfactory relationships with faculty, lower enrollment into postgraduate programs, and greater dissatisfaction.\\" Additionally, many researchers have studied stereotype threat which is the idea that negative perceptions of race can lead to underperformance. One of these experiments done at Stanford tested a group of African Americans and a group of white students with the same measured ability; African Americans did worse when the test was presented as a measure of their intellect and matched performance of their white peers when they were told the test did not reflect intellectual ability. Other studies have been conducted to analyze the different majors that students choose and how these majors hold up in the job market. After analyzing data from 2005-2009, they saw that African Americans were less likely to major in a STEM-related field, which has a higher return on investment than the liberal arts. A 2018 study yielded similar results: white students are twice as likely to major in engineering than Black students, with Hispanic students also being underrepresented. In regards to postgraduate study, Black students are less likely to be accepted into such programs after college. One possible reason is because they aren't being recruited for doctoral programs and are looked less favorably upon if they received a degree from an HBCU (historically black colleges and universities).  Factors contributing to inequalities  = Race = Race is often a big contributor to inequalities in education, and it can explain the widening achievement and discipline gaps between white students and students of color. Implicit bias and stereotyping perpetuate systemic injustices and lead to unequal opportunities. Race influences teachers' expectations and in turn, influences achievement results. A 2016 study showed that non-Black teachers had much lower expectations of Black students than Black teachers who evaluated the same student. White teachers were 12% less likely to think the student would graduate from high school and 30% less likely to think they would graduate from college. Previous studies have proved the importance of teachers' expectations: students whose teachers believe they are capable of high achievement tend to do better (Pygmalion effect). In another study, they saw that white teachers were more likely to give constructive feedback on essays if they believed the student who wrote it was white. The essays perceived to be written by Black or Latino students were given more praise and less pointers on how to improve their writing.Harber, K. D., Gorman, J. L., Gengaro, F. P., Butisingh, S., Tsang, W., & Ouellette, R. (2012). Students' race and teachers' social support affect the positive feedback bias in public schools. Journal of Educational Psychology, 104(4), 1149‚Äì1161. https://doi.org/10.1037/a0028110 One reason for this lack of quality feedback could be that teachers don't want to appear racist so they grade Black students more easily; this is actually detrimental and can lead to lower achievement over time. One research study done to look at how implicit bias affects students of color found that white teachers who gave lessons to Black students had greater anxiety and delivered less clear lectures. They played recordings of these lectures to non-Blacks students who performed just as badly, proving that it wasn't a result of the students' ability but rather implicit bias in the teachers. Minority students often don't have equal access to high-quality teachers which can be an indication for how well a student will perform. However, there has been conflicting research on how large the effect truly is; some claim having a high-quality teacher is the biggest predictor of academic success while another study says that inequalities are largely caused by other factors.  White supremacy in curriculum  White supremacy, or the belief that white people are a superior race, plays a role in course material in U.S. schools. This is manifested by the underrepresentation of racial minorities in history curriculum, and, especially in the 19th and early 20th Centuries, the representation of racial minorities in primarily negative ways. The underrepresentation of non-white Americans and other peoples around the world leads to decreased self-esteem and academic performance among minority students, widening the so-called achievement gap between white students and black and Hispanic students. = Socioeconomic status = In the United States, a family's socioeconomic status (SES) has a significant impact on the child's education. The parents' level of education, income, and jobs combine to determine the level of difficulty their children will face in school. It creates an inequality of learning between children from families of a high SES and children from families of a low SES. Families with a high SES will ensure the child receives a beneficial education while families with a low SES usually are not able to ensure a quality education for their child. This results in children of less wealthy families performing less well in schools as children of wealthier families. There are several factors that contribute to this disparity; these factors narrow into two main subjects: resources and environment. The type of environment a student lives in is a determinant of the education they receive. The environment a child is raised in shapes their perceptions of education. In low SES homes, literacy is not stressed as much as it is in high SES homes. It is proven that wealthier parents spend more time talking to their children and this builds up their vocabulary early on and enhances their literacy skills. Low SES families may not be able to afford as many books at the child's ever- changing reading level. This endangers the child's ability to quickly build up their literacy skills because their only access to books of differing levels is at school. They are unable to challenge their reading skills at home while wealthier children may have a wide variety of books because they are in an environment that encourages reading. Children of low SES are also exposed to a more stressful environment than higher SES children. They worry about influences a lack of money in the household could create (such as bills and food). Monetary struggles also increase the number of arguments parents have which creates a high-stress environment for the child and may prevent them from concentrating on their schoolwork. This inability to concentrate on homework or in class without worrying about the environmental factors at home will cause a decline in academic performance. This decline is less likely to occur to high-SES students because their home environment produces fewer stressors. The student is able to give their full attention to their academics. There is great variation in the resources available to children in schools. Families of higher SES are able to invest more into the education of their children. This ability manifests in the popular tactic of shopping around school districts: parents plan where they are going to live based on the quality of the school district. They can afford to live in areas where other families of high SES reside, and this congregation of high-SES families produces a school district that is well funded. These families are capable of directly investing in their children's education by donating to the school. Having access to such funds gives the schools capacity to hold high caliber resources such as high-quality teachers, technology, good nutrition, clubs, sports, and books. If students have access to such resources, they are able to learn more effectively. Children of lower SES families do not have such resources. Their families tend to settle down where there is an availability of jobs, and are less likely to shop around school districts. Clusters of low- SES families typically produce worse school districts. The families are not in a position to donate to their children's school and so the schools lack appropriate funding for good resources. This results in schools that cannot compete with wealthier schools.  Neighborhood effects  Neighborhoods play a significant effect on the development in adolescents and young adults. As a result, much research has studied how neighborhoods can explain a person's level of educational attainment. These findings are highlighted below. Research has shown that an adolescent's neighborhood can significantly affect his or her life chances. Children from poorer neighborhoods are less likely to climb out of poverty compared to children who grow up in more affluent neighborhoods. In terms of education, students from neighborhoods with a high SES have higher levels of school readiness and higher IQ levels. Studies have also shown that there are ‚Äúlinks between neighborhood high SES and educational attainment‚Äù in regards to older adolescents. Children growing up in high SES neighborhoods are more likely to graduate from high school and attend college compared to students growing up in low SES neighborhoods. Living in a low SES neighborhood has many implications in terms of education. Among them are ‚Äúgreater chances of having a child before age 18; lesser chances of graduating from high school; and earning lower wages as a young adult. Experiencing more neighborhood poverty as a child is also associated with a lower rate of college graduation.‚Äù The neighborhood effect is mitigated when students who grow up in low SES neighborhoods move to high SES neighborhoods. These students are more likely to reap the same benefits as students in high SES neighborhoods and school systems; their chances of attending college are much higher than those who stayed in low SES neighborhoods. One study done in Chicago placed African Americans students in public housing in the suburbs as opposed to in the city. The schools in the suburbs generally received more funding and had mostly white students attending. Students who attended these schools ‚Äúwere substantially more likely to have the opportunity to take challenging courses, receive additional academic help, graduate on time, attend college, and secure good jobs.‚Äù = Private vs. public education = = Language barriers =  Educational inequalities  = Achievement gap = The achievement gap describes the inconsistencies in standardized test scores, rates of high school and college completion, grade point average between students of color (Black and Latino) and White students. It is significant because White students tend to achieve far more academically compared to Black and Latino students. Latino and Black students have some of the lowest college school completion rates in the United States. On average, they also have lower literacy rates in school and lag behind White students in terms of math and science proficiency. It is important to understand that these discrepancies have long-term achievement effects on Latino and Black students. There are several factors that can explain the achievement gap. Among some of the most studied and popular theories are that predominantly Black/Latino schools are concentrated in low SES neighborhoods that do not receive adequate resources to invest in their student's education (such as the ability to pay for qualified teachers) and that parental participation in Black and Latino families lags behind White families. Family influence is significant as shown in a study that demonstrated how high levels of parental involvement in low income communities can actually assist in mitigating the achievement gap. = Summer learning gap = An imbalance in resources at home creates a phenomenon called the summer learning gap. This exhibits the impact of resources outside of school that influence a child's education progression. It uncovers a troubling contrast between the growth in math skills over the summer between children of high SES and children of low SES. The graph displaying the summer learning gap shows the higher SES children starting above the lower SES children at year one. The higher SES children are already ahead of the lower SES children before grade school even starts because of the amount of resources available to them at home. This may be due to their early introduction into literacy and higher vocabulary due to the higher amount of words they are exposed to as mention in a previous paragraph. Also, the lower SES children's access to books is solely through school, and their reading skills are not developed at all at year one because they have not had the exposure yet. As the graph goes on, it is evident that the two groups of children learn at the same rate only when they are in school. The higher SES students are still above the lower SES students because the rate of learning of the children changes radically during the summer. In the summer, the higher SES children show a very slight increase in learning. This is due to their access to various resources during the summer months. Their families are able to enroll them in summer enrichment activities such as summer camp. These activities ensures that they are still being educationally stimulated even when not in school. While at the same time, lower SES students show evidence of a slight decrease in learning during the summer months. Lower SES students do not have the same opportunities as the higher SES students. During the summer, these students are not focused on learning during the summer. Their parents do not enroll them in as many summer activities because they cannot afford them and so the children have more autonomy and freedom in those three months. They are concerned with having fun, and thus forget some of what they gained during the school year. This continuing disparity from year to year results in an approximately 100 point difference in their math scores at year six. = Discipline gap = The discipline gap refers to the overrepresentation of minority students among the differing rates of School discipline, especially in comparison to white students. Shifts in disciplinary policy have been attributed to the discipline gap, with African American students bearing the brunt of the subsequent inequalities. In recent decades, disciplinary policies meant to strengthen school control over social interactions, such as through the use of Zero tolerance (schools), have been implemented, leading to a large increase of sanctions being levied against students. Studies have also suggested that, for black students, the likelihood of suspension increases in concordance with a rise in the population of black students in a school's student body, as well as an increased likelihood of facing harsher punishments for behavior. Additional research has suggested that African American students are both differentially disciplined and more likely to face harsher punishments relative to white students. Furthermore, minority students are more often accused of subjective, rather than objective, disciplinary infractions. Other minority demographics, such as Latinx and Native American students, face similar disproportionately high rates of school discipline‚Äîthough relative to data about black students, these findings have been less consistent. Explanations for the cause of the discipline gap are wide-ranging, as both broad factors and individual actions have been considered as potential sources of the gap. On a macrolevel, things like school culture have been suggested to be meaningfully associated with differences in suspension rates. Conversely, a significant amount of research has been conducted on the micro-interactions that take place between teachers and students. The self-efficacy and confidence of teachers inherently influence their interactions with students, which can then shape their methods of classroom management and propensity to discipline students. Moreover, preexisting assumptions or biases about students can also influence a teacher's treatment of their students. Additional issues, such as cultural differences, have been identified as further complicating the relationship between teachers and students. Most notably, cultural misunderstandings between white teachers and black students have been found to result in disciplinary action taken disproportionately against black students. Research has also indicated that the risk of cultural mishaps may be more pronounced among inexperienced or new teachers.  Zero- tolerance policies  Zero-tolerance policies, also known as no-tolerance policies, were originally instituted to prevent school shootings by strictly prohibiting the possession of dangerous weapons in schools. As these policies have proliferated nationally, research has shown that schools with large populations of minority students tend to utilize zero-tolerance more frequently relative to other schools, often in addition to the use of punitive disciplinary procedures. Over time, these policies have gradually evolved from their original purpose and shifted towards meeting school-specific disciplinary goals, which has inadvertently contributed to the discipline gap. In many schools, subjective misbehaviors‚Äîlike disrupting the class or acting disrespectfully‚Äîhave become offenses that are addressed by zero-tolerance. This has resulted in negative consequences for minority students, as research has indicated that minorities tend to be disproportionately disciplined for subjective transgressions. Additionally, zero-tolerance punishments can lead to student referrals to the juvenile detention system, even for offenses that may otherwise be considered minor. The connection between zero-tolerance and juvenile detention has also been linked to other elements of the discipline gap, such as school-based arrests. Despite comprising approximately 15% of students, African Americans account for 50% of the arrests in schools.Kocon, A. (2018). Sparking a School Discipline Revolution. Education Digest, 83(7), 16‚Äì21. While researchers have attributed many disciplinary policies to this disparity, zero-tolerance has been noted as a significant contributing factor.  Exclusionary policies  Exclusionary discipline policies refer to the removal, or \\"exclusion,\\" of students from the classroom‚Äîtypically in the form of suspensions or expulsions. The national emphasis on suspensions and other exclusionary policies has been partially attributed to the rise of zero- tolerance, as suspensions have become a favored method of punishing students that are also broadly applied to various infractions. Even though suspensions are a commonly used form of discipline, suspension rates for all student demographics‚Äîexcept African Americans‚Äîhave declined. The increase in the rate for African Americans has followed a trend that was identified in the 1970s, when black students were estimated to be twice as likely to receive a suspension, and that has continued to increase over time. Studies have also indicated that, particularly among black women, darker skin tones may raise the risk of receiving a suspension. In addition to being more likely to receive a suspension, studies have shown that black students tend to also receive longer suspensions. As a result of these disparities, research has signaled that students of color perceive the gap among suspension rates as the result of intentional discrimination, rather than as efforts to appropriately enforce school rules. Exclusion from the classroom has been found to be detrimental to a student's academic performance. Research has shown that engagement in the classroom is positively related to student achievement, and, given that suspensions can last for several days, this can greatly influence the risk of academic failure‚Äîparticularly among groups like black males, who are disproportionately suspended. The added impact of suspensions on black students has been noted as compounding other issues facing them, such as higher disengagement from classes, that contribute to the Racial achievement gap in the United States. Academic performance is further affected by the largely-unsupervised time spent outside of the classroom, which can bring students in contact with additional youth who have been suspended or expelled from schools. Suspensions also stay on a student's school record, which can shape academic or personal expectations for the student when seen by future teachers or administrators. Additional consequences arising from exclusionary policies include internalization of stigmas, higher risk of dropping out, and the de facto re-segregation of schools. Exclusion from school typically coincides with labels of being \\"defiant\\" or \\"difficult to deal with\\" that students have a high likelihood of internalizing. Moreover, the services provided during suspensions or at suspension centers often fail to address this internalization or the stigmas that result upon returning to school. This can be significant for a student's educational path, as research has revealed that cycles of antisocial behaviors can result from such labels and stigmas. In terms of High school dropouts in the United States, suspensions have been shown to increase the likelihood of dropping out by a factor of three, in addition to also making students three times more likely to face future incarceration. On a macro-level, some researchers have begun to consider the racial gap among suspension rates as effectively re-segregating schools. Although the exact causes for the de facto re-segregation of schools are still being researched, racist attitudes and cultural friction have been suggested to be potential sources of this issue. At the primary and secondary education level, the trend of African American students being the worst punished in schools holds even when students are engaging in the same infraction. = Prison pipeline = A juvenile prison in Cook County, Illinois. The prison pipeline, also known as the School-to-prison pipeline, refers to the system of student disciplinary referrals to the American juvenile justice system, rather than using disciplinary mechanisms within schools themselves. As a result of this system, negative consequences during adulthood, such as incarceration, that disproportionately impact minority students have been attributed to the pipeline. Many studies have revealed that during childhood, exposures to the justice system make students more likely to become imprisoned later in life. School disciplinary policies that overly effect black and minority students, such as zero-tolerance and exclusionary policies, increase the risk for students to come into contact with the juvenile justice system. These policies disproportionately target students of color, as evidence has revealed a rise among African American males in the prison system who were expelled from schools with recently implemented zero tolerance policies. Furthermore, suspensions have been identified as making the risk of youth incarceration three times more likely for students. Other factors that have fostered the development of the prison pipeline include law enforcement on school campuses, such as School resource officers, that play a role in school discipline. Law enforcement officers intervene or perform arrests to address student issues‚Äîlike drug use or assault of teachers or other students‚Äîthat break the law. However, implicit biases against minority students have been linked to the disciplinary recommendations made by school officers, which tend to result in more severe punishments to be levied against these students. Many factors have contributed to the development of the prison pipeline, including the discipline gap and the criminalization of schools. A significant number of studies have indicated that exclusionary discipline can create cycles of bad behaviors that result in progressively more severe consequences‚Äîoften ending in involvement with the justice system. This has been evidenced by disproportionate arrest rates in schools. For example, even though they constitute only 15% of students, black students comprise 50% of arrests in schools. Subsequent punishments, especially institutional confinement, can have inadvertent consequences, such as dropping out of school. Moreover, the bureaucracy of correctional institutions does not correspond well with school systems, as curriculums do not always match. Consequently, students who reenroll in school tend to not only lack support systems for reentry, but they must also overcome the deficit between curriculums. Research has also indicated that, especially in inner cities, the various elements of the prison pipeline are ultimately counterproductive to improving or \\"fixing\\" a student's education and disciplinary track record.  Potential solutions  = Early intervention = Research studies conducted in the field of sociology have revealed that early intervention in a child's education can have drastic effects on future growth and development in children. Early intervention can include a wide array of educational activities, including increased emphasis on reading and writing, providing additional tools or resources for learning, as well as supplements to aide special education students. One of the most notable studies conducted concerning this topic is that of the Perry Preschool Project in Ypsilanti, Michigan. The study assigned random 3- and 4-year-old children from low-income families to attend the Perry school. The school had ample resources and a high teacher to student ratio, and heavily emphasized development of reading and writing skills. Once graduated, students who attended the Perry school were less than 1/5 as likely to have broken the law as compared with students who did not attend the preschool. The study also discovered that those who attended the preschool program earned, on average, $5,500 more per year than those who did not attend the school. This reveals a higher return on investment for the students who attended Perry when compared with a standard public school in the same low-income community. Researchers who lead the Perry Preschool Project have received widespread acclaim for their contributions to the field, giving validity to the concept that early intervention is a powerful tool in alleviating educational and income inequality in America. = Parental involvement and engagement = Parental involvement is when schools give advice to parents on what they can do to help their children while parental engagement is when schools listen to parents on how better they can teach their students; parental involvement has been shown to work well but engagement works even better. Researchers have found that high-achieving African American students are more likely to have parents who tutor them at home, provide additional practice problems, and keep in touch with school personnel. There is evidence that African American parents do value education for their child, but may not be as involved in schools because they face hostility from teachers when they give their input. Lack of involvement can also be due to social class and socioeconomic status: working- class African American parents tend to have less access to \\"human, financial, social, and cultural resources.\\" They also tend to be more confrontational toward school personnel compared to the middle-class African American parents who usually have the ability to choose what school and what class their child is enrolled in. Surveys conducted on parental involvement in low-income families showed that more than 97% of the parents said they wanted to help their children at home and wanted to work with the teachers. However, they were more likely to agree with the statements \\"I have little to do with my children's success in school,\\" \\"Working parents do not have time to be involved in school activities,\\" and \\"I do not have enough training to help make school decisions.\\" A case study of Clark Elementary in the Pacific Northwest showed that teachers involved parents more after understanding the challenges that the parents faced, such as being a non-native English speaker or being unemployed. = School funding = Much research dispels the notion that school funding determines the educational achievement of students, however, funding and or quality has been shown to account for as much of a 40% variance in student achievement. While school funding can be seen as a factor that perpetuates educational inequality, it also has the ability to assist in mitigating it. The funding gap is a term often used to explain the differences in resource allocation between high-income and low-income schools. Many studies have found that states are spending less money on students from low- income communities than they are on students from high-income communities (Growing Gaps figure). A 2015 study found that across the United States, school districts with high levels of poverty are likely to receive 10 percent less per student (in resources provided from the state and local government) compared to more affluent school districts. For students of color this funding gap is more pervasive; school districts where students of color are in the majority have been shown to receive 15 percent less per student compared to school districts that are mostly white. The funding gap has many implications for those students whose school districts are receiving less aid from the state and local government (in comparison to less impoverished districts). For students in the former districts, this funding gap has led to poorer teacher quality which has been shown to lead to low levels of educational attainment among poor and minority students. Research in 2018 has concluded from a longitudinal study that \\"a 21.7% increase in per-pupil spending throughout all 12 school-age years was enough to eliminate the education attainment gap between children from low-income and non-poor families and to raise graduation rates for low-income children by 20 percentage points.\\" = Charter schools = Charter schools have been depicted as a controversial solution to alleviate educational inequality in the United States. In an effort to combat the impacts of living in a low-income school district, charter schools have emerged as a means of reorganizing funding to better assist low-income students and their communities. A charter school is an independent learning institution most commonly serving secondary students. It receives public funding through a charter granted to a state or local agency. This method is designed to decrease the negative effects on student's educational quality as a result of living in a low-tax-base community. Schools granted a charter are required to implement specific standards and report educational progress of their students. A charter may be granted to a community organization or a private corporation. Critics of charter schools argue they de-emphasize the significance of public education and are subject to greedy enterprise exploiting the fundamental right of education for the sole purpose of profiting. While charter schools are technically considered ‚Äúpublic schools,\\" opponents argue that their operational differences implicitly create differences in quality and type of public education, as standards and operating procedures are individualized based on each school. Free-market proponents often support charter schools, arguing they are more effective than typical public schools, specifically in reference to low-income students. However, studies have not found conclusive evidence that charter schools as a whole are more effective than traditional public schools. One common model of charter schools is called a ‚Äúno excuses‚Äù school. This label has been adopted by many charter schools as a means of indicating their dedication to a rigorous and immersive educational experience. While there is no official list of features required to be a ‚Äúno-excuse‚Äù charter, they have many common characteristics. Some of these attributes include high behavioral expectations, strict disciplinary codes, college preparatory curriculum, and initiatives to hire and retain quality teachers. = School discipline reform =  See also  * Inequality in the United States * Educational inequality * Public school funding  References  Education in the United States ","title":"Educational inequality in the United States"},{"id":"53734678","text":"is a 1981 Japanese film directed by Shue Matsubayashi. The film is a retelling of the downfall of Japan's Imperial Navy. Plot In 1940, despite the opposition of the commander-in-chief of the Combined Fleet, Isoroku Yamamoto (Keiju Kobayashi) and other officers, Japan signs the Tripartite Pact with Nazi Germany and Fascist Italy as it prepares for expansion in Southeast Asia. Masato Odagiri, son of shipwright Takeichi Odgairi, graduates from the Imperial Japanese Naval Academy. A year later, his friend, Eiichi Hongo, is promoted to naval lieutenant. During the attack on Pearl Harbor, Eiichi is in the raid as part of a Val dive bomber crew from the aircraft carrier Zuikaku. The raid is a success, but is tempered by the nonpresence of the American carrier fleet. In February 1942, the battleship Yamato is designated as Yamamoto's flagship, and Takeichi is drafted as a reservist. He is assigned to the ship as a launch pilot. Not long afterwards, the American navy launches a counterstrike in the Doolittle Raid. Following this, Yamamoto orders a massive naval strike at the American-held island of Midway, but the Japanese carrier force is met and sunk by the US carriers. Several months later, after the Guadalcanal campaign, Yamamoto is assassinated as American pilots intercept and shoot down his plane. Eiichi returns home to Japan and marries his fianc√©e, but is soon recalled to participate in the Battle of Leyte Gulf. Off Cape Enga√±o, the Zuikaku is sunk, and Eiichi is among the casualties as he had given his life jacket to Shinji, Masato's younger brother, who was assigned to the ship as a navigator. Elsewhere, the Yamato, now serving as the flagship of Takeo Kurita's Center Force, withdraws from Leyte without having engaged in battle. In April 1945, the Yamato is assigned to participate in Operation Ten- Go, a suicide mission to Okinawa. Shinji has also been reassigned to serve on the battleship. Masato, now a kamikaze pilot, is also due to participate, and asks Shinji to stay with Takeichi during the battle. As the Yamato and her accompanying fleet sails down to Okinawa, it is intercepted by American planes and sunk with a heavy loss of life. Shinji and Takeichi are both killed in battle. Masato observes the sinking, while contemplating on his own death. The film ends on a scene of Eiji's wife, child, and father playing on a beach as the credits roll.

Dina and Clarenza ringing the bells to alert the Messinese people of danger (part of the campanile of the Duomo di Messina) The legend Dina and Clarenza, two Messinese women, were heroines who, in legend, opposed the assaults of the Angevin forces. =Historical background= The Vespers rebellion, begun in Palermo on Easter Monday, 30 March 1282, outside the Church of the Holy Spirit, spread quickly all over the island. Charles I of Anjou tried in vain to put down the uprising with the promise of many reforms. Finally he decided to intervene militarily. With 75,000 men and two hundred ships, in late May 1282 he landed between Catona and Gallico (north of Reggio), on the coast of Calabria opposite Messina, to begin the siege of Messina and to block the flow of support from Reggio to the Sicilian city. The city of the Strait was being governed by . He was made Captain of the People and organized the resistance in the city. Charles laid siege to Messina in vain until September, and in his attempt to conquer and occupy the city he spared no civilians, not old people, nor women, nor children. The city, although in its turn exhausted by the siege, repelled the continual attacks with the participation of the whole population. =The heroines= During the night of 8 August there was a sneak attack by a combined Italian-French Guelph force on the city. Charles's troops tried to invade the city from the hills. The two women were standing guard on the wall. As soon as they saw the enemies, they did all they could to repel the attack. While Dina continually hurled rocks down on the enemy soldiers, Clarenza rang the bells in the campanile of the Duomo, from which she awakened the whole city. Thus the Messinese rushed to the defense of their city and repelled the attack. Legacy The heroines have become symbols of courage and of the Messinese civilians' devotion to their city. Today, Dina and Clarenza are found portrayed in Messina at Palazzo Zanca (the city hall) and on the campanile of the Duomo. The 4th Ward (formerly the 8th Quarter) of Messina, the oldest and central part of the city, is named for them.

She lived in Kansas City, Kansas for more than twenty years and during that time, was identified with almost every woman's movement. She served on the editorial staff of several publications including the New York Teacher, the Leavenworth Home Record, and the Kansas Farmer. Gray's paper on \\"Women and Kansas City's Development\\" was awarded the first prize in the competition held by the Women's Auxiliary to the Manufacturers' Association of Kansas City, Missouri. Early life and education Mary Davy Tenney was born in Brookdale, Liberty Township, Susquehanna County, Pennsylvania, June 19, 1833. She was the daughter of Rev. Ephraim B. and Harriet (Lott). She received her education in her father's theological library, supplemented by a course of study in the Ingalls Seminary, Binghamton, New York. She graduated at Wyoming Seminary, Pennsylvania, in 1853. Career Upon graduation, she served as preceptress in Binghamton Academy of Binghamton, New York 1854‚Äì58. On June 14, 1859, in Conklin, New York, she married Judge Barzillai Gray, moved to Wyandotte, Kansas Territory, a town he founded, He was appointed judge of probate in Leavenworth, Kansas, 1859, judge of the criminal court in 1868; removed to Topeka, Kansas, in 1876, and as private secretary to Gov. Anthony. In Leavenworth, she took part in various activities associated with charities and church extension, as well as the state and county expositions. She lived in Kansas City, Kansas for more than twenty years and during that time, she was identified with almost every woman's movement. =Philanthropist and organizer= Gray was one of Kansas's prominent leaders during the Centennial Exposition of Philadelphia in 1876. As one of the original founders and first president of the Social Science Club of Kansas and Western Missouri, she gave impetus to intellectual culture in those localities, and she saw the organization grow from a small number to a membership of 500 women of the two States. She is also remembered for scientific and artistic work. In 1859, she attended the Wyandotte constitutional convention with Clarina I. H. Nichols and \\"Mother Armstrong\\", attempting to have the vote for women included in the state constitution. As a leader in the women's clubs for art, education, literary and philanthropic purposes, Gray wielded an influence for culture that was felt not only in her home city but throughout the entire state. In the year 1881, a potential effort was made toward a union of the clubs of the state. Up to this time, the club life of the women of the state had been local and confined to a few cities. At a meeting of prominent women, many of whom were members of Kansas and Missouri clubs, held at Leavenworth, Thursday, May 19, 1881, the State Social Science Club of Kansas and Missouri was organized. This first association of women's clubs in the west, with Gray as its first president, was organized by representative women from Atchison, Lansing, Leavenworth, Olathe, Topeka and Wyandotte in Kansas; Kansas City and St. Joseph in Missouri, and Chicago, Illinois. The preamble to its constitution and by-laws read thus: \\"The object of this society shall be to promote a better acquaintance among thoughtful women of this section who are most desirous and best able to raise the standard of women's education and attainments, to enlarge their opportunities, and by frequent meeting bring the highest knowledge of each for the benefit of all.\\" The meetings of this association were held in various cities in Kansas, also in Kansas City, Missouri, two meetings being held each year. The programs at these conventions were comprehensive, embracing the departments of art, archeology, domestic economy, education, history, civil government, literature, natural and sanitary science, philanthropy, and reform. Thereafter, Gray was remembered as the \\"mother of the woman's culture club movement in Kansas\\". =Writer and editor= She wrote for various papers and magazines, and aided in starting the Home Record, Home for the Friendless, and Kansas Cook Book (an issue for charity). In 1855‚Äî,56-,57 she was one of the editors of the New York Teacher. On the editorial staff of the New York Teacher for two years, Gray's influence was felt among the teachers of the state. She was a contributor or correspondent to the leading magazines and papers of Kansas and to the eastern press. The orphan asylum in Leavenworth was indebted to her written appeals for recognition and assistance. The Home Record, of the same city, was an outgrowth and exponent of her deep and abiding interest in the welfare and elevation of women. The compilation of the Kansas Home Cook Book, for the benefit of the Home for the Friendless, was a source of financial strength to the institution, with more than 10,000 copies sold. As editor of the home department of the Kansas Farmer for some years, she showed both sympathy and interest in a group of people who were largely unable to engage in intellectual pursuits. Gray was a vigorous writer and a clear reasoner. She read papers before many state gatherings, as well as clubs of the two Kansas Cities. In the spring of 1901, Gray's paper on \\"Women and Kansas City's Development\\" was awarded the first prize in the competition held by the Women's Auxiliary to the Manufacturers' Association of Kansas City, Missouri. Personal life The couple had three children. Lawrence Tenney Gray (b. 1864), became a lawyer. Daughter Mary Theodosia (1866-1949) married Job Harriman, the candidate for vice president at the 1904 election on the Socialist Party of America ticket. Jessie M. (b. ca. 1863) was another daughter. Gray died on October 11, 1904, at her home on the Missouri River bluffs north of Kansas City, Kansas. On May 9, 1909, the Kansas Federation of Women's Clubs dedicated a monument in Oak Grove Cemetery, Kansas City, to the memory of Gray, as one of the founders of that organization. The monument is of Vermont granite and overlooks the Missouri valley, which Gray once declared was \\"the most beautiful and romantic view in America.\\" References =Attribution=  =Bibliography=  External links * 1833 births 1904 deaths People from Susquehanna County, Pennsylvania 19th-century American newspaper editors Women newspaper editors American philanthropists American community activists American suffragists American women philanthropists 19th-century American women writers 19th-century philanthropists Clubwomen Wikipedia articles incorporating text from A Woman of the Century ","title":"Mary Tenney Gray"},{"id":"53734745","text":"Palaemon guangdongensis is a shrimp species in the family Palaemonidae.

Furthermore, while sex differences in education explains the prevalence of gender-based differences in education on a global scale, the American education system includes specific forms of gender discrimination dissimilar to other countries.  Statistics  Girls and boys have very different developmental trajectories. It has been found that boys are the most likely to delay entry into kindergarten (60% or the children are boys), meaning they do not attend until they are at least 6 years old.DiPrete, T. A., Buchmann, C. (2013). The rise of women: the growing gender gap in education and what it means for American schools. New York: Russell Sage Foundation Boys are also more likely than girls to repeat a grade or more during their time in elementary school (66% of children who repeat kindergarten are boys). On average, girls perform significantly better in school and earn better grades. But, girls and boys do have different strengths. On average, girls perform better in writing and boys are ahead of girls in mathematics.https://nces.ed.gov/programs/digest/d07/tables/dt07_119.asp Men and women workers in the United States have the same mean numbers of years of education which is 12.2 years.Andrews, Emily. \\"Earnings and Sex: An Empirical Investigation of Discrimination 1940- 1951.\\" Ph.D. dissertation, Department of Economics, University of Pennsylvania But there are some discrepancies across gender when it comes to education. When it comes to terminating an educational career, men are more likely to terminate their education either before achieving a high school diploma or at the college level (5,779). Whereas women are more likely to terminate their education after having achieved a high school diploma.Madden, Janice Fanning. ‚ÄúEconomic Rationale for Sex Differences in Education.‚Äù Southern Economic Journal, vol. 44, no. 4, 1978, pp. 778‚Äì797., https://www.jstor.org/stable/1057729. When it comes to amount of education, working class girls tended to have the shortest academic career.King, Ronald. ‚ÄúSex and Social Class Inequalities in Education: A Re-Examination.‚Äù British Journal of Sociology of Education, vol. 8, no. 3, 1987, pp. 287‚Äì303 Middle class boys have the longest academic careers. The sex gap for education was wider between the working class children and the middle class children. Girls had a wider gap when it came to the class gap then boys.  The American School System and Male Students  Male students, like their female counterparts, experience discrimination in academic settings. Several scholars argue this discrimination focuses on teachers‚Äô discipline of their male students as well as on the attitudes of other male peers. Educational scholars and other sociologists use these claims to support their theories regarding male enrollment in specific academic subjects. Dan Kindlon and Michael Thompson examine the ways in which boys‚Äô earlier experiences with education impact their later relationships with schooling. For example, they write of a male patient whose struggles in middle school were traced back to his history of disciplinary violations. The authors go on to state that boys‚Äô typical behaviors‚Äîsuch as their propensity for physical action‚Äîare a ‚Äúproblem‚Äù when they enter American schools, institutions that prioritize obedience and self- control. Furthermore, Kindlon and Thompson explain the detriment of stereotypes surrounding boys, explaining how teachers often ascribe their own biases to male students. Authors like Myra Sadker and David Sadker provide a history to the argument that schools are ‚Äúfeminine‚Äù spaces‚Äîa critique these authors challenge. In this overview, they explain how women‚Äôs entrance into the teaching profession at the time of the Civil War eventually enabled women to lead the field. This large number of female teachers in American schools thus created a fear among men that boys would learn (and perform) traits that were socially coded as feminine. Shifting from this history, Sadker and Sadker write how heteronormative standards, which American schools reinforce through activities, such as sports, affect boys‚Äô ideas of themselves and their female peers. DiPrete and Buchmann synthesize other scholars‚Äô work concerning conceptions of ‚Äúmasculinity‚Äù and its influence on male performance in American high schools. They use examples, such as survey data and student interviews, to highlight the fact that peer groups may be partially responsible for explaining male patterns of achievement. For example, they highlight research that suggests male students ‚Äúgender‚Äù good academic performance. While studies have demonstrated the disparities between male and female students in STEM, a study by the American Association of University Women shows the unequal distribution of male students in subjects like English and the Arts. Notably, male students enroll in ‚Äúremedial‚Äù English classes more often than their female counterparts. The authors posit that educators in these fields (especially in literature) may use learning techniques that girls prefer. This disparity between male-female enrollments in literature classes may also reflect the gendered ideas of students, as students enroll in classes most in line with their expressed gender identity.  STEM Education  Males largely outnumber females in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics related careers, which are commonly referred to as STEM. This disparity can be contributed to a multitude of causes. The belief in stereotypes, lack of science self-confidence, and dissatisfaction with the way science education is presented are the primary issues preventing women from becoming more involved in STEM fields. This scarcity of women is often compared to a leaky pipeline. As children, both boys and girls express equal amounts of interest in science, but as they age the girls slowly drop the subject in favor of more traditionally female fields. While this theory satisfactorily illustrates the changes at a younger age, the number of women in STEM fields does not change drastically once they enter college. Therefore, the issue is one of interest much earlier on. Throughout high school, the percentage of males interested in STEM careers changed from 39.5 to 39.7, effectively staying constant. Contrastingly, the percentage of females interested changed from 15.7 to 12.7. Not only are the initial interest levels over twice as low for females, they also drop by nearly 20%. This data suggests, then, that the differences between male and female interest in STEM subjects is developed from an early age and exacerbated through education. Many school systems present students with multiple paths of science education. If students have had negative experience with science, they are more likely to choose a path with fewer requirements. When female students reach the age where they begin to feel ostracized by their peers for a passion for science, they have an easy option to transition out of the field completely. Many studies have been performed with the intention of determining social effects on girls in STEM. In one sample, the girls had higher science grades than the boys. Nonetheless, they maintained equal self-confidence and reported higher levels of anxiety and stress because of the class. Many capable young women may be opting out of STEM fields because they feel inferior to their male classmates. Closing the gap between genders in STEM is vital for both women and the success of the fields themselves. The way to do this is through education. In February 2017 legislation such as ‚ÄúThe Next Space Pioneers, Innovators, Researchers, and Explorers Women‚Äôs Act‚Äù and ‚ÄúThe Promoting Women in Entrepreneur Act‚Äù was passed with the intention of encouraging more women and girls to study science, technology, engineering, and mathematics.\\"New Legislation Aims to Boost Women in STEM Education and Careers.\\" Women in Academia Report. BruCon Publishing Company, 6 Mar. 2017. Web. Colleges across the country are implementing outreach programs designed to mentor and recruit female STEM students. One such example is IWITTS' CalWomenTech Project, which increased the City College of San Francisco's Computer Networking and Information Technology (CNIT) program‚Äôs female enrollment from 18.1% to 30.1%.Milgram, Donna. \\"How to Recruit Women and Girls to the Science, Technology, Engineering, and Math (STEM) Classroom: The Absence of Women from STEM Education and Careers Affects More than the Women; It Is a Missed Opportunity for Those Fields.\\" Gale. N.p., Nov. 2011. Web.  The Gender Gap of Attitudes Towards Education  Girls have often received higher grades than boys. Thomas A. DiPrete and Claudia Bachmann say one of the three main reasons for this is because girls show higher levels of attachment to school leading to a deeper sense of gratification when receiving these good grades. Students encourage school involvement if it is paired with the suitable behaviors of being popular, athletic, or participating in extracurricular activities according to Thomas A. DiPrete and Claudia Buchmann. However, girls express stronger connections to their education than boys. 90 percent of eighth grade males responded that good grades are important. 50 percent said that good grades are very important. Girls' value of their academic success was shown as closer to the perceived value of their parents than boys. 95 percent of girls reported that good grades are important to them, and 62 percent declared that good grades are very important. This gender gap continues even when the sample is shortened to just the high achieving boys and girls. This is portrayed by the 2 percent of girls that received A‚Äôs answering that grades are only somewhat important, contrasting the 6 percent of exceeding boys who would agree. 65 percent of eighth grade males see themselves earning at least a bachelor‚Äôs degree. Girls‚Äô educational aspirations are even higher. 75 percent of girls expect to get a bachelor's degree, and 42 percent of girls expect to get a master‚Äôs or doctorate. The gender gap is massive at the doctoral level, seeing how this is nearly 50 percent more than for boys. Thomas A. DiPrete and Claudia Buchmann made the conclusion that since girls typically receive higher marks than boys, and children have a basic understanding that higher grades can lead to higher educational success, that it is reasonable for girls to have aspirations that surpass the boys. Thomas A. DiPrete and Claudia Bachmann said these students‚Äô attachment to school could help one to understand their value of their marks and education. Students who are only drawn to school because of an understanding that it is essential for a high salary career can be said to have an ‚Äúinstrumental attachment‚Äù. They understand school to be an ‚Äúinstrument‚Äù that they use to achieve their goal. In contrast, students may have school attachment because they are invested emotionally and receive a great sentiment of success from it, especially when obtaining positive regard from teachers. Students had answered questions relating to whether they felt attached to their school and teachers. Boys did not show as much amount of attachment to school as girls did. All in all, girls express more support than boys for immediate academic success and long-term scholastic goals . Girls‚Äô inspiration for long-term educational success could also be contributed by a higher satisfaction of school and the instant fulfilment they get from a great performance. Thomas A. DiPrete and Claudia Bachmann believe these two forces could be working in unison with each other.  Consequences of inequality in education  Sex discrimination in education persists beyond graduation, influencing one‚Äôs process of entering the workforce. Networking trends, gender norms, and the perception of parenthood differ based on one‚Äôs gender. A study done by Lindsey Trimble was conducted to understand how gender influences job networking. Through extensive research, the results shed light on a host of variances in both the execution of networking and its success levels between men and women. Firstly, people are more likely to find a job through same- gender contacts (about 65%), most of which are found through social functions that are already segregated by sex. Gender norms influence this networking process as well. Certain jobs are commonly perceived as only being fit for one gender. For example, only 9% of nurses are male, while only 4% of women work in local sheriff departments. Furthermore, women only make up 4% of CEO positions at S&P; 500 companies. Thus, if people are finding jobs through same-gender contacts, these contacts are most likely in gender-segregated positions themselves, perpetuating gender inequality within the job selection process. These gender norms influence how decisions are made regarding whom to network for and whom to hire. People are more likely to help someone out if they think they're fit for the particular job. Gender is often considered to be one of the many indicators of an individual's level of capability. This could lead a contact to assist a man over a woman for careers considered more masculine. Employers decision making process is influenced by gender stereotypes as well. For example, assertiveness is often considered to be a sign of strength or good leadership in a man, yet, on the contrary, can cause others to think a woman is too opinionated or bossy. Additionally, parenthood affects one‚Äôs chance of being hired differently based on one's gender. Fatherhood is associated with a greater chance of getting a promotion, while motherhood decreases promotion rates, especially if the children are younger. Statistically, women experience internal promotion rates that are 34‚Äì46% lower than for men. Another aspect of parenthood that creates workforce discrimination is the presence of a societal pressure put on women to stay at home with their children. Not only could this make employers less inclined to hire a woman for time-consuming jobs, but it leaves a stigma on mothers who chose to work full-time, something men don't experience. Workforce discrimination is the result of a very complex list of causes, including gender norms and stereotypes, networking patterns, and the perception of parenthood. By better understanding these concepts, one can begin to combat them and create more gender equality.

At the time of his death, he was the immediate past chairman of the Uganda Land Commission. He previously served as a cabinet minister in several ministries in the Cabinet of Uganda. From 1962 until 1993, Mayanja Nkanki served as the \\"Katikkiro\\" (prime minister) under Sir Edward Muteesa II, the Kabaka of Buganda, who reigned from 1939 until 1969. In 1993, when the Kingdom of Buganda was re-instated, he was instrumental in the installation of the present monarch, Ronald Muwenda Mutebi II. Background and education He was born on 22 August 1932 to Isaya Sibakyalwayo and Yozefina Nantale in what was Masaka District at that time, but today is part of Kalungu District to parents, Isaya Sibakyalwayo and Yozefina Nantale. He attended Kaabungo Masaka Primary School from 1937 to 1946, Kako Junior School from 1944 to 1946, and King's College Budo for secondary school from 1947 to 1949. In 1950, he joined Makerere University, then a constituent college of the University of London, graduating with a Bachelor of Arts in 1953. In 1954, he was admitted to Keble College, Oxford on scholarship, graduating with a Master of Arts in politics, philosophy and economics in 1960. He also became certified as a barrister following his training at Lincoln's Inn of Courts in the United Kingdom. Early career While at Oxford, Nkangi studied law at Lincoln's Inn of Courts in London, then returned to Uganda in 1960 where he set up his law practice. He also joined pre-independence Ugandan politics. He formed a political party called the \\"United Party\\"; later called the \\"United National Party\\" (UNP). In 1962, he abandoned the UNP and joined the Kabaka Yekka (KY) political party. He was elected to represent Masaka East Constituency in the Ugandan Parliament, in May 1962. Following independence on 9 October 1962, Nkangi served as minister without portfolio in the ministry of economic affairs. Then as the commerce and industry minister. On 17 August 1964, Nkangi, at age 33 years and a bachelor, was elected Buganda's katikkiro by the Lukiiko in a landslide. Looking back, Nkangi says his humble beginnings must have marketed him. \\"The Kabaka did not know me personally.\\" Trouble started in early 1966. On 15 April 1966, the 1962 Uganda constitution was abrogated during a parliamentary session in which Milton Obote, the then prime mister, was surrounded by Uganda Army troops. The Buganda lukiiko (parliament) passed a resolution to eject the central government from Buganda; essentially declaring Buganda's secession from Uganda. In response, Obote ordered Idi Amin, the army commander at the time to attack the Kabaka's palace at Mengo. The assault came on 24 May 1966. Both Muteesa and Nkangi fled to the United Kingdom. Nkangi went via Nairobi, in Kenya. In 1967, Obote abolished the cultural kingdoms and put a new constitution in place. Exile While in exile, he was able to find work as a research fellow at Lancaster University. Also while there, he was able to witness the Kabaka's written desire to have his son Ronald Muwenda Mutebi succeed the Buganda throne, when that time came. After Muteesa passed away on 21 November 1969, Mayanja Nkangi, in his capacity as Katikkiro, proclaimed the death, as is the custom. He returned to Uganda in April to arrange and partly oversee the deceased king's funereal in April 1971. After exile Following the removal of the Obote I regime in 1971, Nkangi returned to Uganda and re-opened his law practice. Although Amin spied on him, he generally left him alone, once he learnt that Nkangi had no plans to undermine his government. Following the overthrow of Idi Amin in 1979, Nkonge formed the Conservative Party (Uganda). When the Obote II government (1980 - 1985) was overthrown by the military junta led by Tito Okello Lutwa, Nkangi was appointed minister of labour, serving in that capacity from August 1985 until January 1986. Under the National Resistance Movement administration, led by Yoweri Museveni, Nkangi served as minister of education, minister of planning, minister of finance and ministry of justice. His tenure in Museveni's cabinet lasted from 1986 until 2001. After his retirement from cabinet, he was appointed chairman of the Uganda Land Commission, serving in that capacity from 2002 until 2012. In 2010, he was appointed Chairman of the Uganda Land Commission, which he held from 2010 until 2013. In later life, he wrote an autobiography, titled \\"Out of Empire into Servitude.\\" Other considerations During his tenure as the minister of education (1986 - 1989), he oversaw the creation of Kyambogo University. While he served as the minister of planning (1989 - 1992), he oversaw the creation of the Uganda Investment Authority. Death He died on 6 March 2017 at Nakasero Hospital where he had been hospitalized since February 2017, at the age of 85. The cause of death was reported to be pneumonia. He was buried on 10 March 2017 at his ancestral home in Kalungu District. Among the mourners were Uganda's vice president Edward Ssekandi, the Katikkiro of Buganda Charles Peter Mayiga, members of parliament and religious leaders.

The completion of the project is contingent on the rezoning of the site owned by Alloy and the New York City Department of Education so that two towers can be built and floor-area ratio can be tripled. Without the rezoning, Alloy will still be able to build a single tower taller than the Williamsburgh Savings Bank Tower, which is over tall. The two buildings will incorporate residential units, two schools, office space, and a retail base. One of the schools will be an expanded facility for Khalil Gibran International Academy, while the other will be a new 350-seat elementary school. Alloy, the developer, is also partnering with BRIC to turn a building on the site that will not be razed into new spaces for the organization. The development is planned for a triangular plot in Brooklyn. One of the buildings on the site, a former Civil War infirmary, will be preserved and re-purposed as a cultural facility. Local community members feared that 80 Flatbush as originally planned would cast large shadows around Boerum Hill and Prospect Heights, since one of the towers was originally supposed to be as tall as the Chrysler Building, which is tall. In August 2018, New York City Council member Stephen Levin announced that he would seek a height reduction. Following a height reduction for both towers, the project was approved by a New York City Council subcommittee in September 2018, and was subsequently approved by the full council. The height of Phase One was cut from while Phase Two was cut from . As of October 2019, demolition of the site's preexisting structures had begun.

The melodrama, Riyasat Mae Riyasat, is an eye opener about the fragile legal and judicious system which has turned a blind eye on the deteriorating situation of the prisons: \\"Justice delayed is Justice Denied\\". The political facts of Pakistan have been brought onto the screen to open up minds against bigotries in all forms. The film shows that there is a cold war between the state, polity and the commoners. The city is being run by the local gang mafias and the police state is helpless. Thus, as per the title, there is a state within a state. Release Network: TV One Global Released Date: August 14TH, 2016 Cast *Munawar Saeed as Abba, *Saleem Mairaj as Tajussus *Rashid Farooqui as Kahil, *Adnan Shah (Tipu) as Khaksar , *Arif Bahalim as Mandoob, *Hiba Ali as Alina Plot Munawar Saeed (Abba) is the Godfather to four young men. The five men are living in a low income apartment, sharing comical jokes in the middle of the night. Their intellect is shown through their dialogue but they seem as though they are typical proletarians in their physical appearance. In the midst of the story, violence has erupted in the city and heavy firing has started right outside on their street. Despite this raucous, they continue their jolly discussions as this kind of event had become routine for them. It was as if nothing has happened. The five men are critical and sarcastically bitter but they continue their routine inside the apartment. Suddenly, a new face appears in the story when they hear a knock on the door. A young beautiful girl (Hiba Ali as Alina) is screaming for help as she was frightened and horrified. The gentlemen allow her to be rescued in their apartment for over the night. This beautiful young girl is initially nervous but then begins to enjoy their unique sense of humor. All the young male characters have introduced themselves as brothers and sons of Abba (Godfather). Abba is a retired University Professor. The four young male characters now start trying hard to impress the girl with their individual bygone acumen (Arif Bahalim is a lawyer, Saleem Mairaj is a journalist, Adnan Shah is a student political activist and Rashid Farooqui is a businessman/Cricketer). During these interesting conversations, the girl has introduced herself as of Pakistani descent, but born and raised in Canada. She had come to visit her uncle, but because of the sudden eruption of violence, got stuck in their apartment. All 5 male characters, keep teasing each other in a unique sarcastic manner in the flavor of local political and sad satire of affairs in Pakistan. They all have interesting views on global politics as well. Abba is a moderator and keeps the young men in control. He is behaving as a true guardian and is very pleasant with the girl. Abba continues to talk about a hidden history. He keeps emphasizing the fact, the history we were taught is fabricated. Hiba Ali first confronted then started accepting the facts. The four young men come to reveal, Abba is not their biological father. They respect him as their Godfather and have complete faith in Abba. She seems highly impressed. She is single, and she has disclosed her status, and all four young men are doing their best in their individual smartness to merry her. They all try to propose her one by one, but every time, ended up fighting within each other. She is enjoying this tug of war, or perhaps can't decide to pick who? All is executed with humor, sarcasm and eloquent prose. In the last third of the film, two of the \\"sons\\" go out to search for the food in the middle of erupted violence. The story now makes a twist. The police tracked one of them (Saleem Mairaj) as he was wanted in a high crime. The police reached the apartment and surrounded the building. Abba convinced all the young men that if they were to fight back, Hiba Ali would get killed with them. They surrendered. Hiba Ali was actually a Police Spy and wanted to get information from these five men, who had been absconded - they were fugitives for a while. She disguised herself, Abba knew from the beginning, she was a spy, but he wanted to follow the rule of democracy, as all four young men had allowed her to be rescued that night. In the end, Hiba Ali comes to find, these five so called convicted fellow men, though highly intelligent were the victims of political differences. They stood against the bigotry. They stood against the establishment. They made ONE mistake: they breached the LAW. She learns from them, the law. The law, which to begin with, has been made to protect: feudalism, few families, and groups - Oligarchy. The story contains three strong messages: *Searching history is an educational process as well as of the utmost importance to find the truth, otherwise, history will be manipulated. *Democracy is defined and has been manipulated by local establishments according to the selfish needs of the oligarchy. *\\"Justice delayed is Justice Denied\\" Awards and nominations *Shaan-e-Awadh International Film Award 2016 Best Screenplay *Shaan-e-Awadh International Film Award 2016 Best Story *4th Indian Cine Film Festival 16 2016 References External links *Riysat Mein Riyasat at the International Movie Database *Riyasat Mein Riyasat Video *Riyasat Mein Riyasat Facebook Page Pakistani television films ","title":"Riyasat Mae Riyasat"},{"id":"53734994","text":"Vikatayogi () is a 1946 Indian, Tamil-language film produced and directed by K.

He is the son-in-law of Nemesio Oseguera Cervantes (alias \\"El Mencho\\"), the leader of the CJNG and one of Mexico's most-wanted drug lords. He was reportedly responsible for managing money laundering schemes for the CJNG. In June 2015, he was arrested in Jalisco along with his brother-in-law Rub√©n Oseguera Gonz√°lez (alias \\"El Menchito\\"), and imprisoned at the Federal Social Readaptation Center No. 1, Mexico's maximum-security prison. He was released a month later for lack of evidences. Mexican federal authorities re-arrested him in April 2016 for his alleged involvement in the CJNG. Early life and career Julio Alberto Castillo Rodr√≠guez was born on 11 October 1976, in Apatzing√°n, Michoac√°n, Mexico. He is nicknamed \\"Ojo de Vidrio\\" (Glass Eye). He is married to Jessica Johanna Oseguera Gonz√°lez, the daughter of Nemesio Oseguera Cervantes (alias \\"El Mencho\\"), the leader of the Jalisco New Generation Cartel (CJNG) and one of Mexico's most-wanted drug lords. According to Mexican government sources, Castillo Rodr√≠guez worked under Oseguera Cervantes as one of the CJNG's financial operators in the state of Jalisco. He also reportedly led a group of hitmen for the CJNG. Castillo Rodr√≠guez has at least one sibling, Fernando Castillo Rodr√≠guez (alias \\"El Toro Valencia\\"), who reportedly worked for the CJNG. On 27 October 2016, the United States Department of the Treasury's Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) sanctioned Castillo Rodr√≠guez under the Foreign Narcotics Kingpin Designation Act (also known as the \\"Kingpin Act\\") for his alleged involvement in money laundering and/or international drug trafficking. This sanction was a result of an investigation done by the OFAC and the Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) office in Los Angeles in an attempt to disrupt the inner circle of the CJNG and affect their finances in Mexico's domestic economy. He was accused of providing material assistance to Nemesio and Abigael Gonz√°lez Valencia (alias \\"El Cuini\\"), the two leaders of the CJNG and Los Cuinis. This sanction was also extended to eight more individuals: Antonio Oseguera Cervantes, businessman Fabi√°n Felipe Vera L√≥pez, attorney Mar√≠a Teresa Quintana Navarro, and five of Gonz√°lez Valencia's siblings: Arnulfo, √âdgar Ed√©n, Marisa Ivette, and Noem√≠, and Elvis. As a result, all of their U.S.-based assets were frozen. The act also prohibited U.S. citizens from engaging in transactions with them. 2015 arrest On 23 June 2015, Castillo Rodr√≠guez was arrested by the Mexican Army and the Federal Police in the Lomas de Altamira neighborhood in Zapopan, Jalisco, along with his brother-in-law Rub√©n Oseguera Gonz√°lez (alias \\"El Menchito\\"). The operation lasted about 20 minutes and no shots were fired. The officers entered the private neighborhood in several vehicles at around 2:15 am. CT and subdued the entrance guard. They then shot the security cameras with paintball guns to obscure them, destroyed several others, and asked the guard to cut the electricity power in the vicinity. As they were in the entrance booth of the neighborhood, the telephone ran but none of them answered. The guard was then asked to kneel down while the officers entered the neighborhood and apprehended Castillo Rodr√≠guez, who was inside a vehicle with Oseguera Gonz√°lez. Authorities confiscated several weapons, including 2 customized AR-15 assault rifles engraved with the insignias \\"CJNG 02 JR\\" and \\"Menchito\\". Castillo Rodr√≠guez had a pending order of appearance in court and there was an open investigation against him for kidnapping and organized crime involvement. Once in custody, he was taken to the SEIDO, Mexico's anti-organized crime investigatory agency, where he gave his statement and was interrogated by law enforcement. He was later transferred to the Federal Social Readaptation Center No. 1 (also known as \\"Altiplano\\"), a maximum-security prison in Almoloya de Ju√°rez, State of Mexico, along with Oseguera Gonz√°lez. Castillo Rodr√≠guez was charged with using ammunition of exclusive military use, having five weapons of exclusive military use, carrying a firearm without a license, and organized crime involvement. =Release= On 1 July 2015, a federal judge from the State of Mexico ordered Castillo Rodr√≠guez's release after concluding that the evidences against him were insufficient and that his due process was violated at the moment of his arrest and after he was in custody. The judge stated that when he was arrested in June, the officers did not have an arrest warrant against him and entered the private property without legal authorization. He also stated that the detainee was in custody for 9 hours and without a lawyer before he was sent to the justice department. When the judge considered that authorities had failed to prove that he was involved in organized crime, he was released from prison. 2016 arrest Shortly before midday on 6 April 2016, Mexican federal authorities headed to Providencia neighborhood in Guadalajara, Jalisco, in several vehicles. When they arrived at the property they were looking to raid, they cordoned the area and entered the building through the front entrance while a helicopter flew over the vicinity. Neighbors stated that other federal agents surrounded the property through the rear and climbed the back walls from other properties. The helicopter then descended at the golf course of the Guadalajara Country Club, where three military vehicles later arrived. At the scene, officials arrested Castillo Rodr√≠guez and two of his companions, √âdgar Ernesto Moreno Barrag√°n and Jos√© Antonio Rodr√≠guez Contreras. It was a joint arrest conducted by the Mexican Army, Navy, the and the Office of the General Prosecutor (PGR); no single shot was fired in the operation and authorities did not consider that the arrest created a risk situation. About 50 officers participated in the operation. Investigators seized four assault rifles, one which was equipped with a grande launcher, and a rocket-propelled grenade (RPG) launcher, similar to the one the CJNG used to shoot down an Army helicopter in 2015. In a bulletin, the government stated that Castillo Rodr√≠guez was responsible for coordinating money laundering schemes and other illegal activities for the CJNG, and that the arrest marked an important step in disrupting the financial, operational, and public relations structure of the criminal group. After his capture, Mexican authorities patrolled several areas in the Guadalajara Metropolitan Area to prevent an aggressive response from the CJNG. The municipal police travelled in groups of three to five vehicles, while the and the military patrolled the streets with a helicopter as backup. Castillo Rodr√≠guez and his two companions were then transferred to the SEIDO installations in Mexico City. The evidence seized at the scene was also transferred to Mexico City for the PGR to investigate. =Legal case= On 20 October 2016, Castillo Rodr√≠guez's wife issued a writ of amparo to prevent her arrest and deposited $MXN24,000 in bond insurance. This request was submitted through an appeal court in Jalisco. She had previously issued another writ of amparo against the National Banking and Securities Commission after the PGR froze her bank accounts as part of an investigation. She owned a sushi restaurant chain in Guadalajara and Puerto Vallarta, a rental cabin business in Tapalpa, and a tequila company in Tepatitl√°n; investigators believed that she was laundering money for the CJNG through these businesses. Two months later, on 30 December 2016, an appeal court denied her writs of amparo.

Many factors contribute to healthcare disparity, including access, behavioral risk factors, family history, social determinants of health (mainly income and education), social and cultural factors, and discrimination in the clinic. There is also a distinction between health disparity, otherwise known as health equity, and health inequality. If one population dies young as a result of genetic or a non-controllable factor, that is known as health inequality. If a population dies young as a result of lack of access to preventative treatment or care once they get sick, that is known as health inequity. Socioeconomic status Socioeconomic status is a strong indicator of health in a community. While the average uninsured rate in Massachusetts is 3.4%, the share of the population below the poverty line and the share of households with incomes less than $75,000 accounted for 85.3% of the uninsured population in Massachusetts. Additionally, the Blue Cross Foundation found that there are four types of communities that can be identified based on their risk of uninsurance: entrenched-risk, unexpected-risk, resilient, and low-risk. Entrenched-risk communities are communities that have a high concentration of foreign-born denizens, and therefore are less likely to be eligible for Medicare. Unexpected-risk communities have high uninsurance but were not expected to based on their geographical locations, like Cape Cod or Boston. Resilient communities are communities that were expected to have high uninsurance but did not, like Worcester and north and south of Boston. Finally, low-risk communities are communities are communities that have high rate of insurance and were expected to have high rates of insurance based on their characteristics. Many entrenched risk communities face a diaspora of problems that stem from their socioeconomic status, including higher poverty rates, lower employment rates, low educational needs, and competing needs like housing that take a priority over healthcare. Thus, there is a compounding of issues that face communities of low socioeconomic status that lead to a lack of both preventative healthcare, and treatment once individuals do fall ill. Racial and ethnic disparities Studies suggest that racial and ethnic disparities are other key factors in healthcare disparities. One indicator of health in a population is percentage of respondents that, when prompted with the question \\"Would you say that in general your health is‚Äî excellent, very good, good, fair, or poor?\\", respond with fair or poor. In Massachusetts, 13.0% of respondents overall had fair or poor health, while 23.0% of Hispanic respondents had fair or poor health. Other prominent areas of disparity include birth indicators and chronic conditions. Black non-hispanics have the highest infant mortality rate of any population in Massachusetts, at 2.3 times higher than the state average of 4.9/1,000 infant live births. Black non- hispanics also face higher rates of obesity and hypertension. Massachusetts has recognized these disparities, and became the first state to mandate collection of race and ethnicity data on all patients with an inpatient hospitalization, an observation unit stay, or an emergency department visit. Disparities in access to healthcare Health equity has two parts - unhealthy populations, and access to healthcare once those populations fall ill. Lower-income families oftentimes cannot pay the out-of-pocket costs associated with healthcare in Massachusetts. Under former Governor Mitt Romney, Massachusetts passed comprehensive healthcare reform intended to cover nearly all of its residents. Massachusetts health care reform successfully covered approximately two-thirds of then-uninsured residents, but significant barriers to access of health care still exist. The primary factor affecting access to healthcare is out-of-pocket cost. In a 2010 study, 34.5% of respondents reported that they had difficulty obtaining care due to the out- of-pocket cost. Even once they had seen a primary physician, 15.4% reported not seeing a specialist due to out-of-pocket cost. Attempted solutions In 2006, Massachusetts passed an expansive health care reform bill. The law had three key components aimed at combating healthcare inequality - mandating that every citizen has a minimum level of insurance coverage, providing free health care insurance for residents earning less than 150% of the federal poverty level and mandating employers with more than 10 \\"full-time\\" employees to provide healthcare insurance.

Birth There seems to be some debate on her exact birthdate but it has been listed on multiple sources as, 1104, 1106, c. 1110, or c. 1120. More research will need to be conducted of contemporary sources to determine the exact date. Family She was the sister of Henri I Lambert de Flotte (c. 1090).

There is debate on the marriage date, and more research will need to be done to confirm the exact date. Some sources state that the marriage date was in 1135, yet it is a disgrace for a countess to bear a child to a count illegitimately. Since her first child with Bertrand I was born in 1130 and he is listed as legitimate heir, this would show that their marriage must have been before 1130. She then became the Countess of Forcalquier upon marrying Bertrand I, Count of Forcalquier. She bore a son, Guillaume IV in 1130, and heir to Forcalquier.

It was published three separate times. Vairas was first established in January 1914 when Smetona departed Viltis; it was discontinued due to World War I. The newspaper was briefly revived in September 1923 when Smetona and Augustinas Voldemaras harshly criticized their political opponents and the Lithuanian government. Due to anti-government rhetoric, their newspapers were closed by state censors one after another, but they would quickly establish a new newspaper under a new title. Vairas was closed in February 1924. The newspaper was reestablished as a cultural magazine in 1929 with the backing of the authoritarian regime of Smetona. In 1939, it became a weekly political magazine that pushed an agenda of radical nationalism and openly sympathized with National Socialism. The magazine was discontinued after the Soviet occupation of Lithuania in June 1940. 1914‚Äì1915 It was established by Antanas Smetona with financial backing of Martynas Yƒças on 5 January 1914 in Vilnius. After a conflict with conservative clergy, Smetona departed Viltis and established Vairas to continue its original mission of uniting Lithuanians, regardless of their religious or political beliefs, and promoting the Lithuanian national identity. Initially it was a monthly, and in 1915 became a weekly. It was frequently illustrated with reproductions of paintings and photos by Lithuanian artists, including Mikalojus Konstantinas ƒåiurlionis, Petras Kalpokas, Antanas ≈Ωmuidzinaviƒçius, Adomas Varnas, Juozas Zikaras, Petras Rim≈°a. The publication was discontinued in summer 1915 due to World War I. 1923‚Äì1924 Vairas was reestablished as a weekly in Kaunas in September 1923. Smetona, the first President of Lithuania in April 1919 ‚Äì June 1920, and Augustinas Voldemaras, the first Prime Minister in November‚ÄìDecember 1918, relentlessly criticized their political opponents, the Lithuanian government, and the Second Seimas. Their publications were closed one after another by the government censors. Using a loophole in the law, they would establish a new publication under a slightly different name. Thus Lietuvos balsas (Voice of Lithuania; April‚ÄìOctober 1921) turned into Lietuvi≈≥ balsas (Voice of the Lithuanians; November‚ÄìDecember 1921) which became Tautos balsas (Voice of the Nation), Tƒóvynƒós balsas (Voice of the Fatherland), and eventually Kra≈°to balsas (Voice of the Country; October 1922 ‚Äì June 1923). In September 1923, they revived the pre-war Vairas. It was double the size of Kra≈°to balsas and was illustrated with works by Petras Rim≈°a, but it also did not last long. In November 1923, both Smetona and Voldemaras were imprisoned for two months for their criticism of the government. Vairas was discontinued on February 24, 1924. It was replaced by one-time publications Skeveldr≈≥ rinkinys (Collection of Fragments; February 28) and Irklas (Oar; March 7). Renamed to Tautos vairas, the newspaper was published from March to fall 1924 when it was replaced by Lietuvis (The Lithuanian). 1929‚Äì1940 Vairas was once again reestablished as a monthly magazine in 1929 in Kaunas. It became a biweekly in 1938 and weekly in 1939. The magazine was edited by Domas Ceseviƒçius, Bronius Dirmeikis, Vladas Nausƒódas, Izidorius Tamo≈°aitis. The Lithuanian Nationalist Union was the ruling party in Lithuania since the December 1926 coup and published its official daily Lietuvos aidas. Therefore, Vairas returned to its roots and published articles on issues of culture, philosophy, science, literature, etc. as well as on questions of social, political, and economic life. It also published works of fiction and their reviews. Its contributors included Juozas Balƒçikonis, , Liudas Gira, , Pranas Ma≈°iotas, Balys Sruoga, , Augustinas Voldemaras. Vairas became more radical in 1938‚Äì1939, and switched from a cultural monthly to a political monthly. A group of members of Young Lithuania, the youth organization of the Lithuanian Nationalist Union, took editorial control of Vairas and became known as varpininkai. The group pushed an agenda of radical nationalism. They were openly anti-semitic, anti- democratic, anti-communist, totalitarian and sympathized with National Socialism. They believed all political parties to be a hurdle towards creating a monolithic state with an unquestioned absolute leader at the top (cf. F√ºhrerprinzip) and saw democracy as a \\"psychosis\\" which the young generation should rid itself of. For example, the magazine published articles proposing economic policies to \\"review\\" property of foreigners and impose special taxes or fines to employers who hired non-Lithuanians with a clear goal of diminishing the economic power of Lithuanian Jews. Vytautas Alantas published an article in Vairas arguing in favor of an ethnic cleansing in the Vilnius Region after it was returned to Lithuania according to the terms of the Soviet‚ÄìLithuanian Mutual Assistance Treaty ‚Äì he cited Nazi Germany as an example writing that \\"the Germans turned the city of Gdynia into the most German city in their country through a fully mechanical process ‚Äì people were moved out and other people were moved in\\". The magazine was discontinued after the Soviet occupation of Lithuania in June 1940.

It is a common and widespread, slender ground orchid with a single leaf and up to five small white to pale pink flowers. It grows in all Australian states except Western Australia and the Northern Territory. flowers with index finger for scaleThomas Chalmers with parson's bands Description Eriochilus cucullatus is a terrestrial, perennial, deciduous, herb with an underground tuber. It has a single, egg-shaped, dark green, slightly rough and hairy leaf which is not fully developed until after flowering, when it is long and wide. Up to five white to pale pink flowers long and wide are borne on a slender spike, tall. The dorsal sepal is spoon-shaped to lance shaped with the narrower end towards its base, long, about wide and forms a hood over the column. The enlarged lateral sepals are long and wide and white to pale pink. The petals are reddish-green, long and about wide and slightly enlarged near the tip. The labellum is white, green or yellowish, long, about wide and fleshy with tufts of short red and white hairs. Flowering occurs from December to June. Taxonomy and naming This orchid was first formally described in 1805 by Jacques Labillardi√®re who gave it the name Epipactis cucullata and published the description in Novae Hollandiae Plantarum Specimen. In 1871 Heinrich Reichenbach changed the name to Eriochilus cucullatus. The specific epithet (cucullatus) is a Latin word meaning \\"hooded\\" and the common name, \\"parson's bands\\" refers to the white (or pink) lateral sepals resembling a clerical collar. Distribution and habitat Parson's bands is widespread in Tasmania, in Victoria apart from the far north-west, eastern New South Wales as far west as Grenfell, south-east Queensland and south-east South Australia. It grows in a wide range of habitats, from grassland to forest and from coastal areas to subalpine zones.

He was remembered for his strong stance against Arianism. His feast day is October 21 in the latest Roman Martyrology.David Hugh Farmer, ed., The Oxford Dictionary of Saints, 5 rev. ed. (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2011). The Roman Martyrology formerly identified Severinus as a bishop of Cologne who died at Bordeaux, leading many scholars to identify him with the independently known Saint Severinus of Cologne, whose feast is on October 23. According to legend, Severinus was taking a walk in a field while still a priest when he heard a voice tell him he would one day be bishop of Cologne. When he asked when that would happen, he was told when his staff buds and flowers. Immediately, he stuck his staff into the ground, it budded and he was called to Cologne.Alban Butler; Kathleen Jones, ed, Butler's Lives of the Saints: New Full Edition (December) (Collegeville, Minnesota: The Liturgical Press, 2000), p. 156. It is now generally accepted that Severinus of Bordeaux and Severinus of Cologne are two different people. According to Gregory of Tours, the glory of Saint Martin of Tours at the time of his death was revealed to Severinus. According to Gregory, he was engaged in fighting Arianism when he heard a voice that told him to go to Bordeaux. He was already a bishop at this time. According to the poet Venantius Fortunatus, he was the bishop of Trier, which had come under Frankish control in 407. At Bordeaux, the sitting bishop, Amandus, likewise instructed by a voice, resigned his office to Severinus, or possibly merely made him his successor.

Club career Miller was born in Edinburgh and began his football career playing with leading local amateur club Civil Service Strollers whilst training as a law clerk. He then moved on to Tranent of the Junior grade, and represented Scotland at that level in three matches. He was signed by Hearts in 1915, aged 20 ‚Äì at his own request, he had an amateur contract in order for him to continue training as a solicitor. By this time World War I was in its second year, and the conflict had a huge impact on Hearts when most of their players enlisted en masse and several were later killed in action. The Scottish League continued to operate during the war, and Miller replaced Harry Wattie (also a product of Tranent, who was one of the players training for the Western Front and who would ultimately perish at the Battle of the Somme). In one of Miller's first appearances in October 1915, Hearts lost 5‚Äì0 at home to Ayr United; however in the very next match they defeated Rangers 4‚Äì0 at Ibrox Park with Willie Wilson scoring a hat-trick. From 1916 Miller served in the 9th Royal Scots Regiment and was promoted to Sergeant. He continued to appear for Hearts when home on leave. At the conclusion of the hostilities in 1918 Miller returned to Edinburgh and was in the Hearts side which was a finalist in the 1919 Victory Cup, and that season he also appeared once for Scotland in one of the unofficial Victory Internationals. Miller continued to play regularly for Hearts until April 1922 when he found the football was conflicting with his legal career, which he did not wish to give up to turn professional. He was then signed by Raith Rovers in summer 1922, aged 28, to play for them while continuing as a solicitor in Edinburgh. This suited both parties until Raith requested all their players to be based near Kirkcaldy which did not suit Miller's other work commitments. In January 1925 he was re-signed by Hearts[A Record of pre-war Scottish League Players], John Litster / Scottish Football Historian magazine, October 2012 for a fee of ¬£1,200, going on to spend six further seasons at Tynecastle before retiring in 1931, aged 36, having made 243 appearances for Hearts (46 goals) in major competitions over his two spells.

Phosphatases are enzymes that catalyze the removal of phosphate from biomolecules. Over half of all cellular proteins are modified by phosphorylation which typically controls their functions. Protein phosphorylation is controlled by the opposing actions of protein phosphatases and protein kinases. Most phosphorylation sites are not linked to a specific phosphatase, so the phosphatome approach allows a global analysis of dephosphorylation, screening to find the phosphatase responsible for a given reaction, and comparative studies between different phosphatases, similar to how protein kinase research has been impacted by the kinome approach. The Protein Phosphatome Protein phosphatases remove phosphates from proteins, usually on Serine, Threonine, and Tyrosine residues, reversing the action of protein kinases. The PTP family of protein phosphatases is tyrosine-specific, and several other families (PPPL, PPM, HAD) appear to be serine/threonine specific, while other families are unknown or have a variety of substrates (DSPs dephosphorylate any amino acid, while some protein phosphatases also have non-protein substrates). In the human genome, 20 different folds of protein are known to be phosphatases, of which 10 include protein phosphatases. Protein phosphatomes have been cataloged for human and 8 other key eukaryotes, for Plasmodium and Trypanosomes and phosphatomes have been used for functional analysis, by experimentally investing all known protein phosphatases, in the yeast Fusarium, in Plasmodium and in human cancer Large scale databases exist for human and animal phosphatomes Phosphatome.net, parasitic protozoans ProtozPhosDB and for the substrates of human phosphatases DEPOD. Non-Protein Phosphatases Non-protein phosphorylation has three general forms * As a regulatory mechanism to control the function of the substrate, similar to the role of protein phosphorylation. Phosphoinositide lipds are important signaling molecules that have a variety of dedicated kinases and phosphatases. * As an energetic intermediate. The phosphate bond is high-energy, so adding a phosphate increases the energy of a molecule, and removal of the phosphate can provide energy for an otherwise unfavorable reaction. For instance Glucose 6-phosphatase removes a phosphate group from glucose to complete gluconeogenesis. * In biosynthesis, where the phosphate is a functional part of the mature molecule, and dephosphorylation degrades it or changes function. Nucleotidases are phosphatases used in nucleotide biosynthesis and breakdown. The human non-protein phosphatome has been cataloged, but most phosphatome analyses are restricted to protein and lipid phosphatases that have regulatory functions. Pseudophosphatases The phosphatome includes proteins that are structurally closely related to phosphatases but lack catalytic activity. These retain biological function, and may regulate pathways that involve active phosphatases, or bind to phosphorylated substrates without cleaving them. Examples include STYX, where the phosphatase domain has become a phospho-tyrosine binding domain, and GAK, whose inactive phosphatase domain instead binds phospholipds.

Ten Thirty One Productions landed what was the biggest investment in the history of the show when billionaire Mark Cuban paid $2 million for a 20% stake. The company used the money to expand operations from California to a national audience, and Cuban helped secure ticket distribution contracts with Live Nation (its CEO became another investor in the company) and Ticketmaster. After the show, the company had to triple its cast and crew to nearly 1,000. Ten Thirty One Productions brought in $3 million in revenue in 2014.

The three most frequent answers were: darkness, claustrophobic spaces and clowns. As of 2015, the attractions employed about 250 actors. To minimize its environmental footprint, Ten Thirty One Productions recycles and composts; features plastic-free concessions, hybrid and electric production vehicles, biodiesel fuels, 100-percent reused or recycled sets and wardrobes, and plant-based concessions; and offers carpool discounts. =Los Angeles Haunted Hayride= Los Angeles Haunted Hayride is held in Griffith Park Zoo in Los Angeles.

Ten Thirty One begins planning each year‚Äôs Hayride in January, writing scripts and designing scenes and props for each scene. Everything is first built in warehouses, and 10 days before opening, pieces are brought to the 30-acre site in trucks and reconstructed there. The event employs hundreds of actors and attracts an average of 15,000 guests each weekend. In 2016, when the event carried the theme \\"Secret Society,\\" attendees could leave their wagons for the first time in the event's history, to have a secret society initiation experience on foot.

In a state that would reflect McGovern's national results, the Democratic nominee did not win a single county in Nevada, making Nixon only the second Republican after Theodore Roosevelt in 1904 to sweep all Nevada's counties.Menendez, Albert J.; The Geography of Presidential Elections in the United States, 1868-2004, pp. 256-257 Statewide Results =Results by county= { width=\\"60%\\" class=\\"wikitable sortable\\" style=\\"text-align:center\\" - ! style=\\"text-align:center;\\" rowspan=\\"2\\" County or City ! style=\\"text- align:center;\\" colspan=\\"2\\" Richard Milhous Nixon Republican ! style=\\"text-align:center;\\" colspan=\\"2\\" George Stanley McGovern Democratic ! style=\\"text-align:center;\\" colspan=\\"2\\" Margin ! style=\\"text- align:center;\\" rowspan=\\"2\\" Total votes cast - ! style=\\"text-align:center;\\" data-sort-type=\\"number\\" # ! style=\\"text-align:center;\\" data-sort- type=\\"number\\" % ! style=\\"text-align:center;\\" data-sort-type=\\"number\\" # ! style=\\"text-align:center;\\" data-sort-type=\\"number\\" % ! style=\\"text- align:center;\\" data-sort-type=\\"number\\" # ! style=\\"text-align:center;\\" data- sort-type=\\"number\\" % - style=\\"text-align:center;\\" - style=\\"text- align:center;\\"   Churchill   2,970   74.10%   1,038   25.90%   1,932   48.20%   4,008 - style=\\"text-align:center;\\"   Clark   53,101   59.06%   36,807   40.94%   16,294   18.12%   89,908 - style=\\"text-align:center;\\"   Douglas   2,898   74.67%   983   25.33%   1,915   49.34%   3,881 - style=\\"text-align:center;\\"   Elko   3,886   72.59%   1,467   27.41%   2,419   45.19%   5,353 - style=\\"text-align:center;\\"   Esmeralda   273   68.25%   127   31.75%   146   36.50%   400 - style=\\"text-align:center;\\"   Eureka   371   72.75%   139   27.25%   232   45.49%   510 - style=\\"text- align:center;\\"   Humboldt   1,659   69.94%   713   30.06%   946   39.88%   2,372 - style=\\"text-align:center;\\"   Lander   798   63.03%   468   36.97%   330   26.07%   1,266 - style=\\"text-align:center;\\"   Lincoln   841   68.77%   382   31.23%   459   37.53%   1,223 - style=\\"text-align:center;\\"   Lyon   2,813   74.58%   959   25.42%   1,854   49.15%   3,772 - style=\\"text-align:center;\\"   Mineral   2,111   73.32%   768   26.68%   1,343   46.65%   2,879 - style=\\"text-align:center;\\"   Nye   1,287   61.61%   802   38.39%   485   23.22%   2,089 - style=\\"text-align:center;\\"   Pershing   853   70.03%   365   29.97%   488   40.07%   1,218 - style=\\"text- align:center;\\"   Storey   508   69.21%   226   30.79%   282   38.42%   734 - style=\\"text-align:center;\\"   Washoe   33,539   66.22%   17,106   33.78%   16,433   32.45%   50,645 - style=\\"text- align:center;\\"   White Pine   2,446   61.27%   1,546   38.73%   900   22.55%   3,992 - style=\\"text-align:center;\\"   Carson City   5,396   71.79%   2,120   28.21%   3,276   43.59%   7,516 - style=\\"text-align:center;\\" !Totals!!115,750!!63.68%!!66,016!!36.32%!!49,734!!27.36%!!181,766 } References Nevada 1972 1972 in Nevada Nevada elections ","title":"1972 United States presidential election in Nevada"},{"id":"53735668","title":"2018 Super Rugby season"},{"id":"53735711","text":"The 1972 United States presidential election in Oregon took place on November 7, 1972.

It was directed by Jim Wynorski. The film uses stock footage from two other films. The car chase scene at the beginning of the film is edited from the 1993 film Striking Distance. Ablaze also uses several footage from the film City on Fire during the entire film. The film also contains stock footage from the 1970s TV Show Emergency! Plot Andrew Thomas is an agent tasked with recording the violations made at an oil refinery that resides next to a suburban town. His brother Jack is a firefighter who has just introduced a new member to his team, Scott, who becomes hostile with fellow firefighter Gary Daniels. Meanwhile, at a hospital in the town, one of the doctors, and Jack's ex-girlfriend Jennifer Lewis, defies the orders of her boss Vivian Sims to help a pregnant woman named Mindi Hunter, who's about to go into labor. Jennifer, and Winslow, one of the nurses, help Mindi prepare to give birth. Meanwhile, a young kid named Barry Christopher accidentally sets his house on fire by lighting a match on a toy plane, and Jack's team is sent by chief Sam Davis to rescue him. They rescue Barry, and he is sent to the hospital with his mother Gwen. Jack is also injured in the fire, and is sent to the hospital. Andrew, meanwhile, finds numerous violations taking place at the refinery, as well as discovering a plot to burn the refinery down to collect the insurance money. The planned explosion soon occurs, and Andrew is injured in the explosion. The assistant of the refinery's manager Curt Peters, and worker Rick Woods take Andrew to the hospital, where he reveals the real motive of his visit. As the fire begins to spread across the city, slowly reaching the town, the refinery's manager Wendell Mays sends Peters, and Woods to retrieve a document from Andrew's office concerning the violations. Peters retrieves the documents, although he's burned alive in the process, and is soon run over by a car, killing him. Woods decides to forget the document, and drives off. Davis orders the hospital to be evacuated due to the fire spreading towards it. He angrily confronts the city's mayor Phillips as a result of his involvement in the initial explosion. Jack recovers in the hospital, and is told by doctor Stuart Ridgley that his brother is in critical condition. He visits Andrew, who gives him one last tearful goodbye before dying. An actress named Elizabeth Sherman enters the hospital, offering to help tend to the injured. Barry experiences an asthma attack as a result of the fire, although is taken care of. Mindi successfully gives birth to a girl named Hailey, and the evacuation begins. Wendell, and Vivian are evacuated in a truck, although one of the buildings they pass explodes, causing the truck to catch on fire, and killing them both. Elizabeth is soon killed in the fire while trying to seek the help of Daniels, and the other firefighters. With the help of news cameraman Tim Vester, Jack manages to evacuate the people in the hospital to various rescue units. However, while racing to the units, Tim is killed by falling scaffolding. Alaina Charles, a news reporter Tim was filming, attempts to save him, only to be crushed herself by another piece of scaffolding. Everybody else, including Winslow, Mindi, Barry, and Gwen, reach the rescue units, and are taken to makeshift hospitals along a nearby river. Jennifer, and Ridgley struggle to reach the units, although Jack rescues them, and he, and his team send off the last unit before a catastrophic explosion destroys the entire section of the city. All of the firefighters survive the explosion, and Jack reunites with Jennifer. In the aftermath of the disaster, Phillips is arrested by Davis.

Reception The film got extremely negative reviews. On IMDb Ablaze holds a score 3.2 out of 10. The blog Crane Shot argues that the film is so bad that is good, stating: \\"Phoenician Entertainment and director Jim Wynorski (CHOPPING MALL) attempt an Irwin Allen-style disaster flick that is just unintentionally hilarious enough to be entertaining. A large cast of familiar faces and the amusement of spotting stock footage from other movies, which Wynorski uses in lieu of filming his own action scenes, provide much of the fun in ABLAZE.\\" References External links Ablaze at Letter Box D * Ablaze at Moviefone 2001 films 2001 direct-to-video films 2001 action films American films American action films American disaster films English-language films Films about firefighting ","title":"Ablaze"},{"id":"53735753","text":"The Chicago Stock Exchange Arch is one of the few surviving fragments from the Chicago Stock Exchange building designed in 1893, installed outside the Art Institute of Chicago, in the U.S. state of Illinois.

He holds an associate degree in information systems technology from Danville Community College, a Bachelor of Science in web development, a Master of Science (M.S.) in information security and assurance from Purdue University, and a M.S. in e-commerce and entrepreneurship from Purdue.  Political career Boykin is a public supporter of Donald Trump. In 2016, he founded the Gays for Trump organization which gained national attention as it solicited support from gay Americans for the candidacy of Donald Trump, mainly through social media messaging and outreach. Gays for Trump also organized events, like the ‚ÄúWAKE UP!‚Äù party at the 2016 Republican National Convention to celebrate Trump‚Äôs nomination as the Republican Party candidate. In attendance were prominent far-right figures, such as former Breitbart news editor Milo Yiannopoulos. In February 2018, he announced that he was running for the North Carolina House of Representatives to represent District 58. After advancing from the primary election on May 8, 2018 and receiving the backing of the North Carolina Republican Party, he lost in the general election on November 6, 2018 to the North Carolina Democratic Party candidate, Amos Quick. =LGBT issues= Boykin has publicly stated he does not like the term LGBT, preferring \\"to leave the T out of it.\\" In a 2018 interview in The Daily Beast, Boykin expressed support for President Trump's ban on transgender people serving in the United States military. In the interview he said that transgender soldiers are ‚Äúmentally challenged‚Äù and too expensive for the military. He also said, ‚Äúpeople already have enough problems with PTSD, I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs a good idea to give someone going through that type of change a weapon. They might snap and turn it on their fellow soldiers.‚Äù The outlet LGBTQ Nation declared Boykin \\"dangerous for transexual People\\", a claim that Boykin has denied. = Alleged attack by Antifa and Black Lives Matter= In 2017 Boykin reported that he was attacked by Antifa protesters and a Black Lives Matter individual while covering the aftermath of the Unite the Right rally, and the vandalism and removal of the Confederate Soldiers Monument in Durham, North Carolina. =Rallies and events= After the election of Donald Trump, Boykin planned and hosted the \\"Gay\\" DeploraBall presidential inauguration event in Maryland, on the night of President Trump's inauguration. There was a series of more than two dozen demonstrations organized throughout the United States on March 4, 2017, in support of President Trump. Peter Boykin helped organize and ran the March 4 Trump event in Washington, D.C., at which Joy Villa and Andre Soriano were keynote speakers In 2017 the organization Gays for Trump organized a \\"Make America Great Again Free Speech Rally\\" on the National Mall near the White House on Saturday, July 1, which 18 people attended. Boykin blamed the low turnout on people celebrating the July 4 holiday weekend. Also in 2017, Boykin was the local coordinator for the Raleigh, North Carolina anti-sharia rally, one of a series organized nationally by ACT for America. Although exact counts were difficult to gauge, the fifty or so people gathered for the anti-sharia event were outnumbered by counter-protesters by a factor of five or six. In the same year he was a featured speaker at the Mother of All Rallies in Washington, D.C. In 2018 Boykin held a second March 4 Trump rally at the Lincoln Memorial in Washington, D.C. The Washington Blade reported that about 100 people showed up around noon to the rally at the Lincoln Memorial, but then only 25 stuck around to march towards the White House after that. He also makes regular appearances at his local Greensboro city hall to talk about various topics. In July 2019, Boykin gave a speech at the \\"Demand Free Speech\\" rally held by the far-right Proud Boys organization in Washington, D.C., where he asked the crowd whether they‚Äôd be willing to ‚Äúlay down your digital lives‚Äù to fight for freedom.

All three forms of vitamin B3 are converted within the body to nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD). NAD is required for human life and people are unable to make it within their bodies without either vitamin B3 or tryptophan. Nicotinamide riboside was identified as a form of vitamin B3 in 2004. In the past, the group was loosely referred to as vitamin B3 complex. Mechanism of action NAD, along with its phosphorylated variant nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NADP), are utilized in transfer reactions within DNA repair and calcium mobilization.  Sources  Vitamin B3 is highly absorbed from food sources such as beans, milk, meat, and eggs. It is also highly bioavailable from enriched flour, which has the non-coenzyme form referred to as \\"free\\" niacin. Cereal grains are not high sources of niacin. The U.S. population on average has an intake of niacin that is well above the recommended dietary allowance (RDA).  Toxicity  The daily limit for vitamin B3 has been set at 35 mg. At daily doses of as low as 30 mg, flushing has been reported, always starting in the face and sometimes accompanied by skin dryness, itching, paresthesia, and headache. Liver toxicity is the most serious toxic reaction and it occurs at doses >2 grams/day. Fulminant hepatitis has been reported at doses between 3-9 grams/day with needs for liver transplantation. Other reactions include glucose intolerance, hyperuricemia, macular edema, and macular cysts.  Deficiency  Vitamin B3 deficiency can cause pellagra, a disease found in many alcoholics in North America. Symptoms include vomiting, loss of appetite, abdominal pain, and general fatigue.

The Rabbits' Wedding was published on April 30, 1958, and depicted the love affair and wedding of two bunnies, one white and one black. The following year it became the center of a controversy in the state of Alabama when Edward Oswell Eddins, State Senator from Marengo County, claimed the book was \\"propaganda for integration and intermarriage\\". Alabama's State Library Agency director, Emily Wheelock Reed, faced censorship challenges over the book at the height of the Civil Rights Movement in the American South. Williams illustrated more than 70 books, the majority by other authors; The Rabbits' Wedding was the last of those he wrote. , according to the Los Angeles Times, it remained in print.  Plot summary  The rabbits live in the forest, where they go on journeys. The black rabbit (male) feels conflicted; finally he reveals why he has been depressed and thoughtful, conveying to the white rabbit (female) that he wishes she will stay by his side forever. The white rabbit accepts the black rabbit's wish and love. A wedding is celebrated and the bunnies dance under the moonlight with the other creatures of the forest.  Censorship  The White Citizens Council of Montgomery, Alabama, attacked the book, claiming that it promoted interracial marriage in defiance of the laws against miscegenation. Against such attacks, the book found an advocate in Emily Wheelock Reed, director of the Alabama Public Library Service Division, whose job it was to provide libraries throughout the state with the books they requested. Representative E. O. Eddins of Marengo County, Alabama, together with the White Citizen's Council, led the battle against Williams' book, and suggested Reed \\"put stock in racial incorporation\\": \\"This book and many others should be taken off the shelves and burned\\". As a result, the library system banned the book from all libraries in Alabama. Reed (who said she enjoyed the book) complied to the extent that she moved it away from general circulation and instead put it on reserve, available upon request; this made the book still accessible to local librarians and thus was not a ban of the book: \\"We have had difficulty with the book, but we have not lost our integrity\\". Before the year was over segregationists again found fault with Reed, who distributed a reading list that included various controversial titles including Martin Luther King, Jr.'s book Stride Toward Freedom: The Montgomery Story. During an interview with The New York Times in 1959, Williams said, \\"[The Rabbits' Wedding] was not written for adults who will not understand it, because it is only about a soft, furry love and has no hidden messages of hate.\\" Williams denied that his story, intended for children ages 3 to 7, was a purposeful anecdote of racial integration. \\"I was completely unaware that animals with white furs, such as white polar bears and white dogs and white rabbits, were considered blood relations of white human beings,\\" Williams commented. Williams further explained to The New York Times: \\"I was only aware that a white horse next to a black horse looks very picturesque‚Äîand my rabbits were inspired by early Chinese paintings of black and white horses in misty landscapes.\\" A play about the censorship controversy, titled Alabama Story, was written by Kenneth Jones and first staged in 2015. Jones said he was inspired by Reed's obituary in The New York Times.

The Embassy of India in Kinshasa, Democratic Republic of the Congo is concurrently accredited to CAR. India also maintains an Honorary Consulate General in Bangui. CAR has no diplomatic mission in India.  History  The Central African Republic and India signed an agreement to hold Foreign Office Consultations between the two Foreign Ministries on 3 September 2010, and the first such Consultation was held on 17 January 2011 in Bangui. Rajinder Bhagat, Joint Secretary (West Africa), MEA led the Indian delegation, while Foreign Minister General Antoine Gambi headed the CAR side. Central African Minister of Small & Medium Enterprises, Deputy Minister for Finance, and Adviser to the President of CAR visited India in March 2010 to participate in the 6th CII-EXIM Bank conclave. Foreign Minister Lt. Gen. Antoine Gambi attended the LDC Foreign Ministers Conference in New Delhi in February 2011. Gambi visited India again in February 2011, along with the Minister of Economic Planning and International Cooperation Sylvain Maliko, Minister for Energy Jean Chrysostome Mekonndongo, and Minister for Communications Michel Koyt to attend the 7th CII-EXIM Bank Conclave for India Africa Project Partnership in New Delhi in February‚ÄìMarch 2011.

Addressing the Conclave, Touadera stated that his nation was honoured to be the guest country at the Conclave, acknowledged the benefits of the lines of credit (LoCs) provided by India, and invited Indian companies to get more involved in Africa. The CAR Prime Minister described Inda's growing influence in Africa as \\"a new eastern wind blowing over our continent\\". Touadera also met Indian Prime Minister Manmohan Singh. The CAR Government also invited India to invest in the country specifically in roads, railways, hydro-power and uranium mining. Parfait Anicent Mbay, Second Vice Prime Minister and Minister of Foreign Affairs, African Integration, Francophone and Central Africans Abroad, visited Delhi to participate in the 9th CII-EXIM Bank Conclave for India- Africa Project Partnership in March 2013. CAR delegate Gaudeuille Nee Medou Juliene Desiree represented the country at the third India-Africa Forum Summit in New Delhi in October 2015.  Trade  Bilateral trade between the Central African Republic and India is comparatively small as the former is a war-torn nation suffering from political instability. Trade between the two countries grew from US$1.13 million in 2004-05 to US$10 million in 2015-16. India exported $9.17 million worth of goods to CAR, and imported $830,000 in 2015-16.  Foreign aid  CAR and India signed a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) in March 2010 to establish an Information Technology (IT) Centre for Excellence in Bangui. On 3 September 2010, they signed an MoU to establish two learning stations under the Hole-in-Wall Computer Education project. The two stations were opened on 31 August 2011. Under the Pan-African e-Network project, India set up tele-education, tele-medicine and VVIP connectivity in Bangui. India extended an LoC of $29.5 million to set up a 400 MT/day cement plant in Bangui. CAR availed a line of credit of $20 million from India for limestone mining for the cement plant in Bangui. The contract for the project was awarded to Indian firm Jaguar Overseas Ltd. In early 2014, however, Jaguar was forced to evacuate its personnel from Bangui due to the instability in the CAR. Officials from Jaguar Overseas Ltd. and the Exim Bank visited CAR in August 2016 to assess the progress of the project. The plant had almost been complete at the time the Indian workers were evacuated, but had since been damaged by rebels. Jaguar Overseas stated that it was considering options to restart the work. India provided CAR with a line of credit of $5.5 million to purchase 100 buses, spare parts, and to construct a bus workshop. India supplied CAR with the buses and spare parts, constructed the bus workshop and handed it over to CAR authorities by 2011. However, the majority of the buses have since been damaged by civil unrest in the country, and , only two of the 100 buses are in operation. Further, the bus workshop was destroyed by rebels. CAR signed an agreement to receive a line of credit worth $39.69 million to build two hydroelectric projects. However, India has put the agreement on hold as CAR failed to repay its pending dues to Exim Bank for previously issued lines of credit. The CAR Government has requested loan restructuring. Citizens of CAR are eligible for scholarships under the Indian Technical and Economic Cooperation Programme (ITEC) and the Indian Council for Cultural Relations. Many Central African women have attended the ITEC training course on solar electrification and rooftop water harvesting at Barefoot College in Tilonia, Rajasthan.  Indians in the CAR  As on 8 December 2016, there are 66 Indians residing in CAR, of whom 45 are employed by the UN peacekeeping mission, MINUSCA. The rest of the community is primarily involved in trading activities. On 26 March 2013, two Indians were shot dead and 6 injured when the vehicles they were traveling in were fired upon by French troops patrolling the Bangui M'Poko International Airport. The three vehicles carrying 15 Indians, as well as some Chad nationals, had reportedly attempted to enter the airport facility when they were attacked. According to the French military, troops assigned to protect the airport had just been fired upon by an \\"unknown source\\" when they spotted the three vehicles attempting to enter the airport. France claimed that the vehicles did not stop even after firing warning shots. Believing that the vehicles were attempting to forcibly enter the airport, French troops then intervened in what they described as a \\"particularly confusing situation\\" and opened fire on the vehicles. The injured were then transported to a French military hospital in Chad. French President Fran√ßois Hollande expressed distress at the death of innocents, as well as his regret and condolences over the killings. The French President promised to investigate the incident, and assured that the injured would receive treatment from French medical teams. In a letter to Prime Minister Manmohan Singh, Hollande stated that he had directed French troops in CAR to ensure the safety of the nearly 100 Indians in the country.

In 1919 the company decided to abandon coachbuilding and confine itself to automotive manufacture; by 1927 the construction of Ford Motor Company Model T motor car bodies had become the company's principal activity and the company was operating automotive distributorships and dealerships. However, the succeeding Model A Ford required an all-steel body, which Ford's US headquarters decided would be made in Canada and assembled in Ford's own factory at Geelong. Since most of the company's income had consequently ceased, the shareholders voted in August 1927 to close the company. Horse-drawn carriages A new wagonette manufactured by Duncan & Fraser, outside the company's factory at 42 Franklin Street in 1905. This type was widely used to pick up passengers from horse trams. In January 1865, coach builder James Duncan and coach painter James Fraser ‚Äì Scottish immigrants to Adelaide, South Australia ‚Äì formed a private company, Duncan and Fraser Limited. They operated initially out of a workshop at 37 Franklin Street, Adelaide, with six tradesment employees, but as they expanded the range of their products their business outgrew the premises and in January 1870 they moved to a newly constructed building with a 100-foot (30 metre) frontage at number 42 on the opposite (north) side of Franklin Street.A Brief Company History Duncan & Fraser At the first Intercolonial Exhibition, held in Sydney in 1869, Duncan & Fraser competed against some of the oldest companies in the Commonwealth, and secured the first prize. The impetus saw their turnover double in one year. Railway carriages A Duncan & Fraser horse tram built in 1887 for the Ballaarat Tramway Co. Limited In 1873 Duncan & Fraser were commissioned to build two railway carriages for the Adelaide, Glenelg & Suburban Railway Company. Trams In 1876 and 1877 the company assembled Adelaide's first 20 horse-drawn trams imported by the Adelaide & Suburban Tramway Company from John Stephenson & Co, New York, United States. During the next quarter century the firm became one of the largest carriage building companies in Australia, building in addition to horse-drawn carriages, many hundreds of horse trams for companies in South Australia and Victoria. In 1884, 16 acres of land was secured adjacent to the Port Adelaide railway line at Kilkenny. After Fraser died in August 1886, Duncan bought out his share from his widow. However, the trading name remained unchanged. This Duncan & Fraser newspaper advertisement showed two types of tram cars built for Adelaide's Municipal Tramways Trust in 1908‚Äì09. Duncan & Fraser diversified into the construction of tram bodies, becoming one of the largest carriage building companies in Australia. The company completed 120 A, B, C and D types for the Adelaide network as well as A, C, D, E, F, G, H, M, N, O, P, S, T, U and V class trams for the Melbourne network. It also built trams for the State Electricity Commission of Victoria's Ballarat, Bendigo and Geelong systems.North Melbourne & Electric Tramway & Lighting Company No 13 Melbourne Tram MuseumHorse Tram No 1 Ballarat Tramway Museum In 1913 the business was incorporated into a limited liability company in keeping with its increasing scope. In 1919 the company decided to abandon coachbuilding and confine itself to automotive manufacture. Cars = Bodies = In 1900 Duncan & Fraser completed its first automobile body for Lewis Cycle Works. =Dealerships= In May 1903 Duncan & Fraser secured the Oldsmobile automobile agency. A showroom, complete with a salesman, spare parts, accessories, clothing and driving instruction was established, a first for South Australia. In 1906, the existing factory was replaced by a new two storey factory. After Duncan died on 2 July 1908, the business was taken over by his four sons, James, Robert, Archie and Richard. Duncan & Fraser secured more automobile agencies, including the Orient Buckboard, Argyll, Standard, Singer, Chalmers and BSA. =Ford= In August 1909, it secured the sole distributorship for the Ford Model T for South Australia and Broken Hill.Ford Model T National Motor Museum Cars being repaired in a Duncan & Fraser workshop about 1925. The Ford Motor Company in Canada was unhappy about most of the Australian Ford distributors selling other makes. Thus Duncan & Fraser annexed the Ford agency. In October 1920 Duncan Motors was formed to sell and service all Ford products with Duncan & Fraser selling all other makes. In the early 1920s Duncan & Fraser secured the Studebaker car agency. The Kilkenny site was sold to Holden Motor Bodies and a new factory specially designed to manufacture cars built in Mile End. Rectangular in shape, it allowed for an assembly line type process, similar to the system implemented in 1913 by Henry Ford in Detroit to manufacture the Ford Model T. On 21 February 1923, the Franklin Street factory was destroyed by fire. Temporary buildings and workshops were rented in various parts of Adelaide. A new three storey factory opened on the Frankilin Street site in August 1924. In March 1925 the Ford Motor Company of Australia was formed in Geelong, with bodies initially built by Duncan & Fraser and supplied through Duncan Motors. By May 1926 body panels were being imported by Ford Australia directly from Ford Canada and assembled in Geelong. In August 1927, Ford Canada announced that production of the Ford Model T would cease. Ford Australia followed suit a week later. All the Ford agents including Duncan Motors were informed that they would not have any Ford cars to sell for an estimated 12 months whilst the factories in retooled for the new Model A.

ESKAPE is an acronym for their names and a reference to their evolved ability to escape the effects of commonly used antibiotics. Enterococcus faecium Staphylococcus aureus Klebsiella pneumoniae Acinetobacter baumannii Pseudomonas aeruginosa Enterobacter spp.  Characteristics  ESKAPE pathogens are differentiated from other pathogens due to their increased resistance to commonly used antibiotics such as penicillin, vancomycin, carbapenems, and more. This increased resistance, combined with the clinical significance of these bacteria in the medical field, results in a necessity to understand their mechanisms of resistance and combat them with novel antibiotics. Common mechanisms for resistance include the production of enzymes that attack the structure of antibiotics (for example, Œ≤-lactamases inactivating Œ≤-lactam antibiotics), modification of the target site that the antibiotic targets so that it can no longer bind properly, efflux pumps, and biofilm production. Efflux pumps are a feature of the membrane of Gram-negative bacteria that allows them to constantly pump out foreign material, including antibiotics, so that the inside of the cell never contains a high enough concentration of the drug to have an effect. Biofilms are a mixture of diverse microbial communities and polymers that protect the bacteria from antibiotic treatment by acting as a physical barrier.  Clinical threats  Due to their heightened resistance to frequently used antibiotics, these pathogens pose an additional threat to the safety of the general population, particularly those who frequently interact with hospital environments, as they most commonly contribute to hospital-acquired infections (HAI). The increased antimicrobial resistance profile of these pathogens varies, however they arise from similar causes. One common cause of antibiotic resistance is due to incorrect dosing. When a sub-therapeutic dose is prescribed, or a patient chooses to use less of their prescribed antibiotic, bacteria are given the opportunity to adapt to the treatment. At lower doses, or when a course of antibiotics is not completed, certain strains of the bacteria develop drug-resistant strains through the process of natural selection. This is due to the random genetic mutations that are constantly occurring in many forms of living organisms, bacteria and humans included. Natural selection supports the persistence of strains of bacteria that have developed a certain mutation that allows them to survive. Some strains are also able to participate in inter-strain horizontal gene transfer, allowing them to pass resistance genes from one pathogen to another. This can be particularly problematic in nosocomial infections, where bacteria are constantly exposed to antibiotics and those benefiting from resistance as a result of random genetic mutations can share this resistance with bacteria in the area that have not yet developed this resistance on their own.  Bacterial profiles  = Enterococcus faecium = Enterococcus faecium is a Gram-positive sphereically-shaped (coccus) bacteria that tends to occur in pairs or chains, most commonly involved in HAI in immunocompromised patients. It often exhibits a resistance to Œ≤-lactam antibiotics including penicillin and other last resort antibiotics. There has also been a rise in vancomycin resistant enterococci (VRE) strains, including an increase in E. faecium resistance to vancomycin, particularly vancomycin-A. These vancomycin- resistant strains display a profound ability to develop and share their resistance through horizontal gene transfer, as well as code for virulence factors that control phenotypes. These virulence phenotypes range from thicker biofilms to allowing them to grow in a variety of environments including medical devices such as urinary catheters and prosthetic heart valves within the body. The thicker biofilms act as a ‚Äúmechanical and biochemical shield‚Äù that protects the bacteria from the antibiotics and are the most effective protective mechanism that bacteria have against treatment. = Staphylococcus aureus = Staphylococcus aureus is a Gram-positive round-shaped (coccus) bacteria that is commonly found as a part of the human skin microbiota and is typically not harmful in humans with non-compromised immune systems in these environments. However, S. aureus has the ability to cause infections when it enters parts of the body that it does not typically inhabit, such as wounds. Similar to E. faecium, S. aureus can also cause infections on implanted medical devices and form biofilms that make treatment with antibiotics more difficult. Additionally, approximately 25% of S. aureus strains secrete the TSST-1 exotoxin responsible for causing toxic shock syndrome. Methicillin- resistant S. aureus, or MRSA, includes strains distinct from other strains of S. aureus in the fact that they have developed resistance to Œ≤-lactam antibiotics. Some also express an exotoxin that has been known to cause ‚Äúnecrotic hemorrhagic pneumonia‚Äù in those who suffer from infection. Vancomycin and similar antibiotics are typically the first choices for treatment of MRSA infections, however from this vancomycin-resistant S. aureus, or VRSA (VISA for those with intermediate resistance) strains have emerged. = Klebsiella pneumoniae = Klebsiella pneumoniae is a Gram- negative rod-shaped (bacillus) bacteria that is particularly adept to accepting resistance genes in horizontal gene transfer. It is commonly also resistant to phagocyte treatment due to its thick biofilm with strong adhesion to neighboring cells. Certain strains have also developed Œ≤-lactamases that allow them to be resistant many of the commonly used antibiotics, including carbapenems, which has led to the creation of carbapenem-resistant K. pneumoniae (CRKP), for which there are very few antibiotics in development that can treat infection. = Acinetobacter baumannii = Acinetobacter baumannii is most common in hospitals, which has allowed for the development of resistance to all known antimicrobials. The Gram-negative short-rod-shaped (coccobacillus) A. baumannii thrives in a number of unaccommodating environments due to its tolerance to a variety of temperatures, pHs, nutrient levels, as well as dry environments. The Gram-negative aspects of the membrane surface of A. baumannii, including the efflux pump and outer membrane, affords it a wider range of antibiotic resistance. Additionally, some problematic A. baumannii strains are able to acquire families of efflux pumps from other species, and commonly first to develop new Œ≤-lactamases to improve Œ≤-lactam resistance. = Pseudomonas aeruginosa = The Gram-negative, rod-shaped (bacillus) bacteria Pseudomonas aeurginosa is ubiquitous hydrocarbon degrader that is able to survive in extreme environments as well as in soil and many more common environments. Because of this versatility, it survives quite well in the lungs of patients suffering from late-stage cystic fibrosis (CF). It also benefits from the same previously mentioned Gram-negative resistance factors as A. baumannii. Mutants of P. aeurginosa with upregulated efflux pumps also exist that make finding an effective antibiotic or detergent incredibly difficult. There are also some multi-drug resistant (MDR) strains of P. aeruginosa that express Œ≤-lactamases as well as upregulated efflux pumps which can make treatment particularly difficult. = Enterobacter = Enterobacter encompasses a family of Gram-negative, rod-shaped (bacillus) species of bacteria. Some strains cause urinary tract (UTI) and blood infections and are resistant to multiple drug therapies, which therefore puts the human population in critical need for the development of novel and effective antibiotic treatments. Colistin and tigecycline are two of the only antibiotics currently used for treatment, and there are seemingly no other viable antibiotics in development. In some Enterobacter species, a 5- 300 fold increase in minimum inhibitory concentration was observed when exposed to several gradually increasing concentrations of benzalkonium chloride (BAC). Other Gram-negative bacterias (including Enterobacter, but also Acinetobacter, Pseudomonas, Klebsiella species, and more) also displayed a similar ability to adapt to the disinfectant BAC.

He is a professor and chair in the department of electrical and computer engineering at Brigham Young University. Education and career Hawkins was born in Rehoboth, New Mexico. He received his B.S. degree from the California Institute of Technology in applied physics in 1994, and went on to the University of California, Santa Barbara for his Ph.D. in electrical and computer engineering, which he completed in 1998. His dissertation, Silicon-Indium-Gallium-Arsenide Avalanche Photodetectors, was supervised by John E. Bowers. He held several jobs in industry before moving to Brigham Young in 2002. He is a past Editor-in-Chief of the IEEE Journal of Quantum Electronics. Research One of the research projects led by Hawkins developed optofluidic single-chip devices for rapid diagnosis of antibiotic resistance in bacterial infections. These devices operate on a sample of the bacteria causing the infection by attaching fluorescent markers to the genes for antibiotic resistance in DNA from the sample, using a laser to illuminate the marked samples, and scanning the resulting fluorescence to detect whether the genes are present. In their work on this project, Hawkins's team discovered that a layer of matte black nail polish with openings in specified locations could be used to make an effective light guide. As well as his work on optofluidics, Hawkins has contributed his expertise to the Biological Oxidant and Life Detection proposed Mars landing mission, working on a mass spectrometry device to measure the size and electrostatic properties of Martian dust. Books With Stephen Schultz, Hawkins is the author of the textbook Practically Magic: A Guide to Electrical and Computer Engineering (Kendall Hunt Publishing, 2013). Hawkins is also the author of a children's book, The Year Money Grew On Trees. The book, based on Hawkins' childhood in New Mexico, follows a thirteen-year-old who agrees to work the apple orchard of his neighbor.

He says that they should not use them until they have been shown the correct way to use them.J. D.

As a result, she is now considered to be \\"among the first female scientific illustrators to use a microscope\\". Her father published De cochleis which included illustrations signed by Anna and her sister. In 1685 the first version of her father's work Historia conchyliorum was published with over 1,000 plates. The plates are thought to date from three years work from 1685 to 1688. Their father put the value of their illustrations as $2000. Because the text of Lister's book was applied directly onto the copper plates it was possible for the Lister family to create the book.The Art of science: a ‚ÄòRediscovery‚Äô of the Lister Copperplates, Anna Maria Roos, 14 December 2011, DOI: 10.1098/rsnr.2011.0053, Royal Society, Retrieved 15 April 2020 Anne and her sisters work was used by their father because he considered that the best engravers were not equally reliable. The illustrations were thought to be essential for the book as her father wanted them to distract critics from his interest in molluscs. He was a physician and he worried that his interest in shells would be seen as eccentric. Her legacy includes the illustrations and engravings that she constructed. The engravings were used in reprints and many of the original watercolours are extant at the Bodleian Library in Oxford. It was believed that the copper plates were lost but her biographer, Anna Marie Roos, found that they were safely stored in the Bodleian Library. Roos believes that one of the copper plates may be the oldest extant that were used for the Philosophical Transactions as all the similar plates were given as scrap during the shortages of World War One.
