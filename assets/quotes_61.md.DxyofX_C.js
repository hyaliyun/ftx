They formed in 1968, with a lineup of singers Russell Thompkins Jr., Herb Murrell, Airrion Love, James Smith, and James Dunn. All of their US hits were ballads characterized by the falsetto of Russell Thompkins Jr. and the production of Thom Bell. During the early 1970s, the group had twelve consecutive R&B; top ten hits, including \\"Stop, Look, Listen\\", \\"You Are Everything\\", \\"Betcha by Golly, Wow\\", \\"I'm Stone in Love with You\\", \\"Break Up to Make Up\\", and \\"You Make Me Feel Brand New\\". Murrell brought Eban Brown in to replace Russell Thompkins Jr. in 2000. Career =Early years= The Stylistics were created from two Philadelphia groups, The Percussions and The Monarchs. Russell Thompkins Jr., James Smith, and Airrion Love came from the Monarchs, and James Dunn and Herb Murrell came from the Percussions. In 1970, the group recorded \\"You're a Big Girl Now\\", a song their road manager Marty Bryant co-wrote with Robert Douglas, a member of their backing band Slim and the Boys, and the single became a regional hit for Sebring Records. Producer Bill Perry spent $400 to record the song in the Virtue Studios in Philadelphia. The larger Avco Records soon signed the Stylistics, and the single eventually climbed to No. 7 on the US Billboard R&B; chart in early 1971. =Success: The Bell/Creed years= After signing to Avco, the record label approached producer Thom Bell, who had already produced a catalogue of hits for The Delfonics, to work with the group.Jackson, John A (2004). A House on Fire: The Rise and Fall of Philadelphia Soul. USA: Oxford University Press. . The Stylistics auditioned for Bell, but he was initially unimpressed. He ultimately agreed to produce the group because he believed in the potential of lead singer Russell Thompkins, Jr.'s distinctive, nasal high tenor and falsetto voice. Avco gave Bell complete creative control over the Stylistics and he proceeded to focus the group's sound exclusively around Thompkins's voice. On most of the group hits, Bell would have Thompkins sing virtually solo. The first song recorded with Bell and his collaborator, lyricist Linda Creed, was \\"Stop, Look, Listen\\". Their hits from this period ‚Äî distilled from three albums ‚Äî included \\"Betcha by Golly, Wow\\" (U.S. No. 3), \\"I'm Stone in Love with You\\", \\"Break Up to Make Up\\" (U.S. No. 5), \\"You Make Me Feel Brand New\\" featuring Thompkins singing a lead vocal duet with Airrion Love, \\"Stop, Look, Listen (To Your Heart)\\", \\"You Are Everything\\", and the Top 20 pop chart hit \\"Rockin' Roll Baby\\" (U.S. No. 14). \\"You Make Me Feel Brand New\\" was the group's biggest U.S. hit, holding at No. 2 for two weeks in 1974, and was one of the group's five U.S. gold singles. The Stylistics also found a path on to adult contemporary airwaves, and the group made Billboard magazine's Easy Listening singles chart twelve times from 1971 to 1976, with three entries (\\"Betcha by Golly, Wow\\", \\"You Make Me Feel Brand New\\", and \\"You'll Never Get to Heaven (If You Break My Heart)\\") reaching the Top 10. Every single that Bell produced for the Stylistics was a Top Ten R&B; hit, and several ‚Äî \\"You Are Everything\\", \\"Betcha by Golly Wow!\\", \\"I'm Stone in Love with You\\", \\"Break Up to Make Up\\", and \\"You Make Me Feel Brand New\\" ‚Äî were also Top Ten pop chart hits. The group also enjoyed commercial success with hits with this material throughout Europe. =Changing style: Continuing international success= Thom Bell stopped working with the Stylistics in 1974, and the split proved commercially difficult for the group in the U.S. They struggled to find the right material, although their partnership with label owners Hugo & Luigi as producers and arranger Van McCoy started well with \\"Let's Put It All Together\\" (No. 18 pop, No. 8 R&B;) and \\"Heavy Fallin' Out\\" (No. 4 R&B;, No. 41 pop). Later singles were notably less successful, but as U.S. success began to wane, their popularity in Europe, and especially the United Kingdom, increased. Indeed, the lighter 'pop' sound fashioned by McCoy and Hugo & Luigi gave the group a UK No. 1 in 1975 with \\"Can't Give You Anything (But My Love)\\". Further successes with \\"Sing Baby Sing\\", \\"Na Na Is The Saddest Word\\", \\"Funky Weekend\\" and \\"Can't Help Falling in Love\\" consolidated the group's European popularity. They are one of the few U.S. acts to have two chart-topping greatest hits albums in the UK. The Stylistics switched record labels during this period as Avco Records transitioned into H&L; Records in 1976. Notwithstanding this, the band began to struggle with increasingly weak material, and although the singles and albums came out as before, by 1978 chart success had vanished. A move to Mercury in 1978 for two albums produced by Teddy Randazzo failed to produce any major success. Russell Thompkins Jr. wrote (in the sleevenotes for the re-issue of the 1976 album, Fabulous) that the group began to feel that the music they were recording was becoming dated, and not in keeping with the popular disco sound of the late 1970s. In 1979, they had a small part in the movie Hair, directed by Milo≈° Forman, where they play conservative army officers. They double Nell Carter in singing a song called \\"White Boys\\". =Later years= In 1980 the group reunited with Thom Bell and signed with Philadelphia International Records subsidiary TSOP Records. They released the single \\"Hurry Up This Way Again\\" that year which brought them back into the R&B; Top 20 (peaking at No. 18). Both James Dunn and James Smith departed due to conflicts over the direction of the group. Dunn left before the recording of the album Hurry Up This Way Again (1980) and Smith after the recording of Closer Than Close in 1981.Taylor, Marc (1996). A Touch of Classic Soul of the Early 1970s, Jamaica, N.Y., Aloiv Publications, The group continued, recruiting new member Raymond Johnson. But Johnson departed in 1985, leaving the group a trio. Love, Murrell and Thompkins continued to tour until 2000, when Russell Thompkins, Jr. left the group. Murrell asked Eban Brown (formerly of The Delfonics; The Manhattans and Ray, Goodman and Brown) to replace Russell as Lead Singer back in 2000. The same year, tenor singer Van Fields who also sang with an a cappella group called A Perfect Blend joined The Stylistics too. In 2011, Fields departed from the group due to creative differences and was replaced by Jason Sharp. The group, prior to Fields' departure, was featured live on the DVD The Stylistics Live at the Convocation Center (2006), as well as with other artists of the 1970s on the DVD, 70s Soul Jam. They recorded their latest album, That Same Way, in 2008. Russell Thompkins, Jr. launched his own group in 2004, the New Stylistics, with the returning Raymond Johnson, plus James Ranton and Jonathan Buckson. They were featured on the DVD Old School Soul Party Live!, which was part of the PBS My Music series. In 2006 their hit single \\"Can't Give You Anything (But My Love)\\" was used as the base for a Japanese advertisement campaign by Gatsby, to launch their new male hair styling product, 'Moving Rubber'. The campaign was successful and featured Takuya Kimura of the pop group SMAP. They were also featured guests on SMAP's television show, SMAP√óSMAP, to promote the 'Moving Rubber' product. In October 2009, they featured on the UK BBC One television program, Friday Night with Jonathan Ross. Their song \\"People Make the World Go Round\\" was used by Spike Lee in the soundtrack for his 1994 film, Crooklyn, as performed by Marc Dorsey. In January 2018, Eban Brown announced his departure to concentrate on his solo career. Since then, Eban has performed solo in many venues around the world, including Wembley Arena and Liverpool Echo Arena in the UK, and the GrandWest Grand Arena in Cape Town, South Africa.

(n.d.) Random House Kernerman Webster‚Äôs College Dictionary. (2010). Retrieved March 15 2020 from https://www.thefreedictionary.com/Aleatoricism or aleatorism, the noun associated with the adjectival aleatory and aleatoric is a term popularised by the musical composer Pierre Boulez, but also Witold Lutoslawski and Franco Evangelisti, for compositions resulting from \\"actions made by chance\\", with its etymology deriving from alea, Latin word for \\"dice\\". It now applies more broadly to art created as a result of such a chance-determined process. The term was first used \\"in the context of electro-acoustics and information theory\\" to describe \\"a course of sound events that is determined in its framework and flexible in detail\\", by Belgian-German physicist, acoustician, and information theorist Werner Meyer-Eppler.Werner Meyer-Eppler (1955) \\"Statistische und psychologische Klangprobleme,\\" Elektronische Musik, Die Reihe I (H. Eimert, ed.) Vienna, p. 22. English translation: Werner Meyer- Eppler (1957) \\"Statistic and Psychologic Problems of Sound\\" (Alexander Goehr, transl.). Electronic Music, Die Reihe 1 (H. Eimert, ed.), pp. 55‚Äì61, esp. p. 55. In practical application, in compositions by Mozart and Kirnberger, for instance, the order of the measures of a musical piece were left to be determined by throwing dice, and in performances of music by Pousseur (e.g., R√©pons pour sept musiciens, 1960), musicians threw dice \\"for sheets of music and cues\\". However, more generally in musical contexts, the term has had varying meanings as it was applied by various composers, and so a single, clear definition for aleatory music is defied. Aleatory should not be confused with either indeterminacy, or improvisation. Literature Charles Hartman discusses several methods of automatic generation of poetry in his book The Virtual Muse. Art  Architecture  Sean Keller and Heinrich Jaeger coined the term aleatory architecture to describe \\"a new approach that explicitly includes stochastic (re-) configuration of individual structural elements ‚Äî that is to say 'chance.'\\" Music The term aleatory was first coined by Werner Meyer-Eppler in 1955 to describe a course of sound events that is \\"determined in general but depends on chance in detail\\". When his article was published in English, the translator mistakenly rendered his German noun Aleatorik as an adjective, and so inadvertently created a new English word, \\"aleatoric\\".Arthur Jacobs, \\"Admonitoric Note\\",The Musical Times '107, no. 1479 (May 1966): 414. Pierre Boulez applied the term \\"aleatory\\" in this sense to his own pieces to distinguish them from the indeterminate music of John Cage. While Boulez purposefully composed his pieces to allow the performer certain liberties with regard to the sequencing and repetition of parts, Cage often composed through the application of chance operations without allowing the performer liberties. Another composer of aleatory music was the German composer Karlheinz Stockhausen, who had attended Meyer-Eppler's seminars in phonetics, acoustics, and information theory at the University of Bonn from 1954 to 1956,Michael Kurtz, Stockhausen: A Biography, translated by Richard Toop (London and Boston: Faber and Faber, 1992): 68‚Äì72. (cloth) (pbk). and put these ideas into practice for the first time in his electronic composition Gesang der J√ºnglinge (1955‚Äì56), in the form of statistically structured, massed \\"complexes\\" of sounds.Pascal Decroupet and Elena Ungeheuer, \\"Through the Sensory Looking-Glass: The Aesthetic and Serial Foundations of Gesang der J√ºnglinge\\", translated by Jerome Kohl, Perspectives of New Music 36, No. 1 (Winter 1998): 97‚Äì142.

Formation Although both hailed from New York City, Jack O'Hara (guitar, bass & vocals) met Austin de Lone (keyboards, guitar & vocals) in Berkeley, California, where they formed a duo. The pair moved back to New York, where they met Brien Hopkins (keyboards, bass, guitar & vocals) who joined to form a multi- instrumental trio, without a drummer or percussionist.Sleevenotes by Nigel Cross to the 2006 Hux Records Re-release They regularly played clubs and bars in Greenwich Village and Long Island, until they acquired a small fan base, and a manager, Peter Kauff. Kauff was also helping Cannon Films to move into the music business, and arranged for Chas Chandler (bass player for the Animals and producer/manager of the Jimi Hendrix Experience) to produce their first album. London Recording started at Olympic Studios in Barnes, London, in December 1970, initially with Les Sampson (a friend of Noel Redding who joined him in the band Road) on drums. They also played several dates at the American Embassy as a trio. Recording was completed in January 1971, with ex-Animal John Steel on drums. The recordings went well, but Kauff fell out with Cannon Films, and advised the band to stay in London, until the problems were resolved, rather than return to the US. Chandler, by now their manager, arranged for the band to play a number of college gigs around the country. Many of these were sponsored by the American Embassy in London, which paid for the band to tour British universities to perform before larger audiences with American poets such as Marilyn Hacker, Denis Boyles and Louis Simpson. By then, the band had moved into a house, 10 Alma Street, Kentish Town, near a pub called the Tally Ho. The band were used to playing in American bars, but in common with most London pubs at the time, the Tally Ho had a jazz-only policy. They persuaded the landlord that they played jazz, although their music was predominantly country rock and blues, and first appeared on either 3 May, or 13 May 1971, with Steel on drums. They soon attracted large crowds - including other musicians, such as Graham Parker, Nick Lowe and Elvis Costello - making Eggs the pioneers of the \\"pub rock\\" movement. Eventually, they were asked to increase their performances, until they were playing three nights and Sunday lunchtime each week. On other days they often appeared at other venues, such as The Marquee, which is where Dave Robinson, Brinsley Schwarz's manager, had seen them and introduced them to the band. Eggs over Easy had a large repertoire of over 50 of their own songs, and 50 covers, and were regularly joined on stage by members of Brinsley Schwarz and other performers, such as Loudon Wainwright III and Frankie Miller. One of the former Tally Ho jazz players, Barry Richardson, was so impressed he formed Bees Make Honey, who were also given a Tally Ho residency, alongside a mix of new and existing bands, such as Max Merritt and the Meteors and Brinsley Schwarz. The number of venues wanting to stage Eggs Over Easy and other \\"pub-rock\\" bands was also increasing, primarily in large Victorian pubs \\"north of Regents Park\\" where there were plenty of suitable pubs. Eggs over Easy toured a chain of London pubs owned by the brewer Ind Coope, and in September and October 1971 supported John Mayall on a UK tour, with George Butler replacing Steel on drums; \\"Eggs over Easy's country rock-flavored repertoire offering a fascinating counterpoint to Mayall's then rampant jazz-blues fixation\\" (Dave Thompson). Kauff had not managed to resolve the dispute with Cannon Films, so the album remained unreleased, and the band had not secured a contract with a UK record label either. As they were having visa problems, Kauff suggested that they return home, so on 7 November 1971 they played their last gig at the Tally Ho, and went back to the US. Return to US Back in New York, Bill Franz joined on drums, they signed a deal with A&M; Records and in 1972 they recorded their first album to be released, Good 'N' Cheap. This was partially a re-recording of the tracks originally recorded in London. The album was produced by Link Wray, at his brother, Vernon Wray‚Äôs studio in Tucson, Arizona, and the band wrote all but one of the songs. In 1973, they moved to San Francisco, and later supported Eagles and Yes on tour, the sort of \\"megastar\\" bands that, back in England, pub rock was seen as a backlash against. By 1976 John \\"Jay\\" David (ex Dr. Hook & The Medicine Show) had replaced Franz on drums, and they issued a single \\"Bar in my Car\\", on Buffalo Records, but the record company \\"tanked as soon as the record came out.\\" Originally titled \\"I'm Gonna Put a Bar in the Back of My Car (And Drive Myself to Drink)\\", the song appears on numerous internet lists of \\"worst country song titles\\" as being from their album Fear of Frying, but this is incorrect. The second album Fear of Frying was eventually recorded in 1980/81 and issued on Squish Records, which also failed as soon as the album was released, making this album a rarity, which has yet to be re-issued on CD. The Eggs were frequently joined on stage by Grootna's vocalist Anna Rizzo and also played with members of Commander Cody and his Lost Planet Airmen in Moonlighters. One of their final gigs was as \\"The Opinions\\", backing Dan Hicks; Eggs Over Easy finally split in 1981. After the break-up, Hopkins continued as a songwriter, O‚ÄôHara became a recording engineer and de Lone played as a session musician with Bonnie Raitt, Nick Lowe, Elvis Costello and others.

It is one of Sony Music's four flagship labels, alongside RCA's former long-time rival Columbia Records; also Arista Records, and Epic Records. The label has released multiple genres of music, including pop, classical, rock, hip hop, afrobeat, electronic, R&B;, blues, jazz, and country. Its name is derived from the initials of its defunct parent company, the Radio Corporation of America (RCA). It was fully acquired by Bertelsmann in 1986, making it a part of Bertelsmann Music Group (BMG); however, RCA Records became a part of Sony BMG Music Entertainment, a merger between BMG and Sony Music, in 2004, and was acquired by the latter in 2008, after the dissolution of Sony BMG and the restructuring of Sony Music. It is the second- oldest record label in American history, after sister label Columbia Records. Artists signed to RCA Records include Britney Spears, Miley Cyrus, A$AP Rocky, Chris Brown, Dave Matthews Band, Craig David, Foo Fighters, Becky G, G-Eazy, Childish Gambino, Martin Garrix, Buddy Guy, H.E.R, Enrique Iglesias, Kesha, Alicia Keys, Khalid, Normani, Pentatonix, Pink, Mark Ronson, Shakira, Christina Aguilera, SZA, Bryson Tiller, Justin Timberlake, Usher, Walk the Moon, Little Mix and ZAYN. History Classic RCA logo, first retired in 1968; revived in 1987 until 2015 In 1929, the Radio Corporation of America (RCA) purchased the Victor Talking Machine Company, then the world's largest manufacturer of phonographs (including the famous \\"Victrola\\") and phonograph records (in British English, \\"gramophone records\\"). The company then became RCA Victor. In absorbing Victor, RCA acquired the New World rights to the famous Nipper/\\"His Master's Voice\\" trademark. In 1931, RCA Victor's British affiliate the Gramophone Company merged with the Columbia Graphophone Company to form EMI. This gave RCA head David Sarnoff a seat on the EMI board. In September 1931, RCA Victor introduced the first 33‚Öì rpm records sold to the public, calling them \\"Program Transcriptions\\". These used a shallower and more closely spaced implementation of the large \\"standard groove\\" found on contemporary 78 rpm records, rather than the \\"microgroove\\" used for post-World War II 33‚Öì rpm \\"LP\\" (long play) records. The format was a commercial failure, partly because the new Victrolas with two-speed turntables designed to play these records were exorbitantly priced, the least expensive model retailing for $395.00 in the depths of the Great Depression. The format was abandoned by 1933, and two-speed turntables were no longer offered, but some Program Transcriptions lingered in the Victor record catalog until the end of the 1930s. During the early part of the Depression, RCA Victor made a number of attempts to create a successful cheap label to compete with the \\"dime store labels\\" (Perfect, Oriole, Banner, Melotone, etc.). The first was the short- lived \\"Timely Tunes\\" label in 1931 sold at Montgomery Ward. Bluebird Records was created in 1932 as a sub-label of RCA Victor. It was originally an 8-inch record with a dark blue label, alongside an 8-inch Electradisk label (sold at Woolworth's). Neither were a success. In 1933, RCA Victor reintroduced Bluebird and Electradisk as a standard 10-inch label (Bluebird's label was redesigned, and it became known as the 'buff' label). Another cheap label, Sunrise, was produced (although nobody seems to know for whom it was produced, as Sunrise records are exceptionally rare today). The same musical couplings were issued on all three labels and the Bluebird label still survives today, eight decades after Electradisk and Sunrise were discontinued. RCA Victor also produced records for Montgomery Ward label during the 1930s. Besides manufacturing records for themselves, RCA Victor operated RCA Custom which was the leading record manufacturer for independent record labels. RCA Custom also pressed many record compilations for The Reader's Digest Association. RCA sold its interest in EMI in 1935, but EMI continued to distribute RCA Victor recordings in the UK and its territories on the HMV label until the late 1950s. RCA also manufactured and distributed HMV recordings on the RCA Victor and custom HMV labels in North America. =World War II era= During World War II, ties between RCA Victor and its Japanese affiliate JVC were severed. JVC's record company is known today as Victor Entertainment and still retains the Nipper/His Master's Voice trademark for use in Japan. From 1942 to 1944, RCA Victor was seriously impacted by the American Federation of Musicians recording ban. Virtually all union musicians in the US and Canada were forbidden from making recordings during the period. One of the few exceptions was the eventual release of recorded radio broadcast performances from the NBC Symphony Orchestra conducted by Arturo Toscanini. However, RCA Victor lost the Philadelphia Orchestra during this period; the orchestra's contract with RCA Victor expired during the strike and when Columbia Records settled with the union before RCA, Eugene Ormandy and the Philadelphians signed a new contract with Columbia and began recording in 1944. Ormandy and the Philadelphia Orchestra would not return to RCA until 1968. =The post-war 1940s= Standard RCA Victor 78 RPM label design from just after the end of World War II until 1954 In the spring of 1946, \\"RCA Victor\\" replaced \\"Victor\\" on labels for shellac 78 rpm singles. In 1949, RCA Victor introduced the 7-inch 45 rpm micro-grooved vinylite record, marketed simply as the \\"45\\". The new format, which had been under development for several years, was originally intended to replace 78 rpm discs.Carson, B.H. et al. (1949) \\"A Record Changer and Record of Complementary Design\\", RCA Review, June 1949, as reprinted by the Audio Engineering Society (retrieved January 5, 2013) By the time RCA Victor belatedly unveiled it, the 45 was now competing with the 10-inch and 12-inch 33‚Öì rpm microgroove vinyl \\"LP\\" (Long Play) discs introduced by arch-rival Columbia Records in the early summer of 1948. In heavy promotion, RCA Victor sold compact, inexpensive add-on and stand-alone units that played the 45 rpm format exclusively. At first, RCA Victor's 45s were issued on colored vinyl according to the musical genre: contemporary pop music on black vinyl (47-XXXX series), prestigious Broadway musicals and operettas on \\"midnight blue\\" vinyl (52-xxxx series), classical music on red vinyl (49-xxxx series), country and polka on green (48-xxxx series), children's fare on yellow (also in the 47-xxxx series), rhythm and blues on orange or cerise (50-xxxx series), and international on light blue (51-xxxx series). This array of colors complicated the production process, and the practice was soon discontinued, all records becoming black. Yellow and red held on until about 1952. The first 45 rpm record manufactured was \\"PeeWee the Piccolo\\" RCA Victor 47-0147 pressed December 7, 1948 at the Sherman Avenue plant Indianapolis, R.O. Price, plant manager.Indiana State Museum document no. 71.2010.098.0001 The use of vinyl, which was much more expensive than the gritty shellac compound normally used for 78s, was actually cheaper because of the smaller diameter and greatly reduced bulk of the new records, which required very little raw material. The smaller, lightweight discs were also more economical to store and ship. RCA Victor marketed the 45 as a direct replacement for 10-inch and 12-inch 78 rpm records, which typically played for about three and four minutes per side respectively. The company also released some \\"extended play\\" (EP) 45s with playing times up to 7 minutes per side, primarily for some vocal collections and light classical selections, as typified by an Arthur Fiedler and the Boston Pops Orchestra disc featuring Tchaikovsky's Marche Slave and Ket√®lbey's In a Persian Market. Boxed sets of four to six 45s were issued, each set providing about the same amount of music as one LP. (An extreme case of these boxed sets was the complete recording of the opera Carmen, conducted by Fritz Reiner, which consisted of sixteen 45 rpm discs.) In the case of operas, symphonies and other complete recordings of classical music, there was an interruption every four minutes as one record side ended and another was started up. These disruptive \\"side breaks\\", a nuisance long familiar to listeners of album sets of classical and operatic 78 rpm records, were minimized by an extremely fast automatic record-changing mechanism that was a core feature of RCA Victor's 45 players. Thanks in large degree to RCA Victor's massive five million dollar advertising campaign, the 45 became the preferred speed for pop music singles, overtaking U.S. sales of the same material on 78s by 1954, but Columbia's LP prevailed as the format for classical music and convenient one-disc \\"album\\" collections of eight or more pop songs. RCA Victor finally bowed to the inevitable and announced its intention to issue LPs in January, 1950. =The 1950s= Finally acknowledging the success of Columbia's LP format and fearful of losing further market share, RCA Victor began issuing LPs itself. Among the first RCA Victor LPs released in 1950 was a performance of Ga√Æt√© Parisienne by Jacques Offenbach, played by Arthur Fiedler and the Boston Pops Orchestra, which had actually been recorded in Boston's Symphony Hall on June 20, 1947; it was given the catalogue number LM-1001. Non-classical albums were issued with the prefix \\"LPM\\". When RCA Victor later issued classical stereo albums (in 1958), they used the prefix \\"LSC\\". Non-classical stereo albums were issued with the prefix \\"LSP\\". RCA utilized these catalog prefixes until 1973. In the 1950s, RCA Victor had three subsidiary or specialty labels: Groove, Vik and \\"X\\". The edition of Billboard magazine dated April 11, 1953, announced a new RCA Victor subsidiary label, its first to use independent distribution and was nameless when it was first revealed. For the lack of any better designation, Billboard chose to refer to the new, unnamed label in the story as Label ‚ÄúX‚Äù; the new label began to hire staffers and decide on a direction, and the name stuck until 1955. RCA Victor officially announced the formation of label \\"X\\" on April 20, 1953. Groove was an R&B; specialty label founded in 1954 and folded into Vik in 1957; the Vik label was discontinued the following year. From the label's beginnings in 1902, and intensifying through the 1940s and 1950s, RCA Victor was in direct competition with Columbia Records. A number of recordings were made with the NBC Symphony Orchestra, conducted by Arturo Toscanini; sometimes RCA Victor utilized recordings of broadcast concerts (Toscanini had been recording for the label since the days of acoustic recordings, and RCA Victor had been recording the NBC Symphony since its creation in 1937). After Toscanini retired in the spring of 1954, the NBC Symphony was reorganized later that year as the Symphony of the Air. The orchestra, while no longer connected to NBC, continued to record for RCA Victor, as well as other labels, usually conducted by Leopold Stokowski. RCA Victor also released a number of recordings with the RCA Victor Symphony Orchestra, which was usually drawn from either Philadelphia or New York musicians, as well as members of the Symphony of the Air, and the orchestra of the Metropolitan Opera. By the late 1950s, RCA Victor had fewer high prestige orchestras under contract than Columbia had: RCA Victor recorded the Chicago Symphony Orchestra, the Boston Symphony Orchestra, and the Boston Pops, whereas Columbia had the Cleveland Orchestra, the Philadelphia Orchestra, and the New York Philharmonic Orchestra under contracts. On October 6, 1953, RCA Victor held experimental stereophonic sessions in New York City's Manhattan Center with Leopold Stokowski conducting a group of New York City musicians in performances of George Enescu's Roumanian Rhapsody No. 1 and the waltz from Tchaikovsky's opera Eugene Onegin. There were additional stereo tests in December, again in the Manhattan Center, this time with Pierre Monteux conducting members of the Boston Symphony Orchestra. In February 1954, RCA Victor made its first commercial stereophonic recordings, taping the Boston Symphony Orchestra, conducted by Charles M√ºnch, in a performance of The Damnation of Faust by Hector Berlioz. This began a practice of simultaneously recording orchestras with both stereophonic and monaural equipment. Other early stereo recordings were made of Toscanini's final NBC concerts (never officially issued) and Guido Cantelli respectively, with the NBC Symphony Orchestra; the Boston Pops Orchestra under Arthur Fiedler; and the Chicago Symphony Orchestra under Fritz Reiner. Initially, RCA used RT-21 quarter-inch tape recorders (which ran at 30 inches per second), wired to mono mixers, with Neumann U-47 cardioid and M-49/50 omnidirectional microphones. Then they switched to an Ampex 300‚Äì3 one-half inch machine, running at 15 inches per second (which was later increased to 30 inches per second). These recordings were initially issued in 1955 on special stereophonic reel-to-reel tapes and then, beginning in 1958, on vinyl LPs with the \\"Living Stereo\\" logo. RCA has continued to reissue many of these recordings on CD.The History of Living Stereo, RCA Victor liner notes Another 1953 project for RCA was converting the acoustically superior building Webster Hall into its main East Coast recording studio. RCA operated this studio venue from 1953 to 1968. In September 1954, RCA Victor introduced \\"Gruve-Gard\\" where the center and edge of a record are thicker than the playing area, reducing scuff marks during handling and when stacked on a turntable with an automatic record changer. Most competitors quickly adopted the raised label and edges. In 1955, RCA Victor purchased the recording contract of Elvis Presley from Sun Records for the then-astronomical sum of $35,000. Presley would become RCA Victor's biggest-selling recording artist. His first gold record was \\"Heartbreak Hotel\\", recorded in January 1956. RCA Victor would sell ten million Presley singles during 1956. RCA began making plans in 1955 to establish its own European presence issuing records on the RCA and RCA Victor labels. In 1956, effective in 1957, RCA ended its 55-year association with EMI/HMV, after EMI's acquisition of Capitol Records. Capitol then became the main distributor for EMI recordings in North and South America, with RCA Victor distributing its recordings through Decca Records in the United Kingdom on the RCA label, using the RCA lightning bolt logo, instead of the Nipper/His Master's Voice trademark for which EMI held the rights. RCA set up its own British distribution in 1969. RCA Victor issued several spoken word albums in the 1950s and 60s, notably the soundtracks of the films Richard III, A Man for All Seasons and The Taming of the Shrew, as well as complete versions of the National Theatre of Great Britain stage productions of Othello (starring Laurence Olivier) and Much Ado About Nothing (starring Maggie Smith, who also played Desdemona in the Olivier Othello). None of these albums have appeared on compact disc, but the films of Richard III, A Man For All Seasons, The Taming of the Shrew and the filmed version of Olivier's Othello have all been issued on DVD. =The 1960s= In 1960, RCA Victor announced the Compact 33 double extended play and singles; these were 7 inch records, which played at 33 1/3 rpm. In January 1961, the Compact 33 discs were released simultaneously with their 45 rpm counterparts. The long-term goal was to phase out the 45 rpm disc, but sales of the new records were poor and by early 1962 the campaign had failed. In 1963, RCA Victor introduced Dynagroove which added computer technology to the disc cutting process, ostensibly to improve sound reproduction. Whether it was actually an improvement or not is still debated among audiophiles. RCA quietly discontinued Dynagroove around 1970. In September 1965, RCA and Lear Jet Corp. teamed up to release the first stereo 8-track tape music Cartridges (Stereo 8) which were first used in the 1966 line of Ford automobiles and were popular throughout the late 1960s and 1970s. (The initial release comprised 175 titles from RCA Victor and RCA Camden's catalog of artists.) In 1968, the RCA Corporation modernized its image with what was then a new futuristic-looking logo (the letters 'RCA' in block, modernized form), replacing the old lightning bolt logo, and the virtual retirement of both the Victor and Nipper/His Master's Voice trademarks. The RCA Victor Division was now known as RCA Records, 'Victor' now restricted to the album covers and labels of RCA's regular popular record releases, while the Nipper/His Master's Voice trademark was seen only on the album covers of Red Seal records. The color of the labels, which had always been black for the popular series (as opposed to the Red Seal line), was changed to a bright orange or yellow (becoming tan briefly later in 1975‚Äì76). In late 1969, RCA Records introduced a very thin, lightweight vinyl LP known as Dynaflex. This type of pressing claimed to overcome warping and other problems in conventional thicker pressings, but it had a controversial reputation in the industry and was abandoned by the late 1970s. =The 1970s= Platinum record of album Nilsson Schmilsson, featuring the 1968‚Äì75 Orange RCA Victor label In April 1970, RCA Records announced the first quadraphonic 4-channel 8-track tape cartridges (\\"Quad-8\\", later called just Q8). RCA began releasing quadraphonic vinyl recordings in the United States in February 1973, in the CD-4 format developed by its former subsidiary Japan Victor Corporation (JVC), and made commercially practical by Quadracast Systems Inc. (QSI). RCA's trade name became \\"Quadradisc\\". The CD-4 format required a special cartridge that had a ¬±1 db frequency response out to 50 kHz, a CD-4 demodulator which decoded the difference between the front and rear channels from a 30 kHz subcarrier, four separate amplifier channels, and four separate speakers for the left and right front and left and right rear. Both the CD-4 Quadradisc and Quad-8 tape cartridge systems were true discrete 4‚Äì4‚Äì4 quadraphonic systems. Columbia introduced a quadraphonic matrix system, SQ, which required a decoder, 4-channel amplifier and the four speakers. The SQ system was referred to as a 4‚Äì2‚Äì4 matrix system. The Warner Music Group labels also adopted Quadradisc, but the format never became popular, and both RCA and Columbia abandoned quadraphonic recording by 1976; some of the RCA sessions were later remastered for Dolby encoding (same as Peter Scheiber's original matrix system) and released on CD. This included Charles Gerhardt's acclaimed series of RCA Red Seal albums devoted to classic film scores by Erich Wolfgang Korngold, Alfred Newman, Dimitri Tiomkin, Max Steiner, Franz Waxman, and others, performed by the National Philharmonic Orchestra and recorded in London's Kingsway Hall. In order to publish music in Japan, RCA collaborated with the Victor Company of Japan's publishing wing Victor Musical Industries Inc. in 1975 to found Japanese record label RVC.https://www.discogs.com/label/40355-RVC-Corporation Beginning in late 1976, the RCA Corporation revived the Nipper/His Master's Voice trademark. RCA Records reinstated Nipper to most (Victor, Victrola, Red Seal and Special Products) record labels (in addition to returning to the traditional black label color for popular releases) in countries where RCA held the rights to the Nipper/His Master's Voice trademark. Nipper was once again widely used in RCA newspaper and magazine advertisements as well as store displays and promotional items such as T-shirts, posters, watches, coffee mugs and stuffed toys. The trademark was also painted on RCA delivery and service trucks. =The 1980s= In 1983, Arista Records owner Bertelsmann sold 50% of Arista to RCA. In 1985, Bertelsmann and RCA Records formed a joint venture called RCA/Ariola International. The following year, RCA Corporation was acquired by General Electric (GE) and it sold its 50% interest in RCA Records to its partner Bertelsmann. The company was renamed BMG Music for Bertelsmann Music Group. BMG revived the old RCA \\"lightning bolt\\" logo that was retired in 1968 to differentiate RCA Records from the other RCA divisions, which GE either liquidated, sold, or closed. BMG also revived the \\"RCA Victor\\" label for Red Seal, Broadway and soundtrack releases and other musical genres outside of rock, pop and country music. In 1986, Bob Buziak, formerly an artist manager, was appointed president of the label. During the mid-1980s, RCA Records operated at a deficit, due in part to \\"overpriced deals\\" with pop stars including Kenny Rogers and Diana Ross. In 1986, the label bought back $25 million in unsold albums and lost $35 million during the fiscal year 1987. As a partial corrective, a decentralized style of management which allowed RCA Records to function as a free-standing entrepreneurial business was implemented for 1988. Buziak drastically cut the RCA roster from around 40 acts to 11, and began to rebuild it with a focus on developing artists, including artists acquired through marketing and distribution agreements with Beggars Banquet Records and Jive Records, whose roster included Schooly D, Kool Moe Dee, and DJ Jazzy Jeff & The Fresh Prince. By the end of the fiscal year 1988, RCA Records had gross revenue of $236 million in the United States, its most profitable year to date. Bruce Hornsby's The Way It Is sold more than three million albums, and the soundtrack for the film Dirty Dancing, which cost RCA $200,000 to produce, sold 15.6 million copies in less than two years. Its follow-up, More Dirty Dancing, composed of song tracks which had been left out of the first album, was produced for $80,000 and went on to sell more than 5.6 million. Among the most successful acts for RCA Records during the 1980s were the Eurythmics, Love and Rockets, Joshua Perahia, Rick Astley, Dolly Parton, Juice Newton, and Bucks Fizz. =The 1990s= In August 1990 Buziak was replaced by Joe Galante, who had been the president of RCA Records Nashville division. The roster was cut once again and the A&R; department was restructured. Along with the launch of BNA Records and the expansion of the urban music division, these initiatives would prove to be positive, but RCA was unsuccessful under Galante, ranking 10th in market share in 1995. Galante returned to head the Nashville division and was replaced in March 1995 by the president of RCA Records Canada, Bob Jamieson. Jamieson overhauled RCA, eliminating a layer of middle management and retooling the label's marketing department. The A&R; department was again restructured and the artist roster cut. By the close of the decade, RCA Records had undergone what Billboard described as a \\"remarkable turnaround\\" with the success of artists including Britney Spears, The Dave Matthews Band, Natalie Imbruglia, The Verve Pipe, Robyn, SWV, Christina Aguilera, NSYNC, and Foo Fighters. A distribution deal with Loud Records yielded hit records from urban artists including Big Punisher, Wu-Tang Clan and Mobb Deep. =The 2000s= In 2002, BMG fully acquired J Records, which it had founded in 2000 as a joint venture with Clive Davis. Davis was then named chairman of RCA Records and J Records under the auspices of a new entity, the RCA Music Group, which included RCA Records, J, and Arista Records. In 2004, Sony and BMG merged their music divisions to create Sony BMG, and in 2007, the RCA Music Group was rebranded as the BMG Label Group. In 2006, Sony BMG merged its former Broadway music and classical labels, including Red Seal and Gold Seal, to Sony Masterworks. Legacy Recordings, Sony Music Entertainment's catalog division, reissues classic albums for RCA. In April 2008, former Zomba Label Group president and CEO Barry Weiss was appointed chairman of the BMG Label Group, and Davis was named chief creative officer of Sony BMG worldwide. In October, Sony acquired BMG's 50% ownership and the BMG Label Group was merged with the Jive Label Group to establish the RCA/Jive Label Group. It included RCA, Jive, J, Arista, Polo Grounds, LaFace Records, Volcano Entertainment, Hitz Committee, Battery Records, and the Verity Gospel Music Group. The decade marked a period during which RCA Records had notable success in the pop genre, with Christina Aguilera, NSYNC, Kesha, Pink, Kelly Clarkson and Pitbull scoring multiple #1 hits on the Billboard Hot 100 charts. NSYNC's No Strings Attached broke sales records, selling more than a million singles in one day and 2.3 million albums in one week. It was the top-selling album of the decade. =The 2010s= In May 2011, Doug Morris was appointed chairman of Sony Music Entertainment. Focused on A&R;, Morris named J/RCA A&R; president Peter Edge chairman and CEO of RCA Music Group. Tom Corson was named president and COO. In October of that year, the Jive, Arista and J imprints were folded into RCA, and RCA Music Group was renamed RCA Records, making it a standalone label under the Sony Music umbrella. Multiple artists from the Jive, Arista and J imprints were shifted to RCA. During the first half of the decade, RCA released platinum and multi-platinum records by artists including A$AP Rocky, Cage the Elephant, Chris Brown, Kelly Clarkson, Miley Cyrus, D'Angelo, Dave Matthews Band, Foo Fighters, G-Eazy, Jennifer Hudson, R. Kelly, Kesha, Khalid, Alicia Keys, Kings of Leon, Miguel, Pentatonix, P!nk, Pitbull, Shakira, Sia, Britney Spears, Bryson Tiller, Justin Timberlake, T-Pain, and Tinashe. Since 2015, the label has released music by artists including: Alessia Cara, A$AP Ferg, Becky G, Brockhampton, Bryson Tiller, G-Eazy, Childish Gambino, H.E.R. Bleachers, Normani, Kaytranada, Khalid, Kygo, Martin Garrix, Mark Ronson, and ZAYN. In 2015, RCA reinstated its classic 1968 space-age 'RCA' styled logo after utilizing its old lightning bolt logo since 1987. The lightning bolt logo is still used by RCA's Nashville division. John Fleckenstein and Joe Riccitelli were appointed as co-presidents of RCA Records in January 2018. Later that year, RCA named Keith Naftaly president of A&R;, and Tunji Balogun executive VP of A&R.; Broadway and Hollywood RCA Victor has produced several notable Broadway cast albums, among them the original Broadway recordings of Brigadoon, Paint Your Wagon, the Mary Martin Peter Pan, Damn Yankees, Hello, Dolly!, Oliver!, and Fiddler on the Roof. RCA has also recorded and released recordings of revival stagings of musicals. These include the musical productions staged at Lincoln Center, such as the 1966 revivals of Show Boat and Annie Get Your Gun, the 1987 revival of Anything Goes and the 1998 Broadway revivals of Cabaret and The Sound of Music. Call Me Madam was recorded by RCA Victor with all of its original cast except for its star Ethel Merman, who, due to contractual obligations, could not be released from her American Decca Records contract. She was replaced on the RCA Victor album by Dinah Shore. RCA Victor was also responsible for the film soundtrack albums of Damn Yankees, South Pacific, Bye Bye Birdie, Half a Sixpence, and The Sound of Music. The album made from the 1965 hit Julie Andrews film was (and is) one of the best selling soundtracks of all time. The film soundtrack of Oliver!, made by Colgems Records, was distributed by RCA, which had released the Broadway cast album. RCA Victor also released the original American cast album of Hair. Similarly, RCA Victor also made several studio cast recording albums, including a Lerner and Loewe series with Jan Peerce, Jane Powell, and Robert Merrill, as well as a 1963 album of excerpts from George Gershwin's Porgy and Bess, with its 1952 revival leads, Leontyne Price and William Warfield, but a different supporting cast. They also issued two studio cast versions of Show Boat, one with Robert Merrill, Patrice Munsel, and Rise Stevens in 1956, and the other with Howard Keel, Anne Jeffreys, and Gogi Grant in 1958. Unfortunately, contrary to the way the show is written, both of these Show Boat albums featured all-white casts, reflecting the era of racial segregation. In 2006, Sony BMG merged its Broadway music labels, including RCA Victor, to the new Masterworks Broadway Records. All of these recordings are now on Masterworks Broadway Records, which has remastered and reissued many of these albums. Criticism and controversies =Kelly Clarkson= In the summer of 2007, Kelly Clarkson and Clive Davis, then head of Sony BMG, feuded publicly regarding the direction of her album My December, the follow-up to Clarkson's multi-platinum album, Breakaway. Clarkson wrote the songs on My December, \\"showcasing her own songwriting on darker, edgier rock-oriented fare\\", and Davis insisted Clarkson work with hired hitmakers, as she had previously, on \\"polished, radio-friendly songs\\". Clarkson refused to change the album, and it was released in June 2007. It has since been certified platinum. =Avril Lavigne= In November 2010, Avril Lavigne stated that the long delay of her fourth album, Goodbye Lullaby, was due to \\"a bunch of bureaucratic BS\\" related to RCA. The album was ultimately released in March 2011. In October 2011, Lavigne confirmed that she had left RCA and signed with sister label Epic Records. =Kenny Rogers= After Kenny Rogers left the label, he accused RCA for trying to ruin his career. Rogers signed to RCA in 1982 for an advance sum of $20 million (the largest deal ever in country music at that time) when Bob Summer was head of the label. =Other notable events= Sergei Rachmaninoff's studio master recordings were believed destroyed in the demolition of RCA Victor's Camden warehouse In the early 1920s, Victor was slow about getting deeply involved in recording and marketing black jazz and vocal blues. By the mid-to-late 1920s, Victor had signed Jelly Roll Morton, Bennie Moten, Duke Ellington and other black bands, and was becoming very competitive with Columbia and Brunswick, even starting their own V-38000 \\"Hot Dance\\" series that was marketed to all Victor dealers. They also had a V-38500 \\"race\\" (race records) series, a 23000 'hot dance' continuation of the V-38000 series, as well as a 23200 'Race' series with blues, gospel and some hard jazz. However, throughout the 1930s, Victor's involvement in jazz and blues slowed down and by the time of the musicians' strike and the end of the war, Victor was neglecting the R&B; (race) scene, which is one of the reasons so many independent companies sprang up so successfully. In the early 1960s, Victor decided to demolish its Camden warehouse. This warehouse reportedly held four floors' worth of catalog and vault masters (most of them were pre-tape wax and metal discs), test pressings, lacquer discs, matrix ledgers, and rehearsal recordings. The company retained some of the more important masters (such as those by Enrico Caruso; why Rachmaninoff's apparently weren't saved is a mystery), but it is uncertain just how many others were saved or lost. A few days before the demolition took place, some collectors from the US and Europe were allowed to go through the warehouse and salvage whatever they could carry with them for their personal collections. Soon afterward, record collectors and RCA Victor officials watched from a nearby bridge as the warehouse was dynamited, with many studio masters still intact in the building. The remnants were bulldozed into the Delaware River and a pier was built on top of them. In 1973, to celebrate the centenary of Rachmaninoff's birth, RCA decided to reissue his complete recordings on LP; RCA was forced to go to collectors for copies of certain records because their archives were incomplete, as documented in a Time magazine article.

They were part of the mod subculture, and played soul music-influenced pop music. Career The band was formed as The Boys in August 1963, in Kentish Town, North West London. The original members were Reg King (lead vocals), Alan 'Bam' King (rhythm guitar, vocals), Mike \\"Ace\\" Evans (bass guitar, vocals) and Roger Powell (drums). They had a brief spell as a bar band in Germany, and then as a backing band for Sandra Barry, (sometimes referred to as Sandra Barry and the Boyfriends) playing on her single \\"Really Gonna Shake\\" in 1964. After the stint with Barry, Pete Watson was recruited as lead guitarist, and in 1964 they changed their name to The Action. Shortly after their name change, they signed to Parlophone with producer George Martin. \\"Land of a Thousand Dances\\" b/w \\"In My Lonely Room\\" was well received by critics, but sold poorly. None of The Action's singles achieved success in the UK Singles Chart. Dissatisfied with the stewardship of their manager Rikki Farr, Pete Watson left the band in late 1966. The Action continued as a quartet but were dropped by Parlophone in mid-1967, by which time they had also parted ways with Rikki Farr. They then assumed control of their own affairs, and soon afterwards keyboardist Ian Whiteman joined the band in an effort to expand their sound in order to help secure a new recording contract. By November, guitarist Martin Stone had also joined the band. The Action now set about gathering original new material for a projected LP, but recording demos in a radically different Byrds-influenced psychedelic style failed to secure them their hoped-for recording deal (the 1967/68 demos were eventually released in the 1990s under the title Rolled Gold). With the band seemingly having reached an impasse vocalist Reg King's behaviour became increasing unpredictable, and he departed the band in mid-1968. King's exit left Ian Whiteman and Alan King to share vocal duties, and at this point The Action decided on a brief change of name to Azoth. However the band soon reverted to their old name to record a new set of five demos, where they moved toward a more mid-tempo West Coast-influenced psychedelic ballad style and then into folk rock (these demos were eventually released in 1985 as The Action Speaks Louder Than Words). By January 1969 however, upon signing to Head Records (a fledgling independent label run by their former roadie John Curd), The Action was finally and permanently re- christened Mighty Baby. Alan King later went on to form Ace, who had a US hit in 1975 with ‚ÄúHow Long‚Äù. A 1980 compilation of the Action's Parlophone tracks came with sleeve notes by Paul Weller (\\"The Action had it in their soul\\") and did much for their profile, while the Rolled Gold album demos were hailed as lost classics when they were reissued in the 1990s. In 1998, the original lineup of The Action reformed for a concert on the Isle of Wight. The band then played regularly over the next six years. They are one of the favourite bands of Phil Collins, who performed with the reunited band in June 2000. \\"For me it was like playing with the Beatles\\", he later commented on the experience.

Fireworks depot on 13 May 2000 at 13:00 GMT, in the eastern Dutch city of Enschede. A fire led to an enormous explosion which killed 23 people including four firefighters, and injured nearly 1,000. A total of 400 homes were destroyed and 1,500 buildings damaged. The first explosion had a strength in the order of 800 kg TNT equivalence, while the strength of the final explosion was within the range of 4,000‚Äì5,000 kg TNT.T. Bedford, P. H. A. J. M. van Gelder, 2003, \\"Safety and reliability: proceedings of the ESREL 2003 European safety and reliability conference\\", p.1688 The biggest blast was felt up to away. Fire crews were called in from across the border in Germany to help battle the blaze; it was brought under control by the end of the day. S.E. Fireworks was a major importer of fireworks from China and a supplier to pop concerts and major festive events in the Netherlands. Prior to the disaster it had a good safety record and met all safety audits. Footage of the disaster was featured in a 2009 episode of the Discovery Channel show Destroyed in Seconds. Damage Crater created by the explosion A area around the warehouse was destroyed by the blast. Enschede was built around the S.E. Fireworks factory, which was the only one in the Netherlands to be located in a residential area. This caused around 400 houses to be destroyed, 15 streets incinerated and a total of 1,500 homes damaged, leaving 1,250 people homeless, essentially obliterating the neighbourhood of Roombeek. Ten thousand residents were evacuated, and damages eventually exceeded 1 billion guilders (‚Ç¨454 million). The Dutch Government warned that potentially harmful asbestos was released into the air by the explosion. The fire spread to the nearby Grolsch Beer brewery which had an asbestos roof. It was later demolished and closed; a replacement opened close by in Boekelo in 2004. Cause A fire is believed to have started in the work area of the central building where some of fireworks were stored. It then spread outside the building to two full shipping containers that were being used to illegally store more display incendiaries. When of fireworks exploded, it destroyed the surrounding residential area.Online Oosting zag iets over het hoofd in Enschede, NRC Handelsblad, 23 March 2001_ One theory to explain the large scale of the disaster was that internal fire doors in the central complex ‚Äì which might otherwise have contained the fire ‚Äì had been left open. Theoretically, an explosion was considered highly unlikely because the fireworks were stored in sealed bunkers specifically designed to minimize such risk. However, the illegal use of shipping containers reduced safety, particularly as they had been arranged closely together at ground level and had not been separated either by earthworks or other partitioning. One week prior to the explosion, SE had been audited. The company was judged to have met all official safety regulations while the legally imported fireworks had been inspected by Dutch authorities and deemed safe. However, after the explosion, residents from the affected district of Roombeek‚Äîa poor, working- class neighbourhood‚Äîcomplained of government inaction and lack of interest, saying the whole disaster was just waiting to happen. When it was built in 1977, the warehouse was outside the town, but as new residential areas were built it became surrounded by low-income housing. Residents and town councillors stated they did not even know that there was a fireworks warehouse in their area. Later in the court case, the judge said that city officials failed to take steps even when they knew laws had been broken. They acted \\"completely incomprehensibly\\" by allowing the company to expand, for fear that the city would have to pay the cost of moving S.E. Fireworks to another location. Legal proceedings On May 20 Dutch authorities issued an international arrest warrant for the two managers of the company, Rudi Bakker and Willie Pater, after they fled their homes, which were empty when searched. Willie Pater handed himself in on the same day, and Rudi Bakker the day after. In April 2002, the owners were sentenced to six months' imprisonment each for violation of environmental and safety regulations and dealing in illegal fireworks alongside a fine of ‚Ç¨2,250 each. However, they were both acquitted of the more serious charges of negligence for the fire. In May 2003, Arnhem Appeals Court acquitted 36-year-old Andr√© de Vries of arson. Almelo Court had originally (May 2002) tried and convicted De Vries of arson and sentenced him to 15 years imprisonment.Expatica.com , accessdate 17 April 2009 In February 2005, after a four-and-a-half-year legal battle, the six month sentence of each of the owners was increased to twelve months each. A total of ‚Ç¨8.5m in compensation was awarded to the victims of the explosion, according to the organisation in charge of distributing the compensation, the UPV, having assessed 3,519 claims. Three hundred people received cash for incurring extra costs, 136 people received money for loss of income, and 1,477 people received compensation for health problems. Dutch fire safety regulations A memorial of the disaster, outlining devastated areas around S.E. Fireworks The S.E. Fireworks disaster led to intensified safety regulations in the Netherlands concerning the storage and sale of fireworks. The Roombeek area that was destroyed by the blast has since been rebuilt. Since the catastrophe, three illegal fireworks depots were closed down in the Netherlands. Memorials There have been annual public memorial services in Roombeek since 2000 led by the mayor Jan Mans, and commonly ending on the Stroinksbleekweg. The theme of 2004 was \\"homecoming\\".

Simba Wanyika and its two offshoots, Les Wanyika and Super Wanyika Stars, became some of the most popular bands in Kenya. Their guitar-driven sound, inspired by the Soukous guitarist Dr. Nico, combined highly melodic rumba with lyrics sung in Swahili. Simba wa nyika means \\"Lions of the Savannah\\" in Swahili. Wilson Kinyonga and George Kinyonga began as musicians in their hometown Tanga in Tanzania when they joined Jamhuri Jazz Band in 1966. They moved to Arusha in 1970 and formed Arusha Jazz with their other brother, William Kinyonga. During this period, musicians could travel freely between Kenya and Tanzania, and Kenyan popular music became heavily influenced by Tanzanian rumba musicians. In 1971 the Kinyonga brothers moved to Kenya and created Simba Wanyika. The band played at nightclubs and bars in the Nairobi area, and developed an enthusiastic following, and by the mid 1970s, they were well known throughout Kenya, thanks to hits like \\"Mwongele\\" and \\"Wana Wanyika\\". They had a harder sound than most rumba bands and were almost unchallenged in that area in Kenya due to the closing of the Tanzanian border in 1977. The restrictions enforced on the Kenya-Tanzania border consequently led to the divergence of Kenyan popular music towards the emerging benga music. Simba Wanyika continued playing rumba, and was still quite popular when the band split in the late 1970s when rhythm guitarist Omar Shabani (commonly referred to as Professor Omar Shabani) took many of the band's musicians and forming Les Wanyika. In 1980, George Kinyonga also quit Simba Wanyika, taking more musicians with him to form Orchestra Jobiso. He eventually rejoined Simba Wanyika while still working with Jobiso on side projects. Simba Wanyika later changed their name to \\"Simba Wanyika Original\\" to prevent confusion with Les Wanyika and its splinter group, Super Wanyika Stars. Simba Wanyika regained its popularity in the mid 1980s, releasing many hits and touring Europe in 1989. They disbanded in 1994, but several offshoots of the band still continue to play.

It is held at 11am on the second Sunday in November (the Sunday nearest to 11 November, Armistice Day,These two statements are in effect the same: the second Sunday is always between 8 and 14 November inclusive, so the second Sunday is no more than three days away from 11 November, and therefore always the Sunday nearest to 11 November. the anniversary of the end of hostilities in the First World War in 1918). Remembrance Sunday, within the Church of England, falls in the liturgical period of Allsaintstide. It is marked by ceremonies at local war memorials in most cities, towns and villages, attended by civic dignitaries, ex-servicemen and -women (many are members of the Royal British Legion and other veterans' organisations), members of local armed forces regular and reserve units (Royal Navy and Royal Naval Reserve, Royal Marines and Royal Marines Reserve, Army and Territorial Army, Royal Air Force and Royal Auxiliary Air Force), military cadet forces (Sea Cadet Corps, Army Cadet Force and Air Training Corps as well as the Combined Cadet Force) and youth organisations (e.g. Scouts, Boys' Brigade, Girls' Brigade and Guides). Wreaths of remembrance poppies are laid on the memorials and two minutes' silence is held at 11am. Church bells are usually rung half-muffled, creating a sombre effect. The service is held for about two hours. History The focus of remembrance for the dead of the First World War originally fell on Armistice Day itself, commencing in 1919. As well as the National Service in London, events were staged at town and village war memorials, often featuring processions of civic dignitaries and veterans. The first UK commemoration of the end of World War 1 at Buckingham Palace, with King George V hosting a \\"Banquet in Honour of The President of the French Republic\\" . A two-minute silence was observed at 11am on 11 November 1919. While the initial, spontaneous public reaction when the Armistice was signed on the 11 November 1918 was jubilation and celebration, the 1919 banquet was criticised for being too celebratory. The following year, Armistice Day in 1920, the funeral of Unknown Soldier took place at the London Cenotaph and a two-minute silence was observed throughout the nation. Buses halted, electricity was cut to tram lines, and even trading on the London Stock Exchange halted. Starting in 1921, the Royal British Legion began selling Remembrance Poppies to raise funds for ex-service men. Throughout the 1920s and 1930s the character of the remembrance events became politicised. While for some, Armistice Day was a day for recognising the horrors of war, never to be repeated; for others the day symbolised the honour of military service. In 1923 a Christian Pacifist MP was elected to parliament. In the middle 1930s the Peace Pledge Union gained wide support. Pacifism gained great publicity from a 1933 student debate in the Oxford University Union that voted for a resolution that 'this House will in no circumstances fight for King and Country'. The first White Poppy were sold by the Co-operative Women's Guild in 1933. During the Second World War, the commemorations were moved to the Sunday preceding 11 November as an emergency measure to avoid disruption of the production of vital war materials. In May 1945, just before VE Day, the new government began consultation with the churches and the British Legion on the future of remembrance. Armistice Day in 1945 actually fell on a Sunday, avoiding the need to change the wartime practice. Some thought that to continue with the 11 November would focus more on the First World War and downplay the importance of the Second. Other dates suggested were 8 May (VE Day), 6 June (D-Day), 15 August (VJ Day), 3 September (the declaration of war), and even 15 June (the signing of the Magna Carta in 1215). The Archbishop of Westminster proposed that the second Sunday in November should be named Remembrance Sunday in commemoration of both World Wars, a suggestion which was endorsed by the Home Office in January 1946. In June of that year, the prime minister, Clement Attlee, announced in the House of Commons that \\"the Government felt that this view would commend itself to all quarters of the country. I am glad to say that it has now found general acceptance here and has been approved by The King.\\"Cecil 1998, pp. 357-358 National ceremony in the United Kingdom The ceremony at the Cenotaph Group of wreaths laid during the Remembrance Sunday ceremony in London The national ceremony is held in London at the Cenotaph on Whitehall, starting with two minutes' silence at 11am and concluding with the end of The Nation's Thank You procession at 1:30 p.m. The main part of the ceremony consists of the laying of wreaths by members of the royal family and other dignitaries, prayers, music and a march-past by thousands of military and other units.  Regional and local ceremonies  The Remembrance Sunday parade in Oxford in 2011. Remembrance Service at Trinity College, Cambridge in 2018. Significant ceremonies also take place in the capitals of the nations and across the regions of the United Kingdom.Nation unites to remember fallen. Most notably at the Scottish National War Memorial, in Edinburgh in the grounds of Edinburgh Castle,Services held to honour war dead. the Welsh National War Memorial in CardiffArmy band heads remembrance event. and at the Northern Ireland War Memorial and Cenotaph in Belfast in the grounds of the Belfast City Hall.War dead are remembered across NI. Typically, poppy wreaths are laid by representatives of the Crown, the armed forces, and local civic leaders, as well as by local organisations such as ex-servicemen organisations, cadet forces, the Scouts, Guides, Boys' Brigade, St John Ambulance and the Salvation Army. The start and end of the silence is often also marked by the firing of an artillery piece. A minute's or two minutes' silence is also frequently incorporated into church services.  British Overseas Territories  In the past, the Secretary of State for Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs laid a wreath on behalf of all the British overseas territories. However, since 2001 there has been a campaign by Britain's Overseas Territories Association for the right to lay a wreath themselves at the annual service at the Cenotaph. In 2008 the Labour Government agreed that one wreath could be laid for all 14 territories by a representative of the territories.  Northern Ireland  In Northern Ireland, Remembrance Sunday has tended to be associated with unionists. Most Irish nationalists and republicans do not take part in the public commemoration of British soldiers organised by the Royal British Legion. This is partly due to the actions of the British Army during The Troubles and its role in fighting against Irish independence. However, some moderate nationalists have attended Remembrance Day events as a way to connect with the unionist community. In 1987 a bomb was detonated by the Provisional Irish Republican Army (IRA) just before a Remembrance Sunday ceremony in Enniskillen, killing eleven people. The IRA said it had made a mistake and had been targeting soldiers parading to the war memorial. The Republic of Ireland has its own National Day of Commemoration in July for all Irish people who died in war. Other ceremonies From 1919 until 1945, Armistice Day observance was always on 11 November itself. It was then moved to Remembrance Sunday, but since the 50th anniversary of the end of the Second World War in 1995, it has become usual to hold ceremonies on both Armistice Day and Remembrance Sunday. In 2006, then Chancellor of the Exchequer Gordon Brown proposed that in addition to Remembrance Sunday, a new national day to celebrate the achievements of veterans should be instituted. The \\"Veterans Day\\", to be held in the summer, would be similar to Veterans Day celebrations in the United States. This has now been renamed \\"Armed Forces Day\\", to include currently serving troops to Service families, and from veterans to cadets. The first \\"Armed Forces Day\\" was held on 27 June 2009. Submariners hold an additional remembrance walk and ceremony on the Sunday before Remembrance Sunday, which has The Submariners Memorial as its focal point. Outside the United Kingdom Outside the United Kingdom Anglican and Church of Scotland churches often have a commemorative service on Remembrance Sunday. In the Republic of Ireland there is an ecumenical service in St Patrick's Cathedral, Dublin, the Church of Ireland's national cathedral. Since 1993 the President of Ireland has attended this service. The state has its own National Day of Commemoration (held in July) for all Irish men and women who have died in war. In the United States it is celebrated by many Anglo-Catholic churches in the Episcopal Church. The Anglican Church of Korea also celebrates the day to commemorate, in particular, the Commonwealth soldiers who fought in the Korean War with a service at the Seoul Anglican Cathedral. In New Zealand an attempt was made to change Armistice Day to Remembrance Sunday after World War II but it was a failure, partly owing to competition from Anzac Day.Helen Robinson, 'Lest we Forget? The Fading of New Zealand War Commemorations, 1946‚Äì1966', New Zealand Journal of History, 44, 1 (2010). Remembrance Sunday Commemoration at the Glorious Dead Cenotaph in Kolkata, India, 2016 Every year, the British Deputy High Commission in Kolkata, India, organises a Remembrance Sunday Commemoration at the Glorious Dead Cenotaph in the Maidan.  Controversy  It is a common theme in British tabloid journalism in October and November to \\"expose\\" politicians and celebrities who have chosen not to wear a red Royal British Legion poppy. Critics have labelled this \\"poppy fascism\\", as persons who refuse to wear poppies on TV or at sporting events routinely receive death threats. A common criticism of Remembrance Sunday ceremonies and the Royal British Legion is that by focusing only on veterans and military persons who have died, the vast majority of the casualties of war (civilians) are forgotten.

Suet has a melting point of between 45 ¬∞C and 50 ¬∞C (113 ¬∞F and 122 ¬∞F) and congelation between 37 ¬∞C and 40 ¬∞C (98.6 ¬∞F and 104 ¬∞F). Its high smoke point makes it ideal for deep frying and pastry production. Tallow-beef suet after rendering The primary use of suet is to make tallow, although it is also used as an ingredient in cooking, especially in traditional puddings, such as British Christmas pudding. Suet is made into tallow in a process called rendering, which involves melting and extended simmering, followed by straining, cooling and usually by repeating the entire process. Unlike tallow, suet that is not pre-packed requires refrigeration in order to be stored for extended periods. Etymology The word suet is derived from Anglo-Norman siuet, suet, from Old French sieu, seu, from Latin sƒìbum (\\"tallow\\", \\"grease\\", \\"hard animal fat\\"). Sebum is from the Proto-Indo-European root *seyb- (\\"pour out, trickle\\"), so it shares a root with sap and soap.https://www.linguisticsociety.org/sites/default/files/1972_searchable.pdf  Trade  In the 17th century economy of the Viceroyalty of Peru, Chile's husbandry and agriculture based economy had a peripheral role exporting mainly suet, ch'arki and leather to the other provinces of the viceroyalty. The importance of this trade led Chilean historian Benjam√≠n Vicu√±a Mackenna to label the 17th century the century of suet (Spanish: siglo del sebo).{es icon} [Sergio VillalobosVillalobos, Sergio]; Retamal √Åvila, Julio and Serrano, Sol. 2000. Historia del pueblo Chileno. Vol 4. p. 154.  Cuisine  Suet is found in several traditional British dishes. Suet pastry is soft in contrast to the crispness of shortcrust pastry, which makes it ideal for certain sweet and savoury dishes. Suet is most widely used in sweet puddings, such as jam roly- poly and spotted dick. Savoury dishes include dumplings, which are made using a mixture of suet, flour and water rolled into balls that are added to stews during the final twenty minutes or so of cooking. In the savoury dish steak and kidney pudding, a bowl is lined with suet pastry, the meat is placed inside and a lid of suet pastry tightly seals the meat. The pudding is then steamed for approximately four hours before serving. Suet is also an ingredient of traditional fruit mince (known as 'mincemeat' in the UK). Due to its high energy content, suet is used by cold weather explorers to supplement the high daily energy requirement needed to travel in such climates. Typically the energy requirement is around 5,000‚Äì6,000 Cal per day for sledge hauling or dog-sled travelling.Nutritional Requirements in Cold Climates, Rodahl, Kaare; JN - The Journal of Nutrition Suet is added to food rations to increase the fat content and help meet this high energy requirement. Availability Packaged suet Suet can be bought in natural form in many US supermarkets. As it is the fat from around the kidneys, the connective tissue, blood and other non-fat items must be removed. It then needs to be coarsely grated to make it ready to use. It must be kept refrigerated prior to use and used within a few days of purchase, just like meat. Pre-packaged suet sold in supermarkets is dehydrated suet. It is mixed with flour to make it stable at room temperature. Because of this, some care is needed when using it for older recipes that call for fresh suet as the proportions of flour to fat can alter. Most modern recipes stipulate packaged suet. Cultural and religious restrictions Consumption of suet is forbidden according to the Jewish religion as it was reserved for ritual altar sacrifices. This restriction only applies to those animals which were used for sacrifices, and thus does not include wild animals such as deer. Bird feed Red-breasted nuthatch feeding on suet Suet-based bird feeders are favoured by woodpeckers, goldfinches, juncos, cardinals, thrushes, jays, kinglets, bluebirds, chickadees, nuthatches, wrens, and starlings. Bird feed is commonly used in the form of cakes of suet, which can be made with other solid fats, such as lard. Rolled oats, bird seed, cornmeal, raisins, and unsalted nuts are often incorporated into the suet cakes.

Their best-known recording is the 1967 hit single \\"A Whiter Shade of Pale\\", one of the few singles to have sold over 10 million copies. Although noted for their baroque and classical influence, Procol Harum's music is described as psychedelic rock and proto-prog. In 2018, the band was honoured by the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame when \\"A Whiter Shade of Pale\\" was inducted into the brand-new Singles category.  History  = Origins, The Paramounts, early years and formation (1964‚Äì67) = The Paramounts, based in Southend-on-Sea, Essex, led by Gary Brooker and Robin Trower and including Chris Copping and B. J. Wilson, scored a moderate British success in 1964 with their version of Jerry Leiber and Mike Stoller's \\"Poison Ivy\\", which reached number 35 in the UK Singles Chart. Unable to generate any follow-up success, the group disbanded in 1966. The Paramounts were signed to EMI UK for their releases; until one day before Procol Harum linked with EMI UK again, they were called The Pinewoods. A last- minute offer from Chris Blackwell's fledgling Island Records label was rejected by Brooker and band. In April 1967, Brooker began working as a singer-songwriter and formed Procol Harum with non-Paramounts Keith Reid (poet), Hammond organist Matthew Fisher, guitarist Ray Royer and bassist David Knights. Guy Stevens, their original manager, named the band after a Burmese cat, which had been bred by Eleonore Vogt-Chapman and belonged to Liz Coombes. The cat's \\"cat fancy\\" name was Procul Harun, Procul being the breeder's prefix. In the absence of a definitive origin, the band's name has attracted various interpretations, being said to be (incorrect) Latin for \\"beyond these things\\"; the correct Latin would be procul hƒ´s. The name of the band is frequently misspelled; often with \\"Procul\\", \\"Harem\\", both, or other variations. = \\"A Whiter Shade of Pale\\", commercial success and debut album (1967) = alt= At Olympic Studios, southwest London, with session drummer (and non-Paramount) Bill Eyden, producer Denny Cordell and sound engineer Keith Grant, the group recorded \\"A Whiter Shade of Pale\\", and it was released on 12 May 1967. With a structure reminiscent of Baroque music, a countermelody based on J. S. Bach's Orchestral Suite N¬∞ 3 in D Major played by Fisher's Hammond organ, Brooker's vocals and Reid's lyrics, the single reached No. 1 on the UK Singles Chart and the Canadian RPM Magazine chart. It did almost as well in the United States, reaching No. 5 on 29 July 1967. In Australia, it was No. 1 for many weeks, setting a record of 8 weeks in Melbourne. After \\"A Whiter Shade of Pale\\" became a hit, the band set out to consolidate its studio success by touring, with new official drummer Bobby Harrison added to the line-up; its live debut was opening for Jimi Hendrix in 1967. The group's follow-up single, \\"Homburg\\", with a line-up change of former Paramounts B. J. Wilson on drums and Robin Trower on guitar (replacing Harrison and Royer, respectively, who exited to form the band Freedom), reached No. 6 in the UK, No. 15 in Canada, and No. 34 in the US. The group's eponymous debut studio album was recorded between the two hit singles, and was released in early September in the US, but was held back until December 1967 in the UK. A series of singles charted poorly in the US and UK, though rarely both at the same time. = Follow-up albums and break-up (1968‚Äì77) = The band's follow-up album, Shine On Brightly was released the following year and saw a greater excursion into progressive rock stylings. Their third album, A Salty Dog (1969), was very popular among fans and their first album to sell well in the UK. The title track in particular gained a good deal of US FM radio airplay, and the album is now considered a rock classic, appealing to fans of The Beatles, The Moody Blues and Pink Floyd. However, one noted US writer previewed the LP and the story ran in print as \\"A Salty Duck\\". The group would have many subsequent personnel changes, the first being Fisher, who produced A Salty Dog, departing the band soon after its release. The line-up for the first three albums was Brooker (piano and lead vocals), Trower (guitar and lead vocals), Fisher (organ and lead vocals), Knights (bass), Wilson (drums), and Reid (lyricist). Former Paramount Chris Copping joined on organ and bass in 1970. The group appeared at the Isle of Wight Festival 1970. By 1971, the disparities in style had become too great and, after the release of the fifth album Broken Barricades, Trower left to form his own power trio band and was replaced by Dave Ball. From late 1972 until 1977, the group's guitarist was Mick Grabham. In 1968 a bootleg live album In Concert 1968 was released but only in Germany - part of a series put out by the label Ariola that also included the bands Taste, etc. Procol Harum returned to success on the record charts in the following years with a symphonic rock sound, often backed by symphony orchestras. At this it was one of the first groups to achieve success; Procol Harum Live: In Concert with the Edmonton Symphony Orchestra was a No. 5 gold album in the US in 1972, as well as reaching No. 48 in Britain. \\"Conquistador\\" (a track from their first album, re-charted for accompaniment by the Edmonton Symphony in 1971) was a hit single in 1972, getting to No. 16 on 29 July 1972 in the US, five years to the date after \\"Whiter Shade of Pale\\" peaked at No. 5, and No. 7 in Canada, whilst reaching No. 22 in the UK. Their follow-up album, Grand Hotel, did fairly well, reaching No. 21 on the US Billboard 200 in 1973. The album also received a Silver Certification (over 60,000 copies sold) in the United Kingdom. In 1975, Procol Harum played the final night at the Rainbow Theatre in London. More personnel changes contributed to declining sales in the later part of the 1970s, with \\"Pandora's Box\\" being the final UK Top 20 hit in 1975. Its parent album Procol's Ninth saw a reconnection with Jerry Leiber and Mike Stoller who both produced and wrote with the band. The band broke up in 1977, after seeing Something Magic stall at No. 147 in the US Billboard 200 chart. It reunited for a single performance five months later, when \\"A Whiter Shade of Pale\\" was named joint winner (along with Queen's \\"Bohemian Rhapsody\\") of the Best British Pop Single 1952‚Äì1977 at the BRIT Awards, part of Queen Elizabeth II's Silver Jubilee. The group also had one album,billed as \\"Liquorice John Death\\" and had the title \\"Ain't Nothin' To Get Excited about\\" with the Paramounts' original lineup reuniting and doing covers of Rock Tunes as well = Reformation and the 1990s = The band reformed in 1991 with Brooker, Fisher, Trower and Reid (Wilson had died in 1990), and released The Prodigal Stranger, but sales were modest. After the album's release, a new incarnation of the band, with Brooker and Fisher but not Trower, toured the US and the world for a few years in the first half of the 1990s. In August 1995, Procol Harum played at the Cropredy Music Festival, as guests of Fairport Convention. They also toured US and UK the same year, performing at several locations. In July 1997, fans arranged the celebration of the 30th anniversary of the success of \\"A Whiter Shade of Pale\\", and invited the then-inactive band to play a concert at Redhill, Surrey. In late 1999, Brooker promised that \\"Procol will play in 2000\\", and in September the band played an open air gig with the New London Sinfonia in Guildford. = 2000s = In 2000, Procol Harum received some attention after the song \\"In Held Twas in I\\" appeared on the band Transatlantic's debut album. Since 2001 the band, comprising Brooker, Fisher, Geoff Whitehorn (guitar), Matt Pegg (bass) and Mark Brzezicki (drums), has made several tours of mostly Europe, but also Japan and the US. A 2001 concert in Copenhagen, Denmark was released on DVD in 2002. In 2003 the band released a new studio album, The Well's on Fire, and appeared at the Progman Cometh festival in Seattle. Their concert in London on Friday 12 December 2003, with much of the material from that album, was released on DVD in 2004: Live at the Union Chapel. Fisher left Procol Harum in 2004. The band resumed a limited touring schedule in 2005, with Josh Phillips replacing Fisher on Hammond, leaving Brooker as the only original performing member. In June 2006 they played at the Isle of Wight Festival. In August they played two outdoor concerts with the Danish Radio Orchestra at Ledreborg Castle in Denmark, which were tele-recorded. An hour-long edit of the show was broadcast on Christmas morning 2008 on Danish Channel DR2 and the full concert was issued on DVD on 11 May 2009 (with six extra tracks from a Danish television recording of the band from 1974). Later in 2006 they played in Switzerland, Norway and Denmark, but with Geoff Dunn replacing Brzezicki on drums, because the latter's other band Casbah Club was touring with The Who. However, Dunn ended up replacing Brzezicki for the band's European tour in 2007. Recordings from the Italian concerts were later released as One Eye to the Future ‚Äì Live in Italy 2007. Procol Harum also played an orchestral concert in Sweden on 30 June. They performed with the G√§vle Symphony Orchestra at the outdoor opera venue Dalhalla, near R√§ttvik. On 20 and 21 July 2007, fans arranged the celebration of the 40th anniversary of the success of \\"A Whiter Shade of Pale\\", and invited the band to play. This took the form of two concerts at St John's, Smith Square in London. 20 July saw Procol Harum play a mixture of songs from their early days through to the d√©but of a couple of new songs, \\"Sister Mary\\" and \\"Missing Persons\\". The following night 'Gary Brooker and Guests' performed a fixture of obscure songs by Brooker‚ÄìReid that had either never been recorded, never been performed live before or were significantly different from the versions they recorded. Although there was no Procol Harum activity in 2008, their manager Chris Cooke, on the web site Beyond the Pale, announced plans for a live DVD and a new album in 2009, as well as festival concerts in Norway on 17 July and Finland on 23 July. Just before the latter concert, Brooker fell off a pile of road-side logs in Finland and broke several ribs. The show went ahead but he was unable to sing properly, and many of the songs were performed either as instrumentals or sung by others in the band. In October 2009, with Brooker fully recovered, the band performed four concerts ‚Äì in Hagen (Germany), Drammen (Norway), Moscow and St Petersburg. All This and More, a four disc retrospective (three CDs and a DVD with historical notes) was released in the autumn of 2009, and Salvo also issued all of the band's previous albums as remastered CDs with extra tracks, some never previously heard. = 2010s = Procol played a string of US (and Toronto) concert dates in June 2010, mostly opening for Jethro Tull. On 22 July Procol again headlined at the Keitelejazz Festival in √Ñ√§nekoski, Finland ‚Äì the venue where the band performed with an injured Brooker in 2009. They described this loyal Finnish audience as \\"the best in the world\\" and played a unique three-verse version of \\"A Whiter Shade of Pale\\" with a guitar solo from Geoff Whitehorn. 48 hours later Procol were invited to give a free concert at the courtyard of the Palace of the Province of Bergamo in Italy. In August 2010 they appeared in Bad Krozingen in Germany and a Rock Legends event at the Dolina Charlotty Amphitheater in Poland. After a Halloween gig in Leamington Spa (their first in the UK for three years) the band returned to North America in November, including a return orchestral event with the Edmonton Symphony Orchestra on 9 November. After playing in Tallinn, Estonia on 18 November, they returned to the US for an orchestral concert in Wilmington, Delaware on 4 December. Over 13,000 people saw eight New Year concerts with the Danish Radio Orchestra in Copenhagen and other Danish cities in January 2011. On 29 May 2012, Gary Brooker was hospitalised after suffering a fall in his hotel room in Cape Town. He was due to have performed with his band at GrandWest Arena on the 30th, with fellow Brits 10cc and The Moody Blues, in a tour billed as the 'British Invasion' and then again in Johannesburg on Friday 1 June 2012. Brooker (whose birthday it was) had been in his room at the five-star Table Bay Hotel. He was admitted to the ICU of the Christiaan Barnard Memorial Hospital with a serious skull fracture. The band returned to Denmark for the Kl√∏ften Festival on 25 June before embarking on a 27-date U.S. tour supporting Yes. In 2012 the Japanese artist Yumi Matsutoya came to London to record \\"A Whiter Shade of Pale\\" with Procol Harum, a band she considered an inspiration for her work. She sang a duet with Gary Brooker on this new version of the 1967 classic, which featured three verses and a guitar solo by Geoff Whitehorn. Yumi and Procol Harum then played a series of December concerts in major Japanese cities, one of which was recorded for a later television showing (on 31 March 2013). In 2012, Henry Scott-Irvine published a biography of the band, Procol Harum ‚Äì The Ghosts of A Whiter Shade of Pale. Scott-Irvine also hosted a rare Procol Harum film evening at the BFI on the South Bank, which was attended by members of the group. In March and April 2013, Procol Harum played a series of five orchestral concerts in Denmark and two such events in Wuppertal in Germany. Four band-only concerts in Sweden & Finland were held in early October. In September 2012, Procol Harum was among fifteen final nominees for the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame Class of 2013 (induction 18 April 2013). In the subsequent election that December, however, the band failed to gain enough votes for election. In 2014, the band toured again in France, Switzerland, Germany, Canada (Ottawa with orchestra) and the Eastern U.S. The band also played a five-song set at Kenney Jones' Rock'n'Horsepower charity event at Ewhurst, Surrey in June, on a bill including Alvin Stardust, John Lodge, Nick Kershaw, Mike Rutherford, Judie Tzuke and The Who. A twin CD, Inside & Outside, was issued with studio tracks from the Chrysalis years and a live CD including new material and performances of tracks from their first four Zonophone albums. On Monday 24 November Procol Harum appeared at the Dominion Theatre in London with the BBC Concert Orchestra and the Crouch End Festival Chorus in an event recorded for broadcast on BBC Radio 2's Friday Night is Music Night on 28 November. Guitarist Geoff Whitehorn was hospitalised during rehearsals and at short notice Rick Wakeman's guitarist Dave Colquhoun deputised (on crutches, after a broken ankle). He played a guitar solo in the first extended, orchestrated version of Keith Reid's 9/11 tribute song \\"Blink of an Eye\\", dedicated by Gary Brooker to the brave firefighters of the 8th Avenue station who the band often talked with after gigs in New York. The band's 13th album, Novum, was released on 21 April 2017 and the band played 36 dates in the UK and Europe to promote it. However, the most significant concert of the year came in March when the band played with an orchestra at the Royal Festival Hall in London. Whilst leaving the stage at the end of the first half, Gary Brooker fell and was seriously hurt. He reappeared for the second half with his head bandaged and nursing \\"a broken hand\\". In 2018 the band again toured in Europe, including an orchestral show at the London Palladium on 9 October. They commenced 2019 with a Caribbean cruise hosted by Justin Hayward, with many well-known rock acts. A US tour was due to follow.  Authorship lawsuit  In July 2009, Matthew Fisher won a British court judgment awarding him 40% of the music royalties from 2005 onwards for 1967's \\"A Whiter Shade of Pale\\", which had previously gone 50% to Brooker for the music and 50% to Reid for the lyrics.

(originally an initialism for Music Corporation of America) was an American media conglomerate founded in 1924. Originally a talent agency with artists in the music business as clients, the company became a major force in the film industry, and later expanded into television production. MCA published music, booked acts, ran a record company, represented film, television, and radio stars, and eventually produced and sold television programs to the three major television networks, but had an especially good relationship with NBC. MCA was the legal predecessor of Vivendi Universal and thereby NBCUniversal. Its other legal successor is Universal Studios Holding I Corp, a holding company owned by Vivendi, who also owns its former music assets through Universal Music Group (which has absorbed PolyGram) and Universal Music Publishing Group. History =Early years= MCA was formed in 1924 by Jules Stein and William R. Goodheart, Jr., as Music Corporation of America, a music booking agency based in Chicago, Illinois. MCA helped pioneer modern practices of touring bands and name acts. Early on, MCA booked such prominent artists as King Oliver and Jelly Roll Morton for clubs and speakeasies run by legendary notorious Chicago mobsters such as Al Capone and others. Lew Wasserman joined MCA in 1936 at the age of 23 and rose through the ranks of MCA for more than four decades, with Sonny Werblin as his right-hand man. Wasserman helped create MCA's radio show, Kay Kyser's Kollege of Musical Knowledge, which debuted on NBC Radio that same year. Following that success, Stein installed Wasserman in New York City in 1937, but Wasserman convinced him that Hollywood was the best place for the company's growth. The company was guided by a codification of Stein's pet policies known as \\"The Rules of The Road\\". The Rules were passed down from the Prohibition era, Chicago‚Äìarea MCA (referenced in Citizen Cohn and The King and Queen of Hollywood books) to the 1940s Los Angeles‚Äìarea firm, which focused on representing movie actors. The Rules were next passed to the 1950s generation of MCA talent agents, including Jerry Perenchio, who later owned and headed a number of businesses including Univision from 1992 to 2007 . Perenchio is well known for his version of the Rules (now up to twenty rules), which vary from year to year and have some internal contradictions (Perenchio pointed out that while there is a \\"no nepotism\\" rule, he is aware his son was on the board of directors at the time). In 1939, MCA's headquarters moved from Chicago to Beverly Hills, California, creating a movie division and beginning to acquire talent agencies and represent established actors such as James Stewart, Henry Fonda, Bette Davis, and Ronald Reagan, whom Wasserman became very close with personally. In later decades, Wasserman became a guiding force in Reagan's political ambition by helping Reagan to win the presidency of the Screen Actors Guild (SAG), then election as Governor of California in 1966, and finally President of the United States in 1980. By the end of the 1930s, MCA had become the largest talent agency in the world, with over 700 clients, including movie stars, recording artists, Broadway actors, radio stars, producers, and directors. Its aggressive acquisition of its clientele in all entertainment sectors earned MCA the nickname of The Octopus. This behavior led U.S. Department of Justice agents to investigate not only whether MCA was a monopoly breaking antitrust laws, but also its suspected connections to underworld criminal activities. This investigation continued for the next few decades. =Revue Productions and the early days of television= In 1948, Jules Stein moved up as MCA's first chairman, giving Lew Wasserman charge of day-to-day operations of the company as president. That year, Stein and Wasserman decided to get into a new medium that would soon change the entertainment industry: television. Although many motion picture studios would not touch this new medium, thinking it was just a fad and would fade away, MCA decided to embrace it. First, however, the company needed to get a waiver from the Screen Actors Guild, which ruled at the time that talent agencies such as MCA were prohibited from producing TV shows or films. Thanks to the newly elected SAG president, Ronald Reagan, MCA was granted a waiver to start producing TV shows. After the waiver was granted, the company formed MCA Television Limited for syndication. In 1950 Revue Productions, once a live concert promotion division that produced \\"Stage Door Canteen\\" live events for the USO during World War II, was re-launched as MCA's television production subsidiary. By 1956, Revue became the top supplier of television for all broadcast networks, spanning three decades of television programs such as Armour Theater, General Electric Theater, Leave It to Beaver, Wagon Train, and many others. Prior to 1958, all Revue's shows were filmed at the old Republic Pictures studio lot in Studio City, California. In February 1958, MCA acquired Paramount Pictures' pre-1950 sound feature film library through a newly created MCA subsidiary, EMKA, Ltd. Also in 1958, MCA bought the Universal Studios lot from Universal Pictures for $11 million and renamed it, as well as the actual television unit, Revue Studios. As part of the deal, MCA leased the studios back to Universal for $2 million a year, plus unlimited access to MCA's clients such as Jimmy Stewart, Rock Hudson, Doris Day and Alfred Hitchcock to make films for Universal. Stein, who by this time was the sole owner of MCA, decided to take the company public by giving 51% of his ownership of MCA to his employees, which included a 20% stake for Wasserman. The company went public on the New York Stock Exchange and was incorporated as MCA Inc. on November 10, 1958.Search  Universal Music. New.umusic.com. Retrieved on 2013-12-23. A couple of years later, Alfred Hitchcock gave MCA his rights to Psycho and his television anthology in exchange for 150,000 shares, making him the third largest investor in MCA, and his own boss at Universal.Stephen Rebello, Alfred Hitchcock and the Making of Psycho, Soft Skull Press, Berkeley, 1990. =Takeover of Universal Studios and Decca Records= In 1962, MCA entered a merger of equals with New York‚Äìbased American Decca Records, with MCA as the surviving company. Decca at the time owned Coral Records and Brunswick Records, as well as an 89% controlling stake in Universal Pictures Company, Inc. In order to acquire Universal, MCA was forced by the Department of Justice to dissolve its talent agency‚Äîwhich represented most of the industry's biggest names‚Äîbecause owning both the movie studio and a talent agency would violate antitrust laws. The agents quickly formed several dozen new firms, representing talent. Many of these are woven into the corporate fabric of today's talent management agencies. Jerry Perenchio's firm, UTM (United Talent Management), represented Elizabeth Taylor and Muhammad Ali. By the end of the year, MCA had assumed full ownership of Universal upon the completion of the merger. In 1964, MCA entered the music publishing business when it acquired Lou Levy's Leeds Music, and formed Universal City Studios the same year in effort to merge under one umbrella both Universal Pictures and its Revue Productions division, which was later reincorporated as Universal Television in 1966. On July 15, 1964, MCA established the Studio Tour, which provided guests a sneak peek behind-the- scenes glimpse at movie and television production at the backlot of Universal Studios. This established a footprint of what is known today as the Universal Studios Hollywood film studio and theme park. Over the next few decades, similar parks were built and expanded under MCA for Universal Orlando Resort in Orlando, Florida and Universal Studios Japan in Osaka, Japan. In 1966, MCA formed Uni Records in Hollywood, California, and in 1967, MCA bought New York‚Äìbased Kapp Records. That same year MCA also acquired guitar maker Danelectro and mall retailer Spencer Gifts. =Later years= In 1967, the MCA Records label was established outside the United States and Canada to issue releases by the MCA group of labels. Decca, Kapp and Uni were merged into MCA Records at Universal City, California in 1971; the three labels maintained their identities for a short time but were soon retired in favor of the MCA label. The first MCA Records release in the US was former Uni artist Elton John's \\"Crocodile Rock\\" in 1972. In 1973, the final Decca pop label release, \\"Drift Away\\", a #5 pop hit by Dobie Gray, was issued. MCA had two failed mergers in 1969. Initially it planned a merger with Westinghouse Electric but that collapsed in April and in July, they announced a proposed merger with the Firestone Tire and Rubber Company but this too was called off in September. In 1973, Stein stepped down from the company he founded and Wasserman took over as chairman and chief executive officer, while Sidney Sheinberg was appointed president and chief operating officer of MCA. Other executives within MCA were Lawrence R. Barnett, who ran the agency's live acts division during its glory agency years in the 1950s and 1960s, and Ned Tanen, head of Universal Pictures. Tanen was behind Universal hits such as Animal House, John Hughes's Sixteen Candles and The Breakfast Club. MCA issued soundtrack albums for most films released by Universal Pictures. In 1975, the company entered the book publishing business with the acquisition of G. P. Putnam's Sons. In 1979, it acquired ABC Records along with its subsidiaries Paramount Records, Impulse! Records, and Dot Records. ABC had acquired the Paramount and Dot labels when it purchased Gulf+Western's record labels, then the parent company of Paramount Pictures. From 1983 to 1989, Irving Azoff was chairman of MCA Records and is credited for turning around the fortunes of the label.E. Scott Reckard, \\"Azoff Quits as Chairman of MCA's Music Unit\\", AP News Archive, September 5, 1989 The Chess Records catalog was acquired from the remnants of Sugarhill in 1985. Motown Records was bought in 1988 (and sold to PolyGram in 1993). GRP Records (which became for some years MCA's jazz music label and thus began managing the company's jazz catalogue) and Geffen Records (which served as another mainstream music subsidiary) were acquired in 1990. MCA also acquired other assets outside of the music industry. It became a shareholder in USA Network in 1981, eventually owning 50% of the network (the other half was owned by Paramount). In 1982, its publishing division, G. P. Putnam's Sons, bought Grosset & Dunlap from Filmways. In 1984, MCA bought Walter Lantz Productions and its characters. In 1985, MCA bought toy and video game company LJN. It also bought a TV station in New York City, WWOR-TV (renamed from WOR- TV), in 1987, from RKO General, which was in the midst of a licensing scandal. In November 1990, Japanese multinational conglomerate Matsushita Electric agreed to acquire MCA for US$6.59 billion. MCA was forced to sell WWOR-TV in 1991 by the Federal Communications Commission, because foreign companies could not own over 25% of a US TV station. In 1995, Seagram acquired 80% of MCA from Matsushita. On December 9, 1996, the new owners dropped the MCA name; the company became Universal Studios, Inc., and its music division, MCA Music Entertainment Group, was renamed Universal Music Group. MCA Records continued to live on as a label within the Universal Music Group. The following year, G. P. Putnam's Sons was sold to the Penguin Group. In 1996, MCA filed a lawsuit against Viacom over the latter's launch of the TV Land cable network. Viacom had purchased Paramount in 1994, and the contract for USA Network prohibited either of their owners from owning cable channels outside the joint venture. Viacom had owned MTV Networks (the parent of TV Land) since 1985. The suit was settled when Viacom sold MCA its half of the joint venture. TV Land eventually added shows from the MCA/Universal library in 1999. On May 21, 1998, Seagram acquired PolyGram from Philips and merged it with its music holdings. The European Commission approved the merger on September 21, 1998. When France- based Pernod Ricard purchased Seagram's drinks business, Pernod sold its media holdings (including Universal) to Vivendi, which became Vivendi Universal in 2000. In the spring of 2003, MCA Records was folded into Geffen Records. Its country music label, MCA Nashville Records, is still in operation. MCA's classical music catalog is managed by Deutsche Grammophon. MCA's non-music assets at the time of the company's renaming, including Universal Studios and the 50% interest in USA Network, came under ownership of NBC Universal (now full owner of USA), which was 80% owned by General Electric, and 20% owned by Vivendi. In 2009, GE struck a deal to buy Vivendi's interest, and sold a controlling 51% interest to Comcast afterwards. The sale completed on January 28, 2011, with General Electric owning 49% of the newly formed NBCUniversal. Comcast bought GE's stake two years later. The landmark Paul Williams‚Äìdesigned Beverly Hills property that MCA once occupied became the headquarters of Paradigm Talent Agency until 2018. Conference rooms inside the building are named after Jules Stein and Lew Wasserman in honor of the legendary occupants.

His father, Sir Leonard Hastings, had owned a modest estate in Leicestershire and Gloucestershire, where the family had long been established. On 14 April 1474 Hastings acquired the manorial right to Kirby from the Pakeman family, although he had rented it for some years previous to this. In 1480 he began to build the moated Kirby Muxloe Castle during the period of the Wars of the Roses. However, work on the castle stopped soon after Lord Hastings was executed on 13 June 1483 on the orders of Richard, Duke of Gloucester (days later to become King Richard III) at the Tower of London for conspiracy. William was caught up in the rivalry for the throne after the death of Edward IV.English Heritage , and was Kirby Muxloe Castle Retrieved on 19 July 2007 In 1582 the name of the village is recorded as Kirby Muckelby, with variants Mullox, Muckle. About 50 years later in 1628 disafforestation of Leicester Forest occurred, effectively dividing the land near Kirby Muxloe into forest and pasture. The results are visible today. In 1636, the Hastings families sold the castle, and estates in Kirby and Braunstone, to the Winstanley family. The first official use of Kirby Muxloe was in 1703 in the Oxford Dictionary of Placenames, which states that 'Muxloe' is a family name. There was such a family but they lived three miles away, in the village of Desford. An early Quaker, John Penford, was a substantial resident of Kirby Muxloe and member of the Leicester Quarterly Meeting. A business meeting of the Society held at his home to consult on works of charity in 1670 was interrupted by informers, with the result that Penford and others were heavily fined.John Gough, A History of the People Called Quakers (Robert Jackson, Dublin 1790), II, p. 314. read here For local context see R.H.

The village has a primary school which is rated as one of the top schools in the county. There is a chemist, bakery, supermarket, two pubs, a popular sports and social club and a golf club.

His first wife was Barbara Jacobs (daughter of the writer William Wymark Jacobs), his second wife was Joan Chirnside and his third wife was Virginia Sorenson, author of the Newbery Medal‚Äìwinning Miracles on Maple Hill. Biography Waugh was born in London, and educated at Sherborne School, a public school in Dorset. The result of his experiences was his first, semi-autobiographical novel, The Loom of Youth (1917), in which he dramatized his schooldays. The book was inspired by Arnold Lunn's The Harrovians, published in 1913 and discussed at some length in The Loom of Youth.Alec Waugh, The Loom of Youth (London: Methuen 1984) p. 135 et seq. The Loom of Youth was so controversial at the time (it mentioned homosexual relationships between boys, albeit in a very understated, staid fashion) that Waugh remains the only former pupil to be dismissed from the former students society (The Old Shirburnian Society). It was also a best seller.Alec Waugh, The Loom of Youth (London: Methuen 1984) p. 12.

He later had a career as a successful author, although never as successful or innovative as that of his younger brother. He lived much of his life overseas, in exotic places such as Tangier - a lifestyle made possible by his second marriage to a rich Australian, Joan Chirnside. His work, possibly in consequence, tended to be reminiscent of W. Somerset Maugham, although without achieving Maugham's huge popular success. Nevertheless, his 1955 novel Island in the Sun was a best-seller. It was filmed in 1957 as Island in the Sun, securing from Hollywood the greatest amount ever paid for the use of a novel at that time.Nicholas Shakespeare, \\"Which of today's novelists will stand the test of time?\\", The Telegraph, 9 January 2016.

Veloso first became known for his participation in the Brazilian musical movement Tropicalismo, which encompassed theatre, poetry and music in the 1960s, at the beginning of the Brazilian military dictatorship. He has remained a constant creative influence and best-selling performing artist and composer ever since. Veloso has won nine Latin Grammy Awards and two Grammy Awards. On November 14, 2012, Veloso was honored as the Latin Recording Academy Person of the Year. Veloso was one of seven children born into the family of Jos√© Telles Velloso (Seu Zeca), a government official, and Claudionor Viana Telles Veloso (Dona Can√¥), a housewife. He was born in the city of Santo Amaro da Purifica√ß√£o, in Bahia, a state in the eastern area of Brazil, but moved to Salvador, the state capital, as a college student in the mid-1960s. Soon after that, Veloso won a music contest and was signed to his first label. He became one of the founders of Tropicalismo with a group of several other musicians and artists‚Äîincluding his sister Maria Beth√¢nia‚Äîin the same period. However the Brazilian government at the time viewed Veloso's music and political action as threatening, and he was arrested, along with fellow musician Gilberto Gil, in 1969. The two eventually were exiled from Brazil and went to London where they lived for two years. In 1972, Veloso moved back to his home country and once again began recording and performing. He later became popular outside Brazil in the 1980s and 1990s.  Biography  Veloso was born in Santo Amaro da Purifica√ß√£o, Bahia, Brazil, the fifth of seven children of Jos√© Teles Veloso (1901‚Äì1983) and Claudionor Viana Teles Veloso (1907‚Äì2012). His childhood was influenced greatly by artistic endeavors: he was interested in both literature and filmmaking as a child, but focused mainly on music. The musical style of bossa nova and Jo√£o Gilberto, one of its most prominent exponents, were major influences on Veloso's music as he grew up. Veloso was 17 years old when he first heard Gilberto, whom he describes as his \\"supreme master\\". He recognizes Gilberto's contribution to Brazilian music as new‚Äî\\"illuminating\\" the tradition of Brazilian music and paving the way for future innovation. Veloso moved to the Bahian port city of Salvador as a teenager, the city in which Gilberto lived in a center of Afro-Brazilian culture and music.Wald (2007), p. 118. In 1965, Veloso moved again to Rio de Janeiro, with his sister Maria Beth√¢nia, also a musician. Shortly after the move, Veloso won a lyrics contest for his composition \\"Um Dia\\" and was signed to Philips Records. On October 21, 1967, Veloso won fourth prize and gained a standing ovation at the third annual Brazil Popular Music Festival with his song \\"Alegria, Alegria\\". on which he was backed by S√£o Paulo group Beat Boys; along with the performance of his friend Gilberto Gil, who was backed by psychedelic band Os Mutantes, this marked the first time that rock bands had performed at the festival. During this period, Veloso, Beth√¢nia, Gilberto Gil, Gal Costa, Tom Z√©, and Os Mutantes developed \\"Tropicalismo\\", which fused Brazilian pop with rock and roll and avant-garde music. Veloso describes the movement as a wish to be different - not \\"defensive\\" like the right-wing Brazilian military government, which vehemently opposed the movement. Although Gil and Veloso's performances at the 1967 MBP Festival were rapturously received, within a year, Tropicalismo had become a deeply divisive issue among Brazil's youth audience, with Marxist-influenced college students of the Brazilian left wing condemning Tropicalismo, because they believed it commercialized Brazilian traditional music by incorporating musical influence from other cultures, specifically the United States. The musical manifesto of the Tropicalist movement was the landmark collaborative LP Tropic√°lia: ou Panis et Circencis (\\"Tropicalia: or Bread and Circuses\\"), issued in mid-1968, which brought together the talents of Veloso, Os Mutantes, Gilberto Gil, Tom Z√© and Gal Costa, with arrangements by avant-garde composer-arranger Rogerio Duprat (who had studied with Pierre Boulez) and lyrical contributions from poet Torquato Neto. The album's group cover photograph depicted the collective holding a variety of objects and images, in a deliberate reference to the cover of The Beatles' Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band. National Archives of Brazil. The tensions between the Tropicalistas and the student left peaked in September 1968 with Veloso's now-legendary performances at the third annual International Song Festival, held at the Catholic University in Rio, where the audience included a large contingent of students who were vehemently opposed to the Tropicalistas. When Veloso (backed by Os Mutantes) performed in the first round of the Festival's song competition on September 12, he was initially greeted with enthusiastic applause, but the situation soon turned ugly. Dressed in a shiny green plastic suit, festooned with electrical wires and necklaces strung with animal teeth, Veloso provoked the students with his lurid costume, his sensual body movements and his startling new psychedelic music, and the performers were soon being bombarded with loud insults, jeers and boos from the students, who became even more incensed when American pop singer John Dandurand made a surprise appearance on stage during the song. The ideological conflict climaxed three days later on September 15 when Veloso returned for the second round of the competition, performing a specially-written new song entitled \\"√â Proibido Proibir\\" (\\"It is Forbidden to Forbid\\"). The leftist students began hissing and booing as soon as Veloso's name was announced, and when he began his performance, his overtly sexual stage moves and the experimental music of Os Mutantes again provoked a wild reaction ‚Äì the students began booing so loudly that the performers could barely be heard, and a section of the crowd then stood up and turned their backs to the stage, prompting Os Mutantes to turn their backs on the audience. As the performance continued, the students pelted the stage with fruit, vegetables, eggs, paper balls and anything else that came to hand. Veloso then stopped singing and launched into an impassioned monologue, in which he excoriated the students for their conservatism. After being joined by Gilberto Gil, who came on stage to show his support, Veloso finished his diatribe by telling the students \\"...if you are the same in politics as you are in aesthetics, we‚Äôre done for!\\" and declaring he would no longer compete in music festivals. He then deliberately finished the song out of tune, angrily shouted \\"Enough!\\" and walked off arm- in-arm with Gil and Os Mutantes. A studio version of the song was later released as a single, and the closing section of the tumultuous live performance featuring Veloso's speech, was issued as the single's B-side.Victoria Langland, \\"Il est Interdit d‚ÄôInterdire: The Transnational Experience of 1968 in Brazil\\", Estudios Interdisciplinarios de Am√©rica Latina y el Caribe, Vol. 17, No. 1 (2006). [103] Even though Tropicalismo was controversial among traditional critics, it introduced to M√∫sica popular brasileira new elements for making music with an eclectic style. Veloso studied philosophy at the Universidade Federal da Bahia, which influenced both his artistic expression and viewpoint on life. Two of his favorite philosophers were Jean-Paul Sartre and Martin Heidegger. Veloso's leftist political stance earned him the enmity of Brazil's military dictatorship which ruled until 1985; his songs were frequently censored and some banned. Veloso and Gil were both arrested in February 1969 and held in prison for three months, followed by a further four months under house arrest; they were eventually released on condition that they leave the country, and spent the next few years in exile. He said that \\"they didn't imprison us for any song or any particular thing that we said,\\" ascribing the government's reaction to its unfamiliarity with the cultural phenomenon of Tropic√°lia‚Äîthey seemed to say \\"We might as well put them in prison.\\" The federal police detained the two and flew them to an unknown destination. Finally, Veloso and Gil lived out their exile in London, England. When Caetano was asked about his experience there he says, \\"London felt dark, and I felt far away from myself.\\" Nevertheless, the two improved their music there and were asked to make a musical production with the producer Ralph Mace. Career = Musical career (1972‚Äìpresent) = Veloso performs in Lisbon, Portugal in 2007. Veloso's work upon his return in 1972 was often characterized by frequent merging not only of international styles but of Brazilian folkloric styles and rhythms as well. His popularity grew outside Brazil in the 1980s, especially in Greece, Portugal, France, and Africa. His records released in the United States, such as Estrangeiro, helped gain him a larger audience. To celebrate 25 years of Tropicalismo, Veloso and Gilberto Gil released a CD called Tropicalia 2 in 1993. One song, \\"Haiti\\", attracted people's attention during the time, especially because it included powerful statements about sociopolitical issues present in Haiti and also in Brazil. Issues addressed in the song included ethnicity, poverty, homelessness, and capital corruption in the AIDS pandemic. By 2004, he was one of the most respected and prolific international pop stars, with more than 50 recordings available including songs in film soundtracks of Michelangelo Antonioni's Eros, Pedro Almod√≥var's Hable con ella, and Frida, for which he performed at the 75th Academy Awards but did not win. In 2002 Veloso published an account of his early years and the Tropicalismo movement, Tropical Truth: A Story of Music and Revolution in Brazil.Veloso, Tropical Truth: A Story of Music and Revolution in Brazil, New York: Alfred A. Knopf, 2003. His first all-English CD was A Foreign Sound (2004), which covers Nirvana's \\"Come as You Are\\" and compositions from the Great American Songbook such as \\"Carioca\\" (music by Vincent Youmans and lyrics by Edward Eliscu and Gus Kahn), \\"Always\\" (music and lyrics by Irving Berlin), \\"Manhattan\\" (music by Richard Rodgers and lyrics by Lorenz Hart), \\"Love for Sale\\" (music and lyrics by Cole Porter), and \\"Something Good\\" (music and lyrics by Richard Rodgers). Six of the seven songs on his third eponymous album, released in 1971, were also in English. Veloso has contributed songs to two AIDS benefit compilation albums produced by the Red Hot Organization: Red Hot + Rio (1996) and Onda Sonora: Red Hot + Lisbon (1998). In 2011, he again contributed two songs to the Red Hot Organization's most recent compilation album, Red Hot + Rio 2. The two tracks include a remix of \\"Terra\\" by Prefuse 73 (\\"3 Mellotrons in a Quiet Room Version\\") and \\"Dreamworld: Marco de Canaveses‚Äù, in collaboration with David Byrne. His September 2006 album, C√™, was released by Nonesuch Records in the United States. It won two Latin Grammy Awards, one for best singer-songwriter and one for Best Portuguese Song, \\"N√£o Me Arrependo\\". With a total of nine Latin Grammy Awards and two Grammy Awards, Veloso has received more than any other Brazilian performer. On November 14, 2012, Veloso was also honored as the Latin Recording Academy Person of the Year. Veloso has been called \\"one of the greatest songwriters of the century\\" and \\"a pop musician/poet/filmmaker/political activist whose stature in the pantheon of international pop musicians is on par with that of Bob Dylan, Bob Marley, and Lennon/McCartney\\". In January 2016, Caetano Veloso was a featured artist at the convention of the Modern Language Association (MLA), in Austin, Texas. Before a SRO crowd, he was interviewed on stage by two luminaries in the field of poetry and poetics, Marjorie Perloff (emerita Stanford) and Roland Greene (Stanford, President of MLA at the time). Most of the discussion concerned music, from rock 'n' roll and samba to experimental composition. Videos of the event should be posted at MLA's site and the Stanford Arcade site. He also performed \\"Isto aqui, o que √©?\\" at the 2016 Summer Olympics opening ceremony along with singers Anitta and Gilberto Gil after the parade of delegations in August 2016. In May 2018, Veloso performed at the Grand Final of the 2018 Eurovision Song Contest in the Portuguese capital, Lisbon, alongside 2017 winner Salvador Sobral.  Personal life  Veloso married fellow Baiana and actress Andrea Gadelha (or Ded√©) on November 21, 1967, in a ceremony that reflected the air of the counterculture era. Their son Moreno was born on November 22, 1972. On January 7, 1979, their daughter J√∫lia was born 3 months premature; she died 11 days later. Veloso's father died on December 13, 1983. Veloso separated from Ded√© Veloso in 1983. In 1986 Veloso married Rio native Paula Lavigne, with whom he had two more sons, Zeca Lavigne Veloso, born March 7, 1992, and Tom Lavigne Veloso, born on January 25, 1997, in Salvador. Paula confirmed to Playboy magazine in 1998 that, \\"[Paula] was 13 years old when she lost her virginity to the musician, who was 40 years old at the time.\\" Caetano has since been accused of pedofilia. This marriage lasted twenty years. Although separated since 2004, the two still work together. Veloso's 1989 CD Estrangeiro includes songs (\\"Esse Amor, which means \\"This Love\\", and \\"Branquinha\\") inspired by and dedicated to, respectively, his ex-wife Ded√© and his wife at the time, Paula Lavigne. Veloso is one of the few public atheist celebrities in Brazil. He was brought up in a religious Catholic family but left the faith early on. In an interview Veloso stated that he did not like to \\"lie to his own intelligence\\" by believing in God. In a separate interview Veloso generated controversy when he said that Brazil would be better off if most people in the country were to become irreligious or atheist. Despite this, two of Veloso's sons have become members of the neo-Pentecostal Universal Church of the Kingdom of God, with Veloso attending his children's baptism, stating that \\"what is good for them is good for me.\\" Musical style Veloso's home, Bahia, has had a decisive role in his music. He praises Bahia for its importance in Brazil's colonial period‚Äîwhen the Portuguese first came‚Äîas well as for Bahia's contribution to Brazilian music. He has cited among his musical influences Am√°lia Rodrigues, Cole Porter, the Rolling Stones 1969 tour, and above all, Jo√£o Gilberto. Veloso says that he is unable to make a comparison between his musical style in the 1960s, at the height of Tropic√°lia, and his current work. He does note, however, that he has been able to accomplish music of a higher quality later in his career; that he is \\"better at everything.\\" Discography =Studio albums= *1967: Domingo *1968: Caetano Veloso *1968: Tropic√°lia: ou Panis et Circenses *1968: Veloso, Gil e Beth√¢nia *1969: Caetano Veloso *1971: Caetano Veloso *1972: Transa *1972: Ara√ß√° Azul *1975: Qualquer Coisa *1975: J√≥ia *1977: Caetano... muitos carnavais... *1977: Bicho *1978: Muito *1979: Cinema Transcendental *1981: Outras Palavras *1981: Brasil (Jo√£o Gilberto album featuring Caetano Veloso, Gilberto Gil and Maria Beth√¢nia) *1982: Cores, Nomes *1983: Uns *1984: Vel√¥ *1986: Caetano Veloso *1987: Caetano *1989: Estrangeiro *1991: Circulad√¥ *1993: Tropic√°lia 2 (with Gilberto Gil) *1994: Fina Estampa *1998: Livro *2000: Noites do Norte *2002: Eu N√£o Pe√ßo Desculpa (with Jorge Mautner) *2004: A Foreign Sound *2005: Onqot√¥ *2006: C√™ *2008: Caetano Veloso e Roberto Carlos ‚Äì e a M√∫sica de Tom Jobim *2009: Zii e Zie *2012: Abra√ßa√ßo =Live albums= *1968: Ao Vivo (with Os Mutantes) *1972: Barra 69 ao Vivo na Bahia (with Gilberto Gil) *1972: Caetano e Chico ‚Äì juntos e ao vivo (with Chico Buarque) *1974: Temporada de Ver√£o ‚Äì Ao Vivo na Bahia (with Gal Costa and Gilberto Gil) *1976: Doces B√°rbaros (with Gal Costa, Gilberto Gil, and Maria Beth√¢nia) *1977: Bicho Baile Show (with Banda Black Rio) *1978: Maria Beth√¢nia e Caetano Veloso ao Vivo (with Maria Beth√¢nia) *1986: Totalmente Demais *1992: Circulad√¥ Vivo *1994: Fina Estampa ao Vivo *1999: Prenda Minha *1999: Omaggio a Federico e Giulietta *2001: Noites do Norte ao Vivo *2002: Live in Bahia *2007: C√™ ao Vivo *2011: MTV ao Vivo ‚Äì Caetano ‚Äì Zii e Zie *2011: Caetano e Maria Gad√∫ Multishow ao Vivo (with Maria Gad√∫) *2012: Live at Carnegie Hall (recorded in 2004 with David Byrne) *2013: Abra√ßa√ßo ao Vivo *2016: Dois Amigos (Caetano Veloso and Gilberto Gil) *2018: Ofertorio =Soundtracks= *1995: O Quatrilho *1996: Tieta do Agreste *1999: Orfeu *2002: Talk to Her (Hable con ella) (song \\"Cucurrucuc√∫ paloma\\", live) *2002: Frida *2004: Meu Tio Matou um Cara *2004: Eros *2006: Nacho Libre *2007: Look At This (√ì Pai, √ì) *2008: Romance *2016: Moonlight (\\"Cucurrucuc√∫ paloma\\") =Compilations= *1996: Red Hot + Rio, AIDS-Benefit Album produced by the Red Hot Organization, contributor on track \\"√â Preciso Perdoar\\" *1998: Onda Sonora: Red Hot + Lisbon, AIDS-Benefit Album produced by the Red Hot Organization, contributor on track \\"Dreamworld: Marco de Canaveses\\" *2002: Todo Caetano (box set) Awards and honors  References  Bibliography *Perrone, Charles A.

He was one of the early members of the Fabian Society in 1884, who like George Bernard Shaw joined three months after its inception. Along with his wife Beatrice Webb and with Annie Besant, Graham Wallas, Edward R. Pease, Hubert Bland and Sydney Olivier, Shaw and Webb turned the Fabian Society into the pre-eminent political-intellectual society in Edwardian England. He wrote the original, pro-nationalisation Clause IV for the British Labour Party. Background and education Webb was born in London to a professional family. He studied law at the Birkbeck Literary and Scientific Institution for a degree of the University of London in his spare time, while holding down an office job. He also studied at King's College London, prior to being called to the Bar in 1885. Professional life In 1895, he helped to establish the London School of Economics, using a bequest left to the Fabian Society. He was appointed Professor of Public Administration in 1912, a post he held for 15 years. In 1892, Webb married Beatrice Potter, who shared his interests and beliefs. The money she brought with her enabled him to give up his clerical job and concentrate on his other activities. Sidney and Beatrice Webb founded the New Statesman magazine in 1913.The world movement towards collectivism, Beatrice and Sidney Webb, New Statesman, 12 April 1913; Bending the arc of history towards justice and freedom, New Statesman, 12 April 2013; retrieved 13 May 2014. Political career Sidney Webb and Beatrice Webb Webb and Potter were members of the Labour Party and took an active role in politics. Sidney became Member of Parliament for Seaham at the 1922 general election.The History of the Fabian Society, Edward R. Pease, Frank Cass and Co. LTD, 1963 The couple's influence can be seen in their hosting of the Coefficients, a dining club which attracted some of the leading statesmen and thinkers of the day. In 1929, he was raised to the peerage as Baron Passfield, of Passfield Corner in the County of Southampton. He served as both Secretary of State for the Colonies and Secretary of State for Dominion Affairs in Ramsay MacDonald's second Labour Government in 1929. As Colonial Secretary he issued the Passfield White Paper revising the government's policy in Palestine, previously set by the Churchill White Paper of 1922. In 1930, failing health caused him to step down as Dominions Secretary, but he stayed on as Colonial Secretary till the fall of the Labour government in August 1931. The Webbs ignored the mounting evidence of atrocities being committed by Joseph Stalin and remained supporters of the Soviet Union until their deaths. Having reached their seventies and early eighties, their books Soviet Communism: A New Civilisation? (1935) and The Truth About Soviet Russia (1942) still gave a positive assessment of Stalin's regime. The Trotskyist historian Al Richardson later described Soviet Communism: A New Civilization? as \\"pure Soviet propaganda at its most mendacious\\".Al Richardson, \\"Introduction\\" to C. L. R. James, World Revolution 1917‚Äì1936: The Rise and Fall of the Communist International. Humanities Press (reprint), 1994 Writings Webb co-authored, with his wife, a book on The History of Trade Unionism (1894). For the Fabian Society he wrote on poverty in London, the eight-hour day, land nationalisation, the nature of socialism, education, eugenics and reform of the House of Lords. He also drafted Clause IV, which committed the Labour Party to public ownership of industry. References in literature Beatrice and Sidney Webb working together in 1895 In H. G. Wells' The New Machiavelli (1911), the Webbs, as \\"the Baileys\\", are mercilessly lampooned as short-sighted, bourgeois manipulators. The Fabian Society, of which Wells was briefly a member (1903‚Äì08), fares no better in his estimation. In her diary,. Beatrice Webb records that they have \\"read the caricatures of ourselves... with much interest and amusement. The portraits are very clever in a malicious way.\\"Beatrice Webb's typescript diary, 2 January 1901 ‚Äì 10 February 1911, LSE Digital Library http://digital.library.lse.ac.uk/objects/lse:won715bor/read#page/622/mode/2up She reviews the book and Wells's character in detail, summarising: \\"As an attempt at representing a political philosophy the book utterly fails...\\"Beatrice Webb's typescript diary, 2 January 1901 ‚Äì 10 February 1911, LSE Digital Library http://digital.library.lse.ac.uk/objects/lse:won715bor/read#page/622/mode/2up/ Personal life When Beatrice Webb died in 1943, the casket containing her ashes was buried in the garden of their house in Passfield Corner. Lord Passfield's ashes were also buried there in 1947. Shortly afterwards, George Bernard Shaw launched a petition to have both reburied in Westminster Abbey, which was eventually granted. Today, the Webbs' ashes are interred in the nave of Westminster Abbey, close to those of Clement Attlee and Ernest Bevin. He and his wife were friends with the philosopher Bertrand Russell.Autobiography of Bertrand Russell (London: Allen and Unwin, 1969). In 2006, the London School of Economics, alongside the Housing Association, renamed its Great Dover Street student residence Sidney Webb House in his honour.

The Kaveri river rises at Talakaveri in the Brahmagiri range in the Western Ghats, Kodagu district of the state of Karnataka, at an elevation of 1,341 m above mean sea level and flows for about 800 km before its outfall into the Bay of Bengal. It is the third largest river after Godavari and Krishna in South India and the largest in the State of Tamil Nadu, which, on its course, bisects the state into North and South. The Kaveri is sacred river to the people of South India and is worshipped as the Goddess Kaveriamma. The Kaveri is also one of the seven holy rivers of India. The catchment area of Kaveri basin is estimated to be with many tributaries including Harangi, Hemavati, Kabini, Bhavani, Lakshmana Tirtha, Noyyal and Arkavati. The river basin covers three states and a Union Territory as follows: Tamil Nadu, ; Karnataka, ; Kerala, , and Puducherry, . Rising in Talakaveri in Kodagu, Karnataka, it flows southeast some to enter the Bay of Bengal. In Chamarajanagar district it forms the island of Shivanasamudra, on either side of which are the scenic Shivanasamudra Falls that descend about . The river is the source for an extensive irrigation system and for hydroelectric power. The river has supported irrigated agriculture for centuries and served as the lifeblood of the ancient kingdoms and modern cities of South India. Access to the river's waters has pitted Indian states against each other for decades. It was profusely described in the Tamil Sangam literature and is held in great reverence in Hinduism.  River course  After the river leaves the Kodagu hills and flows onto the Deccan plateau, it forms two islands in Mandya district's Srirangapatna and Shivanasamudra. First comes the Srirangapatna, which forms the sangam, and then comes Shivanasamudra. At Shivanasamudra the river drops , forming the famous Shivanasamudra Falls known separately as Gagana Chukki and Bhara Chukki.The Cauvery Trail : Kaveri has many religious and tourism spots between KRS and Mettur Asia's first hydroelectric plant (built in 1902) was on the left falls and supplied power to the city of Bangalore. In its course through Karnataka, the channel is interrupted by 12 \\"anekattu\\" (dams) for the purpose of irrigation. From the Anaikattu at Madadkatte, an artificial channel is diverted at a distance of , irrigating an area of , and ultimately bringing its water supply to the town of Mandya. 3 km away from Srirangapatna, the Kaveri is the basis for the Ranganthittu Bird Sanctuary. Near Srirangapatna is also an aqueduct, the Bangara Doddi Nala, which was constructed in the 17th century by the Wodeyar maharaja of Mysore, Ranadhira Kantirava, in memory of his favourite consort. This aqueduct also served as a motorable bridge until 1964.The kabini river tributary of Kaveri joins Kaveri at Tirumakudal Narasipura where triveni sangama takes place along with mythological river Spatika. The Moyar River is an east flowing river that originates in the Mudumalai, Bandipur, and Wayanad National Parks draining the Nilgiri Hills in Tamil Nadu and Karnataka and is one of the tributaries to the Kaveri River. The river enters Tamil Nadu through Dharmapuri district leading to the flat plains where it meanders. It drops into the Hogenakkal Falls just before it arrives in the town of Hogenakkal in Tamil Nadu. The three minor tributaries, Palar, Chinnar and Thoppar enter into the Kaveri on her course, above Stanley Reservoir in Mettur, where the dam has been constructed. It then flows further through the length of Erode district where the river Bhavani, running through the breadth of the district, merges with it. The confluence of the rivers Kaveri, Bhavani and Akash Ganga (mythological) is at the exact place of Bhavani, Tamil Nadu Kooduthurai or Tiriveni Sangamam, Northern part of Erode City. While passing through Erode, two more tributaries merge. Thirumani Mutharu joins it in a village called Kududurai in Namakkal District. Noyyal and Amaravathi join it in Karur district and reaches Mayanur Dam, about 20 km east of Karur city. Here the river becomes wide, with a sandy bed, and flows in an eastern direction to enter Tiruchirappalli district It splits into two at upper Anicut about west of Tiruchirappalli. The northern branch of the river is called the Kollidam while the southern branch retains the name Kaveri and then goes directly eastwards into Thanjavur District. These two rivers join again and form the Srirangam island that is a part of the city of Tiruchirapalli. The oldest functional damhttp://www.water- technology.net/features/feature-the-worlds-oldest-dams-still-in-use/Grand Anicut or Kallanai was present at this place. From Thanjavur, the river splits and goes to few places in the Delta Kaveri. = Tributaries = Kaveri river flowing at Mekedatu * Harangi River * Hemavati River * Lakshmana Tirtha * Amaravathi River * Bhavani River * Kabini River * Noyyal River * Arkavathi River Irrigation The primary uses of Kaveri is providing water for irrigation, water for household consumption and the generation of electricity. An estimate at the time of the first Five Year Plan puts the total flow of the Kaveri at , of which 60 % was used for irrigation. The Torekadanahalli pumpstation sends per day of water from Kaveri to Bangalore.http://www.tce.co.in/infra/watersupply/bangalore.pdf#search=%22halli%20pipeline%20Bangalore%22 Stanley Reservoir formed by Mettur Dam, the largest dam in Tamil Nadu The hydroelectric plant built on the left of Sivanasamudra Falls on the Kaveri in 1902 was the first hydroelectric plant in Asia. The Krishna Raja Sagara Dam has a capacity of 49 tmc ft. and the Mettur Dam which creates Stanley Reservoir has a capacity of 93.4 tmc ft. (thousand million cubic ft) In August 2003, inflow into reservoirs in Karnataka was at a 29-year low, with a 58% shortfall. Water stored in Krishna Raja Sagara amounted to only 4.6 tmc ft. In February 2020, Tamil Nadu assembly passed bill to declare Cauvery Delta as Protected Agricultural Zone, includes Thanjavur, Thirvarur, Nagapattinam and five blocks in Cuddalore and Pudukottai. The bill fails to include Tiruchirappalli, Ariyalur and Karur which are geographically included in the Cauvery Delta.https://www.theweek.in/news/india/2020/02/20/tn-assembly-passes- bill-to-declare-cauvery-delta-as-protected-ag.html  Water sharing  As per an order by the Indian Supreme Court on 16 February 2018, Karnataka will get 284.75 tmc ft, Tamil Nadu will get 404.25 tmc ft, Kerala will get 30 tmc ft and Puducherry will get 7 tmc ft, 10 tmc ft will be reserved for Environmental Protection and 4 tmc ft will be reserved for Inevitable Wastage into the Sea.  Cauvery Water Management Authority (CWMA) and Cauvery Water Regulation Committee (CWRC) 2018  Acting on the Supreme Court's direction, the Centre constituted a Cauvery Water Management Authority (CWMA) on 1 June 2018 to address the dispute over sharing of river water among Tamil Nadu, Karnataka, Kerala and Puducherry.. The central government failed to adhere with the top court's deadline of within six weeks of deliverence of judgement. On 16 February 2018, the apex court had directed the government to form the CWMA within six weeks in a verdict that marginally increased Karnataka's share of Cauvery water, reduced the allocation for Tamil Nadu and sought to settle the protracted water dispute between the two states. On 22 June 2018, despite opposition from Karnataka, the Central government constituted the Cauvery Water Regulation Committee (CWRC) as per the provisions in the Kaveri Management Scheme laid down by the Supreme Court.

They are regularly found in improperly stored staple commodities such as cassava, chili peppers, cottonseed, millet, peanuts, rice, sesame seeds, sorghum, sunflower seeds, sweetcorn, tree nuts, wheat, and a variety of spices. When contaminated food is processed, aflatoxins enter the general food supply where they have been found in both pet and human foods, as well as in feedstocks for agricultural animals. Animals fed contaminated food can pass aflatoxin transformation products into eggs, milk products, and meat. For example, contaminated poultry feed is suspected in the findings of high percentages of samples of aflatoxin- contaminated chicken meat and eggs in the Indian subcontinent. Children are particularly affected by aflatoxin exposure, which is associated with stunted growth, delayed development, liver damage, and liver cancer. An association between childhood stunting and aflatoxin exposure has been reported in some studies but could not be detected in all. Furthermore, a causal relationship between childhood stunting and aflatoxin exposure has yet to be conclusively shown by epidemiological studies, though such investigations are under way. Adults have a higher tolerance to exposure, but are also at risk. No animal species is immune. Aflatoxins are among the most carcinogenic substances known. After entering the body, aflatoxins may be metabolized by the liver to a reactive epoxide intermediate or hydroxylated to become the less harmful aflatoxin M1. Aflatoxins are most commonly ingested. However the most toxic type of aflatoxin, B1, can permeate through the skin. The United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) action levels for aflatoxin present in food or feed is 20 to 300 ppb. The FDA has had occasion to declare both human and pet food recalls as a precautionary measure to prevent exposure. The term \\"aflatoxin\\" is derived from the name of one of the molds that produce it, Aspergillus flavus. It was coined around 1960 after its discovery as the source of \\"Turkey X disease\\". Aflatoxins form one of the major groupings of mycotoxins.  Major types and their metabolites  Aflatoxin B1 is considered the most toxic and is produced by both Aspergillus flavus and Aspergillus parasiticus. Aflatoxin M1 is present in the fermentation broth of Aspergillus parasiticus, but it and aflatoxin M2 are also produced when an infected liver metabolizes aflatoxin B1 and B2. * Aflatoxin B1 and B2 (AFB), produced by Aspergillus flavus and A. parasiticus * Aflatoxin G1 and G2 (AFG), produced by some Group II A. flavus and Aspergillus parasiticus * Aflatoxin M1 (AFM1), metabolite of aflatoxin B1 in humans and animals (exposure in ng levels may come from a mother's milk) * Aflatoxin M2, metabolite of aflatoxin B2 in milk of cattle fed on contaminated foods * Aflatoxicol (AFL): metabolite produced by breaking down the lactone ring * Aflatoxin Q1 (AFQ1), major metabolite of AFB1 in in vitro liver preparations of other higher vertebrates AFM, AFQ, and AFL retain the possibly to become an epoxide. Nevertheless, they appear much less capable of causing mutagenesis than the unmetabolized toxin.  Contamination conditions  Aflatoxins are produced by both Aspergillus flavus and Aspergillus parasiticus, which are common forms of 'weedy' molds widespread in nature. The presence of those molds does not always indicate that harmful levels of aflatoxin are present, but does indicate a significant risk. The molds can colonize and contaminate food before harvest or during storage, especially following prolonged exposure to a high-humidity environment, or to stressful conditions such as drought. The native habitat of Aspergillus is in soil, decaying vegetation, hay, and grains undergoing microbiological deterioration, but it invades all types of organic substrates whenever conditions are favorable for its growth. Favorable conditions include high moisture content (at least 7%) and high temperature. Aflatoxins have been isolated from all major cereal crops, and from sources as diverse as peanut butter and cannabis. The staple commodities regularly contaminated with aflatoxins include cassava, chilies, corn, cotton seed, millet, peanuts, rice, sorghum, sunflower seeds, tree nuts, wheat, and a variety of spices intended for human or animal consumption. Aflatoxin transformation products are sometimes found in eggs, milk products, and meat when animals are fed contaminated grains. A study conducted in Kenya and Mali found that the predominant practices for drying and storage of maize were inadequate in minimizing exposure to aflatoxins. Organic crops, which are not treated with fungicides, may be more susceptible to contamination with aflatoxins. Prevention There is very limited evidence to show that agricultural and nutritional education can reduce exposure to aflatoxin in low to middle income countries. Pathology No animal species is immune to the acute toxic effects of aflatoxins. Adult humans have a high tolerance for aflatoxin exposure and rarely succumb to acute aflatoxicosis, but children are particularly affected, and their exposure can lead to stunted growth and delayed development, in addition to all the symptoms mentioned below. High- level aflatoxin exposure produces an acute hepatic necrosis (acute aflatoxicosis), resulting later in cirrhosis or carcinoma of the liver. Acute liver failure is made manifest by bleeding, edema, alteration in digestion, changes to the absorption and/or metabolism of nutrients, and mental changes and/or coma. Chronic, subclinical exposure does not lead to symptoms so dramatic as acute aflatoxicosis. Chronic exposure increases the risk of developing liver and gallbladder cancer, as aflatoxin metabolites may intercalate into DNA and alkylate the bases through epoxide moiety. This is thought to cause mutations in the p53 gene, an important gene in preventing cell cycle progression when there are DNA mutations, or signaling apoptosis (programmed cell death). These mutations seem to affect some base pair locations more than others, for example, the third base of codon 249 of the p53 gene appears to be more susceptible to aflatoxin-mediated mutations than nearby bases. As with other DNA-alkylating agents, Aflatoxin B1 can cause immune suppression, and exposure to it is associated with an increased viral load in HIV positive individuals. The expression of aflatoxin-related diseases is influenced by factors such as species, age, nutrition, sex, and the possibility of concurrent exposure to other toxins. The main target organ in mammals is the liver, so aflatoxicosis primarily is a hepatic disease. Conditions increasing the likelihood of aflatoxicosis in humans include limited availability of food, environmental conditions that favour mould growth on foodstuffs, and lack of regulatory systems for aflatoxin monitoring and control. A regular diet including apiaceous vegetables, such as carrots, parsnips, celery, and parsley may reduce the carcinogenic effects of aflatoxin. There is no specific antidote for aflatoxicosis. Symptomatic and supportive care tailored to the severity of the liver disease may include intravenous fluids with dextrose, active vitamin K, B vitamins, and a restricted, but high-quality protein diet with adequate carbohydrate content. = In other animals = In dogs, aflatoxin has potential to lead to liver disease. Low levels of aflatoxin exposure require continuous consumption for several weeks to months in order for signs of liver dysfunction to appear. Some articles have suggested the toxic level in dog food is 100‚Äì300 ppb and requires continuous exposure or consumption for a few weeks to months to develop aflatoxicosis. No information is available to suggest that recovered dogs will later succumb to an aflatoxin-induced disease. Turkeys are extremely susceptible to aflatoxicosis. Recent studies have revealed that this is due to the efficient cytochrome P450 mediated metabolism of aflatoxin B1 in the liver of turkeys and deficient glutathione-S-transferase mediated detoxification. Some studies on pregnant hamsters showed a significant relationship between exposure of aflatoxin B1 (4 mg/kg, single dose) and the appearance of developmental anomalies in their offspring. In 2005, Diamond Pet Foods discovered aflatoxin in a product manufactured at their facility in Gaston, South Carolina.FDA Inspection Report-Diamond Gaston SC Plant 12/21/2005-1/19/2006.2005 Recall, FDA In 23 states, Diamond voluntarily recalled 19 products formulated with corn and manufactured in the Gaston facility. Testing of more than 2,700 finished product samples conducted by laboratories confirmed that only two date codes of two adult dog formulas had the potential to be toxic.AKC Standard Article Contaminated Diamond Pet Food Products and 'Best By' Dates Narrowed Akcstandard.com  Detection in humans  There are two principal techniques that have been used most often to detect levels of aflatoxin in humans. The first method is measuring the AFB1-guanine adduct in the urine of subjects. The presence of this breakdown product indicates exposure to aflatoxin B1 during the past 24 hours. This technique measures only recent exposure, however. Due to the half-life of this metabolite, the level of AFB1-guanine measured may vary from day to day, based on diet, it is not ideal for assessing long-term exposure. Another technique that has been used is a measurement of the AFB1-albumin adduct level in the blood serum. This approach provides a more integrated measure of exposure over several weeks or months. List of outbreaks International sources of commercial peanut butter, cooking oils (e.g. olive, peanut and sesame oil), and cosmetics have been identified as contaminated with aflatoxin. In some instances, liquid chromatography‚Äìtandem mass spectrometry (LC‚ÄìMS/MS), and other analytical methods, revealed a range from 48% to 80% of selected product samples as containing detectable quantities of aflatoxin. In many of these contaminated food products, the aflatoxin exceeded the safe limits of the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA), or other regulatory agency. * 2003 Kenya: acute poisoning, 120 confirmed deaths. * February‚ÄìMarch 2013: Romania, Serbia, Croatia imported into western Europe - 2013 aflatoxin contamination. * February 2013: Iowa contamination. * 2014 (ongoing): Nepal and Bangladesh, neonatal exposures, found in umbilical cord blood. *2019 Kenya: five brands of maize flour recalled due to contamination.

Villa-Lobos has become the best-known South American composer of all time. A prolific composer, he wrote numerous orchestral, chamber, instrumental and vocal works, totaling over 2000 works by his death in 1959. His music was influenced by both Brazilian folk music and by stylistic elements from the European classical tradition, as exemplified by his Bachianas Brasileiras (Brazilian Bachian-pieces) and his Ch√¥ros. His Etudes for guitar (1929) were dedicated to Andr√©s Segovia, while his 5 Preludes (1940) were dedicated to his spouse Arminda Neves d‚ÄôAlmeida, a.k.a. \\"Mindinha.\\" Both are important works in the guitar repertory. Biography =Youth and exploration= Villa-Lobos was born in Rio de Janeiro. His father, Ra√∫l, was a civil servant, an educated man of Spanish extraction, a librarian, and an amateur astronomer and musician. In Villa-Lobos's early childhood, Brazil underwent a period of social revolution and modernisation, abolishing slavery in 1888 and overthrowing the Empire of Brazil in 1889. The changes in Brazil were reflected in its musical life: previously European music had been the dominant influence, and the courses at the Conservat√≥rio de M√∫sica were grounded in traditional counterpoint and harmony. Villa-Lobos underwent very little of this formal training. After a few abortive harmony lessons, he learnt music by illicit observation from the top of the stairs of the regular musical evenings at his house arranged by his father. He learned to play cello, clarinet, and guitar. When his father died suddenly in 1899 he earned a living for his family by playing in cinema and theatre orchestras in Rio.; Around 1905 Villa-Lobos started explorations of Brazil's \\"dark interior\\", absorbing the native Brazilian musical culture. Serious doubt has been cast on some of Villa-Lobos's tales of the decade or so he spent on these expeditions, and about his capture and near escape from cannibals, with some believing them to be fabrications or wildly embellished romanticism. After this period, he gave up any idea of conventional training and instead absorbed the musical influences of Brazil's indigenous cultures, themselves based on Portuguese and African, as well as American Indian elements. His earliest compositions were the result of improvisations on the guitar from this period. Villa-Lobos played with many local Brazilian street-music bands; he was also influenced by the cinema and Ernesto Nazareth's improvised tangos and polkas. For a time Villa-Lobos became a cellist in a Rio opera company, and his early compositions include attempts at Grand Opera. Encouraged by Arthur Napole√£o, a pianist and music publisher, he decided to compose seriously. Heitor Villa- Lobos statue next to Rio de Janeiro's Municipal Theater. =Brazilian influences= On 12 November 1913, Villa-Lobos married the pianist Luc√≠lia Guimar√£es,; ended his travels, and began his career as a serious musician. Up until his marriage, he had not learned to play the piano, so his wife taught him the rudiments of the instrument. His music began to be published in 1913. He introduced some of his compositions in a series of occasional chamber concerts (later also orchestral concerts) from 19151921, mainly in Rio de Janeiro's Sal√£o Nobre do Jornal do Com√©rcio. The music presented at these concerts shows his coming to terms with the conflicting elements in his experience, and overcoming a crisis of identity, as to whether European or Brazilian music would dominate his style. This was decided by 1916, the year in which he composed the symphonic poems Amazonas and T√©dio de alvorada, the first version of what would become Uirapur√∫ (although Amazonas was not performed until 1929, and Uirapur√∫ was only completed in 1934 and first performed in 1935). These works drew from native Brazilian legends and the use of \\"primitive\\" folk material. European influences did still inspire Villa- Lobos. In 1917 Sergei Diaghilev made an impact on tour in Brazil with his Ballets Russes. That year Villa-Lobos also met the French composer Darius Milhaud, who was in Rio as secretary to Paul Claudel at the French Legation. Milhaud brought the music of Claude Debussy, Erik Satie, and possibly Igor Stravinsky; in return Villa-Lobos introduced Milhaud to Brazilian street music. In 1918, he also met the pianist Arthur Rubinstein, who became a lifelong friend and champion; this meeting prompted Villa-Lobos to write more piano music. In about 1918 Villa-Lobos abandoned the use of opus numbers for his compositions as a constraint to his pioneering spirit. With the piano suite Carnaval das crian√ßas (Children's carnival) of 191920, Villa-Lobos liberated his style altogether from European Romanticism: the suite, in eight movements with the finale written for piano duet, depicts eight characters or scenes from Rio's Lenten Carnival. In February 1922, a festival of modern art took place in S√£o Paulo and Villa-Lobos contributed performances of his own works. The press were unsympathetic and the audience were not appreciative; their mockery was encouraged by Villa-Lobos's being forced by a foot infection to wear one carpet slipper. The festival ended with Villa-Lobos's Quarteto simb√≥lico, composed as an impression of Brazilian urban life. In July 1922, Rubinstein gave the first performance of the piano suite A Prole do Beb√™ (The Baby's Family), composed in 1918. There had recently been an attempted military coup on Copacabana Beach, and places of entertainment had been closed for days; the public possibly wanted something less intellectually demanding, and the piece was booed. Villa-Lobos was philosophical about it, and Rubinstein later reminisced that the composer said, \\"I am still too good for them.\\" The piece has been called \\"the first enduring work of Brazilian modernism\\". Rubinstein suggested that Villa-Lobos tour abroad, and in 1923 he set out for Paris. His avowed aim was to exhibit his exotic sound world rather than to study. Just before he left he completed his Nonet (for ten players and chorus) which was first performed after his arrival in the French capital. He stayed in Paris in 192324 and 192730, and there he met such luminaries as Edgard Var√®se, Pablo Picasso, Leopold Stokowski and Aaron Copland. Parisian concerts of his music made a strong impression.See, for example, the influence of the brilliance of his orchestral palette on the young Olivier Messiaen, discussed in . In the 1920s, Villa-Lobos also met the Spanish guitarist Andr√©s Segovia, who commissioned a guitar study: the composer responded by writing a set of twelve such pieces, each based on a tiny detail or figure played by Brazilian itinerant street musicians (chor√µes), transformed into a √©tude that is not merely didactic. The music of chor√µes also provided the initial inspiration for his Ch√¥ros, a series of compositions written between 1920 and 1929. The first European performance of Ch√¥ros No. 10, in Paris, caused a storm: L.Chevaillier wrote of it in Le Monde musical, \\"[...it is] an art [...] to which we must now give a new name.\\"Le Monde musical 12 (31 Dec. 1927), quoted in . =Vargas era= In 1930, Villa-Lobos, who was in Brazil to conduct, planned to return to Paris. One of the consequences of the revolution of that year was that money could no longer be taken out of the country, and so he had no means of paying any rents abroad. Thus forced to stay in Brazil, he arranged concerts instead around S√£o Paulo, and composed patriotic and educational music. In 1932, he became director of the Superintend√™ncia de Educa√ß√£o Musical e Art√≠stica (SEMA), and his duties included arranging concerts including the Brazilian premieres of Ludwig van Beethoven's Missa Solemnis and Johann Sebastian Bach's Mass in B minor as well as Brazilian compositions. His position at SEMA led him to compose mainly patriotic and propagandist works. His series of Bachianas Brasileiras were a notable exception. In 1936, at the age of forty-nine, Villa-Lobos left his wife, and became romantically involved with Arminda Neves d‚ÄôAlmeida, who remained his companion until death. Arminda eventually took on the name Villa-Lobos, though Villa-Lobos never divorced his first wife. After Villa-Lobos' death, Arminda became the Director of the Museu Villa-Lobos in 1960, until her death in 1985. Arminda was herself a musician and a significant influence on Villa-Lobos. He also dedicated a good number of works to her, including the Ciclo brasileiro and many of the Ch√¥ros. Villa-Lobos's writings during the presidency of Get√∫lio Vargas (1930‚Äì1945) include propaganda for Brazilian nationhood (brasilidade),For example, and teaching and theoretical works. His Guia Pr√°tico ran to 11volumes, Solfejos (two volumes, 1942 and 1946) contained vocal exercises, and Canto Orfe√¥nico (1940 and 1950) contained patriotic songs for schools and for civic occasions. His music for the film O Descobrimento do Brasil (The Discovery of Brazil) of 1936, which included versions of earlier compositions, was arranged into orchestral suites, and includes a depiction of the first mass in Brazil in a setting for double choir. Villa-Lobos published A M√∫sica Nacionalista no Gov√™rno Get√∫lio Vargas 1941, in which he characterised the nation as a sacred entity whose symbols (including its flag, motto and national anthem) were inviolable. Villa-Lobos was the chair of a committee whose task was to define a definitive version of the Brazilian national anthem. After 1937, during the Estado Novo period when Vargas seized power by decree, Villa-Lobos continued producing patriotic works directly accessible to mass audiences. Independence Day on September 7, 1939 involved 30,000 children singing the national anthem and items arranged by Villa-Lobos. For the 1943 celebrations he also composed the ballet Dan√ßa da terra, which the authorities deemed unsuitable until it was revised. The 1943 celebrations did include Villa-Lobos's hymn Invoca√ß√£o em defesa da p√°tria shortly after Brazil's declaring war on Germany and its allies. Villa-Lobos's demagogue status damaged his reputation among certain schools of musicians, among them disciples of new European trends such as serialismwhich was effectively off limits in Brazil until the 1960s. This crisis was, in part, due to some Brazilian composers finding it necessary to reconcile Villa-Lobos's own liberation of Brazilian music from European models in the 1920s with a style of music they felt to be more universal. =Composer in demand= Heitor Villa-Lobos at the end of a concert in Tel Aviv, 1952 Vargas fell from power in 1945. Villa-Lobos was able, after the end of the war, to travel abroad again; he returned to Paris, and also made regular visits to the United States as well as travelling to Great Britain, and Israel. He received a huge number of commissions, and fulfilled many of them despite failing health. He composed concertos for piano, cello (the second one in 1953), classical guitar (in 1951 for Segovia, who refused to play it until the composer provided a cadenza in 1956), harp (for Nicanor Zabaleta in 1953) and harmonica (for John Sebastian, Sr. in 1955‚Äì6). Other commissions included his Symphony No. 11 (for the Boston Symphony Orchestra in 1955), and the opera Yerma (1955‚Äì56) based on the play by Federico Garc√≠a Lorca. His prolific output of this period prompted criticisms of note-spinning and banality: critical reactions to his Piano Concerto No. 5 included the comments \\"bankrupt\\" and \\"piano tuners' orgy\\",The critic of Musical Opinion in 1955, quoted in \\"raked the very depths of banality\\", \\"nothing ... but soupy textures or a bedraggled romantic idea\\", and \\"truly the kind of music that should never get written, still less performed\\".Donald Mitchell, \\"London Music\\", The Musical Times 96, No. 1349 (July 1955): 378‚Äì80. His music for the film Green Mansions starring Audrey Hepburn and Anthony Perkins, commissioned by MGM in 1958, earned Villa-Lobos , and he conducted the soundtrack recording himself. The film was in production for many years. Originally to be directed by Vincente Minnelli, it was taken over by Hepburn's husband Mel Ferrer. MGM decided to use only part of Villa- Lobos's music in the actual film, turning instead to Bronislau Kaper for the rest of the music. From the score, Villa-Lobos compiled a work for soprano soloist, male chorus, and orchestra, which he titled Forest of the Amazon and recorded it in 1959 in stereo with Brazilian soprano Bidu Say√£o, an unidentified male chorus, and the Symphony of the Air for United Artists Records. The recording was issued both on LP and reel-to-reel tape (United Artist UAC 8007, stereo 7 1/2 IPS). In June 1959, Villa-Lobos alienated many of his fellow musicians by expressing disillusionment, saying in an interview that Brazil was \\"dominated by mediocrity\\".. In November he died in Rio; his state funeral was the final major civic event in that city before the capital transferred to Bras√≠lia. He is buried in the Cemit√©rio S√£o Jo√£o Batista in Rio de Janeiro. Music His earliest pieces originated in guitar improvisations, for example Panqueca (Pancake) of 1900. The concert series of 191521 included first performances of pieces demonstrating originality and virtuosic technique. Some of these pieces are early examples of elements of importance throughout his ≈ìuvre. His attachment to the Iberian Peninsula is demonstrated in Can√ß√£o Ib√©ria of 1914 and in orchestral transcriptions of some of Enrique Granados' piano Goyescas (1918, now lost). Other themes that were to recur in his later work include the anguish and despair of the piece Desesperan√ßa‚Äî Sonata Phantastica e Capricciosa no. 1 (1915), a violin sonata including \\"histrionic and violently contrasting emotions\\", the birds of L'oiseau bless√© d'une fl√®che (1913), the mother‚Äìchild relationship (not usually a happy one in Villa-Lobos's music) in Les m√®res of 1914, and the flowers of Su√≠te floral for piano of 191618 which reappeared in Distribui√ß√£o de flores for flute and guitar of 1937. Reconciling European tradition and Brazilian influences was also an element that bore fruit more formally later. His earliest published work Pequena su√≠te for cello and piano of 1913 shows a love for the cello, but is not notably Brazilian, although it contains elements that were to resurface later. His three-movement Su√≠te graciosa of 1915 (expanded to six movements c. 1947 to become his String Quartet No. 1) is influenced by European opera,, quoted in . while Tr√™s dan√ßas caracter√≠sticas (africanas e ind√≠genas) of 191416 for piano, later arranged for octet and subsequently orchestrated, is radically influenced by the tribal music of the Caripunas Indians of Mato Grosso. Facsimile of Villa-Lobos's \\"The Slaves of Job\\" With his tone poems Amazonas (1917, first performed in Paris in 1929) and Uirapur√∫ (1917, first performed 1935) he created works dominated by indigenous Brazilian influences. The works use Brazilian folk tales and characters, imitations of the sounds of the jungle and its fauna, imitations of the sound of the nose-flute by the violinophone, and not least imitations of the uirapuru bird itself. His meeting with Arthur Rubinstein in 1918 prompted Villa-Lobos to compose piano music such as Simples colet√¢nea of 1919‚Äîwhich was possibly influenced by Rubinstein's playing of Ravel and Scriabin on his South American tours‚Äîand Bailado infernal of 1920. The latter piece includes the tempi and expression markings \\"vertiginoso e fren√©tico\\", \\"infernal\\" and \\"mais vivo ainda\\" (faster still). Carnaval das crian√ßas of 191920 saw Villa-Lobos's mature style emerge; unconstrained by the use of traditional formulae or any requirement for dramatic tension, the piece at times imitates a mouth organ, children's dances, a harlequinade, and ends with an impression of the carnival parade. This work was orchestrated in 1929 with new linking passages and a new title, Momoprecoce. Na√Øvet√© and innocence is also heard in the piano suites A Prole do Beb√™ (The Baby's Family) of 191821. Around this time he also fused urban Brazilian influences and impressions, for example in his Quarteto simb√≥lico of 1921. He included the urban street music of the chor√µes, who were groups containing flute, clarinet and cavaquinho (a Brazilian guitar), and often also including ophicleide, trombones or percussion. Villa-Lobos occasionally joined such bands. Early works showing this influence were incorporated into the Su√≠te popular brasileira of 190812 assembled by his publisher, and more mature works include the Sexteto m√≠stico (1955, replacing a lost and probably unfinished one begun in 1917), and his setting of the poetry of M√°rio de Andrade and Catulo da Pax√£o Cearense in the Can√ß√µes t√≠picas brasileiras of 1919. His guitar studies are also influenced by the music of the chor√µes. All the elements mentioned so far are fused in Villa-Lobos's Nonet. Subtitled Impress√£o r√°pida do todo o Brasil (A Brief Impression of the Whole of Brazil), the title of the work denotes it as ostensibly chamber music, but it is scored for flute/piccolo, oboe, clarinet, saxophone, bassoon, celesta, harp, piano, a large percussion battery requiring at least two players, and a mixed chorus. In Paris, his musical vocabulary established, Villa-Lobos solved the problem of his works' form. It was perceived as an incongruity that his Brazilian impressionism should be expressed in the form of quartets and sonatas. He developed new forms to free his imagination from the constraints of conventional musical development such as that required in sonata form. The multi-sectional poema form may be seen in the Suite for Voice and Violin, which is somewhat like a triptych, and the Poema da crian√ßa e sua mam√£ for voice, flute, clarinet, and cello (1923). The extended Rudepo√™ma for piano, written for Rubinstein, is a multi-layered work, often requiring notation on several staves, and is both experimental and demanding. Wright calls it \\"the most impressive result\\" of this formal development. The Ciranda, or Cirandinha is a stylised treatment of simple Brazilian folk melodies in a wide variety of moods. A ciranda is a child's singing game, but Villa-Lobos's treatment in the works he gave this title are sophisticated. Another form was the Ch√¥ros. Villa-Lobos composed more than a dozen works with this title for various instruments, mostly in the years 19241929. He described them as \\"a new form of musical composition\\", a transformation of the Brazilian music and sounds \\"by the personality of the composer\\".Note in the score of Ch√¥ros No. 3, quoted in He also composed between 1930 and 1945 nine pieces he called Bachianas Brasileiras (Brazilian Bachian pieces). These take the forms and nationalism of the Ch√¥ros, and add the composer's love of Bach. He incorporated neoclassicism in his nationalistic style. Villa-Lobos's use of archaisms was not new (an early example is his Pequena su√≠te for cello and piano of 1913). The pieces evolved over the period rather than being conceived as a whole, some of them being revised or added to. They contain some of his most popular music, such as No.5 for soprano and eight cellos (19381945), and No.2 for orchestra of 1930 (the Tocata movement of which is Otrenzinho do caipira, \\"The little train of the Caipira\\"). They also show the composer's love for the tonal qualities of the cello, both No.1 and No.5 being scored for no other instruments. In these works the often harsh dissonances of his earlier music are less evident: or, as Simon Wright puts it, they are \\"sweetened\\". The transformation of Ch√¥ros into Bachianas Brasileiras is demonstrated clearly by the comparison of No.6 for flute and bassoon with the earlier Ch√¥ros No. 2 for flute and clarinet. The dissonances of the later piece are more controlled, the forward direction of the music easier to discern. Bachianas Brasileiras No.9 takes the concept so far as to be an abstract Prelude and Fugue, a complete distillation of the composer's national influences. discusses the Bachianas Brasileiras in some detail Villa-Lobos eventually recorded all nine of these works for EMI in Paris, mostly with the musicians of the French National Orchestra; these were originally issued on LPs and later reissued on CDs. He also recorded the first section of Bachianas Brasileiras No.5 with Bidu Say√£o and a group of cellists for Columbia. During his period at SEMA, Villa-Lobos composed five string quartets, nos. 5to9, which explored avenues opened by his public music that dominated his output. He also wrote more music for Segovia, the Cinq pr√©ludes, which also demonstrate a further formalisation of his composition style. After the fall of the Vargas government, Villa-Lobos returned full-time to composition, resuming a prolific rate of completing works. His concertos‚Äîparticularly those for the guitar, the harp, and the harmonica‚Äîare examples of his earlier poema form. The Harp Concerto is a large work, and shows a new propensity to focus on a small detail, then to fade it and bring another detail to the foreground. This technique also occurs in his final opera, Yerma, which contains a series of scenes each of which establishes an atmosphere, similarly to the earlier Momoprecoce. Villa-Lobos's final major work was the music for the film Green Mansions (though in the end, most of his score was replaced with music by Bronislaw KaperGreen Mansions film credits.) and its arrangement as Floresta do Amazonas for orchestra, as well as some short songs issued separately. In 1957, he wrote a Seventeenth String Quartet, whose austerity of technique and emotional intensity \\"provide a eulogy to his craft\\". His Bendita Sabedoria, a sequence of a cappella chorales written in 1958, is a similarly simple setting of Latin biblical texts. These works lack the pictorialism of his more public music. Except for the lost works, the Nonet, the two concerted works for violin and orchestra, Suite for Piano and Orchestra, a number of the symphonic poems, most of his choral music and all of the operas, his music is well represented on the world's recital and concert stages and on CD. Legacy poster announcing appearance of Villa-Lobos in S√£o Paulo (17 February 1922) When touring Europe with his music he said, \\"I don't use folklore, I am the folklore\\" (Eu sou o folclore) and \\"I have not come to learn, I have come to show what I have done up to now\\" (Ich bin nicht gekommen, um zu lernen, sondern um zu zeigen, was ich bisher gemacht habe), showing that he was quite aware of his unique position among classical composers, and he made good use of his origins to publicise his own works.

F. C. Montague, \\"Arnold Toynbee\\", in Social Science, Municipal and Federal Government, Baltimore, Johns Hopkins University (1889), pp. 5‚Äì53. Life and career Toynbee was born in London, the son of the physician Joseph Toynbee, a pioneering otolaryngologist. His sister was the bacteriologist Grace Frankland.Cohen, S. (2004-09-23). Frankland [n√©e Toynbee], Grace Coleridge (1858‚Äì1946), bacteriologist. Oxford Dictionary of National Biography. Retrieved 30 Jan. 2018, See link Toynbee was the uncle, via his brother Harry Valpy Toynbee, of universal historian Arnold Joseph Toynbee (1889‚Äì1975). The two are often confused for each other due to the similarity of their names. Toynbee attended public schools in Blackheath and Woolwich. In 1873 he began to study political economy at Oxford University, first at Pembroke College and from 1875 at Balliol College, where he went on to teach after his graduation in 1878. He was deeply influenced by John Ruskin while at Oxford. W.G. Collingwood states that he was one of Ruskin's warmest admirers and ablest pupils. He further notes that the philanthropic work of Toynbee truly illustrated the teaching of one of Ruskin's greatest books Unto This Last. The Life and Work of John Ruskin. W.G.Collingwood. Methuen and Co. 1893. Vol 1, Page 150. His lectures on the history of the Industrial Revolution in 18th- and 19th-century Britain proved widely influential; in fact, Toynbee coined,Susan J. Winter and S. Lynn Taylor, The Role of Information Technology in the Transformation of Work: A Comparison of Postindustrial, Industrial and Protoindustrial Organization, in DeSanctis, Gerardine, Janet Fulk. Shaping Organization Form: Communication, Connection, and Community, Sage Publications Inc, 1999, p.105. or at least effectively popularised, the term \\"Industrial Revolution\\" in the Anglophone world‚Äîin Germany and elsewhere it had been brought into circulation earlier by Friedrich Engels, also under the impression of the industrial changes in Britain. He married Charlotte Atwood, 12 years his senior and a cousin of Harold Davidson, the famous rector of Stiffkey. Toynbee died in 1883, at age 30. His health had rapidly deteriorated, probably due to exhaustion by excessive work . Frederick Rogers notes that the publication of Henry George's Progress and Poverty may be said to have brought about Toynbee's death: =Toynbee genealogy= The Toynbees have been prominent in British intellectual society for several generations (this diagram is not a comprehensive Toynbee family tree): Economic history According to Toynbee, applying the historical method in economics would reveal how supposedly universal economic laws were, in fact, relative. For example, he argued that, despite commonly held beliefs, free trade was not generally advantageous in itself, but only under certain circumstances, which should not be considered absolute. Toynbee considered few laws universally true, such as the law of diminishing returns. Therefore, there were no universal rules as to how strongly the state should interfere in the marketplace; all depended on the situation and varying degrees of regulation could be appropriate. Another idea Toynbee dismissed was that free competition was universally beneficial to economic and societal progress, especially as reflected in its apotheosis in Social Darwinism, which promoted laissez-faire capitalism. Toynbee did not equate \\"a struggle for mere existence and a struggle for a particular kind of existence\\". From the very beginning of history, he argued, all human civilisation was essentially designed to \\"interfere with this brute struggle. We intend to modify the violence of the fight, and to prevent the weak being trampled under foot.\\" Lectures on the Industrial Revolution of the 18th Century in England, 2nd ed., London, Rivington's (1887), p. 86. Although economic competition does have its advantages, being the driving force behind technical progress, these were \\"gained at the expense of an enormous waste of human life and labour, which might be avoided by regulation\\". Toynbee suggested a differentiation between competition in production on the one hand, and competition in the distribution of goods on the other: > ... the struggle of men to outvie one another in production is beneficial to > the community; their struggle over the division of the joint produce is not. > The stronger side will dictate its own terms; and as a matter of fact, in > the early days of competition, the capitalists used all their power to > oppress the labourers, and drove down wages to starvation point. This kind > of competition has to be checked; there is no historical instance of its > having lasted long without being modified either by combination or > legislation, or both. In England both remedies are in operation, the former > through Trades Unions, the latter through factory legislation. Lectures on > the Industrial Revolution of the 18th Century in England, 2nd ed., London, > Rivington's (1887), p. 87. In itself, a market based on competition was neither good nor bad, but like \\"a stream whose strength and direction have to be observed, that embankments may be thrown up within which it may do its work harmlessly and beneficially\\". However, in the early phase of industrial capitalism \\"it came to be believed in as a gospel, ... from which it was regarded as little long of immoral to depart\\". Social commitment settlement house, Whitechapel, founded 1884, pictured in 1902 For Toynbee, early industrial capitalism and the situation of the working class in it was not just a subject of ivory-tower studies; he was actively involved in improving the living conditions of the labourer. He read for workers in large industrial centres and encouraged the creation of trade unions and co-operatives. A focal point of his commitment was the slum of Whitechapel, in East London, where he helped to establish public libraries for the working-class population. Toynbee also encouraged his students to offer free courses for working-class audiences in their own neighbourhoods. Inspired by his ideas, Samuel Augustus Barnett and Henrietta Barnett founded the first university settlement in 1884, shortly after Toynbee's death; it was named Toynbee Hall in his honour. A centre for social reform, Toynbee Hall was on Commercial Street, Whitechapel. It remains active today. The concept was to bring upper and middle class students into lower-class neighbourhoods, not only to provide education and social aid, but to actually live and work together with their inhabitants. This soon inspired a worldwide movement of university settlements. The idea was to help members of the future elite understand the problems of British society; this was especially important at a time when class divisions were much stronger, social mobility was minimal, and the living conditions of the poor were completely unknown to many members of the upper class. Early chairs of trustees included Philip Lyttelton Gell and Lord Alfred Milner. Toynbee Hall attracted many students, especially from Oxford's Wadham College and Balliol College, where Toynbee had taught. In 1916, the Arnold Toynbee House in New York was founded by a group of young adults who were part of the Stevenson Club at Madison House and with the help of philanthropist Rose Gruening. Eight years later, the settlement house was renamed Grand Street Settlement. Views on the Industrial Revolution Toynbee's name on the Reformers Monument, Kensal Green Cemetery Toynbee is widely accepted as the historian who ushered the expression \\"the industrial revolution\\" into the English language. Although French and German commentators had used this term in the early nineteenth century, English use had been rare and inconsistent until the posthumous publication of Toynbee's Lectures on the Industrial Revolution in England. According to Toynbee, \\"the essence of the Industrial Revolution\\" was \\"the substitution of competition for the medieval regulations which had previously controlled the production and distribution of wealth\\". Among its components were an \\"agrarian revolution\\" that produced \\"the alienation between farmer and labourer\\" and in the manufacturing world, the appearance of a \\"new class of great capitalist employers\\". \\"The old relations between masters and men disappeared, and a 'cash nexus' was substituted for the human tie.\\" Summing up his interpretation, Toynbee wrote, \\"the Wealth of Nations and the steam-engine...destroyed the old world and built a new one.\\" For Toynbee, this coupling seemed self-evident. Steam-powered factories, the Wealth of Nations, competition, the cash-nexus and the rise of pauperism formed part of a single phenomenon. In response to this bleak scenario, Toynbee proposed a test for when the state should become involved in the regulation of an economic or social sphere of society to even the balance between industry and labour. He proposed the \\"Radical Creed\\", which, > as I understand it, is this: We have not abandoned our old belief in > liberty, justice, and Self-help, but we say that under certain conditions > the people cannot help themselves, and that then they should be helped by > the State representing directly the whole people. In giving this State help, > we make three conditions: first, the matter must be one of primary social > importance; next, it must be proved to be practicable; thirdly, the State > interference must not diminish self-reliance. Even if the chance should > arise of removing a great social evil, nothing must be done to weaken those > habits of individual self-reliance and voluntary association which have > built up the greatness of the English people.Arnold Toynbee and Prof > Benjamin Jowett, Lectures on the Industrial Revolution in England; Popular > Addresses, Notes and Other Fragments (1884), pp. 85, 88, 92‚Äì93, 189, 219.

Lighting at the 2005 Classical Spectacular Concert A theatre lighting designer (or LD) works with the director, choreographer, set designer, costume designer, and sound designer to create the lighting, atmosphere, and time of day for the production in response to the text, while keeping in mind issues of visibility, safety, and cost. The LD also works closely with the stage manager or show control programming, if show control systems are used in that production. Outside stage lighting, the job of a Lighting Designer can be much more diverse and they can be found working on rock and pop tours, corporate launches, art installations, or lighting effects at sporting events. During pre-production The role of the lighting designer varies greatly within professional and amateur theater. For a Broadway show, a touring production and most regional and small productions the LD is usually an outside freelance specialist hired early in the production process. Smaller theatre companies may have a resident lighting designer responsible for most of the company's productions or rely on a variety of freelance or even volunteer help to light their productions. At the Off-Broadway or Off-Off-Broadway level, the LD will occasionally be responsible for much of the hands-on technical work (hanging instruments, programming the light board, etc.) that would be the work of the lighting crew in a larger theater. The LD will read the script carefully and make notes on changes in place and time between scenes - and will have meetings (called design or production meetings) with the director, designers, stage manager, and production manager to discuss ideas for the show and establish budget and scheduling details. The LD will also attend several later rehearsals to observe the way the actors are being directed to use the stage area ('blocking') during different scenes and will receive updates from the stage manager on any changes that occur. The LD will also make sure that he or she has an accurate plan of the theatre's lighting positions and a list of their equipment, as well as an accurate copy of the set design, especially the ground plan and section. The LD must take into account the show's mood and the director's vision in creating a lighting design. To help the LD communicate artistic vision, he or she may employ renderings, storyboards, photographs, reproductions of artwork, or mockups of effects to help communicate how the lighting should look. Various forms of paperwork are essential for the LD to successfully communicate their design to various members of the production team. Examples of typical paperwork include cue sheets, light plots, instrument schedules, shop orders, and focus charts. Cue sheets communicate the placement of cues that the LD has created for the show, using artistic terminology rather than technical language, and information on exactly when each cue is called so that the stage manager and the assistants know when and where to call the cue. Cue sheets are of the most value to stage management. The light plot is a scale drawing that communicates the location of lighting fixtures and lighting positions so a team of electricians can independently install the lighting system. Next to each instrument on the plan will be information for any color gel, gobo, or other accessories that need to go with it, and its channel number. Often, paperwork listing all of this information is also generated by using a program such as Lightwright. The lighting designer uses this paperwork to aid in the visualization of not only ideas but simple lists to assist the Master Electrician during load-in, focus, and technical rehearsals. Professional LDs generally use special computer-aided design packages to create accurate and easily readable drafted plots that can be swiftly updated as necessary. The LD will discuss the plot with the show's production manager and the theatre's master electrician or technical director to make sure there are no unforeseen problems during load-in. The lighting designer is responsible, in conjunction with the production's independently hired \\"Production Electrician\\" who will interface with the theatre's Master Electrician, for directing the theatre's electrics crew in the realization of his or her designs during the technical rehearsals. After the Electricians have hung, circuited, and patched the lighting units, the LD will direct the focusing (pointing, shaping and sizing of the light beams) and gelling (coloring) of each unit. After focus has occurred the LD usually sits at a temporary desk (tech table) in the theater (typically on the Center Line in the middle of the house) where he or she has a good view of the stage and work with the lighting board operator/programmer, who will either be seated alongside him or her at a portable control console or talk via headset to the control room. At the tech table, the LD will generally use a Magic Sheet, which is a pictorial layout of how the lights relate to the stage, so he or she can have quick access to channel numbers that control particular lighting instruments. The LD may also have a copy of the light plot and channel hookup, a remote lighting console, a computer monitor connected to the light board (so they can see what the board op is doing), and a headset, though in smaller theatres this is less common. There may be a period of time allowed for pre- lighting or \\"pre-cueing\\", a practice that is often done with people known as Light Walkers who stand in for performers so the LD can see what the light looks like on bodies. At an arranged time, the performers arrive and the production is worked through in chronological order, with occasional stops to correct sound, lighting, entrances etc.; known as a \\"cue-to-cue\\" or tech rehearsal. The lighting designer will work constantly with the board operator to refine the lighting states as the technical rehearsal continues, but because the focus of a \\"tech\\" rehearsal is the production's technical aspects, the LD may require the performers to pause (\\"hold\\") frequently. Nevertheless, any errors of focusing or changes to the lighting plan are corrected only when the performers are not onstage. These changes take place during 'work' or 'note' calls. The LD only attends these notes calls if units are hung or rehung and require additional focusing. The LD or Assistant Lighting Director (also known as the ALD, see below for description) will be in charge if in attendance. If the only work to be done is maintenance (i.e. changing a lamp or burnt out gel) then the Production or Master Electrician will be in charge and will direct the Electrics crew. After the tech process, the performance may (or may not, depending on time constraints) go into Dress rehearsal without a ticketed audience and/or Previews with a ticketed audience. During this time, if the cueing is finished, the LD will sit in the audience and take notes on what works and what needs changing. At this point, the Stage Manager will begin to take over the work of calling cues for the light board op to follow. Generally, the LD will stay on the headset, and may still have a monitor connected to the light board in case of problems, or will be in the control booth with the board operator when a monitor is not available. Often, changes will take place during notes call, but if serious problems occur the performance may be halted and the issue will be resolved then. Once the show is open to the public, the lighting designer will often stay and watch several performances of the show, making notes each night and making desired changes the next day during notes call. If the show is still in previews, then the LD will make changes, but once the production officially opens, normally the lighting designer will not make further changes. Changes should not be made after the lighting design is finished, and never without the LD's approval. There may be times when changes are necessary after the production has officially opened. Reasons for changes after opening night include: casting changes; significant changes in blocking; addition, deletion or rearrangement of scenes; or the tech and/or preview period (if there was a preview period) was too short to accommodate as thorough a cueing as was needed (this is particularly common in dance productions). If significant changes need to be made, the LD will come in and make them, however, if only smaller changes are needed, the LD may opt to send the ALD. If a show runs for a particularly long time then the LD may come in periodically to check the focus of each lighting instrument and if they are retaining their color (some gel, especially saturated gel, loses its richness and can fade or 'burn out' over time). The LD may also sit in on a performance to make sure that the cues are still being called at the right place and time. The goal is often to finish by the opening of the show, but what is most important is that the LD and the directors believe that the design is finished to each's satisfaction. If that happens to be by opening night, then after opening no changes are normally made to that particular production run at that venue. The general maintenance of the lighting rig then becomes the responsibility of the Master Electrician. In small theatres It is uncommon for a small theatre to have a very large technical crew, as there is less work to do. Many times, the lighting crew of a small theatre will consist of a single lighting designer and one to three people, who collectively are in charge of hanging, focusing and patching all lighting instruments. The lighting designer, in this situation, commonly works directly with this small team, fulfilling the role of both master electrician and lighting designer. Many times the designer will directly participate in the focusing of lights. The same crew will generally also program cues and operate the light board during rehearsals and performances. In some cases, the light board and sound board are operated by the same person, depending on the complexity of the show. The lighting designer may also take on other roles in addition to lights when they are finished hanging lights and programming cues on the board. Advances in visualization and presentation As previously mentioned, it is difficult to fully communicate the intent of a lighting design before all the lights are installed and all the cues are written. With the advancement in computer processing and visualization software, lighting designers are now able to create computer generated images (CGI) that represent their ideas. The lighting designer enters the light plot into the visualization software and then enters the ground plan of the theater and set design, giving as much three-dimensional data as possible (which helps in creating complete renderings). This creates a 3D model in computer space that can be lit and manipulated. Using the software, the LD can use the lights from his plot to create actual lighting in the 3D model with the ability to define parameters such as color, focus, gobo, beam angle etc. The designer can then take renderings or \\"snapshots\\" of various looks that can then be printed out and shown to the director and other members of the design team. Mockups and lighting scale models In addition to computer visualization, either full scale or small scale mock ups are a good method for depicting a lighting designer's ideas. Fiber optic systems such as LightBox or Luxam allow a users to light a scale model of the set. For example, a set designer can create a model of the set in 1/4\\" scale, the lighting designer can then take the fiber optic cables and attach them to scaled down lighting units that can accurately replicate the beam angles of specified lighting fixtures. These 'mini lights' can then be attached to cross pieces simulating different lighting positions. Fiber optic fixtures have the capacity to simulate attributes of full scale theatrical lighting fixtures including; color, beam angle, intensity, and gobos. The most sophisticated fiber optic systems are controllable through computer software or a DMX controlled Light board. This gives the lighting designer the ability to mock up real time lighting effects as they will look during the show. Additional members of the lighting design team If the production is large or especially complex, the Lighting Designer may hire additional lighting professionals to help execute the design. =The Associate Lighting Designer= The Associate Lighting Designer will help assist the Lighting Designer in creating and executing the lighting design. While the duties that an LD may expect the Associate LD to perform may differ from person to person, usually the Ass't LD will do the following: *Attend design and production meetings with or in place of the LD *Attend rehearsals with or in place of LD and take notes of specific design ideas and tasks that the lighting department needs to accomplish *Assist the LD in generating the light plot, channel hookup and sketches *If needed, the Associate may need to take the set drawings and put them into a CAD program to be manipulated by the LD (however, this job is usually given to the Assistant LD if there is one). *The Ass't LD may be in charge of running focus, and may even direct where the lights are to be focused. *The Associate is generally authorized to speak on behalf of the LD and can make creative and design decisions when needed (and when authorized by the LD). This is one of the biggest differences between the Associate and the Assistant. =The Assistant Lighting Designer= The Assistant Lighting Designer assists the Lighting Designer and the Associate Lighting Designer. Depending on the particular arrangement the ALD may report directly to the LD, or they may in essence be the Associate's assistant. There also may be more than one assistant on a show depending on the size of the production. The ALD will usually: *Attend design and production meetings with the LD or the Associate LD *Attend rehearsals with the LD or the Associate LD *Assist the LD in generating the light plot and channel hookup. If the plot is to be computer generated, the ALD is the one who physically enters the information into the computer. *The ALD may run errands for the LD such as picking up supplies or getting the light plot printed in large format. *The ALD will help the Associate LD in running focus. *The ALD may take Focus Charts during focus. *Track and coordinate Followspots (if any exist for the production) and generate paperwork to aid in their cueing and color changes. *In rare instances the ALD may be the light board operator. =A note on focus= During focus, the LD is up on stage directing members of the Electrics crew on where and how to focus each individual lighting unit. This can be a time consuming and frustrating process. Focus can run much smoother if the Associate LD and the Assistant LD are keeping good track of which lights have been focused, what's coming up next and directing the electrics crew so that there is minimal down time between focusing each light. However, this job is sometimes done by the Master Electrician, so that the Assistant LD can be onstage and assist in focus. They should also direct the LD to which units are next and even what their purpose is and a rough focus.

Elements of the Philosophy of Right () is a work by Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel published in 1820,Christian Topp, Philosophie als Wissenschaft, Berlin: De Gruyter, 1982, p. xx. though the book's original title page dates it to 1821. Hegel's most mature statement of his legal, moral, social and political philosophy, it is an expansion upon concepts only briefly dealt with in the Encyclopedia of the Philosophical Sciences, published in 1817 (and again in 1827 and 1830). Law provides for Hegel the cornerstone of the modern state. As such, he criticized Karl Ludwig von Haller's The Restoration of the Science of the State, in which the latter claimed that law was superficial, because natural law and the \\"right of the most powerful\\" was sufficient (¬ß258). The absence of law characterized for Hegel despotism, whether monarchist or ochlocracist (¬ß278). Summary The Philosophy of Right (as it is usually called) begins with a discussion of the concept of the free will and argues that the free will can only realize itself in the complicated social context of property rights and relations, contracts, moral commitments, family life, the economy, the legal system, and the polity. A person is not truly free, in other words, unless he is a participant in all of these different aspects of the life of the state. The bulk of the book is devoted to discussing Hegel's three spheres or versions of 'right,' each one larger than the preceding ones and encompassing them. The first sphere is abstract right (Recht), in which Hegel discusses the idea of 'non- interference' as a way of respecting others. He deems this insufficient and moves onto the second sphere, morality (Moralit√§t). Under this, Hegel proposes that humans reflect their own subjectivity of others in order to respect them. The third sphere, ethical life (Sittlichkeit), is Hegel's integration of individual subjective feelings and universal notions of right. Under ethical life, Hegel then launches into a lengthy discussion about family, civil society, and the state. Hegel also argues that the state itself is subsumed under the higher totality of world history, in which individual states arise, conflict with each other, and eventually fall. The course of history is apparently toward the ever-increasing actualization of freedom; each successive historical epoch corrects certain failures of the earlier ones. At the end of his Lectures on the Philosophy of History, Hegel leaves open the possibility that history has yet to accomplish certain tasks related to the inner organization of the state.  Reception  There were a number of issues that arose during the translation of the text. Most notably the phrase that is contained in the addition to ¬ß258, which was initially translated as \\"The state is the march of God through the world\\" as well as being translated thus: \\"The existence of the state is the presence of God upon the earth\\". From these early translations came the criticism that Hegel justifies authoritarian or even totalitarian forms of government: Giovanni Gentile, whose thought had a strong influence on Mussolini, bases his Hegelian revival on this point. However, Walter Kaufmann argues that the correct translation reads as follows: \\"It is the way of God in the world, that there should be a state\\".Muller, Jerry Z. (2002). The Mind and the Market: Capitalism in Western Thought. New York: A. Knopf. p. 430. This suggests that the state, rather than being godly, is part of the divine strategy, not a mere product of human endeavor. Kaufmann claims that Hegel's original meaning of the sentence is not a carte blanche for state dominance and brutality but merely a reference to the state's importance as part of the process of history. The preface to the Philosophy of Right contains considerable criticism of the philosophy of Jakob Friedrich Fries, who had been a critic of Hegel's prior work. Included in this is a suggestion that it is justifiable for the state to censor the writings of philosophers like Fries and welcoming Fries' loss of his academic position following Fries' participation in the Wartburg Festival. The inclusion of this passage has led to scholarly debate as to the reason for Hegel's advocacy of the kind of censorship the Prussian state had introduced following the murder of August von Kotzebue in the form of the Carlsbad Decrees. Hegel scholars have suggested that the inclusion of these passages was done to satisfy the censors. T.M. Knox argued that, while clearly designed to curry favour with the censors and written well after completion of the work proper, the Preface's condemnation of Fries was \\"nothing new\\", that there was no betrayal of his support for the Wartburg Festival principles, rather a mere denunciation of method, while condemnation of Karl Ludwig von Haller (whose work had been burned at Wartburg) remained undisturbed in the body of the work. Stephen Houlgate writes that Hegel's work is now recognized as \\"one of the greatest works of social and political philosophy ever written.\\" References External links  Philosophy of Right ‚Äì translation into English, 1896 * Complete PDF of the Philosophy of Right (McMaster University) * Complete PDF of the Philosophy of Right (University of Warsaw) * Preface of the Philosophy of Right at Marxist Reference Archive * Redding, Paul, \\"Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel\\", The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy 1820 non-fiction books Works by Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel Ethics books Philosophy of law Social philosophy literature ","title":"Elements of the Philosophy of Right"},{"id":"177316","text":"Viktor Emil Frankl (26 March 1905 ‚Äì 2 September 1997) was an Austrian neurologist and psychiatrist. A Holocaust survivor, he was the founder of logotherapy (literally \\"healing through meaning\\")‚Äì‚Äì a meaning-centered school of psychotherapy, considered the Third Viennese School of Psychotherapy‚Äì‚Äì following the theories developed by Sigmund Freud and Alfred Adler. Logotherapy is part of existential and humanistic psychology theories. He is the author of over 39 books; he is most noted for his best-selling book Man's Search for Meaning based on his experiences in various Nazi concentration camps. Early life Frankl was born the middle of three children to Gabriel Frankl, a civil servant in the Ministry of Social Service, and his wife Elsa, n√©e Lion. His interest in psychology and the role of meaning surfaced early when he began taking night classes at the Adult Education Center (Volkshochschule) on applied psychology while still in junior high school. As a teenager he began corresponding with Sigmund Freud. For the final exam (Matura) in the Sperlgymnasium High School, he wrote a paper on the psychology of philosophical thinking. After graduation from Gymnasium in 1923 he studied medicine at the University of Vienna, specialising in neurology and psychiatry, with a focus on depression and suicide. During a part of 1924, Frankl became president of the Sozialistische Mittelsch√ºler √ñsterreich, the Social Democratic youth movement for high school students, throughout Austria. That same year Frankl's first scientific paper was published in the International Journal of Psychoanalysis in 1924 on the recommendation of Sigmund Freud. During this time he began questioning the Freudian approach to psychoanalysis. He joined Alfred Adler's circle of students and had his second scientific paper, Psychotherapy and Worldview (Psychotherapie und Weltanschauung) published in the International Journal of Individual Psychology in 1925. Frankl was expelled from Adler's circle when he insisted that meaning was the central motivational force in human beings. From 1926 forward he began refining his theory which he coined logotherapy. Professional career Between 1928 and 1930, while still a medical student, he organized special youth counselling centers to address the high numbers of teen suicides occurring around the time of end of the year report cards. The program was sponsored by the city of Vienna and free of charge to the students. Frankl recruited other psychologists to join him including such notables as Charlotte B√ºhler, Erwin Wexberg and Rudolf Dreikurs. In 1931 not a single Viennese student committed suicide. The success of this program caught the attention of the likes of Wilhelm Reich who invited him to Berlin. After obtaining his M.D. in 1930, Frankl gained extensive experience at Steinhof Psychiatric Hospital where he was in charge of the \\"pavilion for suicidal women\\". Over a four-year period (1933‚Äì1937), he treated no less than 3,000 patients each year. In 1937, he began his private practice, but with the Nazi annexation of Austria, his ability to treat patients became limited. In 1940, he joined the Vienna Rothschild Hospital as head of the neurology department. It was the only hospital in Vienna still admitting Jews. Prior to his deportation to the concentration camps, he helped numerous patients avoid the Nazi euthanasia program that targeted the mentally disabled. Following the war, he became head of the neurology department of the Vienna Policlinic Hospital and established a private practice in his home. He actively worked with patients until his retirement in 1970. In 1948, Frankl earned a Ph.D. in philosophy from the University of Vienna. His dissertation, The Unconscious God, is an examination of the relation of psychology and religion.Boeree, George. \\"Personality Theories: Viktor Frankl.\\" Shippensburg University. Accessed 18 April 2014. In this, Frankl advocates for the use of the Socratic dialogue or \\"self-discovery discourse\\" to be used with clients, to get in touch with their \\"Noetic\\" (or spiritual) unconscious.Lantz, James E. \\"Family logotherapy.\\" Contemporary Family Therapy 8, no. 2 (1986): 124-135. Grave of Viktor Frankl in Vienna In 1955, Frankl was awarded a professorship of neurology and psychiatry at the University of Vienna, and as visiting professor, he lectured at Harvard University (1961), at Southern Methodist University, Dallas (1966), and at Duquesne University, Pittsburgh (1972). With the success of his books Man's Search for Meaning and The Doctor and the Soul he became a sought after speaker, invited to teach and lecture around the world. The American Psychiatric Association awarded Frankl the 1985 Oskar Pfister Award for important contributions to religion and psychiatry. Frankl published 39 books, which were translated into 49 languages. He received 29 honorary doctoral degrees. Man's Search for Meaning Soon after his return to Vienna, he wrote Man‚Äôs Search for Meaning over a 9-day period. The book, originally titled, \\"A Psychologist Experiences the Concentration Camp\\" was released in German in 1946. The first edition cover does not identify who wrote it because Frankl felt he could express himself more freely. He was surprised that out of the numerous books he wrote, the one that he wanted to publish anonymously became his most popular. The English translation of Man's Search for Meaning was published in 1959 and became an international bestseller. He saw this not so much as a personal achievement, but as a symptom of the \\"mass neurosis of modern times\\" since its title promised to deal with the question of life's meaningfulness. In 1991, Man's Search for Meaning was listed as \\"one of the ten most influential books in the U.S\\". by the Library of Congress. Still today, decades later, it shows up consistently on Amazon's \\"Top 100 Books\\" list and is recommended as one of Amazon's \\"Top 100 Books to Read in a Lifetime\\".Amazon‚Äôs Top 100 Books to Read In a Lifetime. Personal life In 1941 he married his first wife Tilly Grosser, who was a station nurse at the Rothschild hospital. Soon after they were married she became pregnant but they were forced to abort the child. Tilly died in the Bergen Belsen concentration camp. His father Gabriel died in the Terezin concentration camp (Theresienstadt) on 13 February 1943, aged 81, from starvation and pneumonia. His mother and brother, Walter, were both killed in Auschwitz. His sister, Stella, escaped to Australia. In 1947 he married his second wife Eleonore \\"Elly\\" Katharina Schwindt. She was a practicing Catholic, and the couple respected each other's religious backgrounds, going to both church and synagogue, and celebrating Christmas and Hanukkah. They had one daughter, Gabriele, who went on to become a child psychologist. Frankl died of heart failure in Vienna on 2 September 1997. He is buried in the Jewish section of the Vienna Central Cemetery (Zentralfriedhof). He is survived by his wife Eleonore, one daughter, two grandchildren and three great- grandchildren.  Elements of Logotherapy/Existential Analysis  In logotherapy the search for a meaning in life is identified as the primary motivational force in human beings. Frankl's approach is based on three philosophical and psychological concepts, Freedom of Will - Will to Meaning - Meaning in Life: \\\\- Humans are basically free to take their stance towards internal (psychological) and external (biological and social) conditions. \\\\- The search for meaning is seen as the primary motivation of humans. Logotherapy assists clients in finding and pursuing meaningful goals in their lives. However, they are not offered specific meanings; rather, they are encouraged to realize of those meaning possibilities they have detected themselves. \\\\- Logotherapy is based on the idea that meaning is an objective reality, as opposed to a mere illusion arising within the perceptional apparatus of the observer. Frankl identified three main ways of realizing meaning in life: First, by making a difference in the world through our actions, our work or our creations - referred to as \\"Creative Values\\". Second, by experiencing something (such as truth, beauty) or encountering someone (love) - \\"Experiential Values\\". Third, by adopting a courageous and exemplary attitude in situations of unavoidable suffering - \\"Attitudinal Values.\\" The primary techniques offered by logotherapy and existential analysis are: = Paradoxical Intention = ::Clients learn to overcome their obsessions or anxieties by self-distancing and humorous exaggeration, thus breaking the vicious circle of symptom and symptom amplification. Dereflection: ::To remove the obstruction of instinctive, automatic processes caused by exaggerated self-observation, dereflection breaks the circle of hyper-reflection and the ensuing inhibition by drawing the client's attention away from the symptom. = Socratic dialogue / attitude modification = ::Specific questions are aimed to raise into consciousness the possibility to find, and the freedom to fulfill, meaning in one's life. The logotherapist refrains from imposing their own values or meaning perceptions. Rather, clients are guided to perceive their unrealistic and counterproductive attitudes and to develop a new outlook that may be a better basis for a fulfilled life.  Controversy  In the 1960s Rollo May criticised logotherapy as authoritarian, a view which was debated by Frankl and Reuven Bulka. Timothy Pytell, a history professor at California State University, San Bernardino, criticizes Frankl's logotherapeutic approach in published articles.Redeeming the Unredeemable:Auschwitz and Man's Search for Meaning, Timothy E. Pytell, California State University, San Bernardino. Holocaust and Genocide Studies, Volume 17, Number 1, Spring 2003 Oxford University Press Legacy Frankl's logotherapy and existential analysis (LTEA) was considered by Frankl as \\"the third Viennese School of Psychotherapy\\", among the broad category that comprises existentialists. His acknowledgement of meaning as a central motivational force and factor in mental health and resilience is his lasting contribution to the field of psychology. It provided the foundational principles for the emerging field of Positive Psychology.Viktor Frankl‚Äôs Meaning-Seeking Model and Positive Psychology Chapter from book 'Meaning in Positive and Existential Psychology' (pp.149-184) accessed 26 May 2020 He has coined the term noogenic neurosis, the feeling of an inner void. This results from an awareness of the emptiness caused by a lack of meaning, or \\"existential vacuum\\", another term coined by Frankl. Throughout his career, Frankl argued that the reductionist tendencies of most psychotherapeutic approaches dehumanised the patient and advocated for a rehumanisation of psychotherapy. Viktor Frankl often emphasised the importance of responsibility in conjunction with personal freedom. To illustrate his point he often recommended that the 'Statue of Liberty' on the East Coast of the United States be complemented by a 'Statue of Responsibility', on the West Coast.

Here, Fraunhofer lines in sunlight and Rayleigh scattering of this sunlight is the \\"source.\\" This is the spectrum of a blue sky somewhat close to the horizon, pointing east at around 3 or 4 pm (i.e., Sun toward the west) on a clear day. A spectral line is a dark or bright line in an otherwise uniform and continuous spectrum, resulting from emission or absorption of light in a narrow frequency range, compared with the nearby frequencies. Spectral lines are often used to identify atoms and molecules. These \\"fingerprints\\" can be compared to the previously collected \\"fingerprints\\" of atoms and molecules, and are thus used to identify the atomic and molecular components of stars and planets, which would otherwise be impossible.  Types of line spectra  incandescent lamp (mid) and discrete spectrum lines of a fluorescent lamp (bottom) Spectral lines are the result of interaction between a quantum system (usually atoms, but sometimes molecules or atomic nuclei) and a single photon. When a photon has about the right amount of energy to allow a change in the energy state of the system (in the case of an atom this is usually an electron changing orbitals), the photon is absorbed. Then it will be spontaneously re-emitted, either in the same frequency as the original or in a cascade, where the sum of the energies of the photons emitted will be equal to the energy of the one absorbed (assuming the system returns to its original state). A spectral line may be observed either as an emission line or an absorption line. Which type of line is observed depends on the type of material and its temperature relative to another emission source. An absorption line is produced when photons from a hot, broad spectrum source pass through a cold material. The intensity of light, over a narrow frequency range, is reduced due to absorption by the material and re-emission in random directions. By contrast, a bright emission line is produced when photons from a hot material are detected in the presence of a broad spectrum from a cold source. The intensity of light, over a narrow frequency range, is increased due to emission by the material. Spectral lines are highly atom-specific, and can be used to identify the chemical composition of any medium capable of letting light pass through it. Several elements were discovered by spectroscopic means, including helium, thallium, and caesium. Spectral lines also depend on the physical conditions of the gas, so they are widely used to determine the chemical composition of stars and other celestial bodies that cannot be analyzed by other means, as well as their physical conditions. Mechanisms other than atom-photon interaction can produce spectral lines. Depending on the exact physical interaction (with molecules, single particles, etc.), the frequency of the involved photons will vary widely, and lines can be observed across the electromagnetic spectrum, from radio waves to gamma rays. Nomenclature Strong spectral lines in the visible part of the spectrum often have a unique Fraunhofer line designation, such as K for a line at 393.366 nm emerging from singly-ionized Ca+, though some of the Fraunhofer \\"lines\\" are blends of multiple lines from several different species. In other cases the lines are designated according to the level of ionization by adding a Roman numeral to the designation of the chemical element, so that Ca+ also has the designation Ca II or CaII. Neutral atoms are denoted with the Roman numeral I, singly ionized atoms with II, and so on, so that, for example, FeIX (IX, Roman nine) represents eight times ionized iron. More detailed designations usually include the line wavelength and may include a multiplet number (for atomic lines) or band designation (for molecular lines). Many spectral lines of atomic hydrogen also have designations within their respective series, such as the Lyman series or Balmer series. Originally all spectral lines were classified into series: the Principle series, Sharp series, and Diffuse series. These series exist across atoms of all elements, and the patterns for all atoms are well-predicted by the Rydberg-Ritz formula. For this reason, the NIST spectral line database contains a column for Ritz calculated lines. These series were later associated with suborbitals.  Line broadening and shift  There are a number of effects which control spectral line shape. A spectral line extends over a range of frequencies, not a single frequency (i.e., it has a nonzero linewidth). In addition, its center may be shifted from its nominal central wavelength. There are several reasons for this broadening and shift. These reasons may be divided into two general categories ‚Äì broadening due to local conditions and broadening due to extended conditions. Broadening due to local conditions is due to effects which hold in a small region around the emitting element, usually small enough to assure local thermodynamic equilibrium. Broadening due to extended conditions may result from changes to the spectral distribution of the radiation as it traverses its path to the observer. It also may result from the combining of radiation from a number of regions which are far from each other. = Broadening due to local effects =  Natural broadening  The lifetime of excited states results in natural broadening, also known as lifetime broadening. The uncertainty principle relates the lifetime of an excited state (due to spontaneous radiative decay or the Auger process) with the uncertainty of its energy. A short lifetime will have a large energy uncertainty and a broad emission. This broadening effect results in an unshifted Lorentzian profile. The natural broadening can be experimentally altered only to the extent that decay rates can be artificially suppressed or enhanced.For example, in the following article, decay was suppressed via a microwave cavity, thus reducing the natural broadening:  Thermal Doppler broadening  The atoms in a gas which are emitting radiation will have a distribution of velocities. Each photon emitted will be \\"red\\"- or \\"blue\\"-shifted by the Doppler effect depending on the velocity of the atom relative to the observer. The higher the temperature of the gas, the wider the distribution of velocities in the gas. Since the spectral line is a combination of all of the emitted radiation, the higher the temperature of the gas, the broader the spectral line emitted from that gas. This broadening effect is described by a Gaussian profile and there is no associated shift.  Pressure broadening  The presence of nearby particles will affect the radiation emitted by an individual particle. There are two limiting cases by which this occurs: * Impact pressure broadening or collisional broadening: The collision of other particles with the emitting light particle interrupts the emission process, and by shortening the characteristic time for the process, increases the uncertainty in the energy emitted (as occurs in natural broadening). The duration of the collision is much shorter than the lifetime of the emission process. This effect depends on both the density and the temperature of the gas. The broadening effect is described by a Lorentzian profile and there may be an associated shift. * Quasistatic pressure broadening: The presence of other particles shifts the energy levels in the emitting particle, thereby altering the frequency of the emitted radiation. The duration of the influence is much longer than the lifetime of the emission process. This effect depends on the density of the gas, but is rather insensitive to temperature. The form of the line profile is determined by the functional form of the perturbing force with respect to distance from the perturbing particle. There may also be a shift in the line center. The general expression for the lineshape resulting from quasistatic pressure broadening is a 4-parameter generalization of the Gaussian distribution known as a stable distribution. Pressure broadening may also be classified by the nature of the perturbing force as follows: * Linear Stark broadening occurs via the linear Stark effect, which results from the interaction of an emitter with an electric field of a charged particle at a distance r, causing a shift in energy that is linear in the field strength. (\\\\Delta E \\\\sim 1/r^2) * Resonance broadening occurs when the perturbing particle is of the same type as the emitting particle, which introduces the possibility of an energy exchange process. (\\\\Delta E \\\\sim 1/r^3) * Quadratic Stark broadening occurs via the quadratic Stark effect, which results from the interaction of an emitter with an electric field, causing a shift in energy that is quadratic in the field strength. (\\\\Delta E \\\\sim 1/r^4) * Van der Waals broadening occurs when the emitting particle is being perturbed by van der Waals forces. For the quasistatic case, a van der Waals profile\\"van der Waals profile\\" appears as lowercase in almost all sources, such as: Statistical mechanics of the liquid surface by Clive Anthony Croxton, 1980, A Wiley- Interscience publication, , ; and in Journal of technical physics, Volume 36, by Instytut Podstawowych Problem√≥w Techniki (Polska Akademia Nauk), publisher: Pa≈Ñstwowe Wydawn. Naukowe., 1995, is often useful in describing the profile. The energy shift as a function of distance is given in the wings by e.g. the Lennard-Jones potential. (\\\\Delta E \\\\sim 1/r^6)  Inhomogeneous broadening  Inhomogeneous broadening is a general term for broadening because some emitting particles are in a different local environment from others, and therefore emit at a different frequency. This term is used especially for solids, where surfaces, grain boundaries, and stoichiometry variations can create a variety of local environments for a given atom to occupy. In liquids, the effects of inhomogeneous broadening is sometimes reduced by a process called motional narrowing. = Broadening due to non-local effects = Certain types of broadening are the result of conditions over a large region of space rather than simply upon conditions that are local to the emitting particle.  Opacity broadening  Electromagnetic radiation emitted at a particular point in space can be reabsorbed as it travels through space. This absorption depends on wavelength. The line is broadened because the photons at the line center have a greater reabsorption probability than the photons at the line wings. Indeed, the reabsorption near the line center may be so great as to cause a self reversal in which the intensity at the center of the line is less than in the wings. This process is also sometimes called self-absorption.  Macroscopic Doppler broadening  Radiation emitted by a moving source is subject to Doppler shift due to a finite line-of-sight velocity projection. If different parts of the emitting body have different velocities (along the line of sight), the resulting line will be broadened, with the line width proportional to the width of the velocity distribution. For example, radiation emitted from a distant rotating body, such as a star, will be broadened due to the line-of-sight variations in velocity on opposite sides of the star. The greater the rate of rotation, the broader the line. Another example is an imploding plasma shell in a Z-pinch.  Radiative broadening  Radiative broadening of the spectral absorption profile occurs because the on-resonance absorption in the center of the profile is saturated at much lower intensities than the off-resonant wings. Therefore, as intensity rises, absorption in the wings rises faster than absorption in the center, leading to a broadening of the profile. Radiative broadening occurs even at very low light intensities. = Combined effects = Each of these mechanisms can act in isolation or in combination with others. Assuming each effect is independent, the observed line profile is a convolution of the line profiles of each mechanism. For example, a combination of the thermal Doppler broadening and the impact pressure broadening yields a Voigt profile. However, the different line broadening mechanisms are not always independent. For example, the collisional effects and the motional Doppler shifts can act in a coherent manner, resulting under some conditions even in a collisional narrowing, known as the Dicke effect. Spectral lines of chemical elements =Visible light= For each element, the following table shows the spectral lines which appear in the visible spectrum at about 400-700 nm. =Other wavelengths= Without qualification, \\"spectral lines\\" generally implies that one is talking about lines with wavelengths which fall into the range of the visible spectrum. However, there are also many spectral lines which show up at wavelengths outside this range. At the much shorter wavelengths of x-rays, these are known as characteristic X-rays. Other frequencies have atomic spectral lines as well, such as the Lyman series, which falls in the ultraviolet range.

Tabula (Byzantine Greek: œÑŒ¨Œ≤ŒªŒπ), meaning a plank or board, was a Greco-Roman board game, and is generally thought to be the direct ancestor of modern backgammon. History A game of œÑŒ¨Œ≤ŒªŒπ (tabula) played by Byzantine emperor Zeno in 480 AD and recorded by Agathias in circa 530 AD because of a very unlucky dice throw for Zeno (red), as he threw 2, 5 and 6 and was forced to leave eight pieces alone and thus prone to capture. See \\"Zeno's Game of œÑŒ¨Œ≤ŒªŒπ\\" by Roland G. Austin. According to the Etymologiae by Isidore of Seville, tabula was first invented by a Greek soldier of the Trojan War named Alea. . The earliest description of \\"œÑŒ¨Œ≤ŒªŒπ\\" (tavli) is in an epigram of Byzantine emperor Zeno (r. 474‚Äì475; 476‚Äì491), given by Agathias of Myrine (6th century AD), who describes a game in which Zeno goes from a strong position to a very weak one after an unfortunate dice roll.. The rules of Tabula were reconstructed in the 19th century by Becq de Fouqui√®res based upon this epigram.. The game was played on a board nearly identical to a modern backgammon board with 24 points, 12 on each side. Two players had 15 pieces each, and moved them in opposing directions around the board, according to the roll of three dice. A piece resting alone in a space on the board was vulnerable to being hit. Hitting a blot, reentering a piece from the bar, and bearing off, all had the same rules as today. The only differences with modern backgammon were the use of an extra die (three rather than two) and the starting of all pieces off the board (with them entering in the same way that pieces on the bar enter in modern backgammon). In the epigram Zeno, who was white (red in illustration), had a stack of seven checkers, three stacks of two checkers and two blots, checkers that stand alone on a point and are therefore in danger of being put outside the board by an incoming opponent checker. Zeno threw the three dice with which the game was played and obtained 2, 5 and 6. As in backgammon, Zeno could not move to a space occupied by two opponent (black) pieces. The white and black checkers were so distributed on the points that the only way to use all of the three results, as required by the game rules, was to break the three stacks of two checkers into blots, thus exposing them to capture and ruining the game for Zeno.. Tabula was most likely a later refinement of ludus duodecim scriptorum, with the board's middle row of points removed, and only the two outer rows remaining. Today, the word \\"œÑŒ¨Œ≤ŒªŒπ\\" is still used to refer to backgammon in Greece,. as well as in Syria and Turkey (as tavla), Bulgaria(as tabla) and in Romania (as table); in these countries, backgammon remains a popular game played in town squares and in cafes.

It consisted of a lander, renamed the Carl Sagan Memorial Station, and a lightweight (10.6 kg/23 lb) wheeled robotic Mars rover named Sojourner, which became the first rover to operate outside the Earth‚ÄìMoon system. Launched on December 4, 1996 by NASA aboard a Delta II booster a month after the Mars Global Surveyor was launched, it landed on July 4, 1997 on Mars's Ares Vallis, in a region called Chryse Planitia in the Oxia Palus quadrangle. The lander then opened, exposing the rover which conducted many experiments on the Martian surface. The mission carried a series of scientific instruments to analyze the Martian atmosphere, climate, and geology and the composition of its rocks and soil. It was the second project from NASA's Discovery Program, which promotes the use of low- cost spacecraft and frequent launches under the motto \\"cheaper, faster and better\\" promoted by then-administrator Daniel Goldin. The mission was directed by the Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL), a division of the California Institute of Technology, responsible for NASA's Mars Exploration Program. The project manager was JPL's Tony Spear. This mission was the first of a series of missions to Mars that included rovers, and was the first successful lander since the two Vikings landed on the red planet in 1976. Although the Soviet Union successfully sent rovers to the Moon as part of the Lunokhod program in the 1970s, its attempts to use rovers in its Mars program failed. In addition to scientific objectives, the Mars Pathfinder mission was also a \\"proof-of- concept\\" for various technologies, such as airbag-mediated touchdown and automated obstacle avoidance, both later exploited by the Mars Exploration Rover mission. The Mars Pathfinder was also remarkable for its extremely low cost relative to other robotic space missions to Mars. Originally, the mission was conceived as the first of the Mars Environmental Survey (MESUR) program. Mission objectives * To prove that the development of \\"faster, better and cheaper\\" spacecraft was possible (with three years for development and a cost under $150 million for the lander, and $25 million for the rover). * To show that it was possible to send a load of scientific instruments to another planet with a simple system and at one-fifteenth the cost of a Viking mission. (For comparison, the Viking missions cost $935 million in 1974 or $3.5 billion in 1997 dollars.) * To demonstrate NASA's commitment to low-cost planetary exploration by finishing the mission with a total expenditure of $280 million, including the launch vehicle and mission operations. Science experiments Sojourner rover on Mars on sol 22 The Mars Pathfinder conducted different investigations on the Martian soil using three scientific instruments. The lander contained a stereoscopic camera with spatial filters on an expandable pole called Imager for Mars Pathfinder (IMP), and the Atmospheric Structure Instrument/Meteorology Package (ASI/MET) which acts as a Mars meteorological station, collecting data about pressure, temperature, and winds. The MET structure included three windsocks mounted at three heights on a pole, the topmost at about one meter (yard) and generally registered winds from the West. The Sojourner rover had an Alpha Proton X-ray Spectrometer (APXS), which was used to analyze the components of the rocks and soil. The rover also had two black-and-white cameras and a color one. These instruments could investigate the geology of the Martian surface from just a few millimeters to many hundreds of meters, the geochemistry and evolutionary history of the rocks and surface, the magnetic and mechanical properties of the land, as well as the magnetic properties of the dust, atmosphere and the rotational and orbital dynamics of the planet. Wheel size comparison: Sojourner, Mars Exploration Rover, Mars Science Laboratory Three navigation cameras were on board the rover: Two black and white 0.3-megapixel cameras were located on the front (768 horizontal pixels √ó 484 vertical pixels configured in 4√ó4+100 pixel blocks), coupled with five laser stripe projectors, which enabled stereoscopic images to be taken along with measurements for hazard detection on the rover's path. A third camera with the same resolution but taking color images was located on the back, near the APXS, and rotated by 90¬∞. It provided images of the APXS's target area and the rover's tracks on the ground. The pixels of this colour camera were arranged in such a way, that out of the 16 pixel of a 4√ó4 pixel block, 12 pixel were sensitive to green, 2 pixel to red and 2 pixel were sensitive to infrared as well as blue. As all cameras had lenses made out of zinc selenide, which blocks light below a wavelength of 500 nm, no blue light actually reached these \\"blue/infrared\\" pixels, which therefore recorded only infrared. All three cameras were CCDs manufactured by Eastman Kodak Company, and were controlled by the rover's CPU. They all had auto-exposure and capabilities for handling bad pixels, and the image parameters (exposure time, compression used, etc.) were included in the transmitted images as part of the image header. The rover could compress the front cameras' images using the block truncation coding (BTC) algorithm, but it could only do the same for the back camera's images if the colour information was discarded. The cameras' optical resolution was sufficient to resolve 0.6 cm details across a 0.65 m range. =Pathfinder lander= # Imager for Mars Pathfinder (IMP), (includes magnetometer and anemometer) # Atmospheric and meteorological sensors (ASI/MET) =Sojourner rover= # Imaging system (three cameras: front B&W; stereo, 1 rear color) # Laser striper hazard detection system # Alpha Proton X-ray Spectrometer (APXS) # Wheel Abrasion Experiment # Materials Adherence Experiment # Accelerometers Landing site The landing site was an ancient flood plain in Mars's northern hemisphere called \\"Ares Vallis\\" (\\"the valley of Ares\\", the ancient Greek equivalent of the ancient Roman deity Mars) and is among the rockiest parts of Mars. Scientists chose it because they found it to be a relatively safe surface to land on and one that contained a wide variety of rocks deposited during a catastrophic flood. After the landing, at , succeeded, the lander received the name The Carl Sagan Memorial Station in honor of the astronomer. (See also List of extraterrestrial memorials) Entry, descent and landing 1990s illustration of Mars atmospheric entry Mars Pathfinder entered the Martian atmosphere and landed using an innovative system involving an entry capsule, a supersonic parachute, followed by solid rockets and large airbags to cushion the impact. Mars Pathfinder directly entered Mars atmosphere in a retrograde direction from a hyperbolic trajectory at 6.1 km/s using an atmospheric entry aeroshell (capsule) that was derived from the original Viking Mars lander design. The aeroshell consisted of a back shell and a specially designed ablative heatshield to slow to 370 m/s (830 mph) where a supersonic disk-gap-band parachute was inflated to slow its descent through the thin Martian atmosphere to 68 m/s (about 150 mph). The lander's on-board computer used redundant on-board accelerometers to determine the timing of the parachute inflation. Twenty seconds later the heatshield was pyrotechnically released. Another twenty seconds later the lander was separated and lowered from the backshell on a 20 m bridle (tether). When the lander reached 1.6 km above the surface, a radar was used by the on-board computer to determine altitude and descent velocity. This information was used by the computer to determine the precise timing of the landing events that followed. The Pathfinder air bags are tested in June 1995 Once the lander was 355 m above the ground, airbags were inflated in less than a second using three catalytically cooled solid rocket motors that served as gas generators. The airbags were made of four inter-connected multi-layer vectran bags that surrounded the tetrahedron lander. They were designed and tested to accommodate grazing angle impacts as high as 28 m/s. However, as the airbags were designed for no more than about 15 m/s vertical impacts, three solid retrorockets were mounted above the lander in the backshell. These were fired at 98 m above the ground. The lander's on-board computer estimated the best time to fire the rockets and cut the bridle so that the lander velocity would be reduced to about 0 m/s between 15 and 25 m above the ground. After 2.3 seconds, while the rockets were still firing, the lander cut the bridle loose about 21.5 m above the ground and fell to the ground. The rockets flew up and away with the backshell and parachute (they have since been sighted by orbital images). The lander impacted at 14 m/s and limited the impact to only 18 G of deceleration. The first bounce was 15.7 m high and continued bouncing for at least 15 additional bounces (accelerometer data recording did not continue through all of the bounces). The entire entry, descent and landing (EDL) process was completed in four minutes. Once the lander stopped rolling, the airbags deflated and retracted toward the lander using four winches mounted on the lander \\"petals\\". Designed to right itself from any initial orientation, the lander happened to roll right side up onto its base petal. 74 minutes after landing, the petals were deployed with Sojourner rover and the solar panels attached on the inside. IMP image of landing site in 1997 The lander arrived at night at 2:56:55 Mars local solar time (16:56:55 UTC) on July 4, 1997. The lander had to wait until sunrise to send its first digital signals and images to Earth. The landing site was located at 19.30¬∞ north latitude and 33.52¬∞ west longitude in Ares Vallis, only 19 kilometres southwest of the center of the 200 km wide landing site ellipse. During Sol 1, the first Martian solar day the lander spent on the planet, the lander took pictures and made some meteorologic measurements. Once the data was received, the engineers realized that one of the airbags hadn't fully deflated and could be a problem for the forthcoming traverse of Sojourners descent ramp. To solve the problem, they sent commands to the lander to raise one of its petals and perform additional retraction to flatten the airbag. The procedure was a success and on Sol 2, Sojourner was released, stood up and backed down one of two ramps. The Mars Pathfinder entry descent and landing system design was used (with some modification) on the Mars Exploration Rover mission. Likewise, many design aspects of the Sojourner rover (e.g. the rocker-bogie mobility architecture and the navigation algorithms) were also successfully used on the Mars Exploration Rover mission. Rover operations =Sojourner deployment= The Sojourner rover exit from the lander occurred on Sol 2, after its landing on July 4, 1997. As the next sols progressed it approached some rocks, which the scientists named \\"Barnacle Bill\\", \\"Yogi\\", and \\"Scooby- Doo\\", after famous cartoon characters. The rover made measurements of the elements found in those rocks and in the martian soil, while the lander took pictures of the Sojourner and the surrounding terrain, in addition to making climate observations. The Sojourner is a six-wheeled 65 cm long vehicle, 48 cm wide, 30 cm tall and weighing 10.5 kg. Its maximum speed reached one centimeter per second. Sojourner travelled approximately 100 metres in total, never more than 12 m from the Pathfinder station. During its 83 sols of operation, it sent 550 photographs to Earth and analyzed the chemical properties of 16 locations near the lander. (See also Space exploration rovers) =Sojourners rock analysis= Sojourner next to the rock Barnacle Bill The first analysis on a rock started on Sol 3 with Barnacle Bill. The Alpha Particle X-ray Spectrometer (APXS) was used to determine its composition, the spectrometer taking ten hours to make a full scan of the sample. It found all the elements except hydrogen, which constitutes just 0.1 percent of the rock's or soil's mass. The APXS works by irradiating rocks and soil samples with alpha particles (helium nuclei, which consist of two protons and two neutrons). The results indicated that \\"Barnacle Bill\\" is much like Earth's andesites, confirming past volcanic activity. The discovery of andesites shows that some Martian rocks have been remelted and reprocessed. On Earth, andesite forms when magma sits in pockets of rock while some of the iron and magnesium settle out. Consequently, the final rock contains less iron and magnesiums and more silica. Volcanic rocks are usually classified by comparing the relative amount of alkalis (Na2O and K2O) with the amount of silica (SiO2). Andesite is different from the rocks found in meteorites that have come from Mars. Analysis of the Yogi rock again using the APXS showed that it was a basaltic rock, more primitive than Barnacle Bill. Yogi's shape and texture show that it was probably deposited there by a flood. Another rock, named Moe, was found to have certain marks on its surface, demonstrating erosion caused by the wind. Most rocks analyzed showed a high content of silicon. In another region known as Rock Garden, Sojourner encountered crescent moon-shaped dunes, which are similar to crescentic dunes on Earth. By the time that final results of the mission were described in a series of articles in the journal Science (December 5, 1997), it was believed that the rock Yogi contained a coating of dust, but was similar to the rock Barnacle Bill. Calculations suggest that the two rocks contain mostly the minerals orthopyroxene (magnesium-iron silicate), feldspars (aluminum silicates of potassium, sodium, and calcium), and quartz (silicon dioxide), with smaller amounts of magnetite, ilmenite, iron sulfide, and calcium phosphate. =On- board computer= The embedded computer on board the Sojourner rover was based around the 2 MHz Intel 80C85 CPU with 512 KB of RAM and 176 KB of flash memory solid-state storage, running a cyclic executive. The computer of the Pathfinder lander was a Radiation Hardened IBM Risc 6000 Single Chip (Rad6000 SC) CPU with 128 MB of RAM and 6 MB of EEPROM and its operating system was VxWorks. The mission was jeopardised by a concurrent software bug in the lander,Parallel sparking: Many chips make light work, Douglas Heaven, New Scientist magazine, issue 2930, August 19, 2013, p44. Online (by subscription) which had been found in preflight testing but was deemed a glitch and therefore given a low priority as it only occurred in certain unanticipated heavy-load conditions, and the focus was on verifying the entry and landing code. The problem, which was reproduced and corrected from Earth using a laboratory duplicate thanks to the logging and debugging functionality enabled in the flight software, was due to computer resets caused by priority inversion. No scientific or engineering data was lost after a computer reset, but all the following operations were interrupted until the next day. Four resets occurred (on July 5, 10, 11 and 14) during the mission, before patching the software on July 21 to enable priority inheritance. Results from Pathfinder Close-up of Mars sky at sunset, by Mars Pathfinder (1997) The lander sent more than 2.3 billion bits (287.5 megabytes) of information including 16,500 pictures and made 8.5 million measurements of the atmospheric pressure, temperature and wind speed. By taking multiple images of the sky at different distances from the Sun, scientists were able to determine that the size of the particles in the pink haze was about one micrometre in radius. The color of some soils was similar to that of an iron oxyhydroxide phase which would support the theory of a warmer and wetter climate in the past.Smith, P. et al. 1997. \\"Results from the Mars Pathfinder Camera\\" Science: 278. 1758‚Äì1765 Pathfinder carried a series of magnets to examine the magnetic component of the dust. Eventually, all but one of the magnets developed a coating of dust. Since the weakest magnet did not attract any soil, it was concluded that the airborne dust did not contain pure magnetite or just one type of maghemite. The dust probably was an aggregate possibly cemented with ferric oxide (Fe2O3).Hviid, S. et al. 1997. \\"Magnetic Properties Experiments on the Mars Pathfinder Lander: Preliminary Results\\". Science:278. 1768‚Äì1770. Using much more sophisticated instruments, Mars Spirit rover found that magnetite could explain the magnetic nature of the dust and soil on Mars. Magnetite was found in the soil and that the most magnetic part of the soil was dark. Magnetite is very dark.Bertelsen, P. et al. 2004. \\"Magnetic Properties Experiments on the Mars Exploration rover Spirit at Gusev Crater\\". Science: 305. 827‚Äì829. Using Doppler tracking and two-way ranging, scientists added earlier measurements from the Viking landers to determine that the non-hydrostatic component of the polar moment of inertia is due to the Tharsis bulge and that the interior is not melted. The central metallic core is between 1300 km and 2000 km in radius.Golombek, M. et al. 1997. \\"Overview of the Mars Pathfinder Mission and Assessment of Landing Site Predictions\\". Science. Science: 278. pp. 1743‚Äì1748 End of mission MRO HiRISE Although the mission was planned to last from a week to a month, the rover operated successfully for almost three months. Communication failed after October 7, with a final data transmission received from Pathfinder at 10:23 UTC on September 27, 1997. Mission managers tried to restore full communications during the following five months, but the mission was terminated on March 10, 1998. During the extended operation a high- resolution stereo panorama of the surrounding terrain was being made, and the Sojourner rover was to visit a distant ridge, but the panorama was only about one-third completed and the ridge visit had not begun when communication failed. The on-board battery‚Äîdesigned to operate for one month‚Äîmay have failed after repeated charging and discharging. The battery was used to heat the probe's electronics to slightly above the expected nighttime temperatures on Mars. With the failure of the battery, colder-than-normal temperatures may have caused vital parts to break, leading to loss of communications. The mission had exceeded its goals in the first month. Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter spotted Pathfinder lander in January 2007 (left). Naming the rover Sojourner takes its Alpha Particle X-ray Spectrometer measurement of the Yogi Rock The name Sojourner was chosen for the Mars Pathfinder rover when 12-year old Valerie Ambroise, of Bridgeport, Connecticut, won a year-long, worldwide competition in which students up to 18 years old were invited to select a heroine and submit an essay about her historical accomplishments. The students were asked to address in their essays how a planetary rover named for their heroine would translate these accomplishments to the Martian environment. Initiated in March 1994 by The Planetary Society of Pasadena, California, in cooperation with NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL), the contest got under way with an announcement in the January 1995 issue of the National Science Teachers Association's magazine Science and Children, circulated to 20,000 teachers and schools across the nation. Ambroise's winning essay, which suggested naming the rover for the 19th century women's rights activist Sojourner Truth, was selected from among 3,500 essays. First runner-up was Deepti Rohatgi, 18, of Rockville, Maryland, who suggested scientist Marie Curie. Second runner-up was Adam Sheedy, 15, of Round Rock, Texas, who submitted the name of the late astronaut Judith Resnik, who perished in the 1986 Space Shuttle Challenger explosion. Other popular suggestions included explorer and guide Sacajewea and aviator Amelia Earhart.

Pre-history  MCA Inc., a powerful talent agency and a television production company, entered the recorded music business in 1962 with the purchase of the New York-based US Decca Records (established in 1934), including Coral Records and Brunswick Records. MCA was forced to exit the talent agency business in order to complete the merger. As American Decca owned Universal Pictures, MCA assumed full ownership of Universal and made it into a top film studio, producing several hits. In 1966, MCA formed Uni Records and in 1967 purchased Kapp Records which was placed under Uni Records management. History =The Early Years= In 1937, the owner of Decca, E. R. Lewis, chose to split off the UK Decca company from the US company (keeping his US Decca holdings), fearing the financial damage that would arise for UK Companies if the emerging hostilities of Nazi Germany should lead to war - correctly foreseeing World War II. Lewis sold the remainder of his US Decca holdings when war did break out. US-based Decca Records kept the rights to the Decca name in North and South America and parts of Asia including Japan. UK Decca owned the rights to the Decca name in the rest of the world. After the war, British Decca formed a new US subsidiary, London Records. During this time American Decca issued records outside North America on the Brunswick and Coral labels. In 1962, MCA acquired American Decca and became a wholly owned subsidiary. In 1967, Brunswick and Coral were replaced by the MCA label, which was used to release US Decca and Kapp label material outside North America. Initial activity as MCA Records was based in London and MCA Records UK was formally launched on February 16, 1968. Among the early artists on the MCA label, around 1971, were groups Wishbone Ash, Osibisa, Stackridge and Budgie, and solo artists Tony Christie, Mick Greenwood and Roy Young.Billboard Magazine, November 13, 1971 - MCA Records advertisement, p. L28 (Spotlight on London) Early MCA releases were distributed by UK Decca but it moved to EMI in 1974. In 1979, distribution moved to CBS, while the last releases in the 1980s were self- distributed, mostly through WEA, though BMG was used during the 1990s. As the US division of MCA Records was not established until 1972, the earliest UK MCA Records material was released in the US on either Kapp or Decca. MCA UK also issued American Brunswick material on the MCA label until 1972, two years after MCA lost control of Brunswick, after which American Brunswick material was issued in the UK on the revived Brunswick label. Uni label material was issued on the Uni label worldwide. = MCA Records formation in Canada and the United States = In 1970, MCA reorganized its Canadian record company Compo Company Ltd. into MCA Records (Canada). In April 1970, former Warner Bros. Records president Mike Maitland joined MCA and initially served as Decca's general manager. Maitland was unsuccessful in his attempt to consolidate Warner Bros. Records with co-owned Atlantic Records which led to his departure from Warner. In April 1971, Maitland supervised the consolidation of the New York-based Decca and Kapp labels plus the California-based Uni label into MCA Records based in Universal City, California, with Maitland serving as president. The three labels maintained their identities for a short time but were retired in favor of the MCA label in 1973. \\"Drift Away\\" by Dobie Gray became the final Decca pop label release in the U.S in 1973. Beginning the same year the catalogs of Decca, Uni and Kapp were reissued in the US on the MCA label under the supervision of veteran Decca producer Milt Gabler. = Early success = The first MCA Records release in the US was former Uni artist Elton John's \\"Crocodile Rock\\" single in 1972, which appeared on a plain black and white label. Immediately following this the US MCA label used a black with curved rainbow design until the late 1970s. This design was directly inspired by the US Decca label of the 1960s. In December 1972, Neil Diamond, another Uni artist, reached superstar status with his first MCA release, the live multi-platinum Hot August Night. Elton John's double album Goodbye Yellow Brick Road was released in October 1973 and was number one on the US Billboard 200 albums chart for eight straight weeks. The management of former Decca artists the Who had formed their own label Track Records in the UK but were still under contract with MCA for US distribution. The Who's double album Quadrophenia was released by Track/MCA also in October 1973. Quadrophenia peaked at number 2 as it was held back from the number 1 slot by Goodbye Yellow Brick Road. Other successful artists on MCA after the consolidation included former Kapp artist Cher, and Uni artist Olivia Newton- John. MCA released the highly successful soundtrack album to the 1973 film The Sting. The soundtrack music was arranged and conducted by Marvin Hamlisch and won an Academy Award for Best Original Score (MCA issued many other soundtracks to films from Universal, along with some non-Universal films). One of the most successful new MCA artists in this era was the rock band Lynyrd Skynyrd. Originating from Jacksonville, Florida, the group would go on to become one of the most popular in the Southern rock genre. The group was discovered and produced by Al Kooper and the records were initially released on Kooper's yellow \\"Sounds of the South\\" label imprint of MCA. The song \\"Free Bird\\" peaked at #19 on the Billboard Hot 100 chart in edited form, but the full-length version became one of the most popular songs of all time on album- oriented rock radio stations. On the second album, Second Helping, the group recorded a song about their relationship with the label called, \\"Workin' for MCA\\". Three Lynyrd Skynyrd albums reached the double platinum sales level and at least two others reached platinum or gold levels. The album Street Survivors was released in October 1977, just prior to a tragic plane crash in rural Mississippi in which members of the group were either killed or severely injured. The original Street Survivors cover had a picture of the band members surrounded by flames, but this was quickly substituted for a revised design without flames. Though a latter version of the group enjoyed success, Lynyrd Skynyrd's streak of hits ended after the crash. During the 1970s and 1980s MCA profited from reissuing classic early rock and roll recordings made by artists who recorded for the numerous labels absorbed by MCA. One notable example was the 1954 Decca recording \\"Rock Around the Clock\\" by Bill Haley & His Comets, which was featured as the lead track of MCA's No. 1-charting American Graffiti soundtrack album, and as a single returned to the American top 40 that year, 20 years after it was recorded. = Expansion and struggles = In 1977 MCA president Sidney Sheinberg set up the Infinity Records division, based in New York City with Ron Alexenberg as CEO. Alexenberg had been with the Epic division of CBS Records, now Sony Music Entertainment. The intention was to give MCA a stronger presence on the East Coast. The only big hit the Infinity label had was \\"Escape (The Pina Colada Song)\\" by Rupert Holmes, a #1 single at the end of 1979. Infinity also had some success with Hot Chocolate, Spyro Gyra, New England and TKO. But MCA pulled the plug on Infinity after it failed to sell most of the 1 million advance copies of an album featuring Pope John Paul II in October 1979. Infinity was fully absorbed by the parent company in 1980. In 1979, Bob Siner replaced Maitland as MCA Records president. Shortly afterwards, MCA acquired ABC Records along with its subsidiaries Paramount, Dunhill, Impulse!, Westminster, and Dot. ABC had acquired the Paramount and Dot labels when they purchased Gulf+Western's record labels and Famous Music Corp. Thus MCA now controlled material once owned by Paramount Pictures, the music released by Paramount's record labels, and the pre-1950 films by Paramount as well. Also included in the deal were recordings controlled by ABC, including albums by Tom Petty and the Heartbreakers which were originally released by Shelter Records. Petty was furious about the reassignment of his contract and refused to record for MCA. This led to a series of lawsuits, which resulted in his bankruptcy in 1980. Petty and other ABC/Shelter artists eventually had their contracts transferred to the Backstreet Records label, which was distributed by MCA. ABC Records' independent distributors sued ABC and MCA for $1.3 million in damages for being stuck with unsold ABC recordings they could not return to MCA. The better selling ABC Records catalog albums were reissued on the MCA label. The combined effects of the Infinity Records failure, the purchase of ABC, rising vinyl costs and a major slump in record sales produced tremendous losses for the company between 1979 and 1982. It was not until the mid-1980s that the record labels returned to significant profitability. In late 1980 MCA received negative publicity when it attempted to raise the list price of new releases by top selling artists from $8.98 to $9.98. This policy, known as \\"superstar pricing\\", ultimately failed. The Xanadu soundtrack album and Gaucho, by former ABC act Steely Dan, were the first releases with the higher list price. Backstreet artist Tom Petty succeeded in his campaign to force MCA to drop prices back to $8.98 for the release of his album Hard Promises, in May 1981. = Recovery, further expansion and MCA Music Entertainment Group formation = From 1983 to 1989, MCA Records was headed by Irving Azoff, a record executive who receives credit amongst its management and staff for saving the company from bankruptcy. Azoff resigned from MCA in 1989 to form his own record label, Giant Records, now defunct. Richard Palmese was named president of MCA Records after Azoff in 1990. In this period, MCA signed a distribution agreement with WEA international which lasted until 1990. In the late 1980s, MCA formed Mechanic Records as a sub-label for releasing heavy metal music. Bands signed to Mechanic included Voivod, Dream Theater, Bang Tango, and Trixter. Another sub- label, called The Futurist Label, was created to release progressive rock and death metal albums. In 1993 William Knoedelseder, a business writer for the Los Angeles Times, released the book \\"Stiffed: A True Story of MCA, the Music Business, and the Mafia\\". This volume detailed MCA's connections to organized crime during the 1980s. The Chess Records catalog was acquired from the remnants of Sugar Hill Records in 1985. Motown Records was bought in 1988 (and sold to PolyGram in 1993). GRP Records and Geffen Records were acquired in 1990. Unlike most of MCA's previous acquisitions, the GRP (which began managing MCA's jazz holdings) and Geffen (which became a second mainstream subsidiary) labels kept their identities and MCA created a new holding company in 1989 called MCA Music Entertainment Group, headed by Al Teller, former President of United Artists Records, and Co-Chairman of Turf Classics, a concert production company, run by Producer Richard Flanzer; among several other music industry positions Teller held. with Palmese continuing to run the MCA label. In the same year, the MCA Inc. parent company was purchased by the Matsushita group. = Universal Music Group = In 1995, Seagram Company Ltd. acquired 80% of MCA. In November of that year, Teller was fired and replaced by former Warner Music Group head Doug Morris. Palmese left MCA a week later. On December 9, 1996, the new owners dropped the MCA name; the company became Universal Studios, Inc. and its music division, MCA Music Entertainment Group, was renamed Universal Music Group (UMG), headed by Morris. In 1997, MCA Records adopted a new logo that featured the parent company's former full name. Many younger people had been unaware of what MCA had stood for in the past, hence the new logo. In conjunction with the new logo, the first MCA Records website was launched. On May 21, 1998, Seagram acquired PolyGram (owner of British Decca) from Philips and merged it with its music holdings. When Seagram's drinks business was bought by France-based Pernod Ricard, its media holdings (including Universal) were sold to Vivendi which became Vivendi Universal which was later renamed back to Vivendi SA after selling most of the entertainment division (which included Universal Pictures) to General Electric. Morris continued to head the combined company, still called Universal Music Group. = MCA label phaseout = In spring 2003, the MCA label was absorbed by sister UMG label Geffen Records. Today Universal Music Enterprises manages MCA's rock, pop, and urban back catalogues (including those from ABC Records and Famous Music Group) in conjunction with Geffen - UME and Geffen have re-released various albums from MCA in the years since, as well as several compilations. Its country music label MCA Nashville Records is still in operation, and is one of the only businesses using the MCA trademark as of 2016 along with MCA Records France (imprint of Universal Music France). MCA's jazz catalogue is managed by Verve Records (through the Impulse! and GRP imprints, depending on whether the recording was acquired from ABC or not), while its classical music catalogue is managed by Deutsche Grammophon.

An author who wrote in many genres, West reviewed books for The Times, the New York Herald Tribune, The Sunday Telegraph, and The New Republic, and she was a correspondent for The Bookman. Her major works include Black Lamb and Grey Falcon (1941), on the history and culture of Yugoslavia; A Train of Powder (1955), her coverage of the Nuremberg trials, published originally in The New Yorker; The Meaning of Treason (1949), later The New Meaning of Treason (1964), a study of the trial of the British fascist William Joyce and others; The Return of the Soldier (1918), a modernist World War I novel; and the \\"Aubrey trilogy\\" of autobiographical novels, The Fountain Overflows (1956), This Real Night (published posthumously in 1984), and Cousin Rosamund (1985). Time called her \\"indisputably the world's number one woman writer\\" in 1947. She was made CBE in 1949,The London Gazette, 3 June 1949, Supplement: 38628, p. 2804. and DBE in 1959,The London Gazette, 30 December 1958, Supplement: 41589, p. 10. in each case, the citation reads: \\"writer and literary critic\\". She took the pseudonym \\"Rebecca West\\" from the rebellious young heroine in Rosmersholm by Henrik Ibsen. She was a recipient of the Benson Medal. Biography Rebecca West was born Cicily Isabel FairfieldEncyclopedia Britannica, 17 December 2018 in 1892 in London, UK, and grew up in a home full of intellectual stimulation, political debate, lively company, books and music. Her mother, Isabella, a Scotswoman, was an accomplished pianist but did not pursue a musical career after her marriage to Charles Fairfield. The Anglo-Irish Charles had been a Confederate stretcher- bearer at the siege of Richmond in the US Civil War, and had returned to the UK to become a journalist of considerable reputation but financial incompetence. He deserted his family when Cicily was eight years old. He never rejoined them, and died impoverished and alone in a boarding house in Liverpool in 1906, when Cicily was 14. The rest of the family moved to Edinburgh, Scotland, where Cicily was educated at George Watson's Ladies College. She had to leave school in 1907 due to a bout of tuberculosis. She chose not to return after recovering from the illness, later describing her schooling at Watson's as akin to a \\"prison\\". She had two older sisters. Letitia (\\"Lettie\\"), who was the best educated of the three, became one of the first fully qualified female doctors in Britain, as well as a barrister at the Inns of Court. Winifred (\\"Winnie\\"), the middle sister, married Norman Macleod, Principal Assistant Secretary in the Admiralty, and eventually director general of Greenwich Hospital. Winnie's two children, Alison and Norman, became closely involved in Rebecca's life as she got older; Alison Macleod would achieve a literary career of her own. West trained as an actress in London, taking the name \\"Rebecca West\\" from the rebellious young heroine in Rosmersholm by Henrik Ibsen. She and Lettie became involved in the women's suffrage movement, participating in street protests. Meanwhile, West worked as a journalist for the feminist weekly Freewoman and the Clarion, drumming up support for the suffragette cause. In September 1912, West accused the famously libertine writer H. G. Wells of being \\"the Old Maid among novelists\\" in a provocative review in Freewoman of his novel Marriage. The review attracted Wells's interest and an invitation to lunch at his home. The two writers became lovers in late 1913.Ray, Gordon N. H.G. Wells & Rebecca West (New Haven: Yale University Press, 1974), pp. 1‚Äì32 Their 10-year relationship produced a son, Anthony West, born on 4 August 1914. Wells was behind her move to Leigh-on-Sea in Essex, where she lived between 1917 and 1919.Gibb, Lorna The Extraordinary Life of Rebecca West (Berkeley, CA: Counterpoint, 2014), pp. 66, 70 Their friendship lasted until Wells's death in 1946. West is also said to have had relationships with Charlie Chaplin, newspaper magnate Lord Beaverbrook, and journalist John Gunther. =Early career= West established her reputation as a spokeswoman for feminist and socialist causes and as a critic, turning out essays and reviews for The New Republic, New York Herald Tribune, New York American, New Statesman, The Daily Telegraph, and many more newspapers and magazines. George Bernard Shaw said in 1916 that \\"Rebecca West could handle a pen as brilliantly as ever I could and much more savagely.\\"Linda Charlton, \\"Dame Rebecca West Dies in London, The New York Times, 16 March 1983. During the 1920s, West began a lifelong habit of visits to the US to give lectures, meet artists, and get involved in the political scene. There, she befriended CIA founder Allen Dulles, Charlie Chaplin, Harold Ross of The New Yorker, and historian Arthur Schlesinger Jr., among many other significant figures of the day. Her lifelong fascination with the United States culminated in 1948 when President Truman presented her with the Women's Press Club Award for Journalism, calling her \\"the world's best reporter.\\" In 1930, at the age of 37, she married a banker, Henry Maxwell Andrews, and they remained nominally together, despite one public affair just before his death in 1968. West's writing brought her considerable wealth, and, by 1940, she owned a Rolls-Royce and a grand country estate, Ibstone House, in the Chiltern Hills of southern England. During World War II, West housed Yugoslav refugees in the spare rooms of her blacked-out manor, and she used the grounds as a small dairy farm and vegetable plot, agricultural pursuits that continued long after the war had ended. =Later life= As West grew older, she turned to broader political and social issues, including Mankind's propensity to inflict violent injustice on itself. Before and during World War II, West travelled widely, collecting material for books on travel and politics. In 1936‚Äì38, she made three trips to Yugoslavia, a country she came to love, seeing it as the nexus of European history since the late Middle Ages. Her non-fiction masterpiece, Black Lamb and Grey Falcon is an amalgamation of her impressions from these trips. New York Times reviewer Katherine Woods wrote: \\"In two almost incredibly full-packed volumes one of the most gifted and searching of modern English novelists and critics has produced not only the magnification and intensification of the travel book form, but, one may say, its apotheosis.\\" West was assigned by Ross' magazine to cover the Nuremberg Trials for The New Yorker, an experience she memorialized in the book A Train of Powder. In 1950, she was elected a Foreign Honorary Member of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences. She also went to South Africa in 1960 to report on apartheid in a series of articles for The Sunday Times. She travelled extensively well into old age. In 1966 and 1969, she undertook two long journeys to Mexico, becoming fascinated by the indigenous culture of the country and its mestizo population. She stayed with actor Romney Brent in Mexico City and with Katherine (Kit) Wright, a long-time friend, in Cuernavaca. =Old age= Her husband became both sleepy and inattentive as he got older. The sleepiness led to a car accident where no one was hurt but Henry was charged with dangerous driving. He became obsessed with the Norwegian ballerina Gerd Larsen and he would refuse to travel with West but wanted to return to London to be with Larsen. West initially considered this to be purely her husband's infatuation, but she came to think that Larsen was driven by money. At her husband's funeral she had the upsetting problem of Larsen's request to be amongst the mourners, even though she had only known him for 18 months. Henry's will left ¬£5,000 for Larsen. After her husband's death in 1968, West discovered that he had been unfaithful with other women. After she was widowed, she moved to London, where she bought a spacious apartment overlooking Hyde Park. Unfortunately, it was next door to the Iranian embassy. During the May 1980 incident, West, then 87, had to be evacuated. In the last two decades of her life, West kept up a very active social life, making friends with Martha Gellhorn, Doris Lessing, Bernard Levin, comedian Frankie Howerd, and film star and director Warren Beatty, who filmed her for the production Reds, a biography of journalist John Reed and his connection with the Russian Revolution. She also spent time with scholars such as Jane Marcus and Bonnie Kime Scott, who began to chronicle her feminist career and varied work.Jane Marcus, The Young Rebecca: Writings of Rebecca West 1911‚Äì17, Indiana University Press, 1982, p. x; Bonnie Kime Scott, Refiguring Modernism (Vol. 1), Indiana University Press, 1995, p. xli. She wrote at an unabated pace, penning masterful reviews for The Sunday Telegraph, publishing her last novel The Birds Fall Down (1966), and overseeing the film version of the story by BBC in 1978. The last work published in her lifetime was 1900 (1982). 1900 explored the last year of Queen Victoria's long reign, which was a watershed in many cultural and political respects. At the same time, West worked on sequels to her autobiographically inspired novel The Fountain Overflows (1957); although she had written the equivalent of two more novels for the planned trilogy, she was never satisfied with the sequels and did not publish them. She also tinkered at great length with an autobiography, without coming to closure, and she started scores of stories without finishing them. Much of her work from the late phase of her life was published posthumously, including Family Memories (1987), This Real Night (1984), Cousin Rosamund (1985), The Only Poet (1992), and Survivors in Mexico (2003). Unfinished works from her early period, notably Sunflower (1986) and The Sentinel (2001) were also published after her death, so that her oeuvre was augmented by about one third by posthumous publications. =Relationship with her son= West's relationship with her son, Anthony West, was not a happy one. The rancor between them came to a head when Anthony, himself a gifted writer, his father's biographer (H. G. Wells: Aspects of a Life [1984]), and a novelist, published Heritage (1955), a fictionalized autobiography. West never forgave her son for depicting in Heritage the relationship between an illegitimate son and his two world-famous, unmarried parents, and for portraying the mother in unflattering terms. The depiction of West's alter ego in Heritage as a deceitful, unloving actress (West had trained as an actress in her youth) and poor caregiver so wounded West that she broke off relations with her son and threatened to sue any publisher who would bring out Heritage in England. She successfully suppressed an English edition of the novel, which was only published there after her death, in 1984. Although there were temporary rapprochements between her and Anthony, a state of alienation persisted between them, causing West grief until her dying hour. She fretted about her son's absence from her deathbed, but when asked whether he should be sent for, answered: \\"perhaps not, if he hates me so much\\". =Death= West's grave in Brookwood Cemetery West suffered from failing eyesight and high blood pressure in the late 1970s, and she became increasingly frail. Her last months were mostly spent in bed, sometimes delirious, sometimes lucid, and she complained that she was dying too slowly. She died on 15 March 1983 and is buried at Brookwood Cemetery, Woking. On hearing of her death, William Shawn, then editor in chief of The New Yorker, said: ''' She is honoured with a blue plaque at Hope Park Square, Edinburgh, her childhood home which also provided the setting for her novel The Judge. Politics West grew up in a home filled with discussions of world affairs. Her father was a journalist who often involved himself in controversial issues. He brought home Russian revolutionaries and other political activists, and their debates helped to form West's sensibility, which took shape in novels such as The Birds Fall Down, set in pre-revolution Russia. But the crucial event that molded West's politics was the Dreyfus affair. The impressionable Rebecca learned early on just how powerful was the will to persecute minorities and to subject individuals to unreasonable suspicion based on flimsy evidence and mass frenzy. West had a keen understanding of the psychology of politics, how movements and causes could sustain themselves on the profound need to believe or disbelieve in a core of values‚Äîeven when that core contradicted reality. It would seem that her father's ironic, sceptical temper so penetrated her sensibility that she could not regard any body of ideas as other than a starting point for argument. Although she was a militant feminist and active suffragette, and published a perceptive and admiring profile of Emmeline Pankhurst, West also criticized the tactics of Pankhurst's daughter, Christabel, and the sometimes doctrinaire aspects of the Pankhursts' Women's Social and Political Union (WSPU). The first major test of West's political outlook was the Bolshevik Revolution. Many on the left saw it as the beginning of a new, better world, and the end of the crimes of capitalism. West regarded herself as a member of the left, having attending Fabian socialist summer schools as a girl. But to West, both the Revolution and the revolutionaries were suspect. Even before the Bolsheviks took power in October 1917, West expressed her doubts that events in Russia could serve as a model for socialists in Britain or anywhere else. West paid a heavy price for her cool reaction to the Russian Revolution; her positions increasingly isolated her. When Emma Goldman visited Britain in 1924 after seeing Bolshevik violence firsthand, West was exasperated that British intellectuals ignored Goldman's testimony and her warning against Bolshevik tyranny. For all her censures of Communism, however, West was hardly an uncritical supporter of the Western democracies. Thus in 1919‚Äì1920, she excoriated the US government for deporting Goldman and for the infamous Palmer Raids.Rebecca West, Introduction to Emma Goldman's My Disillusionment with Russia, Doubleday, 1923 She was also appalled at the failure of Western democracies to come to the aid of Republican Spain, and she gave money to the Republican cause. A staunch anti- fascist, West attacked both the Conservative governments of her own country for appeasing Adolf Hitler and her colleagues on the left for their pacifism. Neither side, in her view, understood the evil Nazism posed. Unlike many on the left, she also distrusted Joseph Stalin. To West, Stalin had a criminal mentality that Communism facilitated.Rebecca West, \\"The men we sacrificed to Stalin,\\" Sunday Telegraph, n.d. She was outraged when the Allies switched their loyalties as to Yugoslav resistance movements by deciding in 1943 to start backing the Communist-led Partisans led by Tito in Yugoslavia, thus abandoning their support of Dra≈æa Mihailoviƒá's Chetniks, whom she considered the legitimate Yugoslav resistance. She expressed her feelings and opinions on the Allies' switch in Yugoslavia by writing the satirical short story titled \\"Madame Sara's Magic Crystal\\", but decided not to publish it upon discussion with Orme Sargent, Assistant Under-Secretary of State at the Foreign Office.It was published posthumously in The Only Poet (1992), edited by Antonia Till, Virago, pp. 167‚Äì78. Writing in her diary, West mentioned Sargent persuaded her that \\"the recognition of Tito was made by reason of British military necessities, and for no other reason\\" and following Sargent's claim, she described her decision not to publish the story as an expression of \\"personal willingness to sacrifice myself to the needs of my country\\".Madame Sara's After the war, West's anti-Communism hardened as she saw Poland, Czechoslovakia, Hungary, and other Eastern and Central European states succumb to Soviet domination. It is not surprising in this context that West reacted to US Senator Joseph McCarthy differently from her colleagues. They saw a demagogue terrorizing liberals and leftists with baseless accusations of Communist conspiracy. West saw an oaf blundering into the minefield of Communist subversion. For her, McCarthy was right to pursue Communists with fervor, even if his methods were roughshod, though her mild reaction to McCarthy provoked powerful revulsion among those on the left and dismay even among anti-Communist liberals. She refused, however, to amend her views.Rebecca West, \\"McCarthyism,\\" U.S. News & World Report, 22 May 1953; \\"Miss West Files and Answer,\\" The Herald Tribune, 22 June 1953, p. 12; \\"Memo from Rebecca West: More about McCarthyism,\\" U.S. News & World Report, 3 July 1953, pp. 34‚Äì35 Although West's anti-Communism earned the high regard of conservatives, she never considered herself one of them. In postwar Britain, West voted Labour and welcomed the Labour landslide of 1945. But she spoke out against domination of the Labour Party by British trade unions, and thought left-wing politicians such as Michael Foot unimpressive. She had mixed feelings about the Callaghan government. West admired Margaret Thatcher, not for Thatcher's policies, but for Thatcher's achievement in rising to the top of a male-dominated sphere.Rebecca West, \\"Margaret Thatcher: The Politician as Woman,\\" Vogue, September 1979 She admired Thatcher's willingness to stand up to trade union bullying. In the end, West's anti-Communism remained the centerpiece of her politics because she so consistently challenged the Communists as legitimate foes of the status quo in capitalist countries. In West's view, Communism, like fascism, was merely a form of authoritarianism. Communists were under party discipline and therefore could never speak for themselves. And West was a supreme example of an intellectual who spoke for herself, no matter how her comments might injure her. Indeed, few writers explicitly acknowledged how much West's embrace of unpopular positions hurt her on the left. A whole generation of writers abandoned West and refused to read her, as Doris Lessing suggested. Religion West's parents had her baptised into the Church of England two months after birthLondon Metropolitan Archives, Bryanston Square St Mary, Register of Baptism, p89/mry2, Item 040 and she considered herself a Christian, though an unconventional believer. At times, she found God to be wicked; at other times she considered him merely ineffectual and defeated. However, she revered Christ as the quintessentially good man, she had great respect for the literary, pictorial, and architectural manifestations of the Christian ethos, and she considered faith a valid tool to grapple with the conundrums of life and the mysteries of the cosmos.Rebecca West, \\"My Religion\\" in My Religion, edited by Arnold Bennett, Appleton, 1926. pp. 21‚Äì22] Although her writings are full of references to the Bible and ecclesiastical history, she was essentially anti-doctrinaire and occasionally blasphemous. In 1926 she expressed the unorthodox belief that \\"Christianity must be regarded not as a final revelation but as a phase of revelation.\\"Rebecca West My Religion, pp. 22‚Äì23 Moreover, she rejected specific articles of belief such as the virgin birth, Original sin, the Atonement, and Providence. Her contribution to Virginia Woolf's Hogarth Letters Series, Letter to a Grandfather (1933), is a declaration of \\"my faith, which seems to some unfaith\\" disguised as philosophical fiction. Written in the midst of the Great Depression, Letter to a Grandfather traces the progressive degeneration of the notion of Providence through the ages, concluding skeptically that \\"the redemptive power of divine grace no longer seemed credible, nor very respectable in the arbitrary performance that was claimed for it.\\" As for the Atonement, Black Lamb and Grey Falcon is in part meant as a refutation of that very doctrine, which she saw as having sparked a fatal obsession with sacrifice throughout the Christian era and, specifically, as having prompted Neville Chamberlain to formulate his policy of appeasement, which she vehemently opposed. She wrote: > All our Western thought is founded on this repulsive pretence that pain is > the proper price of any good thing ... [Augustine] developed a theory of the > Atonement which was pure nonsense, yet had the power to convince ... This > monstrous theory supposes that God was angry with man for his sins and that > He wanted to punish him for these, not in any way that might lead to his > reformation, but simply by inflicting pain on him; and that He allowed > Christ to suffer this pain instead of man and thereafter was willing on > certain terms to treat man as if he had not committed these sins. This > theory flouts reason at all points, for it is not possible that a just God > should forgive people who are wicked because another person who was good > endured agony by being nailed to a cross. World War II shocked her into a more conventional belief: \\"I believe if people are looking for the truth, the truth of the Christian religion will come out and meet them.\\"Rebecca West, \\"Can Christian faith survive this war?\\" interview conducted by the Daily Express, 17 January 1945 And in the early 1950s, she thought she had a mystical revelation in France and actively tried to convert to Catholicism. There was a precedent in her family for this action, as her sister, Letitia, had earlier converted to Catholicism, thereby causing quite a stir. But West's attempt was short-lived, and she confessed to a friend: \\"I could not go on with being a Catholic ... I don't want, I can't bear to, become a Graham Greene and Evelyn Waugh, and I cannot believe that I am required to pay such a price for salvation.\\"Rebecca West, Letter dated 22 June 1952, to Margaret and Evelyn Hutchinson. Beinecke Rare Book and Manuscript Library Her writings of the 1960s and early 1970s again betray a profound mistrust towards God: \\"The case against religion is the responsibility of God for the sufferings of mankind, which makes it impossible to believe the good things said about Him in the Bible, and consequently to believe anything it says about Him.\\"Rebecca West, Survivors in Mexico, Yale, 2003, p. 81 Alongside her fluctuating Christianity, West was fascinated with Manichaeanism. She describes the Manichean idea that the world is a mixture of two primeval kingdoms, one of light the other of darkness, as an \\"extremely useful conception of life\\" affirming that a \\"fusion of light and darkness\\" is \\"the essential human character.\\" On the other hand West criticised \\"the strictly literal mind of the founder [of Manichaeanism] and his followers\\" and what she perceived as the meanness of Christian heretics who adopted Manichaean ideas. West states that \\"the whole of modern history could be deduced from the popularity of this heresy in Western Europe: its inner sourness, its preference for hate over love and for war over peace, its courage about dying, its cowardice about living.\\" Regarding the suppression of Manichaean heresies by the Christian authorities West says that whilst \\"it is our tendency to sympathise with the hunted hare... much that we read of Western European heretics makes us suspect that here the quarry was less of a hare than a priggish skunk.\\" Nonetheless Manichean influence persists in an unpublished draft of West's own memoirs where she writes: \\"I had almost no possibility of holding faith of any religious kind except a belief in a wholly and finally defeated God, a hypothesis which I now accept but tried for a long time to reject, I could not face it.\\"Rebecca West, unpublished typescript, McFarlin Special Collections, University of Tulsa West's interest in Manichaeanism reflects her lifelong struggle with the question of how to deal with dualisms. At times she appears to favor the merging of opposites, for which Byzantium served as a model: \\"church and state, love and violence, life and death, were to be fused again as in Byzantium.\\" More dominant, however, was her tendency to view the tensions generated in the space between dualistic terms as life- sustaining and creative; hence, her aversion to homosexuality and her warning not to confuse the drive for feminist emancipation with the woman's desire to become like a man. Her insistence on the fundamental difference between men and women reveals her essentialism,Bonnie Kime Scott, Refiguring Modernism (Vol. 2), p. 161 but it also bespeaks her innate Manichaean sensibility. She wanted respect and equal rights for women, but at the same time she required that women retain their specifically feminine qualities, notably an affinity with life: \\"Men have a disposition to violence; women have not. If one says that men are on the side of death, women on the side of life, one seems to be making an accusation against men. One is not doing that.\\"Rebecca West, Woman as Artist and Thinker, iUniverse, 2005, p. 19 One reason why she does not want to make an accusation against men is that they are simply playing their assigned role in a flawed universe. Only love can alleviate destructive aspects of the sex-antagonism: \\"I loathe the way the two cancers of sadism and masochism eat into the sexual life of humanity, so that the one lifts the lash and the other offers blood to the blow, and both are drunken with the beastly pleasure of misery and do not proceed with love's business of building a shelter from the cruelty of the universe.\\" In addition to the operations of love, female emancipation is crucial to removing the moral, professional, and social stigma associated with the notion of the \\"weaker sex,\\" without trying to do away altogether with the temperamental and metaphysical aspects of the gender dualism itself. Thus, the \\"sex war\\" described in West's early short story \\"Indissoluble Matrimony\\" (1914) elevates the female character, Evadne, in the end because she accepts the terms of the contest without superficially trying to \\"win\\" that war. The task of reconciling dualisms can also be seen in West's political propensities. As Bernard Schweizer has argued: \\"St. Augustine and Schopenhauer emphasized the fallenness of human life, implying a quietistic stance that could be confused with conservatism, while the Reclus brothers [famous French anarchists] urged her to revolt against such pessimistic determinism. West's characteristically heroic personal and historic vision is a result of these two contending forces.\\" West's conviction that humanity will only fulfill its highest potentials if it adheres to the principle of process reflects the same preoccupation: \\"Process is her most encompassing doctrine,\\" states Peter Wolfe. \\"Reconciling her dualism, it captures the best aspects of the male and female principles.\\"Peter Wolfe, Rebecca West: Artist and Thinker, Southern Illinois, 1971, p. 12 Cultural references Long time book reviewer and senior editor at TIME Whittaker Chambers considered West \\"a novelist of note ... a distinguished literary critic ... above all ... one of the greatest of living journalists.\\" Virginia Woolf questioned Rebecca West being labelled as an \\"arrant feminist\\" because she offended men by saying they are snobs in chapter two of A Room of One's Own: was Miss West an arrant feminist for making a possibly true if uncomplimentary statement about the other sex?\\" Bill Moyers's interview \\"A Visit With Dame Rebecca West,\\" recorded in her London home when she was 89, was aired by PBS in July 1981. In a review of the interview, John O'Connor wrote that \\"Dame Rebecca emerges as a formidable presence. When she finds something or somebody disagreeable, the adjective suddenly becomes withering.\\"John J. O'Connor, \\"Moyers and a Provocative Dame Rebecca West.\\" The New York Times, 8 July 1981. West's first novel, The Return of the Soldier, was turned into a major motion picture in 1982, directed by Alan Bridges, starring Alan Bates, Glenda Jackson, and Julie Christie. More recently, an adaptation of The Return of the Soldier for the stage by Kelly Younger titled Once a Marine took West's theme of shell-shock-induced amnesia and applied it to a soldier returning from the war in Iraq with PTSD. There have been two plays about Rebecca West produced since 2004. That Woman: Rebecca West Remembers, by Carl Rollyson, Helen Macleod, and Anne Bobby, is a one-woman monologue in which an actress playing Rebecca West recounts her life through some of her most famous articles, letters, and books. Tosca's Kiss, a 2006 play by Kenneth Jupp, retells West's experience covering the Nuremberg trials for The New Yorker. Robert D. Kaplan's influential book Balkan Ghosts (1994) is an homage to West's Black Lamb and Grey Falcon (1941), which he calls \\"this century's greatest travel book\\"Robert, D. Kaplan, Balkan Ghosts (1994), p. 3 In February 2006, BBC broadcast a radio version of West's novel The Fountain Overflows, dramatized by Robin Brook, in six 55-minute installments.

Sullivan is a political commentator, a former editor of The New Republic, and the author or editor of six books. He started a political blog, The Daily Dish, in 2000, and eventually moved his blog to platforms, including Time, The Atlantic, The Daily Beast, and finally an independent subscription-based format. He announced his retirement from blogging in 2015. From 2016 to 2020, Sullivan was a writer-at-large at New York. Sullivan says his conservatism is rooted in his Roman Catholic background and in the ideas of the British political philosopher Michael Oakeshott. In 2003, he wrote he was no longer able to support the American conservative movement, as he was disaffected with the Republican Party's continued rightward shift on social issues during the George W. Bush era. Born and raised in Britain, he has lived in the United States since 1984 and currently resides in Washington, D.C. and Provincetown, Massachusetts. He is openly gay and a practicing Roman Catholic.http://chqdaily.com/2017/07/conservative-gay-writer-andrew-sullivan- makes-case-faith/https://www.commonwealmagazine.org/sullivans-catholicism Early and personal life Sullivan was born in South Godstone, Surrey, England into a Roman Catholic family of Irish descent, and was brought up in the nearby town of East Grinstead, West Sussex. He was educated at Reigate Grammar School, where his class-mates included future Labour Party leader Keir Starmer and future Conservative member of the House of Lords Andrew Cooper, and Magdalen College, Oxford, where he was awarded a first-class Bachelor of Arts in modern history and modern languages. In his second year, he was elected President of the Oxford Union for Trinity term 1983. Sullivan earned a Master of Public Administration in 1986 from the John F. Kennedy School of Government at Harvard University, followed by a Doctor of Philosophy degree in government from Harvard in 1990. His dissertation was titled Intimations Pursued: The Voice of Practice in the Conversation of Michael Oakeshott. In 2001, it came to light that Sullivan had posted anonymous online advertisements for unprotected anal sex, preferably with \\"other HIV-positive men\\". He was widely criticised in the media for this, with some critics noting that he had condemned President Bill Clinton's \\"incautious behavior\\", though others wrote in his defense. In 2003, Sullivan wrote a Salon article identifying himself as a member of the gay \\"bear community\\". On 27 August 2007, he married Aaron Tone in Provincetown, Massachusetts. Sullivan was barred for many years from applying for United States citizenship because of his HIV-positive status.Andrew Sullivan, \\"Vatican Beatifies John Paul II As Patron Saint Of Ignoring Problem Until You Die.\\". Retrieved 25 May 2009. Following the statutory and administrative repeals of the HIV immigration ban in 2008 and 2009, respectively, he announced his intention to begin the process of becoming a permanent resident and citizen. On The Chris Matthews Show on 16 April 2011, Sullivan confirmed that he had become a permanent resident, showing his green card. On 1 December 2016, Sullivan became a naturalised US citizen. He has been a daily user of marijuana since 2001. Career In 1986, Sullivan began his career with The New Republic magazine, serving as its editor from 1991 to 1996. In that position, he expanded the magazine from its traditional roots in political coverage to cultural issues and the politics surrounding them. During this time, the magazine generated several high-profile controversies. While completing graduate work at Harvard in 1988, Sullivan published an attack in Spy magazine on Rhodes Scholars, \\"All Rhodes Lead Nowhere in Particular,\\" which dismissed recipients of the scholarship as \\"hustling apple-polisher[s]\\"; \\"high-profile losers\\"; \\"the very best of the second-rate\\"; and \\"misfits by the very virtue of their bland, eugenic perfection.\\" \\"[T]he sad truth is that as a rule,\\" Sullivan wrote, \\"Rhodies possess none of the charms of the aristocracy and all of the debilities: fecklessness, excessive concern that peasants be aware of their achievement, and a certain hemophilia of character.\\"Sullivan, Andrew. \\"All Rhodes Lead Nowhere in Particular\\", Spy, October 1988, pp. 108‚Äì114. Quoted in Schaeper, Thomas J.; Schaeper, Kathleen. The Rhodes Scholarship, Oxford, and the Creation of an American Elite, Berghahn Books, 2010, pp. 281‚Äì285. Author Thomas Schaeper notes that \\"[i]ronically, Sullivan had first gone to the United States on a Harkness Fellowship, one of many scholarships spawned in emulation of the Rhodes program.\\" In 1994, Sullivan published excerpts on race and intelligence from Richard Herrnstein and Charles Murray's controversial The Bell Curve, which argued that some of the measured difference in IQ scores among racially defined groups was a result of genetic inheritance. Almost the entire editorial staff of the magazine threatened to resign if material that they considered racist was published. To appease them, Sullivan included lengthy rebuttals from 19 writers and contributors. He has continued to speak approvingly of the research and arguments presented in The Bell Curve, writing, \\"The book ... still holds up as one of the most insightful and careful of the last decade. The fact of human inequality and the subtle and complex differences between various manifestations of being human‚Äîgay, straight, male, female, black, Asian‚Äîis a subject worth exploring, period.\\" According to Sullivan, this incident was a turning point in his relationship with the magazine's staff and management, which he conceded was already bad because he \\"was a lousy manager of people\\". He left the magazine in 1996. Sullivan began writing for The New York Times Magazine in 1998, but was fired by editor Adam Moss in 2002. Jack Shafer wrote in Slate magazine that he had asked Moss in an e-mail to explain this decision, but that his e-mails went unanswered, adding that Sullivan was not fully forthcoming on the subject. Sullivan wrote on his blog that the decision had been made by Times executive editor Howell Raines, who found Sullivan's presence \\"uncomfortable\\", but defended Raines's right to fire him. Sullivan suggested that Raines had done so in response to Sullivan's criticism of the Times on his blog, and said he had expected that his criticisms would eventually anger Raines. Sullivan has also worked as a columnist for The Sunday Times of London. Ross Douthat and Tyler Cowen have suggested that Sullivan is the most influential political writer of his generation, particularly because of his very early and strident support for same-sex marriage, his early political blog, his support of the Iraq War, and his subsequent support of Barack Obama's presidential candidacy. Mark Ames has charged that Sullivan lacks journalistic integrity and has been responsible for a number of unethical and misleading articles during his career. After the cessation of his long-running blog, The Dish, in 2015, Sullivan wrote regularly for New York during the 2016 presidential election, and in February 2017 he began writing a weekly column, \\"Interesting Times\\", for the magazine. On July 19, 2020, following the unexplained absence of his column for June 5, Sullivan announced that he would no longer write for New York. He announced he would be reviving The Dish as a newsletter The Weekly Dish hosted by Substack. Politics Michael Oakeshott was a major intellectual influence on Sullivan Sullivan describes himself as a conservative and is the author of The Conservative Soul. He has supported a number of traditional libertarian positions, favouring limited government and opposing interventionist measures such as affirmative action. However, on a number of controversial public issues, including same-sex marriage, social security, progressive taxation, anti-discrimination laws, the Affordable Care Act, the United States government's use of torture, and capital punishment, he has taken positions not typically shared by conservatives in the United States. In July 2012, Sullivan said that \\"the catastrophe of the Bush-Cheney years ... all but exploded the logic of neoconservatism and its domestic partner-in-crime, supply-side economics.\\"\\"Yglesias Award Nominee\\" The Dish 6 July 2012 One of the most important intellectual and political influences on Sullivan is Michael Oakeshott. Sullivan describes Oakeshott's thought as \\"an anti-ideology, a nonprogramme, a way of looking at the world whose most perfect expression might be called inactivism.\\" He argues \\"that Oakeshott requires us to systematically discard programmes and ideologies and view each new situation sui generis. Change should only ever be incremental and evolutionary. Oakeshott viewed society as resembling language: it is learned gradually and without us really realising it, and it evolves unconsciously, and for ever.\\" In 1984, he wrote that Oakeshott offered \\"a conservatism which ends by affirming a radical liberalism.\\" This \\"anti-ideology\\" is perhaps the source of accusations that Sullivan \\"flip-flops\\" or changes his opinions to suit the whims of the moment. He has written, \\"A true conservative‚Äîwho is, above all, an anti-ideologue‚Äîwill often be attacked for alleged inconsistency, for changing positions, for promising change but not a radical break with the past, for pursuing two objectives‚Äîlike liberty and authority, or change and continuity‚Äîthat seem to all ideologues as completely contradictory.\\" As a youth, Sullivan was a fervent supporter of Margaret Thatcher and later Ronald Reagan. He says of that time, \\"What really made me a right-winger was seeing the left use the state to impose egalitarianism‚Äîon my school\\", after the Labour government in Britain tried to merge his admissions-selective school with the local comprehensive school. At Oxford, he became friends with future prominent conservatives William Hague and Niall Ferguson and became involved with Conservative Party politics. From 1980 through 2000, he supported Republican presidential candidates in the United States, with the exception of the election of 1992, when he supported Bill Clinton in his first presidential campaign. In 2004, however, he was angered by George W. Bush's support of the Federal Marriage Amendment designed to enshrine in the Constitution marriage as a union between a man and a woman, as well as what he saw as the Bush administration's incompetence over its Iraq War management, and consequently supported the presidential campaign of John Kerry, a Democrat. Sullivan endorsed Senator Barack Obama for the Democratic nomination in the 2008 United States presidential election, and Representative Ron Paul for the Republican nomination. After John McCain clinched the Republican primary and named Sarah Palin as his vice presidential nominee, Sullivan began to espouse a birther- like conspiracy theory involving Palin and her young son Trig Palin. Sullivan devoted a significant amount of space on The Atlantic, questioning whether Palin is Trig's biological mother. He and others who held this belief, dubbed \\"Trig Truthers\\", demanded Palin to produce a birth certificate or other piece of medical evidence that proves Trig is indeed her biological son. Sullivan eventually endorsed Obama for president, largely because he believed that he would restore \\"the rule of law and Constitutional balance\\"; he also argued that Obama represented a more realistic prospect for \\"bringing America back to fiscal reason\\", and expressed a hope that Obama would be able to \\"get us past the culture war.\\" Sullivan continued to maintain that Obama was the best choice for president from a conservative point of view. During the 2012 election campaign, he wrote, \\"Against a radical right, reckless, populist insurgency, Obama is the conservative option, dealing with emergent problems with pragmatic calm and modest innovation. He seeks as a good Oakeshottian would to reform the country's policies in order to regain the country's past virtues. What could possibly be more conservative than that?\\" Sullivan has declared support for Arnold Schwarzenegger and other like-minded Republicans.\\"Ron Paul For The GOP Nomination\\" 14 December 2011, The Daily Beast He argues that the Republican Party, and much of the conservative movement in the United States, has largely abandoned its earlier scepticism and moderation in favour of a more fundamentalist certainty, both in religious and political terms. He has said this is the primary source of his alienation from the modern Republican Party. In January 2009, Forbes magazine ranked Sullivan No. 19 on a list of \\"The 25 Most Influential Liberals in the U.S. Media\\". Sullivan rejected the \\"liberal\\" label and set out his grounds in a published article in response. In August 2018, after Sarah Jeong, an editorial board-member of The New York Times, received widespread criticism for her old anti-white tweets, Sullivan accused Jeong of being racist and calling white people \\"subhuman\\". Sullivan also accused Jeong of spreading eliminationist rhetoric; a belief that political opponents are a societal cancer that should be separated, censored or exterminated. =LGBT issues= Sullivan, like Marshall Kirk, Hunter Madsen, and Bruce Bawer, has been described by Urvashi Vaid as a proponent of \\"legitimation\\", seeing the objective of the gay rights movement as being \\"mainstreaming gay and lesbian people\\" rather than \\"radical social change\\".Vaid, Urvashi. Virtual Equality: The Mainstreaming of Gay & Lesbian Liberation. New York: Doubleday, 1996, p. 37 Sullivan wrote the first major article in the United States advocating for gay people to be given the right to marry, published in The New Republic in 1989. Many gay rights organisations attacked him for the stance at the time. Many on \\"the gay left\\" believed that he was promoting \\"assimilation\\" into \\"straight culture\\", when the aim of most at that time was to alter codes of sexuality and society as a whole, rather than fitting gays into it. However, his arguments eventually became widely accepted and formed the basis of the modern movement to allow same-sex marriage. The book won the 1996 Mencken Award for Best Book, presented by the Free Press Association.https://menckenawards.blogspot.com/2019/11/normal_13.html In the wake of the United States Supreme Court rulings on same-sex marriage in 2013 (Hollingsworth v. Perry and United States v. Windsor), The New York Times op- ed columnist Ross Douthat suggested that Sullivan might be the most influential political writer of his generation, writing, \\"No intellectual that I can think of, writing on a fraught and controversial topic, has seen their once-crankish, outlandish-seeming idea become the conventional wisdom so quickly, and be instantantiated so rapidly in law and custom.\\" Sullivan opposes hate crime laws, arguing that they undermine freedom of speech and equal protection. He also opposes the Employment Non-Discrimination Act, arguing that it would \\"not make much of a difference\\" and that the \\"gay rights establishment\\" was wrong to oppose a version of the bill that did not include protections for gender identity. Sullivan opposed calls to remove Brendan Eich as CEO of Mozilla for donating to the campaign for Proposition 8, which made same-sex marriage illegal in California. He argued that \\"old-fashioned liberalism brought gay equality to America far, far faster than identity politics leftism.\\" In 2006, Sullivan was named as an LGBT History Month icon. In November 2019, Sullivan wrote an Intelligencer column on people who at one time identified as transgender but later detransitioned. Sullivan also discussed the controversy over a 2018 journal article by Lisa Littman proposing rapid onset gender dysphoria as a socially mediated subtype of gender dysphoria. =War on terror= Sullivan supported the 2003 invasion of Iraq by the United States and was initially hawkish in the war on terror, arguing that weakness would embolden terrorists. He was \\"one of the most militant\\" supporters of the Bush administration's counter-terrorism strategy immediately following the September 11 attacks in 2001; in an essay for The Sunday Times, he stated, \\"The middle part of the country‚Äîthe great red zone that voted for Bush‚Äîis clearly ready for war. The decadent Left in its enclaves on the coasts is not dead‚Äîand may well mount what amounts to a fifth column.\\" Eric Alterman wrote in 2002 that Sullivan had \\"set himself up as a one-man House Un-American Activities Committee\\" running an \\"inquisition\\" to unmask \\"anti-war Democrats\\", \\"basing his argument less on the words these politicians speak than on the thoughts he knows them to be holding in secret\\". Later, Sullivan criticised the Bush administration for its prosecution of the war, especially regarding the numbers of troops, protection of munitions, and treatment of prisoners, including the use of torture against detainees in United States custody. Though he argues that enemy combatants in the war on terror should not be given status as prisoners of war because \\"terrorists are not soldiers\\", he believes that the US government must abide by the rules of war‚Äîin particular, Article 3 of the Geneva Conventions‚Äîwhen dealing with such detainees. In retrospect, Sullivan said that the torture and abuse of prisoners at the Abu Ghraib prison in Iraq had jolted him back to \\"sanity\\". Of his early support for the invasion of Iraq, he said, \\"I was terribly wrong. In the shock and trauma of 9/11, I forgot the principles of scepticism and doubt towards utopian schemes that I had learned.\\" On the edition of 27 October 2006 of Real Time with Bill Maher, he described conservatives and Republicans who refused to admit they had been wrong to support the Iraq War as \\"cowards\\". On 26 February 2008, he wrote on his blog: \\"After 9/11, I was clearly blinded by fear of al Qaeda and deluded by the overwhelming military superiority of the US and the ease of democratic transitions in Eastern Europe into thinking we could simply fight our way to victory against Islamist terror. I wasn't alone. But I was surely wrong.\\" His reversal on the Iraq issue and his increasing attacks on the Bush administration caused a severe backlash from many hawkish conservatives, who accused him of not being a \\"real\\" conservative. Sullivan authored an opinion piece, \\"Dear President Bush,\\" that was featured as the cover article of the October 2009 edition of The Atlantic magazine. In it, he called on former President Bush to take personal responsibility for the incidents and practices of torture that occurred during his administration as part of the war on terror. =Israel= Sullivan states that he has \\"always been a Zionist\\".A. Sullivan, Mr Netanyahu \\"Expects\\" , 20 May 2011. However, his views have become more critical over time. In February 2009, he wrote that he could no longer take the neoconservative position on Israel seriously:Andrew Sullivan,\\"A False Premise\\", Sullivan's Daily Dish, 5 February 2009. In January 2010, Sullivan blogged that he was \\"moving toward\\" the idea of \\"a direct American military imposition\\" of a two-state solution to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, with NATO troops enforcing \\"the borders of the new states of Palestine and Israel\\". He commented, \\"I too am sick of the Israelis. [...] I'm sick of having a great power like the US being dictated to.\\" His post was criticised by Noah Pollak of Commentary, who referred to it as \\"crazy\\", \\"heady stuff\\" based on \\"hubris\\". In February 2010, Leon Wieseltier suggested in The New Republic that Sullivan, a former friend and colleague, had a \\"venomous hostility toward Israel and Jews\\" and was \\"either a bigot, or just moronically insensitive\\" toward the Jewish people.Leon Wieseltier, Something Much Darker. Andrew Sullivan has a serious problem, The New Republic, 8 February 2010. Sullivan rejected the accusation and was defended by some writers, while others at least partly supported Wieseltier.19 Pundits on the Sullivan-Wieseltier Debate, The Atlantic, 11 February 2010. In March 2019, Sullivan wrote in New York magazine that while he strongly supported the right of a Jewish state to exist, he felt that Rep. Ilhan Omar's comments about the influence of the pro-Israel lobby were largely correct. Sullivan said that \\"it is simply a fact that the Israel lobby uses money, passion, and persuasion to warp this country‚Äôs foreign policy in favor of another country ‚Äî out of all proportion to what Israel can do for the US.\\" =Iran= Sullivan devoted a significant amount of blog space to covering the allegations of fraud and related protests after the 2009 Iranian presidential election. Francis Wilkinson of The Week stated that Sullivan's \\"coverage‚Äîand that journalism term takes on new meaning here‚Äîof the uprising in Iran was nothing short of extraordinary. 'Revolutionary' might be a better word.\\" Sullivan was inspired by the Iranian people's reactions to the election results and used his blog as a hub of information. Because of the media blackout in Iran, Iranian Twitter accounts were a major source of information. Sullivan frequently quoted and linked to Nico Pitney of The Huffington Post. = Immigration = Writing for New York magazine, Sullivan expressed concern that high levels of immigration to the United States could drive \\"white anxiety\\" by causing white Americans to be \\"increasingly troubled by the pace of change\\" since they were never formally asked whether they wanted such a demographic shift. Sullivan has advocated for tighter immigration controls on asylum and overall lower levels of immigration. He has criticized Democrats for what he perceived as their unwillingness to implement such controls. = Race science = As editor at The New Republic, Sullivan published excerpts from the 1994 book The Bell Curve, by Richard Herrnstein and Charles Murray, which advocated for a racialist approach to political policy. In 2015 Jeet Heer, in an article in The New Republic entitled \\"The New Republic's Legacy on Race\\" described Sullivan's decision as an example of \\"The magazine's myopia on racial issues\\". The importance of Sullivan to the popularization of The Bell Curve and race science was noted by Matthew Yglesias who called Sullivan \\"the punditocracy's original champion of Murray's thinking on genetics\\". In Current Affairs in 2017 Nathan J. Robinson said that Sullivan: > ...helped midwife The Bell Curve and grant flimsy race science a veneer of > intellectual respectability. He still believes race is a reasonable prism > through which to view the world, and that if only our racial stereotypes are > \\"true,\\" they are acceptable. He is therefore an unreliable and > ideologically-biased guide to political and social science. He is also a > racist. Religion Sullivan identifies himself as a faithful Catholic while disagreeing with some aspects of the Catholic Church's doctrine. In Virtually Normal, he argues that the Bible forbids same-sex sexual activity only when it is linked to prostitution or pagan rituals. He expressed concern about the election of Pope Benedict XVI in a Time magazine article on 24 April 2005, titled \\"The Vicar of Orthodoxy\\". He wrote that Benedict was opposed to the modern world and women's rights, and considered gays and lesbians innately disposed to evil. Sullivan has, however, agreed with Benedict's assertion that reason is an integral element of faith. Sullivan takes a moderate approach to religion, rejecting fundamentalism and describing himself as a \\"dogged defender of pluralism and secularism\\". He defended religious moderates in a series of exchanges with atheist author Sam Harris in which Harris maintained that religious moderates provided cover for fundamentalists and made it impossible for anyone to effectively oppose them. Blogging In late 2000, Sullivan began his blog, The Daily Dish. The core principle of the blog has been the style of conservatism he views as traditional. This includes fiscal conservatism, limited government, and classic libertarianism on social issues. Sullivan opposes government involvement with respect to sexual and consensual matters between adults, such as the use of marijuana and prostitution. He believes recognition of same-sex marriage is a civil-rights issue but expressed willingness to promote it on a state-by-state legislative federalism basis, rather than trying to judicially impose the change. Most of Sullivan's disputes with other conservatives have been over social issues and the handling of postwar Iraq. Sullivan gave out yearly \\"awards\\" for various public statements, parodying those of the people the awards were named after. Throughout the year, nominees were mentioned in various blog posts. The readers of his blog chose winners at the end of each year. * The Hugh Hewitt Award, introduced in June 2008 and named after a man Sullivan described as an \\"absurd partisan fanatic\\", was for the most egregious attempts to label Barack Obama as un-American, alien, treasonous, and far out of the mainstream of American life and politics. * The John Derbyshire Award was for egregious and outlandish comments on gays, women, and minorities. * The Paul Begala Award was for extreme liberal hyperbole. * The Michelle Malkin Award was for shrill, hyperbolic, divisive, and intemperate right-wing rhetoric. (Ann Coulter was ineligible for this award so that, in Sullivan's words, \\"other people will have a chance.\\") * The Michael Moore Award was for divisive, bitter, and intemperate left-wing rhetoric. * The Matthew Yglesias Award was for writers, politicians, columnists, or pundits who criticised their own side of the political spectrum, made enemies among political allies, and generally risked something for the sake of saying what they believed. * The \\"Poseur Alert\\" was awarded for passages of prose that stood out for pretension, vanity, and bad writing designed to look profound. * The Dick Morris Award (formerly the Von Hoffman Award) was for stunningly wrong cultural, political, and social predictions. Sullivan renamed this award in September 2012, saying that Von Hoffman was \\"someone who in many ways got the future right‚Äîat least righter than I did.\\" In February 2007, Sullivan moved his blog from Time to The Atlantic Monthly, where he had accepted an editorial post. His presence was estimated to have contributed as much as 30% of the subsequent traffic increase for The Atlantic's website. In 2009, The Daily Dish won the 2008 Weblog Award for Best Blog. Sullivan left The Atlantic to begin blogging at The Daily Beast in April 2011. In 2013, he announced that he was leaving The Daily Beast to launch The Dish as a stand-alone website, charging subscribers $20 a year. In a note posted on The Dish on 28 January 2015, Sullivan announced his decision to retire from blogging.Andrew Sullivan, blogger extraordinaire, decides that it‚Äôs time to stop dishing, The Washington Post, 28 January 2015 He posted his final blog entry on 6 February 2015. On 26 June 2015, he posted an additional piece in reaction to Obergefell v. Hodges, which legalized same-sex marriage in the United States. In July 2020, Sullivan stated that The Dish would be revived as a weekly feature which will include a column and podcast. Works ;As author * Virtually Normal: An Argument About Homosexuality (1995).

The story of the Ourang Medan has, to some degree, become a legend.  The Mystery of the SS Ourang Medan  One English reference to the ship and the incident is in May 1952 issue of the Proceedings of the Merchant Marine Council, published by the United States Coast Guard. An earlier English reference was published on October 10, 1948 in The Albany Times of Albany, N.Y. and references its original source as Elsevier's Weekly. and page 25 The word Ourang (also written Orang) is Malay or Indonesian for \\"man\\" or \\"person\\", whereas Medan is the largest city on the Indonesian island of Sumatra, giving an approximate translation of \\"Man from Medan\\". Accounts of the ship's accident have appeared in various books and magazines, mainly on Forteana. Their factual accuracy and even the ship's existence, however, are unconfirmed, and details of the vessel's construction and history, if any, remain unknown. Searches for any official registration or accident investigation recorded have proven unsuccessful. The story's first appearance was a series of three articles in the Dutch-Indonesian newspaper De locomotief: Samarangsch handels- en advertentie-blad (February 3, 1948, February 28, 1948, and March 13, 1948). The story is mostly the same as the later versions, but with significant differences. The name of the ship that found the Ourang Medan is never mentioned, but the location of the encounter is described as southeast of the Marshall Islands. The second and third articles describe the experiences of the sole survivor of the Ourang Medan crew, who was found by an Italian missionary and natives on Taongi Atoll in the Marshall Islands. The man, before perishing, tells the missionary that the ship was carrying a badly stowed cargo of sulphuric acid, and that most of the crew perished because of the poisonous fumes escaping from broken containers. According to the story, the Ourang Medan was sailing from an unnamed small Chinese port to Costa Rica, and deliberately avoided the authorities. The survivor, an unnamed German, died after telling his story to the missionary, who told the story to the author, Silvio Scherli of Trieste, Italy. The Dutch newspaper concludes with a disclaimer: > \\"This is the last part of our story about the mystery of the Ourang Medan. > We must repeat that we don't have any other data on this 'mystery of the > sea'. Nor can we answer the many unanswered questions in the story. It may > seem obvious that this is a thrilling romance of the sea. On the other hand, > the author, Silvio Scherli, assures us of the authenticity of the story.\\" Silvio Scherli is said to have produced a report on Trieste \\"Export Trade\\" on September 28, 1959.Readings in policy and practice for international business, Edwin F. Wigglesworth, T. Ashwell, 1959 New evidence found by The Skittish Library shows there were 1940 newspaper reports of the incident taken from the Associated Press in British newspapers the Daily Mirror and the Yorkshire Evening Post. Again, there were differences in the story. The location being the Solomon Islands, and the SOS messages different from later reports. The story still appears to originate with Silvio Scherzi in Trieste.  Circumstances  According to the story, at some point of time in or around June 1947 (Gaddis and others list the approximate date as early February 1948), two American vessels navigating the Straits of Malacca, the City of Baltimore and the Silver Star, among others passing by, picked up several distress messages from the nearby Dutch merchant ship Ourang Medan. A radio operator aboard the troubled vessel sent the following message in Morse code: \\"S.O.S. from Ourang Medan  We float. All officers including the captain, dead in chartroom and on the bridge. Probably whole of crew dead .\\" A few confused dots and dashes (of Morse code) later, two words came through clearly. They were \\"I die.\\" Then, after that chilling message, there was nothing more heard of. When the Silver Star crew eventually located and boarded the apparently-undamaged Ourang Medan in an attempt at a rescue, the ship was found littered with corpses (including the carcass of a dog) everywhere, with the dead bodies found sprawled on their backs, the frozen (and allegedly badly-frightened) faces of the deceased upturned to the sun above with mouths gaping open and eyes staring straight ahead, with the corpses resembling horrible caricatures. No survivors were located and no visible signs of injuries on the dead bodies were observed. Just as the ship was to be prepared for a tow by the Silver Star to a nearby port, a fire then suddenly broke out in the ship's No. 4 cargo-hold, forcing the boarding party to hastily evacuate the doomed Dutch freighter, thus preventing any further investigations to be carried out. Soon after, the Ourang Medan was witnessed exploding before finally sinking.  Theories  = Unsecured hazardous materials cargo = Bainton and others hypothesize that Ourang Medan might have been involved in smuggling operations of chemical substances such as a combination of potassium cyanide and nitroglycerin or even wartime stocks of nerve agents. According to these theories, sea water would have entered the ship's hold, reacting with the cargo to release toxic gases, which then caused the crew to succumb to asphyxia and/or poisoning. Later, the sea water would have reacted with the nitroglycerin, causing the reported fire and explosion. Another theory is that the ship was transporting nerve gas which the Japanese military had been storing in China during the war, and which was handed over to the U.S. military at the end of the war. No U.S. ship could transport it as it would leave a paper trail. It was therefore loaded onto a non-registered ship for transport to the U.S. or an island in the Pacific. = Carbon monoxide (CO) poisoning = Gaddis puts forward the theory that an undetected smouldering fire or malfunction in the ship's boiler system might have been responsible for the shipwreck. Escaping carbon monoxide would have caused the deaths of all aboard, with the fire slowly spreading out of control, leading to the vessel's ultimate destruction.  The Ourang and the C.I.A. Public interest in the story of the Ourang Medan is reflected in correspondence sent to the U.S. Central Intelligence Agency (C.I.A.). In December 1959, C.H. Marck Jr. of Scottsdale, Arizona sent a private letter to Director of the C.I.A. Allen Dulles. Within the letter, Marck first asks the recipient of the letter if they believe the story of the Ourang deals with ‚Äúsomething from the unknown‚Äù then retells the story of the Ourang and its sinking. The letter was released to the public May 5, 2003. The person to whom Marck wrote remains redacted by the C.I.A.https://www.cia.gov/library/readingroom/document/cia- rdp80r01731r000300010043-5 But in the letter, Marck references an earlier writing he sent on May 29, 1958. It was answered briefly \\"on behalf of Mr. Dulles\\" by the \\"Assistant to the Director,\\" who takes a dismissive tone. This response, released May 7, 2002, establishes the C.I.A. as the recipient.https://www.cia.gov/library/readingroom/document/cia- rdp80b01676r003800130059-5  Skepticism  Several authors note their inability to find any mention of the case in Lloyd's Shipping Register. Furthermore, no registration records for a ship by the name of Ourang Medan could be located in various countries, including the Netherlands. While author Roy Bainton states that the identity of the Silver Star, reported to have been involved in the failed rescue attempt, has been established with high probability, the complete lack of information on the sunken ship itself has given rise to suspicion about the origins and credibility of the account. Ships logs for the Silver Star did not show a record of any such rescue attempt. Bainton and others have put forward the possibility that accounts of, among others, the date, location, names of the ships involved, and circumstances of the accident might have been inaccurate or exaggerated, or that the story might be completely fictitious. One British researcher has found the story of the Ourang Medan, transposed to the Solomon Islands, but also with a Trieste connection, in two British newspapers in 1940 (The Yorkshire Evening Post for 21 November 1940 and The Daily Mirror for 22 November 1940), both quoting AP (The Associated Press) news agency.

The first Packard automobiles were produced in 1899, and the last Detroit- built Packard in 1956, when they built the Packard Predictor, their last concept car. Packard bought Studebaker in 1953 and formed the Studebaker- Packard Corporation of South Bend, Indiana. The 1957 and 1958 Packards were actually badge engineered Studebakers, built in South Bend. History =1899‚Äì1905= Packard was founded by James Ward Packard, his brother William and their partner, George Lewis Weiss, in the city of Warren, Ohio, where 400 Packard automobiles were built at their factory on Dana Street Northeast, from 1899 to 1903. A mechanical engineer, James Packard believed they could build a better horseless carriage than the Winton cars owned by Weiss, an important Winton stockholder, after Packard complained to Alexander Winton and offered suggestions for improvement, which were ignored. Packard's first car was built in Warren, Ohio, on November 6, 1899. Henry Bourne Joy, a member of one of Detroit's oldest and wealthiest families, bought a Packard. Impressed by its reliability, he visited the Packards and soon enlisted a group of investors‚Äîincluding Truman Handy Newberry and Russell A. Alger Jr. On October 2, 1902, this group refinanced and renamed the New York and Ohio Automobile Company as the Packard Motor Car Company, with James Packard as president. Alger later served as vice president. Packard moved operations to Detroit soon after, and Joy became general manager (and later chairman of the board). An original Packard, reputedly the first manufactured, was donated by a grateful James Packard to his alma mater, Lehigh University, and is preserved there in the Packard Laboratory.Packard's 100th Anniversary on Lehigh University website Another is on display at the Packard Museum in Warren, Ohio. In the beginning, all Packards had a single-cylinder engine until 1903. Packard vehicles featured innovations, including the modern steering wheel and, years later, the first production 12-cylinder engine, adapted from developing the Liberty L-12, and air-conditioning in a passenger car. Packard produced its \\"Twin Six\\" model series of 12-cylinder cars from 1915 to 1923.Note the listing at for \\"Packard.\\" See also the database for the Aftermarket Catalog Exchange Standard for the replacement car parts industry at While the Black Motor Company's Black went as low as $375,Clymer, p. 61.

Packard concentrated on cars with prices starting at $2,600. The marque developed a following among wealthy purchasers both in the United States and abroad, competing with European marques like Rolls-Royce and Mercedes Benz. The Packard plant on East Grand Boulevard in Detroit was located on over of land. Designed by Albert Kahn Associates, it included an early use of reinforced concrete for an automotive factory when building #10 opened in early 1906. Its skilled craftsmen practiced over 80 trades. The dilapidated plant still stands, despite repeated fires. The factory is in close proximity to the current General Motors Detroit/Hamtramck Assembly, which was the former site of the Dodge Vehicle factory from 1910 until 1980.

The company was commonly referred to as being one of the \\"Three Ps\\" of American motordom royalty, along with Pierce-Arrow of Buffalo, New York, and Peerless of Cleveland, Ohio. For most of its history, Packard was guided by its President and General Manager James Alvan Macauley, who also served as President of the National Automobile Manufacturers Association. Inducted into the Automobile Hall of Fame, Macauley made Packard the number one designer and producer of luxury automobiles in the United States. The marque was also highly competitive abroad, with markets in 61 countries. Gross income for the company was $21,889,000 in 1928. Macauley was also responsible for the iconic Packard slogan, \\"Ask the Man Who Owns One\\". In the 1920s, Packard exported more cars than any other in its price class, and in 1930, sold almost twice as many abroad as any other marque priced over $2000.Old Car Advertising .

Retrieved 16 September 2013. For one year only, 1932, Packard fielded an upper-medium-priced car, the Light Eight, at a base price of $1,750, or $735 less than the standard Eight. 1931 Ninth Series model 840 Rivals Cadillac and Lincoln benefited from the huge support structure of GM and Ford. Packard could not match the two automotive giants for resources, however the 1920s had proven extremely profitable for the company and it had assets of approximately $20 million in 1932 while many luxury car manufacturers were almost broke. Peerless ceased production in 1932, changing the Cleveland manufacturing plant from producing cars to brewing beer for Carling Black Label Beer. By 1938, Franklin, Marmon, Ruxton, Stearns-Knight, Stutz, Duesenberg, and Pierce-Arrow had all closed. A 1932 Ninth Series De Luxe Eight model 904 sedan-limousine Packard also had one other advantage that some other luxury automakers did not: a single production line. By maintaining a single line and interchangeability between models, Packard was able to keep its costs down. Packard did not change cars as often as other manufacturers did at the time. Rather than introducing new models annually, Packard began using its own \\"Series\\" formula for differentiating its model changeovers in 1923. New model series did not debut on a strictly annual basis, with some series lasting nearly two years, and others lasting as short a time as seven months. In the long run, though, Packard averaged around one new series per year. By 1930, Packard automobiles were considered part of its Seventh Series. By 1942, Packard was in its Twentieth Series. The \\"Thirteenth Series\\" was omitted. 1934 Eleventh Series Eight model 1101 convertible sedan To address the Depression, Packard started producing more affordable cars in the medium price range. This was a necessary step as the demand for hand-built luxury cars had diminished sharply and even people who could afford such vehicles were reluctant to be seen in them at a time when unemployment was higher than 20%. In 1935, the company introduced its first car under $1000, the 120. Sales more than tripled that year and doubled again in 1936. To produce the 120, Packard built and equipped an entirely separate factory. By 1936, Packard's labor force was divided nearly evenly between the high-priced \\"Senior\\" lines (Twelve, Super Eight, and Eight) and the medium-priced \\"Junior\\" models, although more than 10 times more Juniors were produced than Seniors. This was because the 120 models were built using thoroughly modern mass production techniques, while the senior Packards used a great deal more hand labor and traditional craftsmanship. Although Packard almost certainly could not have survived the Depression without the highly successful Junior models,Langworth, pp. 70-71 they did have the effect of diminishing the Senior models' exclusive image among those few who could still afford an expensive luxury car. The 120 models were more modern in basic design than the Senior models; for example, the 1935 Packard 120 featured independent front suspension and hydraulic brakes, features that would not appear on the Senior Packards until 1937. During this time, Packards were built in Windsor, Ontario by the Packard Motor Company of Canada Ltd. Production started in 1931, with the best year being 1937, with just over 2,500 cars built. Parts manufactured in Canada included tires, upholstery, radiator cores, headlamps, springs, wheels, while the engines were locally assembled. Production ended in 1939, although the company maintained an office in Windsor for many years. =1937‚Äì1941= 1939 (17th series) Twelve Packard was still the premier luxury automobile, even though the majority of cars being built were the 120 and Super Eight model ranges. Hoping to catch still more of the market, Packard decided to issue the Packard 115C in 1937, which was powered by Packard's first six-cylinder engine since the Fifth Series cars in 1928. The decision to introduce the \\"Packard Six\\", priced at around $1200,Old Car Advertising Old Car Advertising Old Car Advertising Retrieved 5 October 2013 was in time for the 1938 recession. This model also tagged Packards as something less exclusive than they had been in the public's mind and in the long run hurt Packard's reputation of building some of America's finest luxury cars. The Six, redesignated 110 in 1940‚Äì41, continued for three years after the war. In 1939, Packard introduced Econo-Drive, a kind of overdrive, claimed able to reduce engine speed 27.8%; it could be engaged at any speed over .Old Car Advertising Retrieved 5 October 2013 The same year, the company introduced a fifth, transverse shock absorber and made column shift (known as Handishift) available on the 120 and Six.Old Car Advertising Retrieved 5 October 2013 Restored by Ken Kercheval for Arthur Astor's collection A new body shape was introduced for the 1941 the Packard Clipper.

During World War II, Packard again built airplane engines, licensing the Merlin engine from Rolls-Royce as the V-1650, which powered the famous P-51 Mustang fighter, ironically known as the \\"Cadillac of the Skies\\" by GIs in WWII.Herman, Arthur.

Packard also built 1350-, 1400-, and 1500-hp V-12 marine engines for American PT boats (each boat used three) and some of Britain's patrol boats. Packard ranked 18th among United States corporations in the value of wartime production contracts. By the end of the war in Europe, Packard Motor Car Company had produced over 55,000 combat engines. Sales in 1944 were $455,118,600. By May 6, 1945, Packard had a backlog on war orders of $568,000,000. =1946‚Äì1956= Packard dealer in New York State, ca. 1950‚Äì1955 By the end of World War II, Packard was in excellent financial condition with assets of around $33 million, but several management mistakes became ever more visible as time went on. Like other US automobile companies, Packard resumed civilian car production in late 1945, labelling them as 1946 models by modestly updating their 1942 models. As only tooling for the Clipper was at hand, the Senior-series cars were not rescheduled. One version of the story is that the Senior dies were left out in the elements to rust and were no longer usable. Another long-rumored tale is that Roosevelt gave Stalin the dies to the Senior series, but the ZiS-110 state limousines were a separate design. 1949 Packard convertible coup√© 1950 Packard Eight Club Sedan The Clipper became outdated as the new envelope bodies started appearing, led by Studebaker and Kaiser-Frazer. Had they been a European car maker, this would have meant nothing; they could have continued to offer the classic shape not so different from the later Rolls-Royce with its vertical grill. Although Packard was in solid financial shape as the war ended, they had not sold enough cars to pay the cost of tooling for the 1941 design. While most automakers were able to come out with new vehicles for 1948‚Äì49, Packard could not until 1951. They therefore updated by adding sheet metal to the existing body (which added of curb weight). Six-cylinder cars were dropped for the home market, and a convertible was added. These new designs hid their relationship to the Clipper. Even that name was dropped‚Äîfor a while. The design chosen was a \\"bathtub\\" type. While this was considered futuristic during the war and the concept was taken further with the 1949 Nash‚Äîand survived for decades in the Saab 92-96 in Europe‚Äîthe 1948‚Äì1950 Packard styling was polarizing. To some it was sleek and blended classic with modern; others nicknamed it the \\"pregnant elephant\\". Test driver for Modern Mechanix, Tom McCahill, referred to the newly designed Packard as \\"a goat\\" and \\"a dowager in a Queen Mary hat\\". Packard sold 92,000 vehicles for 1948 and 116,000 of the 1949 models, however in the early post-WWII years, the demand for new cars was extremely high and nearly any vehicle would sell. Attempting to maintain strong sales beyond this point would prove far more problematic. Cadillac's new 1948 cars had sleek, aircraft-inspired styling that immediately made Packard's \\"bathtub\\" styling seem old-fashioned. Moreover, Cadillac also debuted a brand-new OHV V8 engine in 1949 which gave their cars a reputation for performance that Packard's dependable, but aging inline eight engine couldn't match. The lack of a modern powerplant would prove an increasing liability for Packard as the 1950s unfolded. 1950 Packard Eight four-door sedan Packard outsold Cadillac until about 1950; most sales were the midrange volume models. During this time, Cadillac was among the earliest U.S. makers to offer an automatic transmission (the Hydramatic in 1941), but Packard caught up with the Ultramatic, offered on top models in 1949 and all models from 1950 onward. Designed and built by Packard, the Ultramatic featured a lockup torque converter with two speeds. Early Ultramatics normally operated only in \\"high\\", with \\"low\\" having to be selected manually. Beginning in late 1954, it could be set to operate only in \\"high\\" or to start in \\"low\\" and automatically shift into \\"high\\". \\"High\\" was intended for normal driving and \\"Low\\" mainly for navigating hills. The Ultramatic made Packard the only American automotive manufacturer other than GM to develop an automatic transmission completely in-house, as even Ford had chosen to outsource the design of theirs to Borg-Warner (Ford had initially attempted to purchase Ultramatics from Packard to install in Lincolns, but ended up buying Hydramatics until Lincoln got its own automatic transmission a few years later). However, Ultramatic did not compare to GM's Hydramatic for smoothness of shifting, acceleration, or reliability. The resources spent on Ultramatic deprived Packard of the chance to develop a badly needed modern V8 engine. Also, when a new body style was added in addition to standard sedans, coupes, and convertibles, Packard introduced a station wagon instead of a two- door hardtop in response to Cadillac's Coupe DeVille. The Station Sedan, a wagon-like body that was mostly steel, with good deal of decorative wood in the back; only 3864 were sold over its three years of production. Although the Packards of the late 1940s and early 1950s were built in its old tradition with craftsmanship and the best materials, all was not well. The combination of the lower priced Packards leading sales and impacting the prestige of their higher end brethren and some questionable marketing decisions, Packard's crown as \\"king\\" of the luxury car market was at risk ‚Äî and it would eventually be stolen by a rising Cadillac. In 1950, sales dropped to 42,000 cars for the model year. When Packard's president George T. Christopher set course for an evolutionary styling approach with a facelift for 1951, others wanted a radical new design. In the end, Christopher resigned and Packard treasurer Hugh Ferry became president - he demanded a new direction. Ferry, who had spent his career at Packard in the accounting department, did not want the job and quickly made it clear that he was serving on a temporary basis until a permanent company president could be found. 1951 Packard 300 The 1951 Packards were completely redesigned. Designer John Reinhart introduced a high-waisted, more squared-off profile fitting the contemporary styling trends ‚Äî very different from the traditional flowing design of the immediate postwar era. New styling features included a one-piece windshield, a wrap-around rear window, small tailfins on the long-wheelbase models, a full-width grill (replacing the traditional Packard upright design), and blunt \\"guideline fenders\\" with the hood and front fenders at the same height. The wheelbase supported low-end 200-series standard and Deluxe two- and four-doors, and 250-series Mayfair hardtop coupes (Packard's first), and convertibles. Upmarket 300 and Patrician 400 models rode a wheelbase. The 200-series models were again low-end models and now included a business coupe. The 250, 300, and 400/Patricians were Packard's flagship models and comprised the majority of production for that year. The Patrician was now the top-shelf Packard, replacing the Custom Eight line. Original plans were to equip it with a engine, but the company decided that sales would probably not be high enough to justify producing the larger, more expensive power plant, and so the debored (previously the middle engine) was used instead. While the smaller powerplant offered nearly equal performance in the new Packards to that of the 356, the move was seen by some as further denigrating Packard's image as a luxury car. Since 1951 was a quiet year with little new from the other auto manufacturers, Packard's redesigned lineup sold nearly 101,000 cars. The 1951 Packards were a quirky mixture of the modern (the automatic transmissions) and aging (still using flathead inline eights when OHV V8 engines were rapidly becoming the norm). No domestic car lines had OHV V8s in 1948, but by 1955, every car line offered a version. The Packard inline eight, despite being an older design that lacked the power of Cadillac's engines, was very smooth. When combined with an Ultramatic transmission, the drivetrain made for a nearly quiet and smooth experience on the road. However, it struggled to keep pace with the horsepower race, which was increasingly moving to high compression, short stroke engines capable of sustained driving at speeds greater than 55 MPH. Packard's image was increasingly seen as dowdy and old- fashioned, unappealing to younger customers. Surveys found that nearly 75% of Packard customers were repeats who had owned previous Packards and few new buyers were being attracted to the make. Compounding this problem was the company's geriatric leadership. The Packard board of directors by the early 1950s had an average age of 67 and younger executives with a fresher approach to running the company were badly needed--in 1948, Alvin Macauley, born during the Grant Administration, had stepped down as chairman. Hugh Ferry therefore decided that there was no choice but to hire an outsider to take over as president. To that end, he recruited James Nance from appliance manufacturer Hotpoint. At 52, Nance was more than a decade younger than the youngest Packard executive. One of the main reasons for the aged leadership of Packard was the company's lack of a pension plan for executives (the rank-and-file workers had a pension plan per their UAW contract). As a result, Packard executives were reluctant to retire and be left with no source of income other than a Social Security payment, thus blocking younger men from coming to power in the company. One of James Nance's first actions as president was creating a pension plan to induce Packard executives to retire. Nance worked to snag Korean War military contracts and turn around Packard's badly diluted image. He declared that from now on, Packard would cease producing midpriced cars and build only luxury models to compete with Cadillac. As part of this strategy, Nance unveiled a low-production (only 750 made) glamor model for 1953, the Caribbean convertible. Competing directly with the other novelty ragtops of that year (Buick Skylark, Oldsmobile Fiesta, and Cadillac Eldorado), it was equally well received, and outsold its competition. However, overall sales declined in 1953. While the limited edition luxury models as the Caribbean convertible and the Patrician 400 Sedan, and the Derham custom formal sedan brought back some of the lost prestige from better days, the \\"high pocket\\" styling that had looked new two years earlier was no longer bringing people into the showrooms for the bread and butter Packards. Packard's build quality, which had once been second-to-none, also began slipping during this period as employee morale decreased. 1953 Packard Caribbean convertible While American independent manufacturers like Packard did well during the early postwar period, supply had caught up with demand and by the early 1950s they were increasingly challenged as the \\"Big Three\\"‚ÄîGeneral Motors, Ford, and Chrysler‚Äîbattled intensely for sales in the economy, medium-priced, and luxury markets. Those independents that remained alive in the early '50s, merged. In 1953, Kaiser merged with Willys to become Kaiser-Willys. Nash and Hudson became American Motors Corporation (AMC). The strategy for these mergers included cutting costs and strengthening their sales organizations to meet the intense competition from the Big Three. In 1953‚Äì54, Ford and GM waged a brutal sales war, cutting prices and forcing cars on dealers. While this had little effect on either company, it gravely damaged the independent automakers. Nash president George W. Mason thus proposed that the four major independents (Nash, Hudson, Packard, and Studebaker) all merge into one large outfit to be named American Motors Corporation (AMC). Mason held informal discussions with Nance to outline his strategic vision, and an agreement was reached for AMC to buy Packard's Ultramatic transmissions and V8 engines. They were used in 1955 Hudsons and Nashes. Although Korean War defense contracts brought in badly- needed revenue, the war ended in 1953 and new Secretary of Defense Charles E. Wilson began cutting off defense contracts from all automotive manufacturers other than GM, which he had formerly been president of. Chrysler and Ford during the early 1950s also waged a campaign of \\"stealing\\" Packard dealerships, consequently Packard's dealer network became steadily smaller and more scattered. Packard's last major development was the Bill Allison‚Äìinvented Torsion-Level suspension, an electronically controlled four-wheel torsion-bar suspension that balanced the car's height front to rear and side to side, having electric motors to compensate each spring independently. Contemporary American competitors had serious difficulties with this suspension concept, trying to accomplish the same with air-bag springs before dropping the idea. Studebaker-Packard Corporation As of October 1, 1954 Packard Motor Car Company bought the failing Studebaker Corporation to form America's fourth largest automobile company but without full knowledge of their circumstances or consideration of the financial implications.Patrick R Foster. Studebaker, Minneapolis, Motorbooks, 2008 However, SPC's Nance refused to consider merging with AMC unless he could take the top command position (Mason and Nance were former competitors as heads of the Kelvinator and Hotpoint appliance companies, respectively), but Mason's grand vision of a Big Four American auto industry ended on October 8, 1954 with his sudden death from acute pancreatitis and pneumonia. A week after the death of Mason, the new president of AMC, George W. Romney, announced \\"there are no mergers under way either directly or indirectly\\". Nevertheless, Romney continued with Mason's commitment to buy components from SPC. Although Mason and Nance had previously agreed that SPC would purchase parts from AMC, it did not do so. Moreover, Packard's engines and transmissions were comparatively expensive, so AMC began development of its own V8 engine, and replaced the outsourced unit by mid-1956. Although Nash and Hudson merged along with Studebaker and Packard joining, The four-way merger Mason had hoped for, which would have joined Nash, Hudson, Studebaker and Packard, did not materialize. The S-P marriage (really a Packard buyout) proved to be a crippling mistake. Although Packard was still in fair financial shape, Studebaker was not, struggling with high overhead and production costs and needing the impossible figure of 250,000 cars a year to break even. Due diligence was placed behind \\"merger fever\\", and the deal was rushed. It became clear after the merger that Studebaker's deteriorating financial situation put Packard's survival at risk. Nance had hoped for a total redesign in 1954, but the necessary time and money were lacking. Packard that year (total production 89,796) comprised the bread-and- butter Clipper line (the 250 series was dropped), Mayfair hardtop coupes and convertibles, and a new entry level long-wheelbase sedan named Cavalier. Among the Clippers was a novelty pillared coupe, the Sportster, styled to resemble a hardtop. With time and money again lacking, 1954 styling was unchanged except for modified headlights and taillights, essentially trim items. A new hardtop named Pacific was added to the flagship Patrician series and all higher-end Packards sported a bored-out 359-cid engine. Air conditioning became available for the first time since 1942. Packard had introduced air conditioning in the 1930s. Clippers (which comprised over 80% of production) also got a hardtop model, Super Panama, but sales tanked, falling to only 31,000 cars. 1955 Packard Patrician The revolutionary new model Nance hoped for was delayed until 1955, partially because of Packard's merger with Studebaker. Packard stylist Dick Teague was called upon by Nance to design the 1955 line, and to Teague's credit, the 1955 Packard was indeed a sensation when it appeared. Not only was the body completely updated and modernized, but the suspension also was totally new, with torsion bars front and rear, along with an electric control that kept the car level regardless of load or road conditions. Crowning this stunning new design was Packard's brand new ultra-modern overhead-valve V8, displacing , replacing the old, heavy, cast-iron side-valve straight-eight that had been used for decades. In addition, Packard offered a variety of power, comfort, and convenience features, such as power steering and brakes as well as electric window lifts. But air conditioning was an anomaly. Although available on all makes by the mid-1950s, it was installed on only a handful of cars in 1955 and 1956 despite Packard's status as a luxury car. Model year sales only climbed back to 55,000 units in 1955, including Clipper, in what was a very strong year across the industry. As the 1955 models went into production, an old problem flared up. Back in 1941, Packard had outsourced its bodies to Briggs Manufacturing Company. Briggs founder Walter Briggs had died in early 1952 and his family decided to sell the company off to pay for estate taxes. Chrysler promptly purchased Briggs and notified Packard that they would cease supplying bodies after Packard's contract with Briggs expired at the end of 1953. Packard was forced to move body production to an undersized plant on Connor Avenue in Detroit. The facility proved too small and caused endless tie-ups and quality problems. Bad quality control hurt the company's image and caused sales to plummet for 1956, though the problems had largely been resolved by that point. Additionally, a \\"brain drain\\" of talent away from Packard was underway, most notably John Z. DeLorean. alt= For 1956, the Clipper became a separate make, with Clipper Custom and Deluxe models available. Now the Packard-Clipper business model was a mirror to Lincoln-Mercury. \\"Senior\\" Packards were built in four body styles, each with a unique model name. Patrician was used for the four-door top of the line sedans, Four Hundred for the hardtop coupes, and Caribbean for the convertible and vinyl-roof two-door hardtop. In the spring of 1956, the Executive was introduced. Coming in a four-door sedan and a two-door hardtop, the Executive was aimed at the buyer who wanted a luxury car but could not justify Packard's pricing. It was an intermediate model using the Packard name and the Senior models' front end, but using the Clipper platform and rear fenders. This was to some confusing and went against what James Nance had been attempting for several years to accomplish, the separation of the Clipper line from Packard. However, as late as the cars' introduction to the market, was there was reasoning for in 1957 this car was to be continued. It then became a baseline Packard on the all-new 1957 Senior shell. Clippers would share bodies with Studebaker from 1957. Despite the new 1955/56 design, Cadillac continued to lead the luxury market, followed by Lincoln, Packard, and Imperial. Reliability problems with the automatic transmission and all electrical accessories further eroded the public's opinion of Packard. Sales were good for 1955 compared to 1954. The year was also an industry banner year. Packard's sales slid in 1956 due to the fit and finish of the 1955 models, and mechanical issues relating to the new engineering features. These defects cost Packard millions in recalls and tarnished a newly won image just in its infancy. Packard's push-button Ultramatic transmission control pod For 1956, Teague kept the basic 1955 design, and added more styling touches to the body such as then‚àífashionable three toning. Headlamps hooded in a more radical style in the front fenders and a slight shuffling of chrome distinguished the 1956 models. \\"Electronic Push-button Ultramatic\\", which located transmission push buttons on a stalk on the steering column, proved trouble-prone, adding to the car's negative reputation, possibly soon to become an orphan. Model series remained the same, but the V8 was now enlarged to for Senior series, the largest in the industry. In the top-of-the-line Caribbean, that engine produced . Clippers continued to use the 352 engine. There were plans for an all‚àínew 1957 line of Senior Packards based on the showcar Predictor. Clippers and Studebakers would also share many inner and outer body panels. (A private presentation of this 1957 new-car program was made to Wall Street's investment bankers at the Waldorf-Astoria Hotel in New York in January 1956.) These models were in many ways far advanced from what would be produced by any automaker other at the time, save Chrysler, which would soon feel public wrath for its own poor quality issues after rushing its all‚àínew 1957 lines into production. Nance was dismissed and moved to Ford as the head of the new Mercury-Edsel-Lincoln division. Although Nance tried everything, the company failed to secure funding for new retooling, forcing Packard to share Studebaker platforms and body designs. With no funding to retool for the advanced new models envisioned, SPC's fate was sealed; the large Packard was effectively dead in an executive decision to kill \\"the car we could not afford to lose\\". The last fully Packard-designed vehicle, a Patrician four-door sedan, rolled off the Conner Avenue assembly line on June 25, 1956. =1957‚Äì1958= 1958 Packard In 1957, no more Packards were built in Detroit and the Clipper disappeared as a separate brand name. Instead, a Studebaker President‚Äìbased car bearing the Packard Clipper nameplate appeared on the market, but sales were slow. Available in just two body styles, Town Sedan (four-door sedan) and Country Sedan (four-door station wagon), they were powered by Studebaker's V8 with a McCulloch supercharger, delivering the same as the 1956 Clipper Custom, although at higher revolutions. Borrowing design cues from the 1956 Clipper (visual in the grille and dash), with wheel covers, tail lamps, and dials from 1956 along with the Packard cormorant hood mascot and trunk chrome trim from 1955 senior Packards, the 1957 Packard Clipper was more than a badge-engineered Studebaker‚Äîbut also far from a Patrician. Had the company been able to invest more money to finish the transformation and position the car under a senior line of \\"true Packards\\", it might have been a successful Clipper. However, standing alone the cars sold in very limited numbers‚Äîand a number of Packard dealers dropped their franchises while customers stayed away, despite huge price discounts, fearful of buying a car that could soon be an orphaned make. With the market flooded by inexpensive cars, minor automakers struggled to sell vehicles at loss leader prices to keep up with Ford and GM. Also, a general decline in demand for large cars heralded an industry switch to compact cars such as the Studebaker Lark. Predictably, many Packard devotees were disappointed by the marque's perceived further loss of exclusivity and what they perceived as a reduction in quality. They joined competitors and media critics in christening the new models as \\"Packardbakers\\". The 1958 models were launched with no series name, simply as \\"Packard\\". New body styles were introduced, a two-door hardtop joined the four-door sedan. A new premier model appeared with a sporting profile: the Packard Hawk was based on the Studebaker Golden Hawk and featured a new nose and a fake spare wheel molded in the trunk lid reminiscent of the concurrent Imperial. The 1958 Packards were amongst the first in the industry to be \\"facelifted\\" with plastic parts. The housing for the new dual headlights and the complete fins were fiberglass parts grafted on Studebaker bodies. Very little chrome was on the lower front clip. Designer Duncan McRae managed to include the 1956 Clipper tail lights for one last time, this time in a fin, and under a canted fin, a wild‚Äîor to some bizarre‚Äîmixture. Added to the front of all but the Hawk were tacked on pods for dual headlights, in a desperate attempt to keep up with late-1950s styling cues. All Packards were given wheels to lower the profile. The public reaction was predictable and sales were almost nonexistent. The Studebaker factory was older than Packard's Detroit plant, with higher production requirements, which added to dipping sales. A new compact car on which the company staked its survival, the Lark, was a year away, and failed to sell in sufficient numbers to keep the marque afloat. Several makes were discontinued around this time: Packard, Edsel, Hudson, Nash, DeSoto, and Kaiser. Not since the 1930s had so many makes disappeared, and it wouldn't be until the automotive industry crisis of 2008‚Äì10 that so many makes would be dropped at the same time again. =Concept Packards= 1956 Predictor concept, at the Studebaker National Museum During the 1950s, a number of \\"dream cars\\" were built by Packard in an attempt to keep the marque alive in the imaginations of the American car-buying public. Included in this category are the 1952 Pan American that led to the production Caribbean and the Panther (also known as Daytona), based on a 1954 platform. Shortly after the introduction of the Caribbean, Packard showed a prototype hardtop called the Balboa. It featured a reverse-slanted rear window that could be lowered for ventilation, a feature introduced in a production car by Mercury in 1957 and still in production in 1966. The Request was based on the 1955 Four Hundred hardtop, but featured a classic upright Packard fluted grille reminiscent of the prewar models. In addition, the 1957 engineering mule \\"Black Bess\\" was built to test new features for a future car. This car had a resemblance to the 1958 Edsel. It featured Packard's return to a vertical grill. This grill was very narrow with the familiar ox-yoke shape that was characteristic for Packard, and with front fenders with dual headlights resembling Chrysler products from that era. The engineering mule Black Bess was destroyed by the company shortly after the Packard plant was shuttered. Of the 10 Requests built, only four were sold off the showroom floor. Dick Teague also designed the last Packard show car, the Predictor. This hardtop coupe's design followed the lines of the planned 1957 cars. It had many unusual features, among them a roof section that opened either by opening a door or activating a switch, well ahead of later T-tops. The car had seats that rotated out, allowing the passenger easy access, a feature later used on some Chrysler and GM products. The Predictor also had the opera windows, or portholes, found on concurrent Thunderbirds. Other novel ideas were overhead switches‚Äîthese were in the production Avanti‚Äîand a dash design that followed the hood profile, centering dials in the center console area. This feature has only recently been used on production cars. The Predictor survives and is on display at the Studebaker National Museum section of the Center for History in South Bend, Indiana. Astral One unusual prototype, the Studebaker-Packard Astral, was made in 1957 and first unveiled at the South Bend Art Centre on January 12, 1958, and then at the March 1958 Geneva Motor Show.Automobile Quarterly. Volume 31, no. 1, 1992, pages 14‚Äì29. It had a single gyroscopic balanced wheel and the publicity data suggested it could be nuclear powered or have what the designers described as an ionic engine. No working prototype was ever made, nor was it likely that one was ever intended.\\"Cruising the Misfits of Motordom\\", Chuck Squatriglia, Wired, 9 May 2009 The Astral was designed by Edward E. Herrmann, Studebaker-Packard's director of interior design, as a project to give his team experience in working with glass-reinforced plastic. It was put on show at various Studebaker dealerships before being put into storage. Rediscovered 30 years later, the car was restored and put on display by the Studebaker museum. = The end = Studebaker-Packard pulled the Packard nameplate from the marketplace in 1959. In 1962, \\"Packard\\" was dropped off the corporation's name at a time when it was introducing the all new Avanti, and a less anachronistic image was being sought, thus finishing the story of the American Packard marque. The Packard name (as well as Pierce-Arrow) had been considered for the Avanti, but this wasn't done. In the late 1950s, Studebaker-Packard was approached by enthusiasts to rebadge the French car maker Facel-Vega's Excellence four-door hardtop as a Packard for sale in North America, using stock Packard V8s and identifying trim including red hexagonal wheel covers, cormorant hood ornament, and classic vertical ox-yoke grille. The proposition was rejected when Daimler-Benz threatened to pull out of its 1957 marketing and distribution agreement, which would have cost Studebaker-Packard more in revenue than they could have made from the badge-engineered Packard. Daimler- Benz had little of its own dealer network at the time and used this agreement to enter and become more established in the American market through SPC's dealer network, and felt this car was a threat to their models. =Aborted revival= In the late 1990s, Roy Gullickson revived the Packard nameplate by buying the trademark and developing a Packard Twelve for the 1999 model year. His goal was annual production of 2,000 cars, but lack of investment funds stalled that plan indefinitely. The only prototype Twelve made was sold at an auto auction in Plymouth, MI, in July 2014 for $143,000. Packard engines =Automobile= Packard's engineering staff designed and built excellent, reliable engines. Packard offered a 12-cylinder engine‚Äîthe \\"Twin Six\\"‚Äîas well as a low-compression straight-eight, but never a 16-cylinder engine. After WWII, Packard continued with their successful straight-eight-cylinder flathead engines. While as fast as the new GM and Chrysler OHV V8s, they were perceived as obsolete by buyers. By waiting until 1955, Packard was almost the last U.S. automaker to introduce a high-compression V8 engine. The design was physically large and entirely conventional, copying many of the first-generation Cadillac, Buick, Oldsmobile, Pontiac, and Studebaker Kettering features. It was produced in and displacements. The Caribbean version had two four-barrel carburetors and produced . For 1956, a version was used in the Senior cars and the Caribbean two four-barrels produced . =Other Packard engines= Packard also made large aeronautical and marine engines. Chief engineer Jesse G. Vincent developed a V12 airplane engine called the \\"Liberty engine\\" that was used widely in Entente air corps during World War I. After the war the Liberty was adapted for marine use, becoming a multiple world record setter under inventor and boating pioneer Gar Wood from the late 1910s through the 1930s. In the interbellum, Packard built one of the world's first diesel aviation engines, the 225-hp DR-980 radial. It powered the Stinson SM-8D, among others. It also powered a Bellanca CH-300 on a record endurance flight of over 84 hours, a mark that stood for more than 50 years. Other Packard-powered airplanes set several records during the 1920s. During WWII, Packard license- built Rolls-Royce Merlin engines under the Packard V-1650 designation, used with great success in the famed P-51 Mustang fighter. A marine version of the successor to the V12 Liberty was adapted in three versions - M3-2500, M4-2500, and M5-2500 - to power the war's iconic PT boats. After WWII, Packard produced a new line of flathead design six (model 1M-245) and eight (model 1M-356) cylinder marine engines based on the automobile versions and the experience gained from the war production. Of the 1M-245 type engines, only 1,865 were produced between Spring 1947 and January 1951, with only a handful survivors. Of the 1M-356 type engines, approximately 1,525 were produced between 1947 and 1950. Even more rare is the experimental \\"R\\" type racing versions (1M-245 \\"R\\"), of which only 10 were produced with currently only one known survivor, a 1M-245 R six-cylinder engine powering today a 1936 Gar Wood Speedster. Packard also developed two turbine aircraft engines for the US Air Force, the XJ41 an XJ49. This was one reason for the Curtiss-Wright take-over in 1956: Packard wanted to sell their own jet.

Legacy America's Packard Museum and the Fort Lauderdale Antique Car MuseumFort Lauderdale Antique Car Museum - Cars hold collections of Packard automobiles. The electrical connectors developed by Packard were used extensively by General Motors in its automobiles. The first series of connectors was the Packard 56, followed by the Weather Pack, and finally the Metri Pack, which are still in common use today. A massive crushing of circa 50 vintage Packards happened in 1977 in southern California and was dubbed by the Special-Interest auto magazine as \\"Crushathon\\". Cars formerly property of a Packard collector were auctioned off after his death. Due to different disagreements in the terms of the auction between SoCal Packard fan clubs, roughly half of the cars auctioned off did not meet the listed price leading to the cars being ultimately destroyed, despite their purportedly good mechanical and rust-free condition.

Starting his career as a reporter, and radio and television host, he later became known for his eminent role in Quebec's nationalization of hydro, and as an ardent defender of Quebec sovereignty. He was the founder of the Parti Qu√©b√©cois, and before that, a Liberal minister in the Lesage government from 1960 to 1966 and the first Qu√©b√©cois political leader since Confederation to attempt, through a referendum, to negotiate the political independence of Quebec. Early life L√©vesque was born in the H√¥tel Dieu Hospital in Campbellton, New Brunswick on August 24, 1922. He was raised in New Carlisle, Quebec, on the Gasp√© Peninsula, by his parents, Diane (n√©e Dionne) and Dominic L√©vesque, a lawyer. He had three siblings, Andr√©, Fernand and Alice. His father died when L√©vesque was 14 years old.Rene L√©vesque dies from massive heart attack CBC.ca Retrieved 2016-08-12 Journalist During World War II with the U.S. Office of War Information L√©vesque attended the S√©minaire de Gasp√© and the Saint-Charles- Garnier College in Quebec City, both of which were run by the Jesuits. He studied for a law degree at Universit√© Laval in Quebec City, but left the university in 1943 without having completed the degree. He worked as an announcer and news writer at the radio station CHNC in New Carlisle, as a substitute announcer for CHRC during 1941 and 1942, and then at CBV in Quebec City. During 1944‚Äì1945, he served as a liaison officer and war correspondent for the U.S. Army in Europe. He reported from London while it was under regular bombardment by the Luftwaffe, and advanced with the Allied troops as they pushed back the German army through France and Germany. Throughout the war, he made regular journalistic reports on the airwaves and in print. He was with the first unit of Americans to reach Dachau concentration camp. In 1947, he married Louise L'Heureux, with whom he would have two sons and a daughter. L√©vesque worked as a reporter for the CBC's French language section in the international service. He again served as a war correspondent for the CBC in the Korean War in 1952. After that, he was offered a career in journalism in the United States, but decided to stay in Canada. From 1956 to 1959, L√©vesque became famous in Quebec for hosting a weekly television news program on Radio- Canada called Point de Mire. L√©vesque covered international events and major labour struggles between workers and corporations that dogged the Union Nationale government of Premier Maurice Duplessis culminating with a great strike in 1957 at the Gasp√© Copper Mine in Murdochville. The Murdochville strike was a milestone for organized labour in Quebec as it resulted in changes to the province's labour laws. While working for the public television network, he became personally involved in the broadcasters' strike that lasted 68 tumultuous days beginning in late 1958. L√©vesque was arrested during a demonstration in 1959, along with union leader Jean Marchand and 24 other demonstrators. Public figure L√©vesque interviews Lester B. Pearson in Moscow for Radio-Canada in 1955.In 1960, L√©vesque entered politics as a star candidate and was elected to the Legislative Assembly of Quebec in the 1960 election as a Liberal Party member in the riding of Montr√©al-Laurier. In the government of Jean Lesage, he served as minister of hydroelectric resources and public works from 1960 to 1961, and minister of natural resources from 1961 to 1965. While in office, he played a pivotal role in the nationalization of hydroelectric companies, greatly expanding Hydro-Qu√©bec, one of the reforms that was part of the Quiet Revolution. From 1965 to 1966, he served as minister of family and welfare. L√©vesque, with friend the minister of health, Eric Kierans, was heavily involved in negotiations with the Government of Canada to fund both Quebec and federal mandates for social programs. In a surprise, the Liberals lost the 1966 election to the Union Nationale but L√©vesque retained his own seat of Laurier. Believing that the Canadian federation was doomed to fail, L√©vesque began to openly champion separation from Canada as part of the Liberal platform at the upcoming party conference. Kierans, who had been elected party president, led the movement against the motion, with future premier Robert Bourassa attempting to mediate before siding with Kierans. The resolution was handily defeated, and L√©vesque walked out with his followers. =Founding of the Parti Qu√©b√©cois= After leaving the Liberal Party, he founded the Mouvement Souverainet√©-Association (MSA). In contrast to more militant nationalist movements, such as Pierre Bourgault's Rassemblement pour l'Ind√©pendance Nationale (RIN), the party eschewed direct action and protest and attempted instead to appeal to the broader electorate, whom L√©vesque would call \\"normal people\\". The main contention in the first party conference was the proposed policy toward Quebec's Anglophone minority; L√©vesque faced down heavy opposition to his insistence that English schools and language rights be protected. The election of hardline federalist Pierre Elliott Trudeau as prime minister, and the politically damaging riot instigated by the RIN when he appeared at the St. Jean Baptiste Day parade of 1968, led to the sovereignty movement coming together. The MSA would merge with another party in the Quebec sovereignty movement, the Ralliement National of Gilles Gr√©goire, to create the Parti Qu√©b√©cois (PQ) in 1968. At L√©vesque's insistence, RIN members would be permitted to join but not be accepted as a group. The Parti Qu√©b√©cois would gain 25% of the vote in the 1970 election, running on a platform of declaring independence if government was formed. The PQ only won six seats, and L√©vesque continued to run the party from Montreal by communicating with the caucus in Quebec City. The 1973 election saw a large Liberal victory, and created major tensions within the party, especially after L√©vesque was unable to gain a seat. A quarrel with House Leader Robert Burns almost ended L√©vesque's leadership shortly thereafter. =First term as premier= L√©vesque and his party won a landslide victory at the 1976 election, with L√©vesque finally re-entering the Assembly as the member for Taillon in downtown Longueuil. His party assumed power with 41.1 per cent of the popular vote and 71 seats out of 110, and even managed to unseat Bourassa in his own riding. L√©vesque became premier of Quebec ten days later. The night of L√©vesque's acceptance speech included one of his most famous quotations: \\"I never thought that I could be so proud to be Qu√©b√©cois.\\" On February 6, 1977, L√©vesque's car fatally struck Edgar Trottier, a homeless man who had been lying on the road. Trottier had in the past repeatedly used the maneuver to secure a hospital bed for the night. Police officers at the scene did not administer the breathalyzer test to L√©vesque, because they did not suspect that he was impaired.Stars and Stripes (Washington, D.C.), 23 February 1977, p.31. Levesque was later fined $25 for failing to wear his glasses while driving a car on the night in question.The Brandon Sun (Manitoba), 15 July 1977, p.3. The incident gained further notoriety when it was revealed that the female companion in the vehicle was not his wife, but his longtime secretary, Corinne C√¥t√©. L√©vesque‚Äôs marriage ended in divorce soon thereafter (the couple had already been estranged for some time), and in April 1979, he married C√¥t√©. L√©vesque's Act to govern the financing of political parties banned corporate donations and limited individual contributions to political parties to $3,000. This key legislation was meant to prevent wealthy citizens and organizations from having a disproportionate influence on the electoral process. A Referendum Act was passed to allow for a province-wide vote on issues presented in a referendum, giving a \\"yes\\" and \\"no\\" side equal funding and legal footing. His government's signature achievement was the Quebec Charter of the French Language (introduced in the legislature and still colloquially known as Bill 101), whose stated goal was to make French \\"the normal and everyday language of work, instruction, communication, commerce and business\\". In its first enactment, it reserved access to English-language public schools to children whose parents had attended English school in Quebec. All other children were required to attend French schools in order to encourage immigrants to integrate themselves into the majority francophone culture (L√©vesque was more moderate on language than some of the PQ, including the language minister, Camille Laurin. He would have resigned as leader rather than eliminate English-language public schools, as some party members proposed). Bill 101 also made it illegal for businesses to put up exterior commercial signs in a language other than French at a time when English dominated as a commercial and business language in Quebec. On May 20, 1980, the PQ held, as promised before the elections, the 1980 Quebec referendum on its sovereignty-association plan. The result of the vote was 40% in favour and 60% opposed (with 86% turnout). L√©vesque conceded defeat in the referendum by announcing that, as he had understood the verdict, he had been told \\"until next time\\". L√©vesque led the PQ to victory in the 1981 election, increasing the party's majority in the National Assembly and increasing its share of the popular vote from 41 to 49 per cent. =Second term= A major focus of his second mandate was the patriation of the Canadian constitution. L√©vesque was criticized by some in Quebec who said he had been tricked by Canadian Prime Minister Pierre Trudeau and the English-Canadian provincial premiers. To this day, no Quebec premier of any political side has endorsed the 1982 constitutional amendment. The PQ government's response to the recession of the early 1980s by cutting the provincial budget to reduce growing deficits that resulted from the recession angered labour union members, a core part of the constituency of the PQ and the sovereignty movement. L√©vesque had argued that the party should not make sovereignty the object of the 1985 election and instead opt for the \\"Beau risque\\" strategy of seeking an understanding with the federal government of Brian Mulroney, which angered the strongest supporters of sovereignty within the party. He said the issue in the upcoming election would not be sovereignty. Instead, he expressed hope, \\"that we can finally find government leaders in Ottawa who will discuss Quebec's demands seriously and work with us for the greater good of Quebecers\\". His new position weakened his position within the party. Some senior members resigned; there were by-election defeats. L√©vesque resigned as leader of the Parti Qu√©b√©cois on June 20, 1985, and as premier of Quebec on October 3, 1985. L√©vesque, a constant smoker,Graham Fraser, Ivon Owen.

Debts to Pay, pp.128‚Äì29. James Lorimer & Company, 2004, L√©vesque was made a grand officer of the French Legion of Honour. He was posthumously made a grand officer of the National Order of Quebec in 2008. =Legacy= Quebec Parliament Building Despite a perceived weakening of his sovereigntist resolve in the last years of his government, he reaffirmed his belief to friends and, notably, to a crowd of Universit√© Laval students months before his death, of the necessity of independence. His state funeral and funeral procession was reportedly attended by 100,000 Qu√©b√©cois. During the carrying out of his coffin from the church, the crowd spontaneously began to applaud and sing Quebec's unofficial national anthem \\"Gens du pays\\", replacing the first verse with Mon cher Ren√© (My dear Ren√©), as is the custom when this song is adapted to celebrate someone's birthday. Two major boulevards now bear his name, one in Montreal and one in Quebec City. In Montreal, the √âdifice Hydro-Qu√©bec and the Maison Radio-Canada are both located on Ren√© L√©vesque Boulevard, fittingly as L√©vesque once worked for Hydro-Qu√©bec and the CBC, respectively. On June 22, 2010, Hydro-Qu√©bec and the government of Quebec commemorated L√©vesque's role in Quebec's Quiet Revolution and his tenure as premier by renaming the 1244-megawatt Manic-3 generating station in his honour. On June 3, 1999, a monument in his honour was unveiled on boulevard Ren√©-L√©vesque outside the Parliament Building in Quebec City. The statue is popular with tourists, who snuggle up to it, to have their pictures taken \\"avec Ren√©\\" (with Ren√©), despite repeated attempts by officials to keep people from touching the monument or getting too close to it. The statue had been the source of an improvised, comical and affectionately touching tribute to L√©vesque. The fingers of his extended right hand are slightly parted, just enough so that tourists and the faithful could insert a cigarette, giving the statue an unusually realistic appearance. This practice is less often seen now, however, as the statue was moved to New Carlisle and replaced by a similar, but bigger one. This change resulted from considerable controversy. Some believed that the life-sized statue was not appropriate for conveying his importance in the history of Quebec. Others noted that a trademark of L√©vesque was his relatively small stature. L√©vesque today remains an important figure of the Quebec nationalist movement, and is considered sovereigntism's spiritual father. After his death, even people in disagreement with some of those convictions now generally recognize his importance to the history of Quebec. Many in Quebec regard him as the father of the modern Quebec nation. According to a study made in 2006 by Le Journal de Montr√©al and L√©ger Marketing, L√©vesque was considered by far, according to Qu√©b√©cois, the best premier to run the province over the last 50 years. Of the things he left as his legacy, some of the most memorable and still robust are completing the nationalization of hydroelectricity through Hydro-Qu√©bec, the Quebec Charter of the French Language, the political party financing law, and the Parti Qu√©b√©cois itself. His government was the first in Canada to prohibit discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation in the province's Charte des droits de la personne in 1977. He also continued the work of the Lesage government in improving social services, in which social needs were taken care of by the state, instead of the Catholic Church (as in the Duplessis era) or the individual. L√©vesque is still regarded by many as a symbol of democracy and tolerance. L√©vesque was notably portrayed in the television series Ren√© L√©vesque. In 2006, an additional television miniseries, Ren√© L√©vesque, was aired on the CBC. He was also portrayed in an episode of Kevin Spencer, a Canadian cartoon show. In it, his ghost attempted a camaraderie with Kevin because of their similarities in political beliefs, as well as the fact that the title character, like Ren√©'s ghost, claims to smoke \\"five packs a day\\". A song by Les Cowboys Fringants named \\"Lettre √† L√©vesque\\" on the album La Grand- Messe was dedicated to him. They also mention the street bearing his name in the song called \\"La Manifestation\\". He was the co-subject, along with Pierre Trudeau, of the Donald Brittain-directed documentary miniseries The Champions. Personality L√©vesque was a man capable of great tact and charm, but who could also be abrupt and choleric when defending beliefs, ideals, or morals essential to him, or when lack of respect was perceived, for example, when he was famously snubbed by Fran√ßois Mitterrand at their first meeting. He was also a proud Gasp√©sien (hailing from the Gasp√© Peninsula), and had hints of the local accent. Considered a major defender of the Qu√©b√©cois, L√©vesque was, before the 1960s, more interested in international affairs than Quebec matters. The popular image of L√©vesque was his ever-present cigarette and his small physical stature, as well as his unique comb over that earned him the nickname of Ti-Poil, literally, \\"Li'l Hair\\", but more accurately translated as \\"Baldy\\". L√©vesque was a passionate and emotional public speaker. Those close to L√©vesque have described him as having difficulty expressing his emotions in private, saying that he was more comfortable in front of a crowd of thousands than with one person. While many Quebec intellectuals are inspired by French philosophy and high culture, L√©vesque favoured the United States. While in London during the Second World War, his admiration for Britons grew when he witnessed their courage in the face of the German bombardments. He was a faithful reader of The New York Times, and took his vacations in New England every year. He also stated that, if there had to be one role model for him, it would be US President Franklin Delano Roosevelt. L√©vesque was disappointed with the cold response by the American economic elite to his first speech in New York City as Premier of Quebec, in which he compared Quebec's march towards sovereignty to the American Revolution. His first speech in France was, however, more successful, leading him to a better appreciation of the French intelligentsia and of French culture.

She was Consultant in Poetry to the Library of Congress from 1949 to 1950, the Pulitzer Prize winner for Poetry in 1956, the National Book Award winner in 1970, and the recipient of the Neustadt International Prize for Literature in 1976. Dwight Garner argued that she was perhaps ‚Äúthe most purely gifted poet of the 20th century.‚Äù Early life Elizabeth Bishop, an only child, was born in Worcester, Massachusetts, United States, to William Thomas and Gertrude May (Bulmer) Bishop. After her father, a successful builder, died when she was eight months old, Bishop's mother became mentally ill and was institutionalized in 1916. (Bishop would later write about the time of her mother's struggles in her short story \\"In The Village.\\")\\"Elizabeth Bishop, The Art of Poetry No. 27\\" Interview in Paris Review Summer 1981 No. 80 Effectively orphaned during her very early childhood, she lived with her maternal grandparents on a farm in Great Village, Nova Scotia, a period she also referred to in her writing. Bishop's mother remained in an asylum until her death in 1934, and the two were never reunited. Later in childhood, Bishop's paternal family gained custody. She was removed from the care of her grandparents and moved in with her father's wealthier family in Worcester, Massachusetts. However, Bishop was unhappy there, and her separation from her maternal grandparents made her lonely. While she was living in Worcester, she developed chronic asthma, from which she suffered for the rest of her life. Her time in Worcester is briefly chronicled in her poem \\"In The Waiting Room.\\" In 1918, her grandparents, realizing that Bishop was unhappy living with them, sent her to live with her mother's oldest sister, Maude Bulmer Shepherdson, and her husband George. The Bishops paid Maude to house and educate their granddaughter. The Shepherdsons lived in a tenement in an impoverished Revere, Massachusetts neighborhood populated mostly by Irish and Italian immigrants. The family later moved to better circumstances in Cliftondale, Massachusetts. It was Bishop's aunt who introduced her to the works of Victorian poets, including Alfred, Lord Tennyson, Thomas Carlyle, Robert Browning, and Elizabeth Barrett Browning. alt=Four women stand behind three seated women, all facing the camera. Bishop was very ill as a child and, as a result, received very little formal schooling until she attended Saugus High School for her freshman year. She was accepted to the Walnut Hill School in Natick, Massachusetts for her sophomore year but was behind on her vaccinations and not allowed to attend. Instead she spent the year at the North Shore Country Day School in Beverly, Massachusetts. Bishop then boarded at the Walnut Hill School, where she studied music. At the school her first poems were published by her friend Frani Blough in a student magazine. Then she entered Vassar College in Poughkeepsie, New York in the fall of 1929, shortly before the stock market crash, planning to be a composer. She gave up music because of a terror of performance and switched to English where she took courses including 16th and 17th century literature and the novel. Bishop published her work in her senior year in The Magazine (based in California). In 1933, she co-founded Con Spirito, a rebel literary magazine at Vassar, with writer Mary McCarthy (one year her senior), Margaret Miller, and the sisters Eunice and Eleanor Clark. Bishop graduated from Vassar with a bachelor's degree in 1934. Influences Elementary school in Great Village, Nova Scotia, where Bishop first attended school. Bishop was greatly influenced by the poet Marianne Moore,Kalstone, David. Becoming a Poet: Elizabeth Bishop with Marianne Moore and Robert Lowell. University of Michigan Press (2001): 4. In an early letter to Moore, Bishop wrote: \\"[W]hen I began to read your poetry at college I think it immediately opened up my eyes to the possibility of the subject-matter I could use and might never have thought of using if it hadn't been for you.‚Äî(I might not have written any poems at all, I suppose.) I think my approach is so much vaguer and less defined and certainly more old-fashioned‚Äîsometimes I'm amazed at people's comparing me to you when all I'm doing is some kind of blank verse‚Äîcan't they see how different it is? But they can't apparently.\\" to whom she was introduced by a librarian at Vassar in 1934. Moore took a keen interest in Bishop's work and, at one point, Moore dissuaded Bishop from attending Cornell Medical School, where the poet had briefly enrolled herself after moving to New York City following her Vassar graduation. Regarding Moore's influence on Bishop's writing, Bishop's friend and Vassar peer, the writer Mary McCarthy stated, \\"Certainly between Bishop and Marianne Moore there are resemblances: the sort of close microscopic inspection of certain parts of experience. [However,] I think there is something a bit too demure about Marianne Moore, and there's nothing demure about Elizabeth Bishop.\\"Voices and Visions Series. Elizabeth Bishop Episode. New York Center for Visual History: New York, 1988. Moore helped Bishop first publish some of her poems in an anthology called Trial Balances in which established poets introduced the work of unknown, younger poets. It was four years before Bishop addressed \\"Dear Miss Moore\\" as \\"Dear Marianne\\" and only then at the elder poet's invitation. The friendship between the two women, memorialized by an extensive correspondence (see One Art), endured until Moore's death in 1972. Bishop's \\"At the Fishhouses\\" (1955) contains allusions on several levels to Moore's 1924 poem \\"A Grave.\\"Stewart, Susan (2002) Poetry and the Fate of the Senses. University of Chicago Press 141, 357 fn.78 and fn.79). She was introduced to Robert Lowell by Randall Jarrell in 1947, and they became great friends, mostly through their written correspondence, until Lowell's death in 1977. After his death, she wrote, \\"our friendship, [which was] often kept alive through years of separation only by letters, remained constant and affectionate, and I shall always be deeply grateful for it.\\"Bishop, Elizabeth. Poems, Prose, and Letters. New York: Library of America, 2008. 733. They also influenced each other's poetry. Lowell cited Bishop's influence on his poem \\"Skunk Hour\\" which he said, \\"[was] modeled on Miss Bishop's 'The Armadillo.'\\"Lowell, Robert (2003) Collected Poems New York: Farrar, Straus, and Giroux, p1046. Also, his poem \\"The Scream\\" is \\"derived from...Bishop's story In the Village.\\"Lowell, Robert.

Travels Bishop had an independent income from early adulthood, as a result of an inheritance from her deceased father, that did not run out until near the end of her life. This income allowed her to travel widely, though cheaply, without worrying about employment, and to live in many cities and countries which are described in her poems.\\"Elizabeth Bishop\\", poets.org, Retrieved 2008-04-25 She wrote frequently about her love of travel in poems like \\"Questions of Travel\\" and \\"Over 2000 Illustrations and a Complete Concordance.\\" She lived in France for several years in the mid-1930s with a friend from Vassar, Louise Crane, who was a paper-manufacturing heiress. Elizabeth Bishop House, Key West, Florida In 1938, the two of them purchased a house at 624 White Street in Key West, Florida. While living there Bishop made the acquaintance of Pauline Pfeiffer Hemingway, who had divorced Ernest Hemingway in 1940. She later lived in an apartment at 611 Frances Street. 1312 & 1314 30th Street NW, (built 1868) From 1949 to 1950, she was the Consultant in Poetry for the Library of Congress, and lived at Bertha Looker's Boardinghouse, 1312 30th Street Northwest, Washington, D.C., in Georgetown.http://www.dcwriters.org/ Upon receiving a substantial ($2,500) traveling fellowship from Bryn Mawr College in 1951, Bishop set off to circumnavigate South America by boat. Arriving in Santos, Brazil in November of that year, Bishop expected to stay two weeks but stayed 15 years. She lived in Petr√≥polis with architect Lota (Maria Carlota) de Macedo Soares, who was descended from a prominent and notable political family. \\"The Love of Her Life,\\" June 2002 The New York Times review of Rare and Commonplace Flowers: The Story of Elizabeth Bishop and Lota de Macedo Soares Retrieved 2008-04-25 Although Bishop was not forthcoming about details of her romance with Soares, much of their relationship was documented in Bishop's extensive correspondence with Samuel Ashley Brown. However, the relationship deteriorated in its later years, becoming volatile and tempestuous, marked by bouts of depression, tantrums and alcoholism.Bishop Biography Retrieved 2008-04-25 The relationship is depicted in the 2013 film Reaching for the Moon. alt=A sepia photo of a middle-aged woman in a short- sleeve collared shirt sitting and gazing at an item she is holding. During her time in Brazil Bishop became increasingly interested in the languages and literatures of Latin America.Schwartz and Estess (1983) p. 236 She was influenced by Latin American poets, including the Mexican poet Octavio Paz and the Brazilian poets Jo√£o Cabral de Melo Neto and Carlos Drummond de Andrade, and translated their work into English. Regarding Andrade, she said, \\"I didn't know him at all. He's supposed to be very shy. I'm supposed to be very shy. We've met once ‚Äî on the sidewalk at night. We had just come out of the same restaurant, and he kissed my hand politely when we were introduced.\\"Schwartz and Estess (1983) p329 After Soares took her own life in 1967, Bishop spent more time in the United States.Poetry Foundation profileOliveira, Carmen (2002) Rare and Commonplace Flowers: The Story of Elizabeth Bishop and Lota de Macedo Soares Rutgers University Press, Publication history and awards For a major American poet, Bishop published very sparingly. Her first book, North & South, was first published in 1946 and won the Houghton Mifflin Prize for poetry. This book included important poems like \\"The Man-Moth\\" (which describes a dark and lonely fictional creature inspired by what Bishop noted was \\"[a] newspaper misprint for 'mammoth'\\") and \\"The Fish\\" (in which Bishop describes a caught fish in exacting detail). But she didn't publish a follow- up until nine years later. That volume, titled Poems: North & South‚ÄîA Cold Spring, first published in 1955, included her first book, plus the 18 new poems that constituted the new \\"Cold Spring\\" section. Bishop won the Pulitzer Prize for this book in 1956. Then there was another long wait before her next volume, Questions of Travel, in 1965. This book showed the influence that living in Brazil had had on Bishop's writing. It included poems in the book's first section that were explicitly about life in Brazil including \\"Arrival at Santos,\\" \\"Manuelzinho,\\" and \\"The Riverman.\\" But in the second section of the volume Bishop also included pieces set in other locations like \\"In the Village\\" and \\"First Death in Nova Scotia\\", which take place in her native country. Questions of Travel was her first book to include one of her short stories (the aforementioned \\"In the Village\\"). Bishop's next major publication was The Complete Poems (1969), which included eight new poems and won a National Book Award. The last new book of poems to appear in her lifetime, Geography III (1977), included frequently anthologized poems like \\"In the Waiting Room\\" and \\"One Art.\\" This book led to Bishop being the first American and the first Woman to be awarded the Neustadt International Prize for Literature.Neustadt International Prize for Literature listing Retrieved 2008-04-25 Bishop's The Complete Poems, 1927‚Äì1979 was published posthumously in 1983. Other posthumous publications included The Collected Prose (1984; a compilation of her essays and short stories) and Edgar Allan Poe & the Juke- box: Uncollected Poems, Drafts, and Fragments (2006), whose publication aroused some controversy. Meghan O'Rourke notes in an article from Slate magazine, \\"It's no wonder ... that the recent publication of Bishop's hitherto uncollected poems, drafts, and fragments ... encountered fierce resistance, and some debate about the value of making this work available to the public. In an outraged piece for The New Republic, Helen Vendler labeled the drafts 'maimed and stunted' and rebuked Farrar, Straus and Giroux for choosing to publish the volume.\\"O'Rourke, Meghan. \\"Casual Perfection: Why did the publication of Elizabeth Bishop's drafts cause an uproar?\\" Slate. 13 June 2006. Literary style and identity Where some of her notable contemporaries like Robert Lowell and John Berryman made the intimate details of their personal lives an important part of their poetry, Bishop avoided this practice altogether.Helen Vendler phone interview on Robert Lowell and Elizabeth Bishop audio podcast from The New York Review of Books. Accessed 2010-09-11 In contrast to this confessional style involving large amounts of self-exposure, Bishop's style of writing, though it sometimes involved sparse details from her personal life, was known for its highly detailed, objective, and distant point of view and for its reticence on the kinds of personal subject matter that the work of her contemporaries involved. She used discretion when writing about details and people from her own life. \\"In the Village\\", a piece about her childhood and mentally unstable mother, is written as a third person narrative, and so the reader would only know of the story's autobiographical origins by knowing about Bishop's childhood.Bishop, Elizabeth. \\"In the Village.\\" Questions of Travel. Bishop did not see herself as a \\"lesbian poet\\" or as a \\"female poet\\". Because she refused to have her work published in all- female poetry anthologies, other female poets involved with the women's movement thought she was hostile towards the movement. For instance, a student at Harvard who was close to Bishop in the 60s, Kathleen Spivack, wrote in her memoir, \\"I think Bishop internalized the misogyny of the time. How could she not? ... Bishop had a very ambivalent relation to being a woman plus poet‚Äîplus lesbian‚Äîin the Boston/Cambridge/Harvard nexus ... Extremely vulnerable, sensitive, she hid much of her private life. She wanted nothing to do with anything that seemed to involve the women's movement. She internalized many of the male attitudes of the day toward women, who were supposed to be attractive, appealing to men, and not ask for equal pay or a job with benefits.\\"Spivack, Kathleen. Robert Lowell and His Circle: Sylvia Plath, Anne Sexton, Elizabeth Bishop, Stanley Kunitz, and Others. Boston: Northeastern University Press, 2012. However, this was not how Bishop necessarily viewed herself. In an interview with The Paris Review from 1978, she said that, despite her insistence on being excluded from female poetry anthologies, she still considered herself to be \\"a strong feminist\\" but that she only wanted to be judged based on the quality of her writing and not on her gender or sexual orientation.Kalstone, David and Hemenway, Robert (2003) Becoming a Poet: Elizabeth Bishop with Marianne Moore and Robert Lowell. Ann Arbor: University of Michigan Press Although generally supportive of the \\"confessional\\" style of her friend, Robert Lowell, she drew the line at his highly controversial book The Dolphin (1973), in which he used and altered private letters from his ex- wife, Elizabeth Hardwick (whom he divorced after 23 years of marriage), as material for his poems. In a letter to Lowell, dated March 21, 1972, Bishop strongly urged him against publishing the book: \\"One can use one's life as material [for poems]‚Äîone does anyway‚Äîbut these letters‚Äîaren't you violating a trust?

In this poem, her experience of that event is through a child's point of view. The poem highlights that although young and naive the child has some instinctive awareness of the severe impact of death. She combines reality and imagination, a technique also used in her poem \\"Sestina\\". = \\"Sestina\\" = Bishop's poem \\"Sestina\\", published in 1965, depicts a real-life experience. After her father's death when she was a baby and following her mother's nervous breakdown when she was 5, Bishop's poem notes her experience is after she has gone to live with relatives. The poem is about her living with the knowledge that she would not get to see her mother again. Bishop writes, \\"Time to plant tears, says the almanac. / The grandmother sings to the marvelous stove / and the child draws another inscrutable house.\\" The style of her poem, the Sestina, is a poetry style created by Arnaut Daniel in the 12th century, focused on the emphases of ending words in each line, giving the poem a sense of form and pattern. Bishop is widely known for her skill in the Sestina format. Later life Bishop lectured in higher education for a number of years starting in the 1970s when her inheritance began to run out.Schwartz, Tony. \\"Elizabeth Bishop Won A Pulitzer for Poetry and Taught At Harvard.\\" The New York Times October 8, 1979: B13 Retrieved 2008-04-25 For a short time she taught at the University of Washington, before teaching at Harvard University for seven years.

Life James Wright was born and spent an unhappy childhood in Martins Ferry, Ohio. In 1946, he enlisted in the U.S. Army and participated in the occupation of Japan. Following his discharge, he attended Kenyon College on the GI Bill and published poems in the Kenyon Review. He graduated in 1952. Wright subsequently spent a Fulbright year in Vienna and obtained a Ph.D. at the University of Washington.\\"A Poet of the Pure Clear Word\\", David Yezzi, Wall Street Journal, October 14, 2017 Wright first emerged on the literary scene in 1956 with The Green Wall, a collection of formalist verse that was awarded the prestigious Yale Younger Poets Prize. But by the early 1960s, Wright, increasingly influenced by the Spanish language surrealists, had dropped fixed meters. His transformation achieved its maximum expression with the publication of the seminal The Branch Will Not Break (1963), which positioned Wright as curious counterpoint to the Beats and New York Schools, which predominated on the American coasts. This transformation had not come by accident, as Wright had been working for years with his friend Robert Bly, collaborating on the translation of world poets in the influential magazine The Fifties (later The Sixties). Such influences fertilized Wright's unique perspective and helped put the Midwest back on the poetic map. Wright had discovered a terse, imagistic, free verse of clarity, and power. During the next ten years Wright would go on to pen some of the most beloved and frequently anthologized masterpieces of the century, such as \\"A Blessing,\\" \\"Autumn Begins in Martins Ferry, Ohio,\\" and \\"I Am a Sioux Indian Brave, He Said to Me in Minneapolis.\\" Wright's son Franz Wright was also a poet. Together they are the only parent/child pair to have won a Pulitzer Prize in the same category (Poetry). Poetry Wright's early poetry is relatively conventional in form and meter, especially compared with his later, looser poetry. Although most of his fame comes from his original poetry, Wright made a contribution to another area or literary modernism- the translation. His work with translations of German and South American poets, as well as the poetry and aesthetic position of Robert Bly, had considerable influence on his own poems; this is most evident in The Branch Will Not Break, which departs radically from the formal style of Wright's previous book, Saint Judas. In addition to his own poetry, he also published loose translations of Ren√© Char's hermetic poems. His poetry often deals with the disenfranchised, or the American outsider. Wright suffered from depression and bipolar mood disorders and also battled alcoholism his entire life. He experienced several nervous breakdowns, was hospitalized, and was subjected to electroshock therapy. His dark moods and focus on emotional suffering were part of his life and often the focus of his poetry, although given the emotional turmoil he experienced personally, his poems can be optimistic in expressing a faith in life and human transcendence. In The Branch Will Not Break, the enduring human spirit becomes thematic. Nevertheless, the last line of his poem \\"Lying in a Hammock at William Duffy's Farm in Pine Island, Minnesota\\" famously reads, \\"I have wasted my life.\\"Lying in a Hammock at William Duffy‚Äôs Farm in Pine Island, Minnesota by James Wright Technically, Wright was an innovator, especially in the use of his titles, first lines, and last lines, which he used to great dramatic effect in defense of the lives of the disenfranchised. He is equally well known for his tender depictions of the bleak landscapes of the post- industrial American Midwest. Influence and awards His 1972 Collected Poems won the Pulitzer Prize. In addition to his other awards, Wright received a grant from the Rockefeller Foundation. Since his death, Wright has developed a cult following, transforming him into a seminal writer of significant influence. Fellow Pulitzer prize for poetry winner Mary Oliver wrote \\"Three Poems for James Wright\\" upon his death, and hundreds of writers gathered annually for decades to pay tribute at the James Wright Poetry Festival held from 1981 through 2007 in Martins Ferry.

Werner & Werner Corp, Santa Monica CA, 1977. Montgomery, MR & Gerald Foster: A Field Guide to Airplanes, Second Edition, page 32. Houghton Mifflin Company, 1992. The PA-32 is used around the world for private transportation, air taxi services, bush support, and medevac flights. Development The PA-32 series began life in 1965 as the PA32-260 Cherokee Six, a significantly modified six-seat (or seven-seat) development of the PA-28 Cherokee. The Cherokee Six and its successors feature a baggage compartment in the nose between the cockpit and the engine compartment and a large double door in the back for easy loading of passengers and cargo. =PA-32-300= Some pilots thought the original Cherokee Six was underpowered, so on 27 May 1966, Piper obtained FAA type certification for a version, designated as the PA-32-300. It was offered by the company as a 1967 model. =PA-32R= The 1975 addition of retractable landing gear resulted in the first of the PA-32R series, the Piper Lance. This was the earliest aircraft in the Piper Saratoga family, Piper's luxury, high- performance single line. Piper's transition to tapered wings for the Cherokee series resulted in a new wing for the PA-32 series, as well. The tapered-wing version of the Cherokee Six was named the Saratoga and debuted in 1980. Due to product liability concerns and economic conditions, the general aviation industry went into decline in the early 1980s, and Saratoga production ceased in 1985. =Piper 6X= After the General Aviation Revitalization Act of 1994, production of the retractable-gear Saratoga resumed in 1995. A fixed-gear PA32 was reintroduced in 2003 as the Piper 6X and the turbocharged 6XT. Sales of the 6X and 6XT models did not meet expectations and production ceased in late 2007. =PA-34 prototype= Piper built a prototype PA32-260 with IO-360 engines mounted on the wings. The trimotor aircraft was the proof-of-concept aircraft for the twin-engined, retractable-gear version of the Cherokee Six, the PA-34 Seneca.Montgomery, MR & Gerald Foster: A Field Guide to Airplanes, Second Edition, p.96.

In 2003, SQL Slammer became the first observed example of a Warhol worm. The mechanism of SQL Slammer's spread used a pseudo-random number generator seeded from a system variable to determine which IP addresses to attack next. In spite of deficiencies in its implementation, the randomized attack was highly effective. According to a CAIDA-coordinated analysis of the SQL Slammer outbreak, its growth followed an exponential curve with a doubling time of 8.5 seconds in the early phases of the attack, which was only slowed by the collapse of many networks because of the denial of service caused by SQL Slammer's traffic. 90% of all vulnerable machines were infected within 10 minutes, showing that the original estimate for infection speed was roughly correct.

Gold Medal Books) The Man Who Fell to Earth is a 1963 science fiction novel by American author Walter Tevis, about an extraterrestrial who lands on Earth seeking a way to ferry his people to Earth from his home planet, which is suffering from a severe drought. The novel served as the basis for the 1976 film by Nicolas Roeg as well as a 1987 television adaptation and an upcoming television series.  Plot summary  Thomas Jerome Newton is a humanoid alien who comes to Earth seeking to construct a spaceship to ferry others from his home planet, Anthea, to Earth. Anthea is experiencing a terrible drought after many nuclear wars, and the population has dwindled to fewer than 300. Their own starships are unusable for lack of fuel and 500 years of neglect. The Antheans have no water, an abundance of food that is slowly dwindling, and feeble solar power. Like all Antheans, Newton is super-intelligent, but he has been selected for this mission because he has the physical strength necessary to function in Earth's hotter climate and higher gravity. Arriving at Earth in a lifeboat, Newton first lands in the state of Kentucky. He quickly becomes familiar with the environment and forms a plan. Using advanced technology from his home planet, Newton patents many inventions, and amasses incredible wealth as the head of a technology-based conglomerate. He plans to use this wealth to construct space vehicles for the rest of the Anthean population. Along the way he meets Betty Jo, who falls in love with him. He does not return these feelings, but takes her and his curious fuel-technician Nathan Bryce as his friends, while he runs his company in the shadows. Betty Jo introduces Newton to many Earth customs, such as church, fashion, and alcohol. However, his appetite for alcohol soon leads to problems, as he begins to experience intense emotions unfamiliar to Antheans. Eventually, Newton's alien nature is discovered by Nathan Bryce, and it comes as a relief to Newton to be able to reveal his secret to someone. He expresses the hope that the Antheans he will ferry to Earth will flourish and use their superior intelligence to help Earth achieve peace, prosperity, and safety. However, the CIA arrests Newton, having followed him since his appearance on Earth and having recorded this private conversation with Bryce. They submit him to rigorous tests and analysis, resulting in conclusive evidence of his alien identity, but decide not to release the results for fear they would simply not be believed, and possibly even embarrass the government. Newton is released, but is immediately arrested by the FBI, which begins its own examinations. Their final examination is an X-ray of Newton's skull, through his eyes. Newton, whose eyes are sensitive to X-rays, is unable to stop them and is blinded. The story of Newton's blinding becomes a scandal which leads to the fall of the government and eventually to catastrophe. Newton, speaking to Bryce for the last time, explains bitterly that he is unable to continue his spaceship project because of his blindness and because of planetary alignments which have changed during his captivity. He records a message which he hopes to broadcast via radio to his home planet.  Critical reception  James Sallis declared that The Man Who Fell to Earth was \\"among the finest science fiction novels,\\" saying \\"Just beneath the surface it might be read as a parable of the Fifties and of the Cold War. Beneath that as an evocation of existential loneliness, a Christian fable, a parable of the artist. Above all, perhaps, as the wisest, truest representation of alcoholism ever written.\\"Books, F&SF;, July 2000.  Adaptations  = 1976 feature film = = 1987 television film = A made-for-television film of The Man Who Fell to Earth was first broadcast in the United States by ABC on August 23, 1987. Directed by Bobby Roth, the film was produced by MGM and was the pilot for an uncommissioned TV series. In this version, the alien (played by Lewis Smith) is renamed \\"John Dory\\" and forms a relationship with a woman, Eva Miller (Beverly D'Angelo), and her son, Billy (Wil Wheaton), a relationship similar to that of Klaatu, Helen Benson and her son Bobby in the 1951 film The Day the Earth Stood Still. Other cast members include James Laurenson as businessman Felix Hawthorne, and Robert Picardo as government agent Richard Morse. = Television series = On August 1, 2019, it was announced that CBS All Access had given a series order to a television series adaptation of the novel. Developed by Alex Kurtzman, the series will be a reimagining of Tevis' novel following an alien who arrives on Earth at the turning point of human evolution and must confront his own past to determine the future of mankind by introducing new technology that will help evolve mankind while also dealing with the consequences.

She won the Pulitzer Prize for poetry in 1967 for her book Live or Die. Her poetry details her long battle with depression, suicidal tendencies, and intimate details from her private life, including relationships with her husband and children, whom it was later alleged she physically and sexually assaulted. Early life and family Anne Sexton was born Anne Gray Harvey in Newton, Massachusetts to Mary Gray (Staples) Harvey (1901‚Äì1959) and Ralph Churchill Harvey (1900‚Äì1959). She had two older sisters, Jane Elizabeth (Harvey) Jealous (1923‚Äì1983) and Blanche Dingley (Harvey) Taylor (1925‚Äì2011). She spent most of her childhood in Boston. In 1945 she enrolled at Rogers Hall boarding school, Lowell, Massachusetts, later spending a year at Garland School.Middlebrook, p. 21. For a time she modeled for Boston's Hart Agency. On August 16, 1948, she married Alfred Muller Sexton II and they remained together until 1973. Sexton had her first child, Linda Gray Sexton, in 1953. Her second child, Joyce Ladd Sexton, was born two years later. Poetry Sexton suffered from severe bipolar disorder for much of her life, her first manic episode taking place in 1954. After a second episode in 1955 she met Dr. Martin Orne, who became her long- term therapist at the Glenside Hospital. It was Orne who encouraged her to write poetry.Middlebrook The first poetry workshop she attended was led by John Holmes. Sexton felt great trepidation about registering for the class, asking a friend to make the phone call and accompany her to the first session. She found early acclaim with her poetry; a number were accepted by The New Yorker, Harper's Magazine and the Saturday Review. Sexton later studied with Robert Lowell at Boston University alongside poets Sylvia Plath and George Starbuck. Sexton later paid homage to her friendship with Plath in the 1966 poem \\"Sylvia's Death\\". Her first volume of poetry, To Bedlam and Part Way Back, was published in 1960, and included the poem \\"Her Kind\\", which uses the persecution of witches as an analogy for the oppression of women in a patriarchal society. Sexton's poetic career was encouraged by her mentor W.D. Snodgrass, whom she met at the Antioch Writer's Conference in 1957. His poem \\"Heart's Needle\\" proved inspirational for her in its theme of separation from his three-year-old daughter.Snodgrass, W.D., \\"Heart's Needle\\" , American Academy of Poets Sexton first read the poem at a time when her own young daughter was living with her mother-in-law. She, in turn, wrote \\"The Double Image\\", a poem which explores the multi-generational relationship between mother and daughter. Sexton began writing letters to Snodgrass and they became friends. While working with John Holmes, Sexton encountered Maxine Kumin. They became good friends and remained so for the rest of Sexton's life. Kumin and Sexton rigorously critiqued each other's work and wrote four children's books together. In the late 1960s, the manic elements of Sexton's illness began to affect her career, though she still wrote and published work and gave readings of her poetry. She collaborated with musicians, forming a jazz-rock group called Her Kind that added music to her poetry. Her play Mercy Street, starring Marian Seldes, was produced in 1969, after several years of revisions.(Musician Peter Gabriel wrote a song inspired by Sexton's work, also titled \\"Mercy Street\\".) Sexton also collaborated with the artist Barbara Swan, who illustrated several of her books. Within 12 years of writing her first sonnet, she was among the most honored poets in the U.S.: a Pulitzer Prize winner, a fellow of the Royal Society of Literature and the first female member of the Harvard chapter of Phi Beta Kappa. Death Grave of Anne Sexton, located at Forest Hills Cemetery in Jamaica Plain, Massachusetts On October 4, 1974, Sexton had lunch with Kumin to revise galleys for Sexton's manuscript of The Awful Rowing Toward God, scheduled for publication in March 1975 (Middlebrook 396). On returning home she put on her mother's old fur coat, removed all her rings, poured herself a glass of vodka, locked herself in her garage, and started the engine of her car, ending her life by carbon monoxide poisoning. In an interview over a year before her death, she explained she had written the first drafts of The Awful Rowing Toward God in 20 days with \\"two days out for despair and three days out in a mental hospital.\\" She went on to say that she would not allow the poems to be published before her death. She is buried at Forest Hills Cemetery & Crematory in Jamaica Plain, Boston, Massachusetts. Content and themes of work Sexton is seen as the modern model of the confessional poet due to the intimate and emotional content of her poetry. Sexton often wrote and disclosed her struggles with mental illness through her work. Anne Sexton has also included important yet overlooked topics that touched on the overall experience for a woman. Maxine Kumin described Sexton's work: \\"She wrote openly about menstruation, abortion, masturbation, incest, adultery, and drug addiction at a time when the proprieties embraced none of these as proper topics for poetry.\\"Anne Sexton (1988) Steven E. Colburn, University of Michigan Press, 1988 p438 Sexton's work towards the end of the sixties has been criticized as \\"preening, lazy and flip\\" by otherwise respectful critics. Some critics regard her dependence on alcohol as compromising her last work. However, other critics see Sexton as a poet whose writing matured over time. \\"Starting as a relatively conventional writer, she learned to roughen up her line...to use as an instrument against the 'politesse' of language, politics, religion [and] sex.\\" Sexton was heavily criticized for her poetic content and themes, but these topics contributed to the popularity of her work. Her eighth collection of poetry is entitled The Awful Rowing Toward God. The title came from her meeting with a Roman Catholic priest who, unwilling to administer last rites, told her \\"God is in your typewriter.\\" This gave the poet the desire and willpower to continue living and writing. The Awful Rowing Toward God and The Death Notebooks are among her final works, and both center on the theme of dying. Her work started out as being about herself, however as her career progressed she made periodic attempts to reach outside the realm of her own life for poetic themes. Transformations (1971), which is a re-visionary re- telling of Grimm's Fairy Tales, is one such book.Del George, Dana, The Supernatural in Short Fiction of the Americas: The Other World in the New World, Greenwood Publishing Group, 2001, p. 37. (Transformations was used as the libretto for the 1973 opera of the same name by American composer Conrad Susa.) Later she used Christopher Smart's Jubilate Agno and the Bible as the basis for some of her work. Much has been made of the tangled threads of her writing, her life and her depression, much in the same way as with Sylvia Plath's suicide in 1963. Robert Lowell, Adrienne Rich and Denise Levertov commented in separate obituaries on the role of creativity in Sexton's death. Levertov says, \\"We who are alive must make clear, as she could not, the distinction between creativity and self-destruction.\\" Subsequent controversy Following one of many suicide attempts and manic or depressive episodes, Sexton worked with therapist Martin Orne. He diagnosed her with what is now described as bipolar disorder, but his competence to do so is called into question by his early use of allegedly unsound psychotherapeutic techniques.Jamison, K.R., \\"Manic-depressive illness and creativity\\" . Scientific American, February 1995, pp. 68‚Äì73 During sessions with Anne Sexton he used hypnosis and sodium pentothal to recover supposedly repressed memories. During this process, he allegedly used suggestion to uncover memories of having been abused by her father.Imagining Incest: Sexton, Plath, Rich, and Olds on Life with Daddy (2003) Gale Swiontkowski, Susquehanna University Press, p26 This abuse was disputed in interviews with her mother and other relatives.Middlebrook, pp. 56‚Äì60. Orne wrote that hypnosis in an adult frequently does not present accurate memories of childhood; instead, \\"adults under hypnosis are not literally reliving their early childhoods but presenting them through the prisms of adulthood.\\" According to Orne, Anne Sexton was extremely suggestible and would mimic the symptoms of the patients around her in the mental hospitals to which she was committed. Diane Middlebrook's biography states that a separate personality named Elizabeth emerged in Sexton while under hypnosis. Orne did not encourage this development and subsequently this \\"alternate personality\\" disappeared. Orne eventually concluded that Anne Sexton was suffering from hysteria. During the writing of the Middlebrook biography, her daughter, Linda Gray Sexton, stated that she had been sexually assaulted by her mother. In 1994, she published her autobiography Searching for Mercy Street: My Journey Back to My Mother, Anne Sexton, which includes her own accounts of the abuse.Sexton, Linda Gray (1994) Searching for Mercy Street: My Journey Back to My Mother, Anne Sexton. Little Brown & Co. New York Times article A Daughter Revisits Sexton's Bedlam October 14, 1994. Accessed 2010-08-04 Middlebrook published her controversial biography of Anne Sexton with the approval of daughter Linda, Anne's literary executor. For use in the biography, Orne had given Diane Middlebrook most of the tapes recording the therapy sessions between Orne and Anne Sexton. The use of these tapes was met with, as The New York Times put it, \\"thunderous condemnation\\". Middlebrook received the tapes after she had written a substantial amount of the first draft of Sexton's biography, and decided to start over. Although Linda Gray Sexton collaborated with the Middlebrook biography, other members of the Sexton family were divided over the book, publishing several editorials and op-ed pieces in The New York Times and The New York Times Book Review. Controversy continued with the posthumous public release of the tapes (which had been subject to doctor-patient confidentiality). They are said to reveal Sexton's molestation of her daughter Linda,, her physically violent behavior toward both her daughters, and her physical altercations with her husband. Further controversy surrounds allegations that she had an \\"affair with\\" the therapist who replaced Orne in the 1960s. No action was taken to censure or discipline the second therapist. Orne considered the \\"affair\\" with the second therapist (given the pseudonym \\"Ollie Zweizung\\" by Middlebrook and Linda Sexton) to be the catalyst that eventually resulted in her suicide. Legacy Peter Gabriel dedicated his song \\"Mercy Street\\", (named for both her play \\"Mercy Street,\\" and inspired by his reading of her poem \\"45 Mercy Street\\") from his 1986 album So, to Sexton. She has been described as a \\"personal touchstone\\" for Morrissey, former lead singer and lyricist of The Smiths. She is commemorated on the Boston Women's Heritage Trail.

(With linked information including essay by Harold Augenbraum from the Awards 60-year anniversary blog.) He has also won many other awards over the course of his career, including a MacArthur Fellowship. As of 2018, Powers has published twelve novels and has taught at the University of Illinois and Stanford University. He won the 2019 Pulitzer Prize for Fiction for The Overstory. Life and work =Early life= One of five children, Powers was born in Evanston, Illinois. His family later moved a few miles west to Lincolnwood where his father was a local school principal. When Powers was 11 they moved to Bangkok, Thailand, where his father had accepted a position at International School Bangkok, which Powers attended through his freshman year, ending in 1972. During that time outside the U.S. he developed skill in vocal music and proficiency in cello, guitar, saxophone, and clarinet. He also became an avid reader, enjoying nonfiction, primarily, and classics such as the Iliad and the Odyssey. The family returned to the U.S. when Powers was 16. Following graduation in 1975 from DeKalb High School in DeKalb, Illinois, he enrolled at the University of Illinois at Urbana‚ÄìChampaign (UIUC) with a major in physics, which he switched to English literature during his first semester. There he earned the BA in 1978 and the MA in Literature in 1980. He decided not to pursue the PhD partly because of his aversion to strict specialization, which had been one reason for his early transfer from physics to English, and partly because he had observed in graduate students and their professors a lack of pleasure in reading and writing (as portrayed in Galatea 2.2). =Professorships and awards= In 2010 and 2013, Powers was a Stein Visiting Writer at Stanford University, during which time he partly assisted in the lab of biochemist Aaron Straight. Powers was named a MacArthur Fellow in 1989. He received a Lannan Literary Award in 1999. Powers was appointed the Swanlund Professor of English at UIUC in 1996, where he is currently an emeritus professor. On August 22, 2013, Stanford University announced that Powers had been named the Phil and Penny Knight Professor of Creative Writing in the Department of English.https://english.stanford.edu/news/richard-powers-joins- english-faculty =Novels= Powers learned computer programming at Illinois as a user of PLATO and moved to Boston to work as a programmer. One Saturday in 1980, Powers saw the 1914 photograph \\"Young Farmers\\" by August Sander at the Museum of Fine Arts, Boston and was so inspired that he quit his job two days later to write a novel about the people in the photograph. Powers spent the next two years writing the book, Three Farmers on Their Way to a Dance, which was published by William Morrow in 1985. It comprises three alternating threads: a novella featuring the three young men in the photo during World War I, a technology magazine editor who is obsessed with the photo, and the author's critical and historical musings about the mechanics of photography and the life of Henry Ford. Powers moved to the Netherlands where he wrote Prisoner's Dilemma about The Walt Disney Company and nuclear warfare. He followed with The Gold Bug Variations about genetics, music, and computer science. In 1993, Powers wrote Operation Wandering Soul about an agonized young pediatrician. It was a finalist for the National Book Award. \\"National Book Awards ‚Äì 1993\\". National Book Foundation. Retrieved 2012-03-27. In 1995, Powers published the Pygmalion story Galatea 2.2 about an artificial intelligence experiment gone awry. In 1998, Powers wrote Gain about a 150-year-old chemical company and a woman who lives near one of its plants and succumbs to ovarian cancer. It won the James Fenimore Cooper Prize for Best Historical Fiction in 1999. 2000's Plowing the Dark tells of a Seattle research team building a groundbreaking virtual reality while an American teacher is held hostage in Beirut. Powers wrote The Time of Our Singing in 2003. It is about the musician children of an interracial couple who met at Marian Anderson's famed 1939 concert on the Lincoln Memorial steps. Powers's ninth novel, 2006's The Echo Maker, is about a Nebraska man who suffers head trauma in a truck accident then comes to believe his caregiver sister is an imposter. It won a National Book Award and was a Pulitzer Prize for Fiction finalist.\\"Fiction\\". Past winners & finalists by category. The Pulitzer Prizes. Retrieved 2012-03-27. Powers's tenth novel, 2009's Generosity: An Enhancement, has writing professor Russell Stone encountering his former student, Thassa, an Algerian woman whose constant happiness is exploited by journalists and scientists. In 2014, Powers wrote Orfeo about Peter Els, a retired music composition instructor and avant-garde composer who is mistaken for a bio- terrorist after being discovered with a makeshift genetics lab in his house. The Overstory, published in April 2018, won the 2019 Pulitzer Prize for Fiction, was shortlisted for the Booker Prize and the $75,000 2019 PEN/Jean Stein Book Award, and was runner-up for the Dayton Literary Peace Prize.https://www.daytonliterarypeaceprize.org/2019-fiction_runner-up.htm Critical response \\"Before I understood in literature that transformation into living things, I was doing it in code\\", Powers said. \\"Type a few lines of code, you create an organism\\". His programming background has influenced much of his work, including The Gold Bug Variations; philosopher Daniel Dennett sent Powers a fan letter eight pages long after reading Galatea 2.2. Reviewer William Deresiewicz has written critically of Powers's oeuvre; in his review of The Echo Maker, he writes of The Gold Bug Variations that \\"what's missing from the novel is, well, a novel. The characters are idealized, the love stories mawkish and clich√©d, the emotions meant to ground the scientific speculations in lived experience announced rather than established. The thinnest of devices are introduced to allow Powers to suspend the plot for dozens of pages at a stretch.\\" But Deresiewicz also noted that his \\"is hardly the standard view of Powers's work. Over the past two decades, Powers has established himself as one of our most praised as well as one of our most prolific writers of fiction.\\" In an admiring essay, Canadian novelist Margaret Atwood praised The Echo Maker as \\"a grand novel‚Äîgrand in its reach, grand in its themes, grand in its patterning. That it might sometimes stray over the line into the grandiose is perhaps unavoidable: Powers is not a painter of miniatures. Of the two extremes of American mannerist style, the minimalist or Shaker chair (Dickinson, Hemingway, Carver) and the maximalist or Gilded Age (Whitman, James, Jonathan Safran Foer), Powers inclines toward the latter. He gets his effects by repetition, by a Goldberg Variation‚Äìlike elaboration of motifs, by cranking up the volume and pulling out all the stops\\". Powers often provokes mixed reaction. Writing for The New Yorker, James Wood once likened his fiction to \\"a dying satyr ‚Äî above the waist is a mind full of serious thought, philosophical reflection, deep exploration of music and science; below, a pair of spindly legs strain to support the great weight of the ambitious brain.\\" Bibliography * 1985 Three Farmers on Their Way to a Dance, HarperCollins * 1988 Prisoner's Dilemma, McGraw Hill * 1991 The Gold Bug Variations, HarperCollins * 1993 Operation Wandering Soul, HarperCollins * 1995 Galatea 2.2, Farrar Straus & Giroux * 1998 Gain, Farrar Straus & Giroux * 2000 Plowing the Dark, Farrar, Straus & Giroux * 2003 The Time of Our Singing, Farrar, Straus & Giroux * 2006 The Echo Maker, Farrar, Straus & Giroux * 2009 Generosity: An Enhancement, Farrar, Straus & Giroux * 2014 Orfeo, W.

The band includes vocalist David Draiman, guitarist/keyboardist Dan Donegan, bassist John Moyer and drummer Mike Wengren. Draiman, Donegan and Wengren have been involved in the band since its inception, with Moyer replacing former bassist Steve Kmak, first as session performer in 2003, and then officially in 2005. The band has released seven studio albums, five of which have consecutively debuted at number one on the Billboard 200. Disturbed went into hiatus in October 2011, during which the band's members focused on various side projects, and returned in June 2015, releasing their first album in four years, Immortalized in August 2015. They also released two live albums, Music as a Weapon II in February 2004 and Disturbed: Live at Red Rocks in November 2016. Disturbed has sold over 17 million records worldwide, making them one of the most successful rock bands in the modern era alongside Slipknot and Godsmack, among others. History =Early years (1994‚Äì96)= Before David Draiman joined Disturbed, guitarist Dan Donegan, drummer Mike Wengren and bassist Steve \\"Fuzz\\" Kmak were in a band called Brawl with vocalist Erich Awalt. Before changing their name to \\"Brawl\\", however, Donegan mentioned in the band's DVD, Decade of Disturbed, that the name was originally going to be \\"Crawl\\"; they switched it to \\"Brawl\\", due to the name already being used by another band. Awalt left the band shortly after the recording of a demo tape; the other three members advertised for a singer. They posted an advertisement in the local music publication in Chicago, Illinois, called the \\"Illinois Entertainer\\". Draiman answered the advertisement after going to twenty other auditions that month. Guitarist Dan Donegan commented on Draiman: \\"You know, out of all the singers that we had talked to or auditioned, he [Draiman] was the only singer who was ready to go with originals. And that impressed me, just to attempt that\\". With regard to Draiman being the singer for the band, Donegan said, \\"After a minute or two, he just starts banging out these melodies that were huge...I'm playing my guitar and I'm grinning from ear to ear, trying not to give it away that I like this guy, you know, because I don't want to, you know...[say] 'Yeah, we'll give you a call back. We'll, you know, discuss it.' But I was so psyched. Chill up my spine. I'm like, 'There is something here.'\\" As drummer Mike Wengren commented, \\"We clicked right off the bat.\\" Draiman then joined the band in 1996 and the band was renamed Disturbed. When asked in an interview why he suggested to name the band \\"Disturbed\\", Draiman said, \\"It had been a name I have been contemplating for a band for years. It just seems to symbolize everything we were feeling at the time. The level of conformity that people are forced into was disturbing to us and we were just trying to push the envelope and the name just sorta made sense.\\" =The Sickness (1997‚Äì2000)= After renaming the band, Disturbed went on to record two 3-track demo tapes, the first having the demos for \\"The Game\\", \\"Down with the Sickness\\", and \\"Meaning of Life\\", with the second having the demos for \\"Want\\", \\"Stupify\\", and \\"Droppin' Plates.\\" The artwork was composed of the band's recently created mascot, The Guy. The band eventually signed with Giant Records. In 2000, the band released its debut album, titled The Sickness, which launched the band into stardom. The album peaked at number twenty on Billboard 200, and it has sold over four million copies in the United States since its release. Before joining Marilyn Manson's 2001 European tour, bassist Steve Kmak was unable to play with the band due to a shattered ankle, caused by falling out of a fire escape outside Disturbed's rehearsal hall in Chicago. He took the fire escape to exit the building while the elevator was being used to move their equipment downstairs. Kmak skipped the European trek of the tour, but he did perform with the band on January 11 and 12, 2001 at Disturbed's show in Chicago. During the European tour, Marty O'Brien replaced Kmak until he was able to tour again. =Believe (2001‚Äì03)= Believe logo Disturbed covered the song \\"Midlife Crisis\\" for a Faith No More tribute album that was eventually released in 2002. However, Disturbed's cover was not used, and a rerecorded version would later make an appearance on the compilation album, The Lost Children. In September 2001, production of their second studio album began. On June 4, 2002, Disturbed released a documentary DVD about the band, titled M.O.L., which showed some of the band's more personal moments in the studio and during tours, as well as featuring several music videos and live performances. On September 17, 2002, Disturbed released their second studio album, titled Believe, which debuted at number one on the Billboard 200. The music video for the first single from the album, titled \\"Prayer\\", was pulled from most television stations, due to perceived similarities with the September 11, 2001 attacks. David Draiman recorded vocals for a song titled \\"Forsaken\\", a song written and produced by Jonathan Davis of the band Korn, released on Queen of the Damned. In 2003, the band once again participated in the Ozzfest tour and started another one of their own tours, titled Music as a Weapon II. The bands Chevelle, Taproot, and √únloco toured with them. During the tour, Disturbed debuted an unreleased song, titled \\"Dehumanized\\". After Disturbed finished the Music as a Weapon II tour, Steve Kmak was fired by the band because of \\"personality differences\\". He was replaced by John Moyer, who is the current bass player. On the night Moyer became the band's new bass player, Disturbed played live at the House of Blues and performed two new songs, \\"Hell\\" and \\"Monster\\", both of which are B-side tracks on the band's third studio album, Ten Thousand Fists. =Ten Thousand Fists (2004‚Äì06)= Disturbed's third studio album, Ten Thousand Fists, was released on September 20, 2005. The album debuted at number one on the Billboard 200, while also selling around 238,000 copies in the week following its release. The album was certified platinum, shipping 1,000,000 units, in the United States on January 5, 2006. The band toured with 10 Years and Ill Ni√±o in support of the album. Disturbed headlined Ozzfest 2006 along with System of a Down, Lacuna Coil, DragonForce, Avenged Sevenfold, and Hatebreed. Disturbed performing in 2005 In an interview with Launch Radio Networks, Disturbed vocalist David Draiman stated that twenty songs were recorded for the album, but only fourteen made it to the final track listing. The remaining songs included \\"Hell\\", which was included in one of the two \\"Stricken\\" singles; \\"Monster\\", which was included as an iTunes pre-order bonus for Ten Thousand Fists, then later included on the Ten Thousand Fists Tour Edition; \\"Two Worlds\\", which was also included on the Tour Edition of Ten Thousand Fists; and \\"Sickened\\", which was included in the \\"Land of Confusion\\" single. Ten Thousand Fists is the first album released by Disturbed to feature guitar solos. The band stated that they felt that guitar solos are a part of music that is absent in a lot of modern music, and they wanted to bring some of that back. Songs like \\"Stricken\\", \\"Overburdened\\", and \\"Land of Confusion\\" all feature guitar solos, as well as many others. In 2006, a European tour was scheduled but had been moved twice due to Draiman having troubles with severe acid reflux, which affected his voice, as related by Draiman himself. Later that year, Draiman underwent surgery for a deviated septum which affected his voice. It was successful, and ever since then, Draiman has limited his drinking on the road. In late 2006, Disturbed headlined another one of their own tours named Music as a Weapon III; the bands Flyleaf, Stone Sour, and Nonpoint toured with them. Disturbed completed the first leg of their Music as a Weapon III tour in late 2006. Soon after, Draiman stated that there was not going to be a second leg to the tour and that instead the band was going off the road to start working on their fourth studio album. =Indestructible (2007‚Äì09)= Disturbed at 2008's Mayhem Festival in Dallas, Texas In July 2007, a new track titled \\"This Moment\\" was released on the soundtrack to the film Transformers. Disturbed mixed their fourth studio album, titled Indestructible, in Los Angeles in late 2007. In an earlier interview, David Draiman said that they were going to record fifteen songs, but only twelve would be on the album. Indestructible's first single, \\"Inside the Fire\\" was made available on digital distribution services for purchase on March 25, 2008. The band also toured in the United States in April and May 2008 with the bands Five Finger Death Punch and Art of Dying. The music video for \\"Inside the Fire\\" was released on May 2, 2008 on the band's official website. Disturbed released their previously free song \\"Perfect Insanity\\" on iTunes Store as a second single on May 6, 2008, and the album Indestructible become available for pre-order for the release date on June 3, 2008. Indestructible was released in the United States on June 3, 2008 and in Australia on June 7, 2008 and became the band's third consecutive number one debut on the Billboard 200. A special \\"Internet Only\\" limited edition of the album that includes the B-side track \\"Run\\", a making-of DVD with instructional videos, wrap-around poster, VIP laminate, access to special Disturbed events, and a special website with an exclusive video, rare audio and more was also released. Disturbed played their first live online concert on May 29, 2008. The concert was sponsored by Pepsi and Deep Rock Drive. They performed in Las Vegas. The band toured in support of the \\"Mayhem Festival\\" alongside Slipknot, DragonForce and Mastodon during summer of 2008. Disturbed also completed a tour of Australia and New Zealand through August and September 2008. In May 2008, Harmonix, the developers of the video game Rock Band announced they had reached a deal with Disturbed and Best Buy to offer two tracks from Indestructible for play in Rock Band to those who pre-ordered the album from Best Buy's website. On June 3, 2008, Harmonix released three tracks from Indestructible; \\"Indestructible\\", \\"Inside the Fire\\", and \\"Perfect Insanity\\". On May 12, 2009, Harmonix released Stricken and Stupify to the Rock Band music store. Dan Donegan (left) and John Moyer in 2009 On September 30, 2008, the band released an iTunes-exclusive live album entitled Live & Indestructible, made up of songs from Deep Rock Drive, as well as the music video for \\"Indestructible\\". The band started a tour of Europe, starting in London during October 2008 and finishing during November 2008 in Helsinki. In November and December 2008, Disturbed toured in the United States. The song \\"Inside the Fire\\" was nominated for a 2009 Grammy Award in the \\"Best Hard Rock Performance\\" category. In March 2009, Disturbed released a music video for the single \\"The Night\\". The band began their Music as a Weapon IV tour in March 2009 and it ended in late May. The tour, also dubbed a \\"festival\\", featured the bands Killswitch Engage, Lacuna Coil, and Chimaira on the main stage. The band released a second cover version of Faith No More's song \\"Midlife Crisis\\" on the album Covered, A Revolution in Sound, which also included bands such as Mastodon, The Used, and Avenged Sevenfold. This cover of \\"Midlife Crisis\\" was originally recorded for Indestructible, but the band decided not to include it on the album. =Asylum and The Lost Children (2010‚Äì11)= In an interview in July 2009, with FaceCulture, Draiman stated that the DVD would be \\"chronicling the past decade of Disturbed's existence. It's meant to show our growth over the course of the decade.\\" He also talked more about the fifth album: \\"A couple of [song riffs] that Danny has come up with are really amazing. But they're just little pieces...it's not even in two-three part progression [yet].\\" A few months later on March 23, 2010, the band released a reissue of their debut album, The Sickness, with the B-side tracks \\"God of the Mind\\" and \\"A Welcome Burden\\", updated artwork, as well as remastering and remixing the track list. It was also available for the first time in vinyl format. On February 26, 2010, Harmonix announced a second Disturbed pack for download on the Rock Band music store, containing the 2010 remastered versions of \\"Voices\\", \\"The Game\\", and \\"Meaning of Life\\". The band entered the studio in Chicago in early 2010 to begin recording their fifth album, planning on a release that summer. Guitarist Dan Donegan stated that the band had written around 15‚Äì18 songs. It was later confirmed that the title of the album would be Asylum. The band released a cover of heavy metal band Judas Priest's song \\"Living After Midnight\\" for the Metal Hammer Presents... Tribute to British Steel album. On April 20, 2010, roughly two months after they entered the studio, Disturbed announced that they had finished recording the album, and were ready to begin mixing it in Los Angeles, California. As they did with their last album Indestructible, Disturbed stated that they self-produced Asylum. The band announced that Asylum would be released on August 31, 2010. On July 9, 2010, the track listing was revealed on the band's official website. Asylum debuted at number one on the Billboard 200. Asylum was Disturbed's fourth consecutive studio album to debut on top of the charts, an achievement only earned by two other bands: Metallica and Dave Matthews Band. Disturbed performing \\"Down with the Sickness\\" in 2010 Disturbed headlined the first annual \\"Rockstar Energy Drink Uproar\\" tour with Avenged Sevenfold, as well as Stone Sour, Hellyeah and Halestorm, among others in late summer 2010. Then, in October 2010, it was reported that David Draiman was diagnosed with a \\"serious throat condition\\", and the band's U.S. tour had been canceled, as Draiman's healing process could have taken up to four weeks. Around the end of that year, Disturbed announced that they would be commencing the Music as a Weapon V tour in 2011, co-headlining with Korn and guests Sevendust, In This Moment and Stillwell. In January 2011, the Mayhem Festival announced that Disturbed would be headlining the festival along with Godsmack and Megadeth that summer. In February 2011, Disturbed was added to that summer's Download Festival. Disturbed announced that in May 2011, they would be co-headlining the Rock on the Range Festival in Columbus, Ohio. On Thursday, April 28, Disturbed announced that their previously unreleased bonus track from Asylum, titled \\"3\\", would be available for download on their website. They said that all proceeds made from the download of the song would go towards the Damien Echols Defense Fund, a benefit foundation supporting the release of the West Memphis Three. In July 2011, the band confirmed it would go on hiatus after finishing their US tour that year, and in an interview that same month, Draiman dismissed concerns that the hiatus was a result of conflict between the band members. Disturbed went into hiatus in October 2011. Disturbed released a b-side compilation album, titled The Lost Children, on November 8, 2011. The song \\"Hell\\" was made available for digital download on October 11, 2011, but Draiman stated on his Twitter page that there would not be a music video for it. A previously unreleased track, titled \\"Mine\\", also appears on the album. The track listing and release date were revealed on Draiman's Twitter page on September 20. On April 21, 2012, to commemorate Record Store Day, Disturbed released \\"The Collection\\". It is a box set featuring the band's five full-length studio albums in 140 gram vinyl LPs. =Immortalized (2015‚Äì17)= The band at Rock am Ring, Germany, 2016 On June 20, 2015, on Disturbed's Facebook page and website, there was material posted hinting at a possible return of the band. The website shows a new Disturbed logo, plus a video of the band's mascot \\"The Guy\\" appearing to be on life support, still breathing. The new Disturbed logo was also posted to their official Facebook page, along with the video of their mascot, and their profile picture changed to solid black, indicating new activity within the band. On June 22, 2015, Disturbed posted another video on Facebook, this time showing The Guy awakening from life support, as well as an 18-hour countdown on their official website, giving speculation to a definite reunion. On June 23, 2015, Disturbed officially announced the end of their hiatus and the coming of their new album entitled Immortalized. On the same day, the official music video for the new single \\"The Vengeful One\\" was released on their YouTube channel. Immortalized was released on August 21, 2015. John Moyer did not perform on the album due to working on other projects, with all bass tracks being performed by Dan Donegan. Moyer is not in the band's video for \\"The Sound of Silence\\" released in December 2015. Moyer remains a band member, however, having appeared in promotional photography for the album as well as continuing to perform live with the band. On the album's release day, the band played their first show in four years at the House of Blues in Chicago. The show featured the live debuts of four new songs (\\"The Vengeful One\\", \\"What Are You Waiting For\\", \\"The Light\\" and the title track) and the song \\"Hell\\", a B-side from Ten Thousand Fists, in its entirety for the first time. Hellfest 2016 Disturbed released a virtual reality experience for the band's cover of \\"The Sound of Silence\\" via Littlstar.

Disturbed was announced as a direct support to Avenged Sevenfold on their UK & European tour throughout January and March 2017, alongside In Flames and Chevelle. =Evolution and The Sickness anniversary tour (2018‚Äìpresent)= Disturbed headlined the 2018 Rock Fest, along with Godsmack and Incubus. The band announced via social media in early January 2018 that they had entered the studio to begin recording their next studio album. In June 2018, lead guitarist Dan Donegan and bassist John Moyer confirmed with sources that the new album had been completed, with 100% of the songs finished, leaving only mixing and mastering to be done. Band members also posted a picture via Instagram together at a dinner party in celebration of completion of the recording process, the band's first album in over 3 years and the band's first album in over 8 years to have bassist John Moyer being involved in. The album, Evolution was released on October 19, 2018. On August 16, 2018, the lead single, titled \\"Are You Ready\\" was released. On September 21, 2018, the album's second single, titled \\"A Reason to Fight\\" was released. In support of the album, the band announced the 'Evolution World Tour', which took place in early 2019. The initial dates announced included shows across North America with select Canadian dates, as well as a European leg of the tour. On March 25, 2019, Disturbed announced a massive summer tour with Pop Evil and In This Moment. Pop Evil opened the first half of dates and In This Moment opened the second. On January 27, 2020, the band announced a 31-date tour with Staind and Bad Wolves celebrating the 20th anniversary of The Sickness. Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, the band had postponed the tour to 2021. On September 11, 2020, Disturbed released a cover of the song \\"If I Ever Lose My Faith in You\\" by Sting. Other projects On February 8, 2012, it was announced that John Moyer was supergroup Adrenaline Mob's new bass player. John made his onstage debut with the group on March 12, at New York City's Hiro Ballroom, a day before the release of the band's debut full-length album, Omert√°. On February 14, 2012, on his Twitter account David Draiman confirmed that he would make an appearance on VH1's That Metal Show 10th Season airing sometime that year. That episode was later moved to the 11th season and premiered on August 11, 2012. In May 2012, Draiman announced his new project, an industrial metal band called Device. Draiman later released information regarding the future of Disturbed and his new project Device, stating that Device would release their self-titled debut album on April 9, 2013. The album features several guest musicians from various metal bands. On April 25, 2013, it was announced that guitarist Dan Donegan and drummer Mike Wengren had begun a new project with Evans Blue singer Dan Chandler, Fight or Flight. Their debut album, \\"Life by Design?\\" was released on July 23, 2013. In December 2014, Moyer formed a new band with Scott Weiland, Ron \\"Bumblefoot\\" Thal, twins Jon and Vince Votta entitled Art of Anarchy, with a self-titled album released in June 2015. After the death of Weiland, the band recruited retired Creed singer Scott Stapp and recorded their second album The Madness, released in March 2017. In February 2018, Art of Anarchy members filed a lawsuit to the New York Supreme Court against Stapp for alleged failure to promote The Madness. Mascot The Guy Disturbed's mascot, named \\"The Guy\\", was originally just a drawing of a face with a large grin, as seen on the back of the album The Sickness. The original drawing of The Guy was then edited using a digital distorting program. After the original image had been distorted three times The Guy became the official mascot for the band. Later, he would be drawn as a full figure by artist David Finch. Musical style, influences, and lyrical themes While often classified as a heavy metal or hard rockBerelian, Essi, \\"The Rough Guide To Heavy-Metal\\" (2005), p. 102 band, Disturbed is also regarded as nu metal and alternative metal. When asked about die-hard heavy metal fans not finding Disturbed heavy enough, Draiman at one time stated: Allmusic reviewer Bradley Torreano described the album Believe as \\"taking the sort of jump that their heroes in Soundgarden and Pantera made after their respective breakthrough records\\". He also described the title track as moving \\"from a brutal chug to a sweeping chorus that suddenly stops in its tracks and turns into a winding riff that recalls the work of vintage James Hetfield\\". Believe is also considered by several critics to be a step away from the nu metal sound featured on The Sickness, moving towards a more hard rock and heavy metal sound that was continued in their following albums. David Draiman (left) and Dan Donegan performing in 2009 According to frontman David Draiman on the band home documentary M.O.L., the lyrics that he writes are inspired by actual experiences of his own, and he stated that he likes to present his ideas with cryptic lyrics. These lyrical themes range from the Judeo-Christian concept of Heaven and Hell, domestic abuse, suicide, insanity, relationships, war, to more fantastical themes, such as vampirism, werewolves and demons. They have often cited their influences as Black Sabbath, Judas Priest, Metallica, Pantera, Iron Maiden, Led Zeppelin, Queensr√øche, Nirvana, Alice in Chains and Soundgarden. Guitarist Dan Donegan uses guitar tunings Drop C, Drop C# and Drop B (also occasionally Eb standard), which are lower tunings than regular E standard. These lower tunings allow for a heavier sound and quicker chord changes in Donegan's riffs. Donegan also uses subtle electronic effects, which the rest of the band refers to as \\"The Danny Donegan Orchestra\\".

Her name, an unexpected choice, was not announced until almost two weeks after her birth. = Education = Beatrice began her early education at the independent Upton House School in Windsor, in 1991. From there, she and her sister both attended the independent Coworth Park School from 1995. Beatrice continued her education at the independent St George's School in Ascot, where she was a pupil from 2000 to 2007. She was diagnosed with dyslexia at the age of seven and went public with the diagnosis in 2005. She delayed sitting her GCSE exams for one year. She remained at St George's to take her A-Levels. She was elected Head Girl in her final year, and was a member of the school choir. After two years' study she gained a grade A in drama, and B grades in history and film studies. In September 2008, Beatrice started a three-year course studying for a BA in history and history of ideas at Goldsmiths College, London. She graduated in 2011 with a 2:1 degree.  Personal interests  In an interview to mark her 18th birthday, Beatrice said she wanted to use her position to assist others through charity work; she had already undertaken charitable duties alongside her mother through the various organisations the Duchess supported. During the summer of 2008, Beatrice volunteered as a sales assistant at Selfridges. She also worked at the Foreign Office's press office for a period of time without receiving a salary. It was also reported in 2008 that Beatrice was interested in pursuing a career at the Financial Times website. Beatrice celebrated her 18th birthday with a masked ball at Windsor Castle in July 2006. Nikolai von Bismarck took her official birthday portrait. Beatrice was the first member of the family to appear in a non-documentary film when she had a small, non-speaking role as an extra in The Young Victoria (2009), based on the accession and early reign of her ancestor Queen Victoria. For a while, she was a paid intern at Sony Pictures, but she resigned after the hacking incident that affected the company in late 2014. In April 2015, it was reported that Beatrice had decided to move to New York City. As of April 2017, Beatrice has a full-time job and splits her time between London and New York City. She is known as Beatrice York in her professional life and is Vice President of Partnerships and Strategy at Afiniti. She is also in charge of an Afiniti programme to engage senior business chiefs around the world to support women in leadership. She works with the programme through charity endeavours and speaking engagements. She has supported the Kairos Society, a nonprofit organisation of entrepreneurs at universities in China, Europe, India and the USA.  Personal life  In 2006, Beatrice was briefly in a relationship with Paolo Liuzzo, an American whose previous charge for assault and battery caused controversy at the time. For ten years, until July 2016, she was in a relationship with Virgin Galactic businessman Dave Clark. In March 2019, Beatrice attended a fundraising event at the National Portrait Gallery, London, accompanied by property developer Edoardo Mapelli Mozzi, the son of Alex Mapelli-Mozzi, a former British Olympian and descendant of the Italian nobility; the BBC describes Edoardo as \\"also a count\\", like his father. The couple are believed to have begun dating in 2018. Together, they attended the wedding of Lady Gabriella Windsor, Beatrice's second cousin once removed. They became engaged in Italy in September 2019, with their engagement formally announced by the Duke of York's Office on 26 September. The wedding was scheduled to take place on 29 May 2020 at the Chapel Royal at St James's Palace, followed by a private reception in the gardens of Buckingham Palace, but first the reception and then the wedding itself were postponed due to the COVID-19 pandemic. The wedding was eventually held in private on 17 July 2020, at the Royal Chapel of All Saints, Royal Lodge, Windsor, and was not publicly announced in advance. Beatrice's father walked her down the aisle. She wore the Queen Mary Fringe Tiara that was also worn by the Queen at her own wedding, and a remodelled Norman Hartnell dress that was loaned by the Queen. Princess Beatrice has a stepson, Christopher Woolf (born 2016), her husband's child from a relationship with architect Dara Huang.  Activities  In 2002, Beatrice visited children living with HIV in Russia, and, in Britain, she supported Springboard for Children (a literacy project for primary-school children with learning difficulties) and the Teenage Cancer Trust. In April 2010, running to raise money for Children in Crisis, she became the first member of the royal family to complete the London Marathon.

In 2016, Beatrice, her mother, Sarah, Duchess of York, and her sister, Eugenie, collaborated with British contemporary artist Teddy M to create the first ever royal graffiti. The painting on canvas, Royal Love, was painted at Royal Lodge and exhibited in London before being sold for a five-figure sum. Proceeds from the sale were donated to Children in Crisis. In 2018, Children in Crisis merged with Street Child, a children's charity active in multiple countries, with Beatrice serving as its ambassador. She is also a supporter of the Pitch@Palace initiative, a charity her father founded to amplify and accelerate entrepreneurs' business ideas. Beatrice took part in a South Asia Tour 2016 that lasted nine days. She visited Nepal, India, and Bhutan on behalf of the Franks Family Foundation (FFF), and Jamgon Kongtrul Eyes Centres, a free micro-surgical cataract programme in technical collaboration with Nepal's Tilganga Eye Centre under Nepali eye surgeon Sanduk Ruit's direction. A few weeks later she attended the 2016 Asia Game Changer Awards Dinner at the United Nations in New York City, which honoured Ruit and others. Beatrice and Charles Rockefeller presented Ruit with his Asia Society Asia Game Changer award.

It is best known for the civilian Hummer and the military Humvee that are assembled in Mishawaka, Indiana. For a relatively brief period, 1974‚Äì1979, the company also manufactured transit buses, making more than 5,400.  Corporate history  AM General traces its roots to the Standard Wheel Company of Terre Haute, Indiana, which expanded in 1903 to include the Overland Automotive Division. In 1908, John North Willys purchased the Overland company, then based in Indianapolis, Indiana, and renamed it Willys-Overland Motors. In the 1940s, it developed a vehicle to US Army specifications and later mass-produced \\"America's first four-wheel drive one- fourth-ton tactical utility truck\\"‚Äîthe Jeep of World War II fame. In 1953, Kaiser Motors purchased Willys-Overland, changing its name to first to Kaiser- Willys Motor Company and Kaiser-Jeep Corporation in 1963. In 1970 it was purchased by American Motors Corporation. In July 2020, KPS Capital Partners acquired the company. Defense and Government Products Division In 1964, Kaiser-Jeep purchased the Studebaker facilities in South Bend, Indiana, which included Studebaker's \\"General Products Division\\", along with its substantial defense contracts. At the time, Kaiser had been awarded a US$87 million Army truck contract, and under government pressure agreed to perform the work at the South Bend plant it had recently acquired from Studebaker. =American Motors= American Motors Corporation (AMC) purchased the Jeep Corporation from Kaiser in 1970 when it decided to leave the auto business. In 1971, AMC made the General Products Division of Jeep (producing military trucks as well as contract and non-commercial vehicles) a wholly owned subsidiary and renamed it AM General Corporation. American Motors ceased to function as an independent automaker in 1982 when a controlling interest was purchased by Renault. US government regulations at that time forbade ownership of defense contractors by foreign governments--and Renault was partially owned by the French government. =LTV Corporation= In 1983, LTV Corporation bought AM General and established it as a wholly owned subsidiary. In 1984, its headquarters moved from the American Motors AMTEK Building in Detroit, Michigan, to Livonia, Michigan, and two years later to South Bend, Indiana, where primary manufacturing operations were located. =Renco Group= In 1992, AM General was sold to Renco Group, which in 2002 converted it to a limited liability company. =Hummer brand= In 1992 AM General began marketing the HMMWV to the civilian market under the Hummer brand. In 1999 GM acquired the rights to the brand and continued production of the original civilian Hummer as the H1 until June 2006. AM General built a separate factory for the new Hummer H2, designed by and marketed by GM. The vehicle went on the market in 2002 and was produced until January 2009. AM General did not build the H3 model. GM was sued early in 2003 by DaimlerChrysler, owners of the Jeep brand, for the resemblance of the Hummer's seven-slot grille to Jeep's. The lawsuit was dismissed after acknowledgment of the shared corporate history of AMC and Jeep. = 2004 - Present = On August 20, 2004, it was announced that Ronald Perelman's MacAndrews & Forbes company would form a joint venture with AM General's then-owner, Renco Group, to give Perelman 70% ownership. The deal reportedly cost close to US$1 billion. In 2008, AM General and the Vehicle Production Group (VPG), of Troy, Michigan, announced that contracts had been signed for AM General to begin producing purpose-built taxi-cabs in 2009. Actual production would not begin until October 2011. The first vehicle off the line was presented to Marc Buoniconti, a former linebacker for The Citadel who was partially paralyzed in 1985. In May 2010, Azure Dynamics announced it had chosen AM General to assemble its electric drivetrain for Ford Transit Connect vehicles for the North American market at its Livonia, Michigan, factory. In September 2013, AM General reached an agreement to purchase the United States Department of Energy's secured loan to the Vehicle Production Group (VPG). Prior to this, AM General acted as sole vehicle assembler for VPG. As a result of this transaction, AM General created a wholly owned company, Mobility Ventures LLC, to operate the Mobility Vehicle-1 (MV-1) business and receive all VPG assets. In 2015, production of the Mercedes-Benz R-Class began at the Mishawaka assembly plant. Without this deal, \\"the German automaker would likely have had to shut down production of the vehicle, currently only sold in China.\\" Production ended in October 2017. Jeep Dispatcher 100 1975 AM General RHD postal delivery van Another familiar product from the AM General line was the Jeep DJ-5 series‚Äîa purpose built \\"Dispatch Jeep\\" 2-wheel drive (RWD) version of the Jeep CJ-5‚Äîused in huge numbers as a right-hand drive mail delivery vehicle by the United States Postal Service.  Buses  A 1976 AM General bus of Tri-Met, in Portland, Oregon, showing AM General logo on front The AM General Metropolitan buses were manufactured for city transit use from 1974 until 1979, producing a total of 5,431 buses (including 219 electric trolley buses). The Metropolitan was built under a 1971 agreement with Flyer Industries of Winnipeg, Manitoba; AM General licensed the rights to build and market the Western Flyer D700 for the US market. The D700 itself was similar in design to the contemporaneous GM New Look buses. The front end of the D700 was restyled and thus the resulting Metropolitan was not simply a Flyer design built under license but rather a jointly designed vehicle. Flyer later adopted the design changes for its own line as the models D800 and E800. Buses were built in lengths of either or , and widths of or . The model numbers reflected the chosen dimensions; for example, model \\"10240\\" indicated a 102-inch wide, 40-foot long bus. Suffixes \\"A\\" or \\"B\\" were used for later models to indicate certain options. In total, 3,571 40-foot diesel buses and 1,641 35-foot diesel buses were produced. =Articulated buses= MAN articulated bus in Seattle that was completed by AM General In 1977‚Äì1979, AM General also worked under a partnership with MAN of Germany to build SG 220 articulated buses for US transit systems. MAN fabricated the bodyshells in Germany and shipped them to the US for AM General for final assembly. Two different lengths were offered, and ; 93 buses were built to the shorter length while the rest were 60 feet long. By October 1978, the company discontinued bus production with the last unit completed in March 1979. The total number built was just under 400 (392 or 399), the largest group by far being 150 for Seattle's Metro Transit. MAN subsequently set up its own factory for US production in Cleveland, North Carolina. =Trolleybuses= Production of complete motor buses (and of any two-axle motor buses) had ended in 1978 and aside from the fitting-out of the last articulated MAN shells, the only production in 1979 was two batches of trolleybuses (and the only such vehicles ever built by the company). These were all vehicles, model 10240T: 110 trackless trolleys for the Philadelphia trolleybus system, operated by SEPTA; and 109 for the Seattle trolleybus system, operated by Metro Transit (now King County Metro). One of the latter has been preserved since its retirement in 2003 by King County Metro (see King County Metro fleet).  Development and production of the HMMWV  AM General HMMWV in Iraq In 1979, AM General began preliminary design work on the M998 Series High Mobility Multi-Purpose Wheeled Vehicle (HMMWV, pronounced Humvee), a 1.25-ton truck intended to replace the M151 and other Light Utility Vehicles. The US Army awarded AM General a prototype contract in 1981 with development and operational testing conducted over a five-month period in 1982. In March 1983, AM General won an initial $1.2 billion contract to produce 55,000 Humvees to be delivered in five basic models and 15 different configurations over a five-year period. Production began at the Mishawaka, Indiana, assembly plant in the fall of 1984 and the first deliveries were made in early 1985. Total international production by mid-1991 was more than 72,000. Since 1991, an additional 20,000 HMMWVs ordered brought total international production to 100,000 in March 1995. Late in 2000, AM General was awarded another contract for 2,962 M998A2 series trucks. The contract contained six single-year options running to fiscal year 2007 and continues to be renewed. To date, nearly 250,000 units have been produced. Humvees feature full-time four-wheel drive, an independent suspension, steep approach and departure angles, 60-percent grade ability and of ground clearance. More recent production models include the M1151, M1152, M1165, and M1167. As of 2015, Humvees are in use by the US Army, Marine Corps, Air Force, and Navy. The combined fleet numbers 140,000. More than 50 nations have bought these vehicles, too. The Humvee's replacement, a completely new Joint Light Tactical Vehicle (JLTV) design, has been in production by Oshkosh Corporation since 2016. AM General was unsuccessful in its bid for this $30-billion 25-year contract, leading to fears that the company might not remain independent, but it is now focused on military Humvee support (they still outnumber JLTVs by three to one) and development of a new ambulance model.Joint Light Tactical Vehicle Award Shakes Up Industry - Nationaldefensemagazine.org, October 2015  Other military vehicles  AM General also acquired Department of Defense contracts for medium and heavy trucks, including the M151 series,M151 Truck, Utility, l/4-Ton, 4√ó4 M35 series, and a heavier 5-ton series. In 2005, AM General was contracted to take over militarization, sales, and marketing of LSSV vehicles.

American bull riding has been called \\"the most dangerous eight seconds in sports.\\" To receive a score, the rider must stay on top of the bull for eight seconds with the use of one hand gripped on a bull rope tied behind the bull's forelegs. Touching the bull or themselves with the free hand, or failing to reach the eight-second mark, results in a no-score ride. Depending on the bull riding organization and the contest, up to four judges might judge the rider and four judge the bull on their performance. For most organizations, a perfect score is 100 points. In general, most professional riders score in the neighborhood of the mid-70s to the high 80s. Outside of the United States, bull riding traditions with varying rules and histories also exist in Canada, Mexico, Belize, Guatemala, El Salvador, Honduras, Nicaragua, Costa Rica, Panama, Cuba, the Dominican Republic, Colombia, Venezuela, Guyana, Ecuador, Peru, Bolivia, Brazil, Paraguay, Chile, Argentina, Uruguay, the Philippines, Japan, South Africa, England, Germany, France, Italy, Spain, Australia and New Zealand with the majority of them following similar rules, especially with the Professional Bull Riders (PBR) organization.Kubke, Jane & Kubke Jessica 2006. \\"Bull Riding\\". The Rosen Publishing Group History The taming of bulls has ancient roots in contests dating as far back as Minoan culture. Bull riding itself has its direct roots in Mexican contests of equestrian and ranching skills now collectively known as charreada.LeCompte, Mary Lou. (1985) . Journal of Sport History. volume 12. Issue 1. During the 16th century, a hacienda contest called jaripeo developed. Originally considered a variant of bull fighting, in which riders literally rode a bull to death, the competition evolved into a form where the bull was simply ridden until it stopped bucking. By the mid-19th century, charreada competition was popular on Texas and California cattle ranches where Anglo and Hispanic ranch hands often worked together. Many early Texas rangers, who had to be expert horse riders and later went on to become ranchers, learned and adapted Hispanic techniques and traditions to ranches in the United States. Many also enjoyed traditional Mexican celebrations, and H. L. Kinney, a rancher, promoter and former Texas Ranger staged what is thought to be the first Anglo-American organized bullfight in the southwest in 1852. This event also included a jaripeo competition and was the subject of newspaper reports from as far away as the New Orleans Daily Delta. However, popular sentiment shifted away from various blood sports and both bullfighting and prize fighting were banned by the Texas legislature in 1891. In the same time period, however, Wild West Shows began to add steer riding to their exhibitions, choosing to use castrated animals because steers were easier to handle and transport than bulls. Additionally, informal rodeos began as competitions between neighboring ranches in the American Old West. The location of the first formal rodeo is debated. Deer Trail, Colorado claims the first rodeo was in 1869, but so does Cheyenne, Wyoming in 1872.Melody Groves (2006), Ropes, reins, and rawhide, , https://books.google.com/books?id=ztGsU7ISp50C&pg;=PA51&dq;=Cowboy+Up:+The+History+of+Bull+Riding&client;=firefox-a#PPA4,M1 Although steer riding contests existed into the 1920s, the sport did not gain popularity until bulls were returned to the arena and replaced steers as the mount of choice. The first-known rodeo to use brahma bulls was in Columbia, Mississippi, produced in 1935 by Canadian brothers Earl and Weldon Bascom with Jake Lybbert and Waldo Ross. This rodeo was the first to feature a bull riding event at a night rodeo held outdoors under electric lights. A pivotal moment for modern bull riding, and rodeo in general, came with the founding of the Rodeo Cowboy Association (RCA) in 1936, which later became the Professional Rodeo Cowboys Association (PRCA). Through this organization, many hundreds of rodeos are held each year. Since that time, the popularity of all aspects of the rodeo has risen. In addition to the PRCA, which has PRCA ProRodeo with bull riding and the Xtreme Bulls events for bull riding only, there is the Professional Bull Riders (PBR), which stages a large number of events in the United States, Canada, Mexico, Brazil, and Australia, since 1994. With PBR World Finals in Las Vegas Valley, with it currently since 2016 at T-Mobile Arena in Paradise, Nevada. The PBR's major league tour, currently titled the Unleash the Beast Series, is televised on CBS Sports Network, with the primary broadcast network televising selected bonus rounds (known as 15/15 bucking battles). The previous tour name, which ran from 2003 until 2017, was titled the Built Ford Tough Series. From these roots, bull riding as a competitive sport has spread to a number of other nations worldwide. Rules and regulations Bull riding at the Calgary Stampede; the \\"bullfighter\\" or \\"rodeo clown\\" is standing just to the right of the bull. Each bull has a unique name and number (called a brand) used to help identify it. A sufficient number of bulls, each judged to be of good strength, health, agility, and age, are selected to perform. The rider and bull are matched randomly before the competition, although starting in 2008, some ranked riders are allowed to choose their own bulls from a bull draft for selected rounds in PBR events. A rider mounts a bull and grips a flat braided rope. After they secure a good grip on the rope, the rider nods to signal they are ready. The bucking chute (a small enclosure which opens from the side) is opened and the bull storms out into the arena. The rider must attempt to stay on the bull for at least eight seconds, while only touching the bull with their riding hand. The other hand must remain free for the duration of the ride. Originally, the rules required a 10-second ride, but that was changed to the current eight seconds. The bull bucks, rears, kicks, spins, and twists in an effort to throw the rider off. This continues for a number of seconds until the rider is bucked off of the bull or dismounts after completing the ride. A loud buzzer or whistle announces the completion of an eight-second ride. Throughout the ride, bullfighters, also popularly known as rodeo clowns, stay near the bull to aid the rider if necessary. When the ride ends, either intentionally or not, the bullfighters distract the bull to protect the rider from harm. Many competitions have a format that involves multiple rounds, sometimes called \\"go-rounds\\". Generally, events span two to three nights. The rider is given a chance to ride one bull per night. The total points scored by the end of the event are recorded, and after the first or first two go-rounds, the top 20 riders are given a chance to ride one more bull. This final round is called the \\"short go\\" or sometimes it is called the championship round. After the end of the short go, the rider with the most total points wins the event. =Points and scoring= Scoring is done consistently within a rodeo organization. The two largest sanctioning bodies are the PRCA and PBR. They vary slightly in how they score bull rides. There are many other organizations, and each has their own particular rules on how they score, but most follow rules similar to the PRCA. The rider only scores points if he successfully rides the bull for 8 seconds. The bull is always given a score. In the PRCA, a ride is scored from 0‚Äì100 points. Both the rider and the bull are awarded points. In the regular season, there are four judges, two judges scoring the bull's effort from 0‚Äì25 points, and two judges scoring the rider's performance from 0-25 points. There is the potential for the rider and the bull to earn up to 50 points each. The two scores are added together for a total ride score of up to 100 points. This system was spearheaded by former PRCA president Dale Smith. Scores of zero are quite common, as many riders lose control of the animal almost immediately after the bull leaves the bucking chute. Many experienced professionals are able to earn scores of 75 or more. Scores above 80 are considered excellent, and a score in the 90s exceptional. In the PBR, a ride is scored from 0-100 points in total. Up to 50 points is scored for the rider and 50 points for the bull. The rider only scores points if he successfully rides the bull for 8 seconds. The bull is always given a score. Four judges award a score of up to 25 points each for the rider's performance, and four judges award up to 25 points each for the bull's effort. Then all the scores are combined and then the total is divided in half for the official score. Judges award points based on several key aspects of the ride. Judges look for constant control and rhythm in the rider in matching their movements with the bull. Points are usually deducted if a rider is constantly off balance. For points actually to be awarded, the rider must stay mounted for a minimum of 8 seconds, and they are scored only for actions during those 8 seconds. The ability to control the bull well allows riders to gain extra style points. These are often gained by spurring the animal. A rider is disqualified for touching the bull, the rope, or themself with their free arm.2018 PBR Media Guide, Bull Riding Basics - Rider Score, p. 32. Bulls have more raw power and a different style of movement from bucking horses. One move particular to bulls is a belly roll (\\"sunfishing\\"), in which the bull is completely off the ground and kicks either his hind feet or all four feet to the side in a twisting, rolling motion. Bulls also are more likely than horses to spin in tight, quick circles, and are less likely to run or to jump extremely high (\\"break in two\\"). For the bull, judges look at the animal's overall agility, power and speed; his back legs kick, and his front end drops. In general, if a bull gives a rider a very hard time, more points will be awarded. If a rider fails to stay mounted for at least 8 seconds, the bull is still awarded a score. The PBR and PRCA record bulls' past scores so that the best bulls can be brought to the finals, ensuring that riders will be given a chance to score highly. Both organizations award one bull an award for the best bull of the year, decided by bull scores in both buckoffs and successful qualified rides. The award brings prestige to the ranch at which the bull was raised. If a rider scores sufficiently low due to poor bull performance, the judges may offer the rider the option of a re-ride. By taking the option, the rider gives up the score received, waits until all other riders have ridden, and rides again. This can be risky because the rider loses their score and risks being bucked off and receiving no score. A re-ride may also be given if a bull stumbles or runs into the fence or gate. In some PBR events that use an elimination style bracket, if both riders in a bracket fail to reach eight seconds, the rider who lasts longer advances to the next round. Otherwise, the rider with a higher score advances. Equipment =Rider equipment= A rider in full gear being thrown from his bull. Bull riders use many pieces of equipment both functionally and to ensure maximum safety, both to themselves and to the animals involved. The primary piece of equipment used is the bull rope. It is a braided rope made of polypropylene, grass, or some combination. A handle is braided into the center of the rope and is usually stiffened with leather. One side of the rope is tied in an adjustable knot that can be changed for the size of bull. The other side of the rope (the tail) is a flat braid and is usually coated with rosin to keep it from sliding through the rider's hand. A metallic bell is strapped to the knot and hangs directly under the bull throughout the ride. In addition to the sound the bell produces, it also gives the rope some weight, allowing it to fall off the bull once a rider has dismounted. Chaps are probably the most noticeable piece of bull rider clothing, as their distinctive coloring and patterns add flair to the sport. Usually made of leather, chaps also provide protection for the rider's legs and thighs. Bull riders wear protective vests, usually made of high impact foam that allow the shock to disperse over a wide area, thereby reducing pain and injury. They were introduced in the summer of 1993, and by late 1994, the vast majority of contestants were riding with them. They were officially made mandatory for all riders by 1996. Some bull riding vests also include a neck roll for protection to the neck, although very few contestants use a vest with said modification. To prevent a rope burn, riders must wear a protective glove, usually made of leather. It must be fastened to the rider's hand since the force the animal is able to exert could easily tear it away. The rider often applies rosin to the glove, which allows for additional grip. Cowboy boots are also worn. The dull and loosely locked spurs help keep the rider balanced and is crucial piece of equipment to the sport as a whole. The bulls are unharmed by the rowels, as their hide is roughly seven times thicker than a human being's skin. Truly skilled riders will often spur the bull in the hope of achieving extra style points from the judges. Many riders wear mouthguards, which are optional at the professional level. For most of bull riding‚Äôs history, the primary headgear worn by contestants was cowboy hats. However, starting in the early 1990s, a small number of them were riding either with a protective face mask underneath their hat or with a full ice hockey helmet. By the early 2010s, manufacturers were building helmets made specifically for bull riding. Around the same time, most up-and-comers were already riding with helmets. In 2013, the PBR made it mandatory that all contestants at their events who were born on or after October 15, 1994 ride with a full bull riding helmet. Those born before that date were grandfathered in and permitted to ride with a face mask underneath their hat or simply with their hat if so desired. Public health researchers found evidence suggesting that bull riding helmets are protective, when riders wearing one particular type of helmet suffered approximately 50% fewer head and facial injuries. In 2004, at the 1st International Rodeo Research and Clinical Care Conference in Calgary, Alberta, Canada, the licensed rodeo and bull riding medical personnel and clinicians recommended to the rodeo and bull riding associations mentioned in the agreement the mandatory use of helmets to all youth bull riders and the recommendation of helmets to all adult bull riders.Butterwick2005/ For competitors under the age of 18, mandatory protective headgear incorporating an ice hockey-style helmet is worn. Riders who use helmets as youths tend to continue wearing them as they reach adulthood and turn professional.Texas law mandates competitors under 18 in rodeos, including bull riding, must wear a helmet. =Bull equipment= This bull is wearing a flank strap. The flank strap is a soft cotton rope at least 5/8\\" in diameter and is used without extra padding like sheepskin or neoprene. It is tied around the bull's flank. Contrary to popular belief, the flank strap is not tied around the bull's testicles. This rope is to encourage the bull to use his hind legs more in a bucking motion, as this is a true test of a rider's skill in maintaining the ride. If it is applied improperly a rider may request to ride again, as the bull will not buck well if the flank strap is too tight. The flank strap is applied by the stock contractor or his designate. =The arena= The arenas used in professional bull riding vary. Some are rodeo arenas that are used only for bull riding and other rodeo events. Others are event centers that play host to many different sports. Common to all arenas is a large, open area that gives the bulls, bull riders, and bull fighters plenty of room to maneuver. The area is fenced, usually 6 to 7 feet high, to protect the audience from escaped bulls. There are generally exits on each corner of the arena for riders to get out of the way quickly. Riders can also hop onto the fence to avoid danger. One end of the arena contains the bucking chutes from which the bulls are released. There is also an exit chute where the bulls can exit the arena. North America In the United States and Canada, most professional bull riders start out riding in high school rodeo or other junior associations. From there, riders may go on the college rodeo circuit or to one of several national or regional semi-professional associations including the Southern Extreme Bull Riding Association (SEBRA), the National Federation of Professional Bull Riders (NFPB), the International Bull Riders Association (IBR), the Professional Championship Bull Riders Tour (PCB), the American Bull Riders Tour (ABT), Bull Riders Canada (BRC), the International Professional Rodeo Association (IPRA), the Cowboys Professional Rodeo Association (CPRA), the United Professional Rodeo Association (UPRA), the Southern Rodeo Association (SRA), the Professional Western Rodeo Association (PWRA), the Canadian Cowboys Association (CCA), among others. Bull riders compete in these organizations as they are climbing the ladder to the professional ranks and to supplement their income. In Mexico, there are a number of American-style bull riding organizations. The three main professional ones include PBR Mexico, Cuernos Chuecos (Crooked Horns), and La Federacion Mexicana de Rodeo (The Mexican Rodeo Federation). The latter of which is Mexico's top organization that includes all of American Rodeo's standard events, including bull riding. There are also a number of regional semi-pro associations. The top bull riders in the world compete on the PBR and PRCA circuits. Bull riders can win in excess of $100,000 a year while competing in either of these organizations, and it is not uncommon for riders to compete in both of them. Australia and New Zealand There are approximately 200 rodeos and bushmen's carnivals held annually across Australia. At most of these events bull riding is one of the featured competitions. Initially bullocks and steers were used for roughriding events and these were owned by local graziers that lent them for these events. Nowadays bulls are used for the open events and stock contractors supply the various roughriding associations. Contract stock has produced a more uniform range of bucking stock which is also quieter to handle. The competitions are run and scored in a similar style to that used in the United States.Hicks Jenny, \\"Australian Cowboys, Roughriders & Rodeos\\", CQU Press, Rockhampton, QLD, 2000 In May 1992 the National Rodeo Council of Australia (NRCA) was formed to promote and further the sport of rodeo and has represented the following associations, which also control bull riding: *Australian Bushmen's Campdraft & Rodeo Association (ABCRA) *Australian Professional Bull Riders Association (APBA) *Central Rodeo Cowboys Association (CRCA) *Indigenous Rodeo Riders Australia (IRRA) *National Student Rodeo Association (NSRA) *National Rodeo Association (NRA) *Northern Cowboys Association (NCA) *Queensland Rodeo Association (QRA) *Rodeo Services Association (RSA) *West Coast Rodeo Circuit (WCRC)NCRA.

Animal welfare There is debate between animal rights/welfare organizations and bull riding enthusiasts over many aspects of the sport. One source of controversy is the flank strap. The flank strap is placed around a bull's flank, just in front of the hind legs, to encourage bucking. Critics say that the flank strap encircles or otherwise binds the genitals of the bull. However, the flank strap is anatomically impossible to place over the testicles. Many point out that the bull's genes are valuable and that there is a strong economic incentive to keep the animal in good reproductive health. Further, particularly in the case of bulls, an animal that is sick and in pain usually will not want to move at all, will not buck as well, and may even lie down in the chute or ring rather than buck. Critics also claim that electric cattle prods (\\"hot shots\\") are used to injure and torture bulls, while supporters of bull riding claim that the cattle prod simply gets the bull out of the chute quickly and is only a moderate irritation due to the thickness of the animal's hide. Cattle prods have not been used in the Professional Bull Riders (PBR) tour for several years. However, in smaller associations, a cattle prod is still sometimes used to ensure that the animal leaves the chute as soon as the rider nods their head. Cattle prods are not allowed by any major association. Spurs are also a source of controversy, though modern rodeo rules place strict regulations on the type and use of spurs and participants point out that they are a tool commonly used in other non-rodeo equestrian disciplines. Spurs used in bull riding do not have a fixed rowel, nor can they be sharpened. The PBR currently allows only two types of rowels to ensure the safety of the animals.

Bronc riding, either bareback bronc or saddle bronc competition, is a rodeo event that involves a rodeo participant riding a bucking horse (sometimes called a bronc or bronco) that attempts to throw or buck off the rider. Originally based on the necessary horse breaking skills of a working cowboy, the event is now a highly stylized competition that utilizes horses that often are specially bred for strength, agility, and bucking ability. It is recognized by the Professional Rodeo Cowboys Association (PRCA) and the International Professional Rodeo Association (IPRA). Description Each competitor climbs onto a horse, which is held in a small pipe or wooden enclosure called a bucking chute. When the rider is ready, the gate of the bucking chute is opened and the horse bursts out and begins to buck. The rider attempts to stay on the horse for eight seconds without touching the horse with their free hand. On the first jump out of the chute, the rider must \\"mark the horse out\\". This means they must have the heels of their boots in contact with the horse above the point of the shoulders before the horse's front legs hit the ground. A rider that manages to complete a ride is scored on a scale of 0‚Äì50 and the horse is also scored on a scale of 0‚Äì50. Scores in the 80s are very good, and in the 90s are exceptional. A horse who bucks in a spectacular and effective manner will score more points than a horse who bucks in a straight line with no significant changes of direction. Bareback bronc vs. Saddle bronc riding Bareback bronc riding Saddle bronc riding Bareback bronc and saddle bronc styles are very different. In saddle bronc, the rider uses a specialized saddle with free swinging stirrups and no horn. The saddle bronc rider grips a simple rein braided from cotton or polyester and attached to a leather halter worn by the horse. The rider lifts on the rein and attempts to find a rhythm with the animal by spurring forwards and backwards with their feet in a sweeping motion from shoulder to flank. The bareback rider does not use a saddle or rein, but uses a rigging that consists of a leather and rawhide composite piece often compared to a suitcase handle attached to a surcingle and placed just behind the horse's withers. The rider leans back and spurs with an up and down motion from the horse's point of shoulder toward the rigging handle, spurring at each jump in rhythm with the motion of the horse. Bareback bronc riding began to develop as a professional rodeo sporting event around 1900. The riding equipment used during that era varied. In some cases, the rider simply held onto the horse's mane, called a mane-hold. Others held a loose or twisted rope tied around the horse's girth, and other methods involved using multiple handhold leather riggings based on a surcingle. In the early 1920s, when the old rodeo rules allowing two handed riding were being phased out and replaced with the newer rule of riding with one hand in the rigging and one hand in the air, Earl Bascom invented, designed and made rodeo's first one-hand bareback rigging. The original one-handed rigging was made by Bascom from a section of rubber belting discarded from a threshing machine, with the entire rigging‚Äîthe handhold and the body‚Äîall made as one piece. The handhold was folded back and riveted to the main body of the rigging, with a 'D' ring riveted on each side for tying the latigos. This rigging was first used at the Raymond Stampede in Alberta, Canada in July 1924. Bascom then refined the design, making his second one-handhold rigging out of leather and rawhide. Sole leather was used for the rigging body. Strips of leather, with rawhide sewed between, were used for the handhold with sheepskin glued under the handholds to protect the knuckles; this arrangement became known as \\"Bascom's Rigging\\". Honored in several Halls of Fame, Bascom is now known as the \\"Father of the Modern-day Bareback Rigging\\". Variations of Bascom's rigging are still used in rodeos today. The horse A bucking horse at pasture during the off season The bucking horse is usually a gelding, a castrated male horse. Because bucking horses usually travel in close quarters and are housed in a herd setting, geldings are generally less disruptive and more prone to get along with one another. However, mares are also used, and while a mixed herd of mares and geldings is a bit more prone to disruptions, they can be kept together without great difficulties. Stallions are less common, because they can be disruptive in a herd and may fight if there are mares present. The modern bronc is not a truly feral horse. Most bucking stock are specifically bred for use in rodeos, with horses having exceptional bucking ability being purchased by stock contractors and fetching a high price. Most are allowed to grow up in a natural, semi-wild condition on the open range, but also have to be gentled and tamed in order to be managed from the ground, safely loaded into trailers, vaccinated and wormed, and to load in and out of bucking chutes. They also are initially introduced to bucking work with cloth dummies attached to the saddle. Due to the rigors of travel and the short bursts of high intensity work required, most horses in a bucking string are at least 6 or 7 years old.Partian, Chris. \\"Diamond in the Rough.\\" Western Horseman, July 2007, pp. 132-140 Animal welfare issues The event has provoked concerns among some animal welfare advocates that practices used in the event may constitute animal cruelty. Modern rodeos in the United States are closely regulated and have responded to accusations of animal cruelty by instituting a number of rules to guide how rodeo livestock are to be managed. The PRCA has 60 rules that specifically regulate the proper care and treatment of rodeo animals; these guidelines must be followed by all rodeo participants in sanctioned rodeos. In 1994, a survey of 28 sanctioned rodeos was conducted by on-site independent veterinarians. Reviewing 33,991 animal runs, the injury rate was documented at 16 animals or 0.047 percent, less than five-hundredths of one percent or one in 2000 animals. A study of rodeo animals in Australia found a similar injury rate. Basic injuries occurred at a rate of 0.072 percent, or one in 1,405, with injuries requiring veterinary attention at 0.036 percent, or one injury in every 2810 times the animal was used, and transport, yarding and competition were all included in the study. A later PRCA survey of 60,971 animal performances at 198 rodeo performances and 73 sections of \\"slack\\" indicated 27 animals were injured, again approximately five-hundredths of 1 percent ‚Äì 0.0004. However, accusations of cruelty in the USA persist. The PRCA acknowledges that they only sanction about 30 percent of all rodeos, while another 50 percent are sanctioned by other organizations and 20 percent are completely unsanctioned. Several animal rights organizations keep records of accidents and incidents of possible animal abuse. They cite various specific incidents of injury to support their statements,Renate Robey, \\"Horse Euthanized After Show Accident,\\" Denver Post 16 January 1999. and also point to examples of long-term breakdown,Steve Lipsher, \\"Veterinarian Calls Rodeos Brutal to Stock,\\" Denver Post 20 January 1991. as well as reporting on injuries and deaths suffered by animals in non-rodeo events staged on the periphery of professional rodeo such as chuck wagon races and \\"suicide runs\\". While in terms of actual statistics on animal injury rate, there appear to be no more recent independent studies on animal injury in rodeo than the 1994 study, groups such as PETA gather anecdotal reports such as one from a 2010 rodeo in Colorado alleging eleven animal injuries, of which two were fatal. There are economic incentives to keep animals healthy enough for continuing rodeo participation. Bucking horses and bulls are costly to replace: a proven bucking horse can be sold for $8000 to $10,000, making \\"rough stock\\" an investment worth caring for and keeping in good health for many years. Health regulations also mandate vaccinations and blood testing of horses crossing state lines. An injured animal will not buck well and hence a cowboy cannot obtain a high score for his ride, so sick or injured animals are not run through the chutes, but instead are given appropriate veterinary care so they can be returned to their usual level of strength and power. PRCA regulations require veterinarians to be available at all rodeos to treat both bucking stock and other animals as needed. The PRCA requires a veterinarian be at all sanctioned rodeos. Activists also express concern that many rodeo horses end their lives as horsemeat. While it is accurate that some rough stock animals are slaughtered for horsemeat at the end of their useful careers, other bucking horses are retired at the end of their rodeo usefulness and allowed to live into old age. The issue of horse slaughter crosses all equestrian disciplines and is not confined solely to the rodeo industry. Any unwanted horse can meet this fate, including race horses, show horses, or even backyard pasture pets. Over the years, some states imposed regulation upon certain techniques and tools used in rodeos. In 2000, California became the first state to prohibit the use of cattle prods on animals in the chute. The city of Pittsburgh prohibited the use of flank straps as well as prods or shocking devices, wire tie-downs, and sharpened or fixed spurs or rowels at rodeos or rodeo-related events. Some other cities and states have passed similar prohibitions. Under PRCA guidelines, electric prods may not deliver a shock stronger than can be produced from two D batteries. Prods are allowed as long as the situation requires them to protect the people or the animals. =Flank strap controversy= A \\"flank strap\\" (or, \\"bucking strap\\") is used to encourage the horse to kick out straighter and higher when it bucks. The flank strap is about 4 inches wide, covered in sheepskin or neoprene and fastens behind the widest part of the abdomen. Flank straps that hurt the horse are not allowed by rodeo rules in the United States. However, a bucking strap has to be an incentive, not a prod, or the horse will quickly sour and refuse to work. A horse in pain will become sullen and not buck very well, and harm to the genitalia is anatomically impossible because the stifle joint of the hind leg limits how far back a flank strap can be attached. People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals (PETA) has stated that burrs and other irritants are at times placed under the flank strap and that improperly used flank straps can cause open wounds and burns if the hair is rubbed off and the skin is chafed raw. However, while the implied argument behind this claim is that pain is what makes the horse buck, in actual practice, irritants or pain generally interfere with a horse's ability to buck in an energetic and athletic fashion.

Personal life  Jakob Ammann was born on 12 February 1644 in Erlenbach im Simmental, Canton of Bern, Switzerland, to Michael and Anna (n√©e Rupp) Ammann. Erlenbach church records note the baptism of a Jacob Ammann on 12 February 1644, who was probably the Jakob Ammann from whom the Amish received their name. His grandfather has been identified as Ulrich Ammann. All three Ammanns were tailors. Jakob was third in a family of six children. He probably received limited formal education. On 37 official documents signed by Jakob, only his initials appear, with most of them having a nearby note that Jakob was not able to write, so he only \\"made his mark\\". However, on three documents, his signed name does appear, although twice it was probably written for him by someone else; once, with the same style of writing as his initials, appear the poorly formed letters \\"J. AMME\\", which is assumed to be his own writing. Because he asked for letters to be read in one meeting, it is assumed he was not able to read, or possibly only poorly. He did better financially than the average person of his time.

They had at least one daughter and one son, Baltz. Jakob‚Äôs father and one of his sisters also joined the Anabaptist movement. His brother Ulli, 18 years his junior, was also an Anabaptist and is known for his moderating tone in the attempts at reconciliation between the Amish and Reist sides. View of Simmental valley, birthplace of Jakob Ammann = Conversion to Anabaptism = On 12 March 1671 he is noted as the sponsor for a baptism in the state church. In June 1680, government correspondence from Oberhofen asked counsel from authorities in Bern on how to deal with a Jakob Ammann who had \\"become infected with the Anabaptist sect\\". This is the first known reference to Ammann as an Anabaptist. This indicates a conversion to Anabaptism sometime between 1671 and 1680. Sometime between his conversion and 1693 he was ordained to the ministry, possibly by Hans Reist, who would later become one of his greatest opponents. By 1693, Ammann had moved from Switzerland to Heidolsheim, Alsace, where his father died and was buried in the neighboring village of Baldenheim. Apparently shortly after the death of his father, he moved to the head of the valley at La Petite Li√®pvre, near Sainte-Marie-aux-Mines, France, remaining there until October 1712 when all the Anabaptists in the area were expelled by an edict of Louis XIV. After this date, no more records concerning Jakob Ammann have been found. He probably went to live with friends or relatives somewhere in Lower Alsace. = Death = The date and place of Ammann's death are unknown, but in 1730 his daughter requested baptism in the Reformed Church in Erlenbach and stated that her father had died. It is not recorded when or where the death had occurred.There is no record that the requested baptism took place. Ammann's involvement in church matters had dropped off considerably before his disappearance from the records in 1712, possibly from old age, since he would have been approaching 70 years of age when he moved away from the Sainte-Marie-aux-Mines area.  Theology and practice  Because of scarcity of materials, very little is known of Jakob Ammann‚Äôs teaching and day-to-day life. Three letters comprise the whole of his first-hand accounts of his thoughts.This sparsity is probably due to his inability to write. The extant letters were probably dictated. Other letters accuse Jakob of teaching or holding various viewpoints, but since many of these letters were written by his opponents it is not clear how much bias the accusations contain. From Jakob‚Äôs letters, it can be learned that he was a firm disciplinarian, uncompromising in what he believed, and expected others to \\"conform to the teachings of Christ and His apostles\\". His rejection of the \\"good-hearted\\" stemmed from his belief that whoever accepted the \\"true saving faith\\" would be baptized upon that faith, cost what it may. They would \\"forsake the world\\" and practice a very practical separation in their everyday life. Jakob was willing to disregard longstanding customs and practices if they were not founded on God‚Äôs Word. He denied that he was trying to start a \\"new faith\\". He believed in a new birth experience that would radically change a person. He wrote: > If a miser does not turn from his fornication, and a drunkard from his > drunkenness, or other immoralities, they are thereby separated from the > kingdom of God, and if he does not improve himself through a pious, penitent > life, such a person is no Christian and will not inherit the Kingdom of God. In practical matters, he stood opposed to long hair on men, shaved beards, and clothing that manifested pride. Liars were to be excommunicated. Ammann, unlike most Amish married men of today, however, had a mustache, which is largely forbidden today in the faith.  Schism  Jakob Ammann is known because of his prominent involvement in a schism among the Swiss Brethren that began in 1693. Until recent decades, he was often heavily blamed for the division, being portrayed as an angry, harsh, and demanding leader who imposed his views on others.It needs to be considered that the Amish side of the division did not publish much about the event, while the other side of the story was published, creating a basically one-sided version that was passed down from generation to generation. With the publication of some of the correspondence from the period (beginning in 1950, with Mast‚Äôs \\"Amish Letters\\") and the uncovering of new evidence, Ammann‚Äôs reputation has received a more positive appraisal among some researchers. Because of their prominent roles, Jakob Ammann and Hans Reist have been used to characterize the two sides of the schism, but the issues were broader than the two most prominent men involved. = Background = In the mid-1600s, a fresh influx of converts came into Swiss Anabaptism. The Reformed pastor at Burgdorf even complained that half of the people in the villages in his area were either Anabaptist or deeply sympathetic to their cause. These fresh converts‚Äîzealous for their new faith‚Äîwere in fact a sort of new movement within Swiss Anabaptism. Of the nearly 200 surnames among the Amish in the 1690s, only a very few were found in the Reist side, indicating that the two sides formed mostly around two groups of people with different origins. Because of persecution, many Swiss Brethren families had emigrated or been evicted from Swiss territory into the Alsace and Palatinate before the division. The civil authorities tended to be more lenient in the new locations, and in some cases welcomed the newcomers as they were looking for people to develop their lands. This emigration tended to create a different environment than the Swiss who had not emigrated were experiencing, making some of the issues come to the fore. Another important aspect in the schism was a conference held at Ohnenheim, Alsace, by several Swiss Brethren ministers and elders in 1660, in which they formally adopted the Dordrecht Confession of Faith that had been drawn up by Dutch Mennonites. Until this time, the Swiss Brethren (who did not use the name \\"Mennonite\\" for themselves) had no official confession of faith beyond the Schleitheim Confession.The Schleitheim Confession was not an official confession of faith, but rather a statement of some points upon which those attending that conference had agreed upon. The Dordrecht Confession contained two points that the Swiss Brethren had not historically practiced: foot washing (Article XI) and social avoidance (including not eating meals with those who had been shunned) (Article XVII). Swiss Brethren had practiced excommunication and a refusal to \\"eat\\" the [Lord's Supper] with those banned, but their avoidance did not include refraining from eating regular meals with those in the bann. These two issues, foot washing and not eating \\"physical\\" meals with the excommunicated, would be at the core of the schism. = Beginning = In 1693, Jakob Ammann, \\"together with the ministers and elders,\\" sent a general letter to people within the Swiss Brethren congregations, asking for a meeting in which he wanted clarification about where they stood on three issues: 1) Shunning those who had been banned, 2) whether liars should be excommunicated, and 3) if people could be saved who did not follow God‚Äôs word. This last issue was referring to the \\"good-hearted\\", meaning those who sympathized with the Anabaptists and even helped them materially in times of persecution, but who would not take the step of rebaptism.So as to escape persecution, since rebaptism was illegal. Those siding with Ammann felt that these \\"good-hearted\\" people should not be looked upon and consoled as \\"saved\\" unless they took up the cross and followed Christ in rebaptism and obedience to his teachings. Along with feetwashing, these three issues were at the core of the division. However, other issues surfaced during the discussions in the following years, including frequency of communionThe Amish side wanted it twice per year so that women who missed because of pregnancy could have more than one opportunity per year. Historically the Swiss Brethren had only practiced communion once per year. and how church discipline should be conducted.Historically, the Swiss Brethren had a more congregational approach, where the whole congregation approved of matters like excommunications. The Dutch Mennonites tended to give more authority to ministers. Another issue mentioned during the time of the schism was the establishment of stricter regulations concerning dress and beard styles. However, social avoidance of banned individuals was the most controversial of all the issues, and thus it has sometimes been erroneously considered as the only cause of the schism. = Excommunications = Jakob Ammann and Nicolas Augsburger were chosen by a ministerial committee to travel to Switzerland for a meeting with church leaders to find out where the Swiss congregations stood on the disputed issues. At first, a few of the Swiss ministers agreed with Ammann‚Äôs view, but in a later meeting Hans Reist would not agree with social avoidance, using Matthew 15:17 as a basis for \\"what enters the mouth is no sin.\\" Another meeting was called, in which Hans Reist did not show up, saying he was busy. At this point, Jakob Ammann became irritated (verdreiszlich)This word has been translated to English as \\"enraged\\", (Roth and Mast) thus giving Jakob the reputation of having lost his anger. Leroy Beachy prefers \\"annoyed\\". The exact level of Ammann‚Äôs \\"vexation\\" is, of course, unknown. and then proceeded to announce that Hans Reist was excommunicated on six points. When Ammann questioned some of the other Swiss ministers at the meeting where they stood on the issues, they pleaded for time to consult with their congregations. Ammann saw this as a turning back, since some of them had previously expressed agreement with his side. He then proceeded to announce the excommunication of six of the present ministers. Amman and the four men with him then left \\"without shaking hands with anyone.\\" These excommunications created a definite breach within the Swiss Brethren movement. The Reist side eventually excommunicated the Ammann side as well. = Attempts at reconciliation = Within a few years, several attempts were made at reconciliation. In February 1700, Jakob Ammann and several of his co-ministers removed the ban from the Swiss ministers and excommunicated themselves in recognition that they had acted too rashly and had \\"grievously erred.\\" They did not feel that they were in error concerning the issues they had brought up, but rather that they had not given sufficient time for the Reist side to consider the issues before excommunicating them. Also, they felt that they should not have excommunicated the Swiss ministers on the spot, but should have consulted with the whole congregation before proceeding. However, while Hans Reist and some of the Swiss ministers appear to have accepted the repentance of Ammann and his co- workers, they held firm to their position of not accepting social shunning. Some of the other issues had been accepted by the Swiss ministers, but the main body of Amish and the Reist side were never able to reconcile on the issue of social shunning. Today in North America, the Amish and Mennonites (the Reist side became known as Mennonites after the schism; in a paradox, it was the Amish side that was pushing for the introduction of Dutch Mennonite ideas, but those opposing the ideas eventually became known as Mennonites) live side by side in many communities and work together peacefully in publishing,See the weekly Amish newspaper Die Botschaft, which only accepts \\"scribes\\" from \\"Team Mennonites and Old Order Amish\\". businesses, and charitable aid projects. However, official sharing of ministry and communion is rare among the most conservative groups of Old Order Amish and Mennonites. In more moderate groups, there remains little to no effect from the schism, with the exception of names of churches.  References   Further reading  * Steven M. Nolt, A History of the Amish, rev. ed.

Origin  The Confession is thought to have been written by Michael Sattler. J. Philip Wogaman, Douglas M. Strong, Readings in Christian Ethics: A Historical Sourcebook, Westminster John Knox Press, USA, 1996, p. 141 The South German Ordnung of approximately the same date is similar to that of the Schleitheim Confession but contains many more Biblical references supporting the confession. The Schleitheim confession continues to be a guide for churches such as the Bruderhof and the Hutterites, who trace their spiritual heritage back to the Radical Reformation and the Anabaptists.  Doctrine  The Confession consisted of seven articles, written during a time of severe persecution Donald B. Kraybill, Concise Encyclopedia of Amish, Brethren, Hutterites, and Mennonites, JHU Press, USA, 2010, p. 184: ;Baptism: Baptism is administered to those who have consciously repented and amended their lives and believe that Christ has died for their sins and who request it for themselves (believer's baptism). Infant baptism is specifically denounced. ;The Ban (Excommunication): A Christian should live with discipline and walk in the way of righteousness. Those who slip and fall into sin should be admonished twice in secret, but the third offense should be openly disciplined and banned as a final recourse. This should always occur prior to the breaking of the bread. ;Breaking of Bread (Communion): Only those who have been baptized can take part in communion. Participation in Communion is a remembrance of Christ's body and blood; the real body and blood of Christ is not present in the sacrament.. ;Separation from Evil: The community of Christians shall have no association with those who remain in disobedience and a spirit of rebellion against God. There can be no fellowship with the wicked in the world; there can be no participation in works, church services, meetings and civil affairs of those who live in contradiction to the commands of God (Catholics and Protestants). All evil must be put away, including using weapons of force such as the sword and armor. ;Pastors in the Church: Pastors should be men of good repute. Some of the responsibilities they must faithfully carry out are teaching, disciplining, the ban, leading in prayer, and the sacraments. They are to be supported by the church, but must also be disciplined if they sin. ;The Sword (Christian pacifism) - nonresistance: Violence must not be used in any circumstance. The way of nonviolence is patterned after the example of Christ who never exhibited violence in the face of persecution or as a punishment for sin. A Christian should not pass judgment in worldly disputes. It is not appropriate for a Christian to serve as a magistrate; a magistrate acts according to the rules of the world, not according to the rules of heaven; their weapons are worldly, but the weapons of a Christian are spiritual. ; The Oath: No oaths should be taken because Jesus prohibited the taking of oaths and swearing. Testifying is not the same thing as swearing. When a person bears testimony, they are testifying about the present, whether it be good or evil..

A rodeo clown, bullfighter (in the United States, Canada, Australia and New Zealand) or rodeo protection athlete, is a rodeo performer who works in bull riding competitions. Originally, the rodeo clown was a single job combining \\"bullfighting\\"‚Äîthe protection of riders thrown from the bull, as well as being an individual who provided comic relief. Today in the United States, the job is split into two separate ones: bullfighters who protect the riders from the bull, and entertainers (barrelmen) who provides comic humor. However, in other parts of the world and at some small rodeos, the jobs of rodeo rider protection and comic remain combined. Tasks and skills The primary job of the rodeo bullfighter is to protect a fallen rider from the bull by distracting it and providing an alternative target for the bull to attack, whether the rider has been bucked off or has jumped off the animal. These individuals expose themselves to great danger in order to protect the riders. To this end, they wear bright, loose-fitting clothes that are designed to tear away, with protective gear fitted underneath.Groves, Melody; \\"Ropes, Reins and Rawhide\\", University of New Mexico Press, 2006, Rodeo clowns require speed, agility, and the ability to anticipate a bull's next move. Working closely with very large, very powerful animals, rodeo clowns are often injured seriously, and, sometimes, fatally. Most rodeos feature a clown, and clowns have become crowd favorites. In some venues, rodeo bullfighters still wear clown make-up and some may also provide traditional clowning entertainment for the crowd between rodeo events, often parodying aspects of cowboy culture. But most modern bullfighters no longer dress as clowns, though they still wear bright, loose-fitting clothing. At larger events in the USA, the job is split, a bullfighter (sometimes two or more) protects the riders from the bull, and a barrelman (sometimes one person, sometimes two) provide comic humor. Some barrelmen provide both comedy and support to bullfighters, but the job of a bullfighter is generally distinct from that of the comic. History Rodeo clowns date to the beginnings of competitive rodeo in the early 1900s, when promoters hired cowboys to entertain the crowd between events or if the competition was delayed. These individuals began wearing oversized, baggy clothing and eventually developed more outlandish gear. When bull riding competition began to use ill-tempered Brahma bulls in the 1920s, the need for a person to distract the bull from fallen riders fell to the rodeo clown. The use of a barrel for protection began during the 1930s when a rodeo clown named Jasbo Fulkerson began to use a wooden barrel with a solid bottom.Hollman, Holly. \\"Clowning around in arena is a century-old tradition\\" Decatur Daily, March 26, 2007 In 1995, Earl W. Bascom was honored at age 89 as the oldest living rodeo clown in the world.Vernal Express (August 30, 1995) \\"World's oldest living rodeo clown and bullfighter dies\\" Bullfighting was reported as Wick Peth's profession in 1967, and Jimmy Anderson was reported to have begun his career in 1975. In Australia, rodeo clowns were a part of rodeos and agricultural shows for many years. They were hired to entertain the spectators between events and to help manage the bullocks, steers or bulls in the arena.Hicks Jenny, ‚ÄúAustralian Cowboys, Roughriders & Rodeos‚Äù, CQU Press, Rockhampton, QLD, 2000 In the 1930s, with the introduction of aggressive Brahman bulls and Brahman crossbreds, the job became much more serious. In the late 20th century, acknowledging the great danger faced by the profession, the term bullfighter began to replace the name rodeo clown in formal use. The comedy aspect of clown work, as opposed to protection of rodeo athletes, began to disappear in some parts of the USA by the late 1970s. In 2003, bullfighters in the Professional Bull Riders (PBR) organization stopped wearing traditional rodeo clown make-up & outfits, and traded them for sport jerseys & shorts with corporate sponsor logos. This was also the case for barrelmen in the PBR, but they retained their make-up. Technique The bullfighters enter the rodeo arena on foot, before the bull is released from the bucking chute. They stand on either side of the chute as the bull is released and work as a team to distract the bull and thus protect the rider and each other. Their role is particularly important when a rider has been injured, in which case the bullfighter interposes himself between the bull and the rider, or uses techniques such as running off at an angle, throwing a hat, or shouting, so that the injured rider can exit the ring. Bullfighters are an extremely important asset to the bull rider, and will at times put their lives on the line to preserve the bull riders. When a rider has been hung up, they face the extremely dangerous task of trying to free him, with one team member going to the bull's head and the other attempting to release the rider. Typically, at larger rodeos, bullfighters work in groups of as little as two, and as many as four. The barrelman uses a large, well-padded steel barrel that he can jump in and out of easily, and the barrel helps to protect him from the bull. In Australia, barrelmen generally do not use barrels. A rodeo bullfighter‚Äôs job can be quite dangerous, as in this example of one being gored by a bucking bull. All members of the protection team wear loose, baggy clothing. The comic may wear the most outlandish clothing in bright colors, which may include things like wearing an inflatable female costume, and uses noisy colorful props such as rubber chickens and exploding garbage cans. Typically, the barrelman carries a microphone and heckles the rodeo announcer, the crowd and anyone else he recognizes. During the bull riding event, the barrelman supports the bullfighters, including taunting the bulls by calling them names and waving props at them, usually from within the safety of the barrel. Barrelmen may also tell jokes and use topical humor. Freestyle Bullfighting Bullfighting has grown in popularity, so that in addition to being a job in its own right, it is a competitive event at rodeos around the United States. When not working to protect bull riders, rodeo bullfighters also have their own performances known as Freestyle bullfighting or American bullfighting.Professional Bullfighters Instead of bucking bulls, fighting bulls are used in these events. They are turned into the arena and the bullfighter works with the animal, evaluated based upon the aptitude he displays in controlling and maneuvering the bull, precision in jumping the bull, contact with the bull, and handling of the barrel. Similar skills are sometimes displayed at traditional rodeos in intermission acts. A typical format is a 60- or 70-second encounter between bull and bullfighter, in which the bullfighter scores points for various maneuvers. In contrast to the older sport of Spanish bullfighting, no harm is done to the bull in rodeo bullfighting. Recognition Since 2015, the Bullfighters Only Tour has crowned a definitive world champion each December in Las Vegas. From 1981‚Äì2000, Wrangler Jeans sponsored the Bullfighter of the Year contest at the National Finals Rodeo, The California Cowboys Professional Rodeo Association designates a Bullfighter of the Year annually. Other titles include the American Cowboys Association Freestyle Bullfighting Champion and the Ultimate Challenge Freestyle Bullfighting Champion. Schools exist to provide training for potential rodeo bullfighters. See also *Rob Smets *Jimmy Anderson *Flint Rasmussen *Earl W.

The first television channel to be aimed specifically at a Welsh-speaking audience, S4C is the fourth-oldest terrestrial television channel in the United Kingdom after BBC One, ITV and BBC Two. As of 2019‚Äì2020, S4C had an average of 101 employees. S4C's headquarters is based in Carmarthen, at the University of Wales Trinity Saint David‚Äôs creative and digital centre, Yr Egin. It also has regional offices in Caernarfon and Cardiff. When first established, the channel‚Äîinitially broadcast on analogue television‚Äîwas bilingual (Welsh and English) outside peak hours, with English-language content consisting of the simultaneous or deferred transmission of programmes from Channel 4 (analogue reception of which was unavailable in most of Wales). When digital terrestrial television arrived several years later, S4C added a second, full-time Welsh-language channel called S4C Digidol (\\"digital\\") on 1 November 1998. With the completion of the digital switchover in Wales on 31 March 2010 which made English- language Channel 4 available across Wales as S4C's bilingual analogue channel closed, and what had been S4C Digidol became the default S4C channel, available on Freeview and pay television, and broadcasting entirely in Welsh. S4C does not commission programming in English, but when English is used on the channel it is left untranslated. Moreover, the channel includes an English subtitle track available for some programmes, which can be accessed using their television set's remote control. Pre-history Before the launch of S4C on Monday 1 November 1982 (one day before Channel 4 in the rest of the UK), Welsh speakers had been served by occasional programmes in Welsh, broadcast as regional opt-outs on BBC Cymru Wales and HTV Cymru Wales (the ITV franchise in Wales), usually at off-peak or inconvenient times. This was unsatisfactory for Welsh speakers, who saw the arrangement as a sop, and at the same time an annoyance for non-Welsh speakers, who found the English language programmes seen in the rest of the UK often rescheduled or not transmitted at all. On 14 September 1962, the ITV network had created a licence area for North and West Wales, which was awarded to Wales (West and North) Limited. This traded as Teledu Cymru and provided significant levels of Welsh-language programming. However, problems with transmission infrastructure and poor market research led to financial difficulties within two years and the station was taken over by its neighbour Television Wales and the West. During the 1970s, Welsh-language activists had campaigned for a TV service in the language, which already had its own radio station, BBC Radio Cymru. Both the Conservative and Labour parties promised a Welsh-language fourth channel, if elected to government in the 1979 general election. Shortly after the Conservatives won a majority in the election, the new Home Secretary William Whitelaw decided against a Welsh fourth channel, and suggested that, except for an occasional opt-out, the service should be the same as that offered in the rest of the UK. This led to acts of civil disobedience, including refusals to pay the television licence fee, thereby running the risk of prosecution or even a prison sentence, and sit-ins in BBC and HTV studios. Some took more extreme measures, including attacking television transmitters in Welsh- speaking areas. On 17 September 1980, the former president of Plaid Cymru, Gwynfor Evans, threatened to go on hunger strike if the Conservative government of Margaret Thatcher did not honour its commitment to provide a Welsh-language TV service. The channel started broadcasting on 1 November 1982, the night before Channel 4's opening. Programming S4C's remit is to provide a service which features a wide range of programmes in the Welsh language. Like Channel 4, S4C does not produce programmes of its own; instead, it commissions programmes from BBC Cymru Wales and independent producers (although the quantity purchased from ITV Cymru Wales has greatly reduced since the early years of S4C), and it has particularly developed a reputation for commissioning children's animation, such as SuperTed, Rocky Hollow, Fireman Sam (also broadcast by the BBC), Gogs, Shakespeare: The Animated Tales and the 1992-1996 French co-production Natalie. BBC Wales fulfils its public service requirement by producing programmes in Welsh, including Newyddion, S4C's news bulletin, and a soap opera, Pobol y Cwm, and providing them to S4C free of charge. It has also provided (or licensed) Welsh-language versions of English-language programmes, such as the original Teletubbies. On the analogue service, S4C showed programmes produced for Channel 4 in the rest of the United Kingdom ‚Äì either simultaneously or time-shifted ‚Äì outside of peak hours. These programmes were provided to S4C by Channel 4, free of charge. To make content more accessible to English speakers, all Welsh-language programming carries English subtitles. Originally these were on Teletext page 888, with Welsh subtitles on page 889, with both subtitle languages now also available on digital television platforms. For speakers of English who are learning Welsh, certain programmes, particularly children's programmes Planed Plant Bach (now Cyw) and Planed Plant (now Stwnsh), carry subtitles featuring Welsh subtitles with additional English translations in brackets next to more difficult Welsh-language words. TV films produced for S4C have received some good foreign reviews; Hedd Wyn was nominated for the Best Foreign Language Oscar in 1994 and Solomon & Gaenor was nominated in 2000. The S4C analogue signal also spilled over on to the east coast of the Republic of Ireland. In the past it was rebroadcast in a number of areas there on UHF terrestrial signals by so-called 'deflectors'. Up until the 1990s, S4C was also carried by some Irish cable and MMDS providers before being replaced by Channel 4. The S4C channels continue to be available in the Republic of Ireland via the Freesat satellite service. Up until 2009, S4C ran its own teletext service, Sbectel (\\"Sbec\\", Welsh for \\"a peek\\" or \\"a glimpse\\", and a reference to an S4C schedule insert formerly included in the TVTimes issues for the HTV Wales region).  Viewing figures  11.5 million people throughout the UK watched S4C on television at some time during 2019‚Äì2020. On average, 702,000 people throughout the UK watched the channel on TV every week. On an average week in 2019-2020, approximately 306,000 viewers in Wales watched the channel on television for at least three consecutive minutes. 142,000 Welsh speakers in Wales watched S4C each week during this period. The programme that enjoyed the channel's highest viewing figures in 2019-2020 was Sgorio's coverage of Wales' Euro 2020 qualifier match against Hungary in November 2019, which drew 366,000 viewers. There were also 38.2 million viewing sessions of S4C content on Facebook, Twitter and YouTube in 2018‚Äì2019, with 8.6 million viewing sessions of S4C content on S4C Arlein and BBC iPlayer. Digital channels Following the switch-off of analogue terrestrial signals on 31 March 2010, Wales became the first fully digital region in the UK, with both S4C and Channel 4 becoming available to all homes. As a result, S4C now broadcasts solely in the Welsh language and, as well as on Freeview in Wales, is available throughout Britain, Ireland and the rest of western Europe on Freesat and Sky. A review commissioned by the Department for Culture, Media and Sport in 2004 suggested that \\"S4C should operate a single core service after digital switchover\\". Logo of the former channel S4C2 In addition, S4C also operated a sister channel, S4C2 until 2010. It formerly broadcast coverage of the National Assembly for Wales when in session. The programme content was provided by the BBC who, from January 2010, now make it available online and via BBC Parliament. Like the main channel, S4C2 was available within Wales on Freeview and throughout the UK and Ireland on Freesat and Sky. S4C2 had two audio feeds, allowing viewers to select between an untranslated version and an English-only version where all Welsh spoken is translated into English. Delayed coverage of Assembly proceedings is now broadcast overnight on S4C's main channel on Tuesdays, Wednesdays and Thursdays. In addition to the analogue TV signal transmitted throughout Wales, S4C, along with United News & Media, owned the company S4C Digital Networks (SDN). SDN was awarded the UK-wide contract to provide half a digital multiplex worth of programming. The other half continues to belong to the broadcaster Channel 5. On 27 April 2005, S4C sold its share of SDN to ITV plc for approximately ¬£34 million, though it still has the half-multiplex as of right in Wales. ITV already owned some of SDN due to the consolidation of the ITV industry: Granada bought UNM's stake in SDN, and this was then incorporated into the united ITV plc. In January 2007, S4C announced plans to launch a Welsh-language children's service. The new service, in the form of a programming block, launched on 23 June 2008. Under the name Cyw (chick), it brings together a wide range of programmes for nursery-age children, and S4C plans eventually to extend the service to include the Stwnsh strand for older children and a third service for teenagers and young people. The service currently airs on weekdays from 7 am to 1.30 pm on S4C. S4C launched a high- definition simulcast of S4C called 'Clirlun' on 19 July 2010 to coincide with terrestrial digital switchover in Wales. Clirlun was broadcast on Freeview channel 53 only, and not via other platforms. However, following funding cuts and a review of core services it was announced on 11 July 2012 that Clirlun would close before the end of the year. Clirlun closed at midnight on the evening of 1 December 2012, with Channel 4 HD taking over its transmission capacity with effect from the next day, 2 December 2012. It was announced on 20 May 2016 that S4C would relaunch a high-definition service S4C HD on Freesat and Sky in Wales and across the UK from 7 June onwards. In December 2014, S4C became available on the BBC iPlayer website, both live and on demand, as part of an 18-month trial. Presentation =1982‚Äì1987= S4C's first logo, used from 1 November 1982 to May 1987 S4C launched on 1 November 1982 (the day before Channel 4 started in the UK), it's on-air appearance has always been a representation of the Welsh society and people, but this representation has changed several times. Initial idents featured clips from the natural landscapes of Wales with a basic logo animation and fanfare, with the logo forming as WALES4CYMRU. =1987‚Äì1993= S4C's second logo, used from May 1987 to 9 February 1995 In May 1987, the ident changed to a computer- generated ident featuring an animation of the streamlined S4C logo and the colours of the logo were blue, green and red. The font used for this logo was Bodoni Bold. On 7 September 1990, the new ident was introduced, depicting a piece of Welsh slate with colours blue, green and red washing over the letters S4C. =1993‚Äì2007= S4C's third logo, used from 10 February 1995 to 17 January 2007 On 5 September 1993, S4C introduced a new series of idents, which depicted inanimate objects as having characteristics of dragons (such as flight or breathing fire), as a reference to the red dragon on the flag of Wales. On 10 February 1995, the channel introduced a new logo, featuring a tilde representing a dragon. =2007‚Äì2014= S4C's fourth logo, used from 18 January 2007 to 9 April 2014 On 18 January 2007, S4C announced that their digital channels would be refreshed with a new corporate logo and brand. The new branding was implemented online on 17 January, with S4C's television channels adopting it the next day. The new branding, developed by the London- based firm Proud Creative, was intended to portray S4C as a more \\"contemporary\\" multi-platform broadcaster, and downplayed \\"traditional\\" Welsh imagery such as dragons. Its idents were filmed around various parts of the country, and themed around magnetism‚Äîrepresenting the \\"uncontrollable attraction\\" of Welsh people and their \\"emotional affinity to the homeland, whether near or far\\". The magnetism-themed idents were later accompanied by a new set developed in collaboration with the agency Minivegas, consisting of live-action scenes with dynamic, animated elements that can react to the voice of the continuity announcer. =2014‚Äìpresent= A new S4C logo and brand developed by Sugar Creative Studio was introduced on 10 April 2014; the new design was developed around a concept of providing \\"context\\" to S4C's target audience and programming. The design revolves heavily around a trapezium shape used within the channel's new logo, which is prominently used within aspects of the channel's overall marketing and branding. Criticisms S4C has faced criticism for poor viewing figures since its launch. Leaked internal reports in March 2010 showed that \\"over the 20-day period from February 15 to last Saturday, March 6, as many as 196 of the 890 programmes put out by S4C were rated as having zero viewers\\". The story was widely reported across the UK and referenced in parliament by the then Culture Secretary Jeremy Hunt. In response, an S4C spokesperson stated that 90% of those programmes were aimed at pre-school children, and that BARB (the organisation that compiles television ratings in the UK) only takes into account viewers aged four years and over. The remaining 10% consisted of repeats and daytime news bulletins which did not attract the minimum 1,000 viewers necessary to register on a UK- wide analysis. On 28 July 2010, S4C's chief executive Iona Jones left her post without explanation. Assembly members and Members of Parliament requested an independent investigation into the circumstances leading up to her departure. The S4C Authority refused to comment further and commissioned a review into how the broadcaster was governed in August 2010. On 3 February 2011, it was announced that issues between Iona Jones and S4C had been settled. On 11 February 2011, the Shortridge Report on corporate governance was made public. (The English version begins at page 54.) Personnel S4C appointed its first female CEO, Iona Jones in 2005. , previously the deputy permanent secretary to the Welsh Government, became chief executive in October 2017. Funding and regulation From its inception S4C was part publicly-financed: funding came both from its advertising revenue and a fixed annual grant from the UK Department for Culture, Media and Sport (DCMS), receiving ¬£90m of funding in 2011. Additionally, some Welsh-language programming (including Newyddion and Pobol y Cwm) was produced by BBC Wales as part of the BBC's public service remit, and provided to S4C free of charge. There is an agreement in place until 2022 for 10 hours a week of programming to be provided to S4C, which is valued at ¬£19.4m annually. From 2013, responsibility for funding S4C began to transfer to the BBC, with the DCMS reducing its funding by 94% by 2015. The BBC will provide around ¬£76m of funding to S4C by this date, resulting in a cut of around 25% to S4C's annual budget. In 2016, it was agreed that the BBC would provide ¬£74.5m a year funding to S4C from the licence fee until 2022. The UK Government announced in 2018 that it would continue providing ¬£6.72m until 2020, with the aim of S4C being funded wholly from the licence fee from 2022. This would see S4C's funding being decided as part of the licence fee settlement, for 10 year periods. In addition to public funding, S4C generates around 2% of its income through commercial sources, such as advertising. S4C is controlled by the S4C Authority (Awdurdod S4C), an independent body unconnected to Ofcom, the regulator of other UK television channels such as ITV and Channel 4. Catch-up Screenshot of S4C's catch-up service, Clic S4C maintains its own catch-up service called Clic. Clic is a free online video on demand service which offers live-streaming, signed programming, a 35-day catch-up service, and archive programming. Clic is available across the UK but also contains a limited selection of worldwide programming. Clic's catch-up service is split into seven categories: Drama, Entertainment, Factual and Arts, Music, Sport, and two Children's categories, Cyw (ages 3‚Äì6) and Stwnsh (ages 7‚Äì13). A Clic app was released for Apple's iOS devices on 18 August 2011. In late 2014, S4C's programmes and live-streaming also became available to view on the BBC's catch-up service, BBC iPlayer. Both services offer English and Welsh subtitles to some shows. There were 8.2 million viewing sessions to S4C content on Clic and BBC iPlayer in 2017‚Äì2018. This was an increase of 600,000 from the 7.6 million viewing sessions on those platforms in 2016‚Äì2017.

(died 1552) was a Portuguese merchant, pharmacist, and official diplomat under the explorer and Portuguese Malacca governor Afonso de Albuquerque. His encounter with Ming China in 1517‚Äîafter initial contacts by Jorge √Ålvares and Rafael Perestrello in 1513 and 1516, respectively‚Äîmarked the resumption of direct European commercial and diplomatic contact with China. (Even though there were Europeans in Medieval China, notably Marco Polo, that period of contact had been interrupted by the fall of the Yuan dynasty.) Although de Andrade's mission was initially a success that allowed a Portuguese embassy to proceed all the way to Beijing, relations were soon spoiled by culminating events that led to an extremely negative impression of the Portuguese in China. This included acts of his brother Sim√£o that enraged the Chinese, false reports of the Portuguese being cannibals of kidnapped Chinese children and true reports of their conquest of Malacca, a loyal Ming tributary state. Normalized trade and relations between Portugal and the Ming dynasty would not resume until the late 1540s and the 1557 establishment of Portuguese rule over Macau. Andrade was referred to as a \\"Folangji\\" (‰ΩõÈÉéÊ©ü) in Ming dynastic archives. Folangji comes from Franques or Franks, which was a generic name the Muslims called Europeans since the Crusades, and which spawned the Indian-Southeast Asian term ferengi. The Chinese adopted the convention when they first thought the Portuguese were related to those Muslim guides and interpreters during Fern√£o's first encounter and before Europeans directly convened with Chinese. Voyages abroad =India, Sumatra, and Malacca= Afonso de Albuquerque, who launched the attack to conquer the Malacca Sultanate and commissioned the first direct European maritime contacts with China during the Ming dynasty. Fern√£o Pires de Andrade commanded a vessel in the naval venture of the Portuguese explorer and conqueror Afonso de Albuquerque from Cochin in India to conquer the Malacca Sultanate in 1511.Dion, 135. The Portuguese historian Jo√£o de Barros (1496-1570) wrote that when a violent storm arose as Albuquerque's fleet entered the vast waters between Sri Lanka and Aceh, a ship commanded by Sim√£o Martinho was sunk, but his entire crew was rescued by Fern√£o and taken aboard his ship. To make up for this loss, the Portuguese captured and commandeered five ships from Gujarat that were sailing between Malacca and Sumatra. The small fleet of Albuquerque engaged an enemy \\"junk\\" ship of the Malaccan \\"Moors\\" near an island between Lumut and Belawan.Dion, 138. According to Barros, they fought against this ship for two days. The enemy crew employed tactics of lighting fire to its own ship as a means to burn Albuquerque's ships as they employed ramming techniques and close-range volleys of artillery.Dion, 138-139. Although the ship surrendered; the Portuguese gained such an admiration for the junk and its crew that they nicknamed it O Bravo (The Brave Junk).Dion, 139. The Portuguese crew pleaded with Fern√£o Pires to convince Albuquerque that the crew should be spared and viewed vassals of Portugal who were simply unaware of who they were actually fighting. Albuquerque eventually agreed to this. While writing of Afonso de Albuquerque's ventures in Sumatra, Jo√£o de Barros noted that the Chinese were the first to control trade between Sumatra and India, and noted the presence of Chinese people living in Sumatra.Dion, 144. Barros also noted that while Fern√£o Pires was loading Southeast Asian spices onto his ship in Pacem (a kingdom in Sumatra) in order to sell or present them as gifts in China, two different kings were killed and their position usurped.Dion, 146. Apparently the usurpation of kings caused little tumult or crisis in this state, as Barros noted any leader there was believed by the locals not to have divine right to rule if he was able to be killed by a royal kinsman. Historian Mark Dion notes that Fern√£o related the same story in his writing, only adding that a Muslim in their society was the only acceptable replacement as ruler. =Initial contact with China= After the conquest of Malacca in 1511, not only did the Portuguese monopolize the European spice trade, but they also met and traded avidly with Chinese merchants. When Portuguese under Diogo Lopes de Sequeira had earlier arrived in Malacca in 1509 to open trade relations, he was supported by the local Chinese merchants there (along with Javanese and Tamil merchants).Wolff, 311. D'Albuquerque sent Jorge √Ålvares to explore northward; his expedition sailed along the coast of Guangdong in 1513 and hoisted a flag on \\"Tuen Mun island\\". This mission was followed up later that year by Rafael Perestrello, who later traded with Chinese merchants of Canton in 1516. He provided an enticing report to other Portuguese on the lucrative trade in China. This prompted Andrade to speed up the course of his mission while stalled in Malacca and debate with his crew on whether to go to China or Bengal.Wills, 336.Dames, 247. =Mission of Manuel I to China= Choosing the ambassadors Manuel I of Portugal, who commissioned Andrade's mission to China. King Manuel I authorized a trade mission in 1517 when Andrade set sail with seven cannon- armed merchant vessels with a Muslim interpreter on June 17, 1517. Andrade had been chosen for this mission in Lisbon back in 1515, so that‚Äîas a pharmacist‚Äîhe could investigate the types of pharmaceutical drugs used in East Asia for the benefit of the Portuguese and Europe. Florentine merchant Giovanni da Empoli, who had written a report about trade with China while stationed in India, was also chosen for the mission as the chief commercial agent between the Portuguese and Chinese. However, Giovanni would die in China during the early mission on October 15, 1517 when the ship he was on accidentally caught on fire.Dames, 211-212. Tom√© Pires, a royal apothecary who had also traveled to India and written a landmark work in 1515 on Asian trade, was chosen as the chief ambassador for the mission. First contact Although the mission was stalled once they lost a ship in the Strait of Malacca, they nonetheless landed at the Pearl River estuary on August 15 with eight ships and negotiated with Chinese officials for possible silk and porcelain trade at Canton. The Chinese naval commander of Nantou (under the jurisdiction of Zhongshan, located at the mouth of the Pearl River) stalled Andrade's small fleet of ships for an entire month while Andrade waited for permission to sail upriver to Canton.Wills, 337. After Andrade threatened to sail upriver without permission, the naval commander finally decided to let him pass, granting him pilots to assist his travel. Once the ships sailed into port at Canton, they alarmed the Chinese residents and officials there by discharging cannon fire, what they believed was a friendly salute since the Chinese merchants had done so when the Portuguese earlier arrived in Malacca. Chinese officials became even more cautious in dealing with the Portuguese, since the deposed King of Malacca had been a loyal tributary to the imperial Ming court. The Portuguese explained that in deposing the Malaccan king, they were helping the Chinese merchants there who were being oppressed under his rule. In the eyes of the Canton officials, this added further negative speculations about the Portuguese visitors, because private Chinese overseas trade was banned under the current hai jin laws that stated only the Chinese government could conduct foreign trade. The Ryukyu Islands, where Jorge de Mascarenhas was sent by Andrade. Although the local Canton officials watched the Portuguese and their ships closely, once the provincial authorities arrived at Canton they greeted the Portuguese with a warm reception, providing them comfortable lodgings and had their trade goods brought ashore. The Chinese became suspicious once again of Andrade, this time for being a spy, when he sent a ship along the Fujian coast to look for further trade prospects, but he left a good impression when he gave the order that any locals who might be harmed by a Portuguese should seek him for redress. Besides exploring Fujian, Andrade sent one of his captains named Jorge de Mascarenhas to explore the Ryukyu Islands after he heard of their beauty while stationed in Malacca.Nowell, 8. Andrade's brother and spoiled relations Sim√£o de Andrade, brother to Fern√£o Pires, sailed from Malacca to China with a small crew on three junks in August 1519.Wills, 337-338. Sim√£o immediately made a bad impression upon the Chinese when he built a fort at the center of Tuen Mun, an island designated for all foreigners to trade. Soon after, Sim√£o ceremoniously executed a Portuguese and barred other foreigners (mostly Siamese and other South East Asians) from trading on the island, which drew even more attention to him. When a Chinese official visited the island and began reasserting Ming authority over it, Sim√£o became aggressive and hit him, knocking the official's hat off.Wills, 338. The greatest offense to the Chinese was the supposed kidnapping of children by the Portuguese so they could eat them. In reality, Sim√£o had earned the Portuguese a bad reputation for buying young Chinese slaves, presumably some of whom were kidnapped after Sim√£o offered local Chinese huge sums of money for child slaves. In fact, some boys and girls from wealthy Chinese families were later found by Portuguese authorities at Diu in western India. However, there were no official reports of Sim√£o's abuses, even though he stayed until September 1520; yet rumors of his behavior (which became associated with all Portuguese) no doubt reached as far as the court of Beijing, which would soon condemn the Portuguese for this and other reasons. Although he had left Canton, Sim√£o de Andrade landed at Xiamen and Ningbo, establishing settlements there.Douglas, 11. Sim√£o continued to defy local Chinese laws at Ningbo, and when his men were cheated on a trade deal with a Chinese man in 1545, Sim√£o sent a band of armed men into the town, pillaged it, and took local women and young girls as their captives.Williams, 76. The outraged locals banded together and slaughtered the Portuguese under Sim√£o. A similar episode occurred later when Coelho de Sousa seized the house of a wealthy foreign resident in Jinzhou of Fujian, which led authorities to cut off supplies to the Portuguese; the Portuguese then attacked and ransacked a nearby village for supplies, which prompted Chinese authorities to destroy thirteen of their ships while thirty Portuguese survivors of this settlement fled to the Portuguese settlement at Macau in 1549.Douglas, 11-12. End of the mission The Zhengde Emperor, who accepted the Portuguese embassy but died before he could finalize relations with Portugal, hence dooming the embassy as conservative factions at court in Beijing were aligned against those who conquered the Ming's loyal tributary vassal in Malacca. The embassy party left behind in Canton in 1518 proceeded north in January 1520 with the rest of the Portuguese under Tom√© Pires and Fern√£o Pires de Andrade. The embassy reached Nanjing, where the Zhengde Emperor was touring in May 1520, granting the Portuguese embassy a quick audience. However, further diplomatic negotiations were to be resumed once the emperor returned to Beijing; hence, the Portuguese embassy was sent there to wait for the emperor's return. Although no Chinese sources detail the event, Portuguese sources tell of how the Portuguese were summoned on the first and fifteenth days of each lunar month to ceremoniously prostrate themselves before a wall of the Forbidden City to seek another audience with the emperor. From Beijing, the Portuguese embassy heard reports that the emperor reached Tongzhou in January 1521 and had the rebel Prince of Ning executed there. The Portuguese embassy had also become aware that ambassadors from the exiled King of Malacca were sent to Beijing seeking assistance from the Chinese emperor in expelling the conquering Portuguese so that their king could be reinstalled there. The Portuguese also knew of two officials in the Censorate‚ÄîQiu Daolong and He Ao‚Äî who sent memorials to the throne that condemned the Portuguese conquest of Malacca and that their embassy should be rejected.Wills, 338-339. There were also reports sent to Beijing by Canton officials stating that the Portuguese were bothersome foreigners who sought to build their own trading post. With the death of the Zhengde Emperor on April 19, 1521, mourning ceremonies were initiated that cancelled all other ceremonies, including the reception of foreign embassies.Wills, 339. The newly appointed Grand Secretary, Yang Tinghe, soon turned against the powerful eunuch influence at court, which had grown even more powerful under the Zhengde Emperor. Although Ming officials were of the opinion that only foreign tributary states listed during the beginning of the dynasty should be accepted at court, it was the eunuchs who wanted to expand commercial ties with new foreign countries. These desires were given free rein under the Zhengde Emperor, who was intrigued with and desired to learn about foreign and exotic peoples. However, with his death, eunuch influence at court was challenged by Yang Tinghe, who announced the rejection of the Portuguese embassy under Pires and Andrade the day after the emperor's death; the embassy was forced to leave and arrived back in Canton in September. =Open hostility to reopening of relations= Map of Macau Peninsula in 1639, long after the first Portuguese settlement there and in the same year that the city began to decline due to halt of trade shipments from Japan. Earlier, in April and May 1521, five Portuguese ships docked at Tuen Mun to begin trading, but were ordered to leave once officials came to the region to announce the emperor's death. The Portuguese refused this demand, so the Chinese sent a naval squadron to drive them out, sinking one ship, killing many, and taking the rest as prisoners (First Battle of Tamao). Two more Portuguese vessels arrived in June, were attacked by Chinese ships, but were able to fend off the Chinese attack. Three more Portuguese ships barely fended off another attack in September, the same month that Fern√£o Pires de Andrade and Tom√© Pires arrived back at Canton. Ming authorities would not permit Fern√£o and Pires to see the prisoners captured in the sea battles and made inventories of their goods and the goods captured from the Portuguese ships. In August 1522, Martim Afonso de Melo Coutinho arrived at Tuen Mun with three ships, unaware of the conflict and expecting to meet with Chinese officials on establishing consent for a Portuguese trade base in China.Wills, 340. Two of his ships were captured in a surprise Chinese attack, while the survivors escaped back to Portugal on the third ship (see Second Battle of Tamao).Madureira, 150. These encounters and others with the Portuguese brought the first breech-loading culverins into China, mentioned even by the philosopher and scholar-official Wang Yangming in 1519 when he suppressed Zhu Chenhao's rebellion in Jiangxi.Needham, Volume 5, Part 7, 369, 372, 374. The prisoners of these sea battles were eventually executed in 1523 for crimes of \\"robbery in the high seas\\" and cannibalism, while Tom√© Pires was kept prisoner so that he could write letters to the King of Portugal, the Viceroy of Portuguese India, and the Governor of Malacca conveying the new Ming emperor's message that the Portuguese should leave Malacca and restore it to the rightful rule of its deposed king. By some accounts, Fern√£o Pires de Andrade simply died while imprisoned; others say Andrade was one of those beheaded when a crime of false credentials was placed upon him after a court examined if his embassy was legitimate or spurious due to negative accounts of the Portuguese (i.e. acts committed by those such as Fern√£o Pires' brother Sim√†o).Williams, 76-77.Douglas, 10-11. Tom√© Pires died while living as a prisoner in China; there is speculation on whether Tom√© Pires died in 1524 or 1540.Madureira, 150-151. Two survivors of this embassy were still alive around 1536, when they sent letters to Malacca and Goa detailing plans for how the Portuguese could capture Canton by force. Other survivors of these missions retired to nearby Lampaco (Lampa) in Guangdong, where a trade post would exist for several decades; in 1537, there were written records of the Portuguese having three warehouses at Lampa, Shangchuan Island, and Macau, and were initially allowed there with the excuse of drying their goods in a storm. Despite initial hostilities, good relations between the Portuguese and Chinese would resume in 1549 with annual Portuguese trade missions to Shangchuan Island, following an event where the Portuguese helped Ming authorities eliminate coastal pirates.Brook, 124.Wills, 342. In 1554, Leonel de Sousa‚Äîa later Governor of Macau‚Äî established positive relations through an agreement with Cantonese authoritiesDenis Crispin Twitchett, John King Fairbank, The Cambridge history of China, Volume 2; Volume 8, Cambridge University Press, 1978, and in 1557 the Ming court finally gave consent for a permanent and official Portuguese trade base at Macau.Wills, 343-344. Although Fern√£o Pires de Andrade and his Portuguese comrades were the first to open up China to the West, another significant diplomatic mission reaching all the way to Beijing would not be carried out until an Italian, the Jesuit Matteo Ricci (1552-1610) ventured there in 1598.

(commonly called ATI, later known as Radeon Technologies Group) was a semiconductor technology corporation based in Markham, Ontario, Canada, that specialized in the development of graphics processing units and chipsets. Founded in 1985 as Array Technology Inc., the company listed publicly in 1993. Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) acquired ATI in 2006. As a major fabrication-less or fabless semiconductor company, ATI conducted research and development in-house and outsourced the manufacturing and assembly of its products. With the decline and eventual bankruptcy of 3dfx in 2000, ATI and its chief rival Nvidia emerged as the two dominant players in the graphics processors industry, eventually forcing other manufacturers into niche roles. The acquisition of ATI in 2006 was important to AMD's strategic development of its Fusion generation of computer processors, which integrated general processing abilities with graphics processing functions within a chip. Since 2010, AMD's graphics processor products have ceased using the ATI brand name. History Lee Ka Lau,University of Toronto Division of University Advancement page . Retrieved February 28, 2008. Francis Lau, Benny Lau, and Kwok Yuen Ho founded ATI in 1985 as Array Technology Inc. Working primarily in the OEM field, ATI produced integrated graphics cards for PC manufacturers such as IBM and Commodore. By 1987, ATI had grown into an independent graphics-card retailer, introducing EGA Wonder and VGA Wonder card product lines that year.History of AMD at AMD.com In the early nineties, they released products able to process graphics without the CPU: in May 1991, the Mach8, in 1992 the Mach32, which offered improved memory bandwidth and GUI acceleration. ATI Technologies Inc. went public in 1993, with shares listed on NASDAQ and on the Toronto Stock Exchange. ATI's former Silicon Valley office Hercules graphics.

This card uses the ISA 8-bit interface. ATI VGA Wonder with 256 KB RAM In 1994, the Mach64 accelerator debuted, powering the Graphics Xpression and Graphics Pro Turbo, offering hardware support for YUV-to-RGB color space conversion in addition to hardware zoom; early techniques of hardware-based video acceleration. ATI introduced its first combination of 2D and 3D accelerator under the name 3D Rage. This chip was based on the Mach 64, but it featured elemental 3D acceleration. The ATI Rage line powered almost the entire range of ATI graphics products. In particular, the Rage Pro was one of the first viable 2D-plus-3D alternatives to 3Dfx's 3D-only Voodoo chipset. 3D acceleration in the Rage line advanced from the basic functionality within the initial 3D Rage to a more advanced DirectX 6.0 accelerator in 1999 Rage 128. The All-in-Wonder product line, introduced in 1996, was the first combination of integrated graphics chip with TV tuner card and the first chip that enabled display of computer graphics on a TV set.History of AMD ‚Äì 1996 at AMD.com The cards featured 3D acceleration powered by ATI's 3D Rage II, 64-bit 2D performance, TV-quality video acceleration, analog video capture, TV tuner functionality, flicker-free TV-out and stereo TV audio reception. ATI entered the mobile computing sector by introducing 3D-graphics acceleration to laptops in 1996. The Mobility product line had to meet requirements different from those of desktop PCs, such as minimized power usage, reduced heat output, TMDS output capabilities for laptop screens, and maximized integration. In 1997, ATI acquired Tseng Labs's graphics assets, which included 40 engineers. The Radeon line of graphics products was unveiled in 2000. The initial Radeon graphics processing unit offered an all-new design with DirectX 7.0 3D acceleration, video acceleration, and 2D acceleration. Technology developed for a specific Radeon generation could be built in varying levels of features and performance in order to provide products suited for the entire market range, from high-end to budget to mobile versions. In 2000, ATI acquired ArtX, which engineered the Flipper graphics chip used in the Nintendo GameCube game console. They also created a modified version of the chip (codenamed Hollywood) for the successor of the GameCube, the Wii. Microsoft contracted ATI to design the graphics core (codenamed Xenos) for the Xbox 360. Later in 2005, ATI acquired Terayon's cable modem silicon intellectual property, strengthening their lead in the consumer digital television market.press release K. Y. Ho remained as Chairman of the Board until he retired in November 2005. Dave Orton replaced him as the President and CEO of the organization. On July 24, 2006, a joint announcement revealed that Advanced Micro Devices would acquire ATI in a deal valued at $5.6 billion. The acquisition consideration closed on October 25, 2006, and included over $2 billion financed from a loan and 56 million shares of AMD stock. ATI's operations became part of the AMD Graphics Product Group (GPG), and ATI's CEO Dave Orton became the Executive Vice President of Visual and Media Businesses at AMD until his resignation in 2007. The top-level management was reorganized with the Senior Vice President and General Manager, and the Senior Vice President and General Manager of Consumer Electronics Group, both of whom would report to the CEO of AMD. On 30 August 2010, John Trikola announced that AMD would retire the ATI brand for its graphics chipsets in favor of the AMD name. Products ATI's fictional character & mascot Ruby In addition to developing high-end GPUs (originally called a VPU, visual processing unit, by ATI) for PCs and Apple Macs, ATI also designed embedded versions for laptops (Mobility Radeon), PDAs and mobile phones (Imageon), integrated motherboards (Radeon IGP), and others. \\"Ruby\\", a fictional female character described as a \\"mercenary for hire\\", was created by ATI to promote some of its products.

Some of these features include the embedded DRAM (eDRAM). The Xenos also features the ‚ÄúTrue Unified Shader Architecture‚Äù which dynamically loads and balances pixel and vertex processing amongst a bank of identically capable processing units. This differs greatly from PC graphics chips of previous generations that have separate banks of processors designed for their individual task (vertex/fragment). Another feature presented in Xenos is the hardware surface tessellation to divide a surface into smaller triangles, similar to TruForm in terms of functionality, which is an advanced feature as it is not presented even in the DirectX 10 specification.

The term continues to be applied to a woman who has separated from her partner, and ceases to be applied to such a woman only when her marriage has come to an end, following a legally recognized divorce or the death of her spouse. On the death of her partner, a wife is referred to as a widow, but not after she is divorced from her partner. The rights and obligations of a wife in relation to her partner and her status in the community and in law vary between cultures and have varied over time. Summary A white gold wedding ring and a single-diamond, gold-banded engagement ring. In many cultures, wives show their marital status through various symbols. The word is of Germanic origin, from Proto-Germanic *wƒ´bam, \\"woman\\". In Middle English it had the form wif, and in Old English wƒ´f, \\"woman or wife\\". It is related to Modern German Weib (woman, female),Etymology of \\"Weib\\" (broken link to a uni personal account) and Danish viv (wife, usually poetic) and may derive ultimately from the Indo-European root ghwƒ´bh- \\"shame; pudenda\\" (cf. Tocharian B kwƒ´pe and Tocharian A kip, each meaning \\"female pudenda\\", with clear sexual overtones).Watkins, The American Heritage Dictionary of Indo-European Roots, p. 32. The original meaning of the phrase \\"wife\\" as simply \\"woman\\", unconnected with marriage or a husband/wife, is preserved in words such as \\"midwife\\" and \\"fishwife\\". In many cultures, marriage is generally expected that a woman will take her husband's surname, though that is not universal. A married woman may indicate her marital status in a number of ways: in Western culture a married woman would commonly wear a wedding ring but in other cultures other markers of marital status may be used. A married woman is commonly given the honorific title \\"Mrs\\", but some married women prefer to be referred to as \\"Ms\\", a title which is also used by preference or when the marital status of a woman is unknown. Related terminology A young bride at her Nikah. A woman on her wedding day is usually described as a bride, even after the wedding ceremony, while being described as a wife is also appropriate after the wedding or after the honeymoon. If she is marrying a man, her partner is known as the bridegroom during the wedding, and within the marriage is called her husband. In the older custom, still followed, e. g., by Roman Catholic ritual, the word bride actually means fianc√©e and applies up to the exchange of matrimonial consent (the actual marriage act); from then on, even while the rest of the very ceremony is ongoing, the woman is a wife, and no longer a bride, and the bridal couple is no longer referred to as such but as the newlywed couple. \\"Wife\\" refers to the institutionalized relation to the other spouse, unlike mother, a term that puts a woman into the context of her children. In some societies, especially historically, a concubine was a woman who was in an ongoing, usually matrimonially oriented relationship with a man who could not be married to her, often because of a difference in social status. The term wife is most commonly applied to a woman in a union sanctioned by law (including religious law), not to a woman in an informal cohabitation relationship, which may be known as a girlfriend, partner, cohabitant, significant other, concubine, mistress etc. However, a woman in a so-called common law marriage may describe herself as a common law wife, de facto wife, or simply a wife. Those seeking to advance gender neutrality may refer to both marriage partners as \\"spouses\\", and many countries and societies are rewording their statute law by replacing \\"wife\\" and \\"husband\\" with \\"spouse\\". A former wife whose spouse is deceased is a widow. Termination of the status of a wife The status of a wife may be terminated by divorce, annulment, or the death of a spouse. In the case of divorce, terminology such as former-wife or ex-wife is often used. With regard to annulment, such terms are not, strictly speaking, correct, because annulment, unlike divorce, is usually retroactive, meaning that an annulled marriage is considered to be invalid from the beginning almost as if it had never taken place. In the case of the death of the other spouse, the term used is widow. The social status of such women varies by culture, but in some places, they may be subject to potentially harmful practices, such as widow inheritance or levirate marriage; or divorced women may be socially stigmatized. In some cultures, the termination of the status of wife made life itself meaningless, as in the case of those cultures that practiced sati, a funeral ritual within some Asian communities, in which a recently widowed woman committed suicide by fire, typically on the husband's funeral pyre. Legal rights of the wife The legal rights of a wife have been since the 19th century, and still are, in many jurisdictions subject to debate. This subject was in particular addressed by John Stuart Mill, in The Subjection of Women (1869). Historically, many societies have given sets of rights and obligations to husbands that have been very different from the sets of rights and obligations given to wives. In particular, the control of marital property, inheritance rights, and the right to dictate the activities of children of the marriage, have typically been given to male marital partners. However, this practice was curtailed to a great deal in many countries in the twentieth century, and more modern statutes tend to define the rights and duties of a spouse without reference to gender. Among the last European countries to establish full gender equality in marriage were Switzerland,In 1985, a referendum guaranteed women legal equality with men within marriage. The new reforms came into force in January 1988.Women's movements of the world: an international directory and reference guide, edited by Sally Shreir, p. 254 Greece,In 1983, legislation was passed guaranteeing equality between spouses, abolishing dowry, and ending legal discrimination against illegitimate children Demos, Vasilikie.

Spain,In 1981, Spain abolished the requirement that married women must have their husbands‚Äô permission to initiate judicial proceedings and FranceAlthough married women in France obtained the right to work without their husbands' permission in 1965, and the paternal authority of a man over his family was ended in 1970 (before that parental responsibilities belonged to the father who made all legal decisions concerning the children), it was only in 1985 that a legal reform abolished the stipulation that the husband had the sole power to administer the children's property. in the 1980s. In various marriage laws around the world, however, the husband continues to have authority; for instance the Civil Code of Iran states at Article 1105: \\"In relations between husband and wife; the position of the head of the family is the exclusive right of the husband\\".

Traditionally, and still in some parts of the world, the bride or her family bring her husband a dowry, or the husband or his family pay a bride price to the bride's family, or both are exchanged between the families; or the husband pays the wife a dower. The purpose of the dowry varies by culture and has varied historically. In some cultures, it was paid not only to support the establishment of a new family, but also served as a condition that if the husband committed grave offenses upon his wife, the dowry had to be returned to the wife or her family; but during the marriage, the dowry was often made inalienable by the husband.Britannica 2005, dowry Today, dowries continue to be expected in parts of South Asia such as India, Pakistan, Nepal, Bangladesh, and Sri Lanka, and conflicts related to their payment sometimes result in violence such as dowry deaths and bride burning. Changing of name upon marriage In some cultures, particularly in the Anglophone West, wives often change their surnames to that of the husband upon getting married. For some, this is a controversial practice, due to its tie to the historical doctrine of coverture and to the historically subordinated roles of wives. Others argue that today this is merely a harmless tradition that should be accepted as a free choice. Some jurisdictions consider this practice as discriminatory and contrary to women's rights, and have restricted or banned it; for example, since 1983, when Greece adopted a new marriage law which guaranteed gender equality between the spouses, women in Greece are required to keep their birth names for their whole life. Childbearing Percentage of births to unmarried women, selected countries, 1980 and 2007. Traditionally, and still in many cultures, the role of a wife was closely tied to that of a mother, by a strong expectation that a wife ought to bear children, while, conversely, an unmarried woman should not have a child out of wedlock. These views have changed in many parts of the world. Children born outside marriage have become more common in many countries. Although some wives in particular in Western countries choose not to have children, such a choice is not accepted in some parts of the world. In northern Ghana, for example, the payment of bride price signifies a woman's requirement to bear children, and women using birth control are at risk of threats and coercion. Pdf. In addition, some religions are interpreted as requiring children in marriage; for instance Pope Francis said in 2015 that choosing not to have children was \\"selfish\\". Differences in cultures =Antiquity= Seuso and his wife Many traditions like a dower, dowry and bride price have long traditions in antiquity. The exchange of any item or value goes back to the oldest sources, and the wedding ring likewise was always used as a symbol for keeping faith to a person. =Western cultures= Historical status In ancient Rome, The Emperor Augustus introduced marriage legislation, the Lex Papia Poppaea, which rewarded marriage and childbearing. The legislation also imposed penalties on young persons who failed to marry and on those who committed adultery. Therefore, marriage and childbearing was made law between the ages of twenty-five and sixty for men, and twenty and fifty for women.Mary T. Boatwright, Daniel J. Gargola, Noel Lenski, Richard J. A. Talbert, \\"A Brief History of The Romans\\" (Oxford University Press; 2 edition, 2013), p. 176. Women who were Vestals Virgins, were selected between the ages of 6 and 10 to serve as priestesses in the temple of goddess Vesta in the Roman Forum for 30 years after which time they could marry. Noble women were known to marry as young as 12 years of age,Beryl Rawson, \\"The Roman Family in Italy\\" (Oxford University Press, 1999), p. 21. whereas women in the lower classes were more likely to marry slightly further into their teenage years. Judith P. Hallett, Fathers and Daughters in Roman Society: Women and the Elite Family (Princeton University Press, 1984), 142.Lauren, Caldwell, \\"Roman Girlhood and the Fashioning of Femininity\\" (Cambridge University Press, 2014), pp. 3‚Äì4. Ancient Roman law required brides to be at least 12 years old, a standard adopted by Roman Catholic canon law. In ancient Roman law, first marriages to brides aged 12‚Äì25 required the consent of the bride and her father, but by the late antique period Roman law permitted women over 25 to marry without parental consent. Anti Arjava, Women and Law in Late Antiquity Oxford, 1996, pp. 29‚Äì37. The father had the right and duty to seek a good and useful match for his children, and might arrange a child's betrothal long before he or she came of age. Frier, A Casebook on Roman Family Law, p. 66. To further the interests of their birth families, daughters of the elite would marry into respectable families. Beryl Rawson, \\"The Roman Family,\\" in The Family in Ancient Rome: New Perspectives (Cornell University Press, 1986), p. 21 . If a daughter could prove the proposed husband to be of bad character, she could legitimately refuse the match. Beryl Rawson, \\"The Roman Family,\\" in The Family in Ancient Rome: New Perspectives (Cornell University Press, 1986), p. 21 . The age of lawful consent to a marriage was 12 for maidens and 14 for youths.Beryl Rawson, \\"The Roman Family in Italy\\" (Oxford University Press, 1999), p. 21. In late antiquity, Most Roman women seem to have married in their late teens to early twenties, but noble women married younger than those of the lower classes, and an aristocratic maiden was expected to be virgin until her first marriage.Judith P. Hallett, Fathers and Daughters in Roman Society: Women and the Elite Family (Princeton University Press, 1984), 142. In late antiquity, under Roman law, daughters inherited equally from their parents if no will was produced. Antti Arjava, Women and law in late antiquity Oxford, 1996, p. 63 In addition, Roman law recognized wives' property as legally separate from husbands's property,A. Arjava, Women and law in late antiquity Oxford, 1996, 133-154. as did some legal systems in parts of Europe and colonial Latin America. Christian cultures claim to be guided by the New Testament in regard to their view on the position of a wife in society as well as her marriage. The New Testament condemns divorce for both men and women (1 Cor 7:10‚Äì11), and assumes monogamy on the part of the husband: the wife is to have her \\"own\\" husband, and the husband is to have his \\"own\\" wife (1 Cor 7:2). In the medieval period, this was understood to mean that a wife should not share a husband with other wives. As a result, divorce was relatively uncommon in the pre-modern West, particularly in the medieval and early modern period, and husbands in the Roman, later medieval and early modern period did not publicly take more than one wife. In pre-modern times, it was unusual to marry for love alone,William C. Horne, Making a heaven of hell: the problem of the companionate ideal in English marriage, poetry, 1650‚Äì1800 Athens (Georgia), 1993 although it became an ideal in literature by the early modern period.Frances Burney, Evelina, Lowndes 1778, and Seeber, English Literary History of the Eighteenth Century, Weimar 1999 In the 12th century, the Roman Catholic Church drastically changed legal standards for marital consent by allowing daughters over 12 and sons over 14 to marry without their parents' approval, even if their marriage was made clandestinely.John Noonan, \\"The Power to Choose\\" Viator 4 (1973) 419‚Äì34. Parish studies have confirmed that late medieval women did sometimes marry against their parents' approval.J. Sheehan, \\"The formation and stability of marriage in fourteenth century England\\" Medieval Studies 33 (1971) 228‚Äì63. The Roman Catholic Church's policy of considering clandestine marriages and marriages made without parental consent to be valid was controversial, and in the 16th century both the French monarchy and the Lutheran church sought to end these practices, with limited success.Beatrice Gottlieb, The family in the Western World from the Black Death to the Industrial Age Oxford, 1993, pp. 55‚Äì56. The New Testament made no pronouncements about wives' property rights, which in practice were influenced more by secular laws than religion. Most influential in the pre-modern West was the civil law, except in English- speaking countries where English common law emerged in the High Middle Ages. In addition, local customary law influenced wives' property rights; as a result wives' property rights in the pre-modern West varied widely from region to region. Because wives' property rights and daughters' inheritance rights varied widely from region to region due to differing legal systems, the amount of property a wife might own varied greatly. Under the English common law system, which dates to the later medieval period, daughters and younger sons were usually excluded from landed property if no will was produced. Under English common law, there was a system where a wife with a living husband (\\"feme couvert\\") could own little property in her own name.Elizabeth M. Craik, Marriage and property, Aberdeen 1984 Unable to easily support herself, marriage was very important to most women's economic status. This problem has been dealt with extensively in literature, where the most important reason for women's limited power was the denial of equal education and equal property rights for females.In the 18th and 19th centuries, which contained much criticism of these facts, see also Mary Wollstonecraft, A Vindication of the Rights of Women, Boston 1792 The situation was assessed by the English conservative moralist Sir William Blackstone: \\"The husband and wife are one, and the husband is the one.\\"William Blackstone, Commentaries upon the Laws of England Married women's property rights in the English-speaking world improved with the Married Women's Property Act 1882 and similar legal changes, which allowed wives with living husbands to own property in their own names. Until late in the 20th century, women could in some regions or times sue a man for wreath money when he took her virginity without taking her as his wife.Brockhaus 2004, Kranzgeld. If a woman did not want to marry, another option was entering a convent as a nun.Though cloisters' practices were not bound by modern national borders, see sources for Spain, for Italy, and for Britain to become a \\"bride of Christ\\", a state in which her chastity and economic survival would be protected. Both a wife and a nun wore Christian headcovering, which proclaimed their state of protection by the rights of marriage.Silvia Evangelisti, Wives, Widows, And Brides Of Christ: Marriage And The Convent In The Historiography Of Early Modern Italy, Cambridge 2000 Much more significant than the option of becoming a nun, was the option of non- religious spinsterhood in the West. An unmarried woman, a feme sole, had the right to own property and make contracts in her own name. As first demonstrated quantitatively by John Hajnal, in the 19th and early 20th centuries the percentage of non-clerical Western women who never married was typically as high as 10‚Äì15%, a prevalence of female celibacy never yet documented for any other major traditional civilization.John Hajnal, \\"European marriage patterns in perspective\\" in D.E. Glass and D.E.C. Eversley eds. Population in History London, 1965. In addition, early modern Western women married at quite high ages (typically mid to late 20s) relative to other major traditional cultures. The high age at first marriage for Western women has been shown by many parish reconstruction studies to be a traditional Western marriage pattern that dates back at least as early as the mid-16th century.Michael Flynn, The European Demographic System, 1500-1820 Johns Hopkins, 1981, pp. 124‚Äì127. Contemporary status In the 20th century, the role of the wife in Western marriage changed in two major ways; the first was the breakthrough from an \\"institution to companionate marriage\\";\\"Companionship marriage\\" and \\"companionate marriage\\" are synonyms (the latter being the older one), although the term usually refers to a relationship based on equality, it might instead refer to a marriage with mutual interest in their children, for the first time since the Middle Ages, wives became distinct legal entities, and were allowed their own property and allowed to sue. Until then, partners were a single legal entity, but only a husband was allowed to exercise this right, called coverture. The second change was the drastic alteration of middle and upper-class family life, when in the 1960s these wives began to work outside their home, and with the social acceptance of divorces the single-parent family, and stepfamily or \\"blended family\\" as a more \\"individualized marriage\\". Today, some women may wear a wedding ring in order to show her status as a wife.Howard, Vicki. \\"A 'Real Man's Ring': Gender and the Invention of Tradition.\\" Journal of Social History. Summer 2003 pp. 837‚Äì856 In Western countries today, married women usually have an education, a profession and they (or their husbands) can take time off from their work in a legally procured system of ante-natal care, statutory maternity leave, and they may get maternity pay or a maternity allowance. The status of marriage, as opposed to unmarried pregnant women, allows the spouse to be responsible for the child, and to speak on behalf of their wife; a partner is also responsible for the wife's child in states where they are automatically assumed to be the biological legal parent.Cuckoo's egg in the nest, Spiegel 07, 2007 Vice versa, a wife has more legal authority in some cases when she speaks on behalf of a spouse than she would have if they were not married, e.g. when her spouse is in a coma after an accident, a wife may have the right of advocacy.The restrictions of her abilities to do this vary immensely even within a legal system, see case NY vs. Fishman , 2000 If they divorce, she also might receive‚Äîor pay‚Äîalimony (see Law and divorce around the world). =Asia cultures= Hinduism 16th-century Samurai Toyotomi Hideyoshi sitting with his wives and concubines. In Indo-Aryan languages, a wife is known as Patni, which means a woman who shares everything in this world with her husband and he does the same, including their identity. Decisions are ideally made in mutual consent. A wife usually takes care of anything inside her household, including the family's health, the children's education, a parent's needs. The majority of Hindu marriages in rural and traditional India are arranged marriages. Once they find a suitable family (family of same caste, culture and financial status), the boy and the girl see and talk to each other to decide the final outcome. In recent times however the western culture has had significant influence and the new generations are more open to the idea of marrying for love. Indian law has recognized rape, sexual, emotional or verbal abuse of a woman by her husband as crimes. In Hinduism, a wife is known as a Patni or Ardhangini (similar to \\"the better half\\") meaning a part of the husband or his family. In Hinduism, a woman or man can get married, but only have one husband or wife respectively. In India, women may wear vermillion powder on their foreheads, an ornament called Mangalsutra () which is a form of necklace, or rings on their toes (which are not worn by single women) to show their status as married women. Buddhism and Chinese folk religions China's family laws were changed by the Communist revolution; and in 1950, the People's Republic of China enacted a comprehensive marriage law including provisions giving the spouses equal rights with regard to ownership and management of marital property.Britannica 2004, Legal limitations on marriage (from family law) Japan In Japan, before enactment of the Meiji Civil Code of 1898, all of the woman's property such as land or money passed to her husband except for personal clothing and a mirror stand.Britannica, Legal limitations on marriage (from family law) See Women in Japan, Law of Japan Wife in Abrahamic religions =Wife in Christianity= Christian marriage is to be between one woman (adult female) and one man (adult male) and that God Himself joined them and that no human is to separate them, according to Christ (Matthew 19:4-6). The Holy New Testament states that an unmarried Christian woman is to celibate or is to become the Christian wife of one husband to avoid sexual immorality and for sexual passion (1 Cor 7:1-2 & 8-9). Holy New Testament permits divorce of a Christian wife by a Christian husband only if she has committed adultery (Matthew 5:32). The Holy New Testament allows a Christian widow to (re)marry a man she chooses (1 Cor 7:39) but forbids a divorced Christian woman to (re)marry a man because she would be committing adultery if she did (Matthew 5:32), she is to remain unmarried and celibate or be reconciled with her husband (1 Cor 7:1-2 & 8-9 and 1 Cor 7:10-11). A Christian wife can divorce a non-Christian husband if he wants a divorce (1 Cor 7:12-16). Christian husbands are to love their Christian wives as Christ loved the Church (Ephesians 5:25) and as he loves himself (Ephesian 5:33). The Christian wife is to respect her husband (Ephesians 5:33). Christian husbands are to not be harsh with their Christian wives (Colossians 3:19) and to treat them as a delicate vessel and with honor (1 Peter 3:7). =Wife in Islam= Women in Islam have a range of rights and obligations (see main article Rights and obligations of spouses in Islam). Marriage takes place on the basis of a marriage contract. The arranged marriage is relatively common in traditionalist families, whether in Muslim countries or as first or second generation immigrants elsewhere. Women in general are supposed to wear specific clothes, as stated by the hadith, like the hijab, which may take different styles depending on the culture of the country, where traditions may seep in. The husband must pay a mahr to the bride.Qur'an verse 4;4 Traditionally, the wife in Islam is seen as a protected, chaste person that manages the household and the family. She has the ever important role of raising the children and bringing up the next generation of Muslims. In Islam, it is highly recommended that the wife remains at home although they are fully able to own property or work. The husband is obligated to spend on the wife for all of her needs while she is not obligated to spend even if she is wealthy. Muhammad is said to have commanded all Muslim men to treat their wives well. There is a Hadith by Al- Tirmidhi, in which Muhammad is said to have stated \\"The believers who show the most perfect faith are those who have the best character and the best of you are those who are best to their wives.\\" Traditionally, Muslim married women are not distinguished from unmarried women by an outward symbol (such as a wedding ring). However, women's wedding rings have recently been adopted in the past thirty years from the Western culture. =Wife in Judaism=  Rabbinic Judaism  King Solomon with 3 of his many wives. Illustrated in 1668 by Giovanni Venanzi di Pesaro. According to Biblical account, Solomon had an obsession with women and fell in love with many. Women in Judaism have a range of rights and obligations ( see main article Jewish views on marriage). Marriage takes place on the basis of a Jewish marriage contract, called a Ketubah. There is a blur of arranged marriages and love marriages in traditional families. Married women, in traditional families, wear specific clothes, like the tichel.  Hebrew Bible  In ancient times the husband paid a mohar. Genesis 34:12 In ancient times there were Israelite women who were Judge, Queen regnant, Queen regent, Queen mother, Queen consort, and Prophetess: Deborah was the wife of an Israelite man whose name was Lapidoth, which means \\"torches.\\" Deborah was a Judge and a Prophetess. Esther was the Jewish wife of a Persian King named Ahasuerus. Esther was Queen consort to the King of Persia and at the same time she was Queen regnant of the Jewish people in Persia and their Prophetess. Bathsheba was the Queen consort of King- Prophet David and then the Queen mother of King-Prophet Solomon. He rose from his throne when she entered and bowed to her and ordered that a throne be brought and he had her sit at his right hand, which is in stark contrast to when she was Queen consort and bowed to King-Prophet David when she entered. Prophet Jeremiah portrays a Queen mother as sharing in her son‚Äôs rule over the kingdom in Jeremiah 13:18-20. The wife of Prophet Isaiah was a Prophetess. Isaiah 8:3 Expectation of fidelity and violence related to adultery Inca woman and man to be stoned for adultery, by Huam√°n Poma There is a widely held expectation, which has existed for most of recorded history and in most cultures, that a wife is not to have sexual relations with anyone other than her legal husband. A breach of this expectation of fidelity is commonly referred to as adultery or extramarital sex. Historically, adultery has been considered to be a serious offense, sometimes a crime, and a sin. Even if that is not so, it may still have legal consequences, particularly as a ground for a divorce. Adultery may be a factor to consider in a property settlement, it may affect the status of children, the custody of children; moreover, adultery can result in social ostracism in some parts of the world. In addition, affinity rules of Catholicism, of Judaism and of Islam prohibit an ex-wife or widow from engaging in sexual relations with and from marrying a number of relatives of the former husband. In parts of the world, adultery may result in violent acts, such as honor killings or stoning. Some jurisdictions, especially those that apply Sharia law, allow for such acts to take place legally. As of September 2010, stoning is a legal punishment in countries such as Saudi Arabia, Sudan, Iran, Yemen, the United Arab Emirates, and some states in Nigeria as punishment for zina al-mohsena (\\"adultery of married persons\\").

At least 100 galaxy groups and clusters are located within its diameter of 33 megaparsecs (110 million light-years). The Virgo SC is one of about 10 million superclusters in the observable universe and is in the Pisces‚ÄìCetus Supercluster Complex, a galaxy filament. A 2014 study indicates that the Virgo Supercluster is only a lobe of an even greater supercluster, Laniakea, a larger, competing referent of the term Local Supercluster centered on the Great Attractor. Background Beginning with the first large sample of nebulae published by William and John Herschel in 1863, it was known that there is a marked excess of nebular fields in the constellation Virgo (near the north galactic pole). In the 1950s, French‚ÄìAmerican astronomer G√©rard Henri de Vaucouleurs was the first to argue that this excess represented a large-scale galaxy-like structure, coining the term \\"Local Supergalaxy\\" in 1953, which he changed to \\"Local Supercluster\\" (LSC cfa.harvard.edu, The Geometry of the Local Supercluster, John P. Huchra, 2007 (accessed 12-12-2008) ) in 1958. (Harlow Shapley, in his 1959 book Of Stars and Men, suggested the term Metagalaxy.Shapley, Harlow Of Stars and Men (1959)) Debate went on during the 1960s and 1970s as to whether the Local Supercluster (LS) was actually a structure or a chance alignment of galaxies. The issue was resolved with the large redshift surveys of the late 1970s and early 1980s, which convincingly showed the flattened concentration of galaxies along the supergalactic plane. Structure In a comprehensive 1982 paper, R. Brent Tully presented the conclusions of his research concerning the basic structure of the LS. It consists of two components: an appreciably flattened disk containing two- thirds of the supercluster's luminous galaxies, and a roughly spherical halo containing the remaining one-third. The disk itself is a thin (~1 Mpc) ellipsoid with a long axis / short axis ratio of at least 6 to 1, and possibly as high as 9 to 1. Data released in June 2003 from the 5-year Two-degree-Field Galaxy Redshift Survey (2dF) has allowed astronomers to compare the LS to other superclusters. The LS represents a typical poor (that is, lacking a high density core) supercluster of rather small size. It has one rich galaxy cluster in the center, surrounded by filaments of galaxies and poor groups. The Local Group is located on the outskirts of the LS in a small filament extending from the Fornax Cluster to the Virgo Cluster. The Virgo Supercluster's volume is very approximately 7000 times that of the Local Group or 100 billion times that of the Milky Way. Galaxy distribution The number density of galaxies in the LS falls off with the square of the distance from its center near the Virgo Cluster, suggesting that this cluster is not randomly located. Overall, the vast majority of the luminous galaxies (less than absolute magnitude ‚àí13) are concentrated in a small number of clouds (groups of galaxy clusters). Ninety-eight percent can be found in the following 11 clouds (given in decreasing order of number of luminous galaxies): Canes Venatici, Virgo Cluster, Virgo II (southern extension), Leo II, Virgo III, Crater (NGC 3672), Leo I, Leo Minor (NGC 2841), Draco (NGC 5907), Antlia (NGC 2997) and NGC 5643. Of the luminous galaxies located in the disk, one third are in the Virgo Cluster, while the remainder are found in the Canes Venatici Cloud and Virgo II Cloud, plus the somewhat insignificant NGC 5643 Group. The luminous galaxies in the halo are also concentrated in a small number of clouds (94% in 7 clouds). This distribution indicates that \\"most of the volume of the supergalactic plane is a great void.\\" A helpful analogy that matches the observed distribution is that of soap bubbles. Flattish clusters and superclusters are found at the intersection of bubbles, which are large, roughly spherical (on the order of 20‚Äì60 Mpc in diameter) voids in space. Long filamentary structures seem to predominate. An example of this is the Hydra- Centaurus Supercluster, the nearest supercluster to the LS, which starts at a distance of roughly 30 Mpc and extends to 60 Mpc. Cosmology =Large-scale dynamics= Since the late 1980s it has been apparent that not only the Local Group, but all matter out to a distance of at least 50 Mpc is experiencing a bulk flow on the order of 600 km/s in the direction of the Norma Cluster (Abell 3627). Lynden-Bell et al. (1988) dubbed the cause of this the \\"Great Attractor\\". The Great Attractor is now understood to be the center of mass of an even larger structure of galaxy clusters, dubbed \\"Laniakea\\", which includes the Virgo Supercluster (including the Local Group) as well as the Hydra- Centaurus Supercluster, the Pavo-Indus Supercluster, and the Fornax Group. =Dark matter= The LS has a total mass M ‚âà 1015 and a total optical luminosity L ‚âà 3 . This yields a mass-to-light ratio of about 300 times that of the solar ratio (/ = 1), a figure that is consistent with results obtained for other superclusters. By comparison, the mass-to-light ratio for the Milky Way is 63.8 assuming a solar absolute magnitude of 4.83, a Milky Way absolute magnitude of ‚àí20.9, and a Milky Way mass of . These ratios are one of the main arguments in favor of the presence of large amounts of dark matter in the universe; if dark matter did not exist, a much smaller mass-to-light ratios would be expected.

Galaxy superclusters ","title":"Virgo Supercluster"},{"id":"177436","text":"Panoramic view of the entire near-infrared sky. The location of the Great Attractor is shown following the long blue arrow at bottom-right. Hubble Telescope image of the region of the sky where the Great Attractor is located The Great Attractor is a gravitational anomaly in intergalactic space and the apparent central gravitational point of the Laniakea Supercluster. The observed anomalies suggest a localized concentration of mass thousands of times more massive than the Milky Way. However, it is inconveniently obscured by our own Milky Way's galactic plane, lying behind the Zone of Avoidance (ZOA), so in visible wavelengths the Great Attractor is difficult to observe directly. The anomaly is observable by its effect on the motion of galaxies and their associated clusters over a region hundreds of millions of light- years across the universe. These galaxies are observable above and below the ZOA; all are redshifted in accordance with the Hubble Flow, indicating that they are receding relative to us and to each other, but the variations in their redshifts are large enough and regular enough to reveal that they are slightly drawn towards the anomaly. The variations in their redshifts are known as peculiar velocities, and cover a range from about +700 km/s to ‚àí700 km/s, depending on the angular deviation from the direction to the Great Attractor. The Great Attractor itself is moving towards the Shapley Supercluster. Recent astronomical studies by a team of South African astrophysicists revealed a supercluster of galaxies, termed the Vela Supercluster, in the Great Attractor's theorized location. Location The first indications of a deviation from uniform expansion of the universe were reported in 1973 and again in 1978. The location of the Great Attractor was finally determined in 1986: It is situated at a distance of somewhere between 150 and 250 Mly (million light years) (47‚Äì79 Mpc) (the larger being the most recent estimate) away from the Milky Way, in the direction of the constellations Triangulum Australe (The Southern Triangle) and Norma (The Carpenter‚Äôs Square). While objects in that direction lie in the Zone of Avoidance (the part of the night sky obscured by the Milky Way galaxy) and are thus difficult to study with visible wavelengths, X-ray observations have revealed that the region of space is dominated by the Norma cluster (ACO 3627), a massive cluster of galaxies containing a preponderance of large, old galaxies, many of which are colliding with their neighbours and radiating large amounts of radio waves. Debate over apparent mass In 1992, much of the apparent signal of the Great Attractor was attributed to a statistical effect called Malmquist bias. In 2005, astronomers conducting an X-ray survey of part of the sky known as the Clusters in the Zone of Avoidance (CIZA) project reported that the Great Attractor was actually only one tenth the mass that scientists had originally estimated. The survey also confirmed earlier theories that the Milky Way galaxy is in fact being pulled towards a much more massive cluster of galaxies near the Shapley Supercluster, which lies beyond the Great Attractor, and which is called the Shapley Attractor. Dark flow In astrophysics, Dark flow is a possible non-random component of the peculiar velocity of galaxy clusters. The measured velocity is the sum of that predicted by Hubble's Law added to a possible small, unexplained, \\"dark\\" velocity that flows in a direction common to the galaxy clusters. Laniakea Supercluster The proposed Laniakea Supercluster is defined as the Great Attractor's basin, encompassing the former superclusters of Virgo and Hydra- Centaurus. Thus the Great Attractor would be the core of the new supercluster. Vela Supercluster In 2016, a multinational team of South African, European and Australian researchers headed by South African astronomer Ren√©e C. Kraan- Korteweg announced the discovery of a supercluster of galaxies that would largely explain the mysterious Great Attractor. Using data from the AAOmega spectrograph, the 3.9 m Anglo-Australian Telescope, and the Southern African Large Telescope, astronomers detected a region of galactic overdensity consistent with the \\"supercluster\\" designation, which provides the requisite explanation for a gravitational anomaly in the Shapley Supercluster neighborhood where the Great Attractor was theorized to be located.

The term was coined by French philosopher Voltaire.Voltaire, La philosophie de l'histoire, Changuion, 1765. In contemporary philosophy a distinction has developed between speculative philosophy of history and critical philosophy of history, now referred to as analytic. The former questions the meaning and purpose of the historical process whereas the latter studies the foundations and implications of history and the historical method.The Continuing Relevance of Speculative Philosophy of History, Journal of the Philosophy of HistoryPhilosophy of History, Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy The names of these are derived from C. D. Broad's distinction between critical philosophy and speculative philosophy.E.g. W. H. Walsh, Introduction to the Philosophy of History (1951) ch. 1 p. 2.Rolf Gruner, \\"The concept of speculative philosophy of history,\\" Metaphilosophy 3(4).  Origins  In his Poetics, Aristotle (384‚Äì322 BCE) maintained the superiority of poetry over history because poetry speaks of what ought or must be true rather than merely what is true. Herodotus, a fifth-century BCE contemporary of Socrates, broke from the Homeric tradition of passing narrative from generation to generation in his work \\"Investigations\\" (Ancient Greek: ·ºπœÉœÑŒøœÅŒØŒ±Œπ; Istor√≠ai), also known as Histories. Herodotus, regarded by some as the first systematic historian, and, later, Plutarch (46‚Äì120 CE) freely invented speeches for their historical figures and chose their historical subjects with an eye toward morally improving the reader. History was supposed to teach good examples for one to follow. The assumption that history \\"should teach good examples\\" influenced how writers produced history. Events of the past are just as likely to show bad examples that one should not follow, but classical historians would either not record such examples or would re- interpret them to support their assumption of history's purpose. From the Classical period to the Renaissance, historians alternated between focusing on subjects designed to improve mankind and on a devotion to fact. History was composed mainly of hagiographies of monarchs or of epic poetry describing heroic gestures (such as The Song of Roland‚Äîabout the Battle of Roncevaux Pass (778) during Charlemagne's first campaign to conquer the Iberian peninsula). In the fourteenth century, Ibn Khaldun, who is considered one of the fathers of the philosophy of history, discussed his philosophy of history and society in detail in his Muqaddimah (1377). His work represents a culmination of earlier works by medieval Islamic sociologists in the spheres of Islamic ethics, political science, and historiography, such as those of al-Farabi (c. 872 ‚Äì c. 950), Ibn Miskawayh, al-Dawani, and Nasir al-Din al-Tusi (1201‚Äì1274).H. Mowlana (2001). \\"Information in the Arab World\\", Cooperation South Journal 1. Ibn Khaldun often criticized \\"idle superstition and uncritical acceptance of historical data\\". He introduced a scientific method to the philosophy of history (which Dawood Compare: considers something \\"totally new to his age\\") and he often referred to it as his \\"new science\\", which is now associated with historiography. His historical method also laid the groundwork for the observation of the role of the state, communication, propaganda, and systematic bias in history. By the eighteenth century historians had turned toward a more positivist approach‚Äîfocusing on fact as much as possible, but still with an eye on telling histories that could instruct and improve. Starting with Fustel de Coulanges (1830‚Äì1889) and Theodor Mommsen (1817‚Äì1903), historical studies began to move towards a more modern scientific form. In the Victorian era, historiographers debated less whether history was intended to improve the reader, and more on what causes turned history and how one could understand historical change.  Concepts  = Philosophy of chronology = Many ancient cultures held mythical and theological concepts of history and of time that were not linear. Such societies saw history as cyclical, with alternating Dark and Golden Ages. Plato taught the concept of the Great Year, and other Greeks spoke of aeons. Similar examples include the ancient doctrine of eternal return, which existed in Ancient Egypt, in the Indian religions, among the Greek Pythagoreans' and in the Stoics' conceptions. In his Works and Days, Hesiod described five Ages of Man: the Golden Age, the Silver Age, the Bronze Age, the Heroic Age, and the Iron Age, which began with the Dorian invasion. Some scholars identify just four ages, corresponding to the four metals, with the Heroic age as a description of the Bronze Age. A four-age count would match the Vedic or Hindu ages known as Satya Yuga, Treta Yuga, Dvapara Yuga and Kali Yuga, which together make one Yuga Cycle that repeats. According to Jainism, this world has no beginning or end but goes through cycles of upturns (utsarpini) and downturns (avasarpini) constantly. Many Greeks believed that just as mankind went through four stages of character during each rise and fall of history so did government. They considered democracy and monarchy as the healthy r√©gimes of the higher ages; and oligarchy and tyranny as corrupted r√©gimes common to the lower ages. In the East, cyclical theories of history developed in China (as a theory of dynastic cycle) and in the Islamic world in the work [name needed] of Ibn Khaldun (1332-1406). During the Renaissance, cyclical conceptions of history would become common, with proponents illustrating decay and rebirth by pointing to the decline of the Roman Empire. Machiavelli's Discourses on Livy (1513‚Äì1517) provide an example. The notion of Empire contained in itself ascendance and decadence, as in Edward Gibbon's The History of the Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire (1776) (which the Roman Catholic Church placed on the Index Librorum Prohibitorum). During the Age of Enlightenment, history began to be seen as both linear and irreversible. Condorcet's interpretations of the various \\"stages of humanity\\" and Auguste Comte's positivism were among the most important formulations of such conceptions of history, which trusted social progress. As in Jean-Jacques Rousseau's Emile (1762) treatise on education (or the \\"art of training men\\"), the Enlightenment conceived the human species as perfectible: human nature could be infinitely developed through a well-thought pedagogy. Cyclical conceptions continued in the nineteenth and twentieth centuries in the works of authors such as Oswald Spengler (1880‚Äì1936), Nikolay Danilevsky (1822‚Äì1885), and Paul Kennedy (1945‚Äì ), who conceived the human past as a series of repetitive rises and falls. Spengler, like Butterfield, when writing in reaction to the carnage of the First World War of 1914‚Äì1918, believed that a civilization enters upon an era of Caesarism Compare Oswald Spengler and History as Destiny, page 93: \\"[...] the closing years of the First World War, when Spengler was completing his work, had witnessed the passing of the feudal rule of landed aristocracy in Germany and its merging into budding forms of parliamentary plutocracy - soon to be followed by the rise of 'mobocracy' and then Caesarism.\\" after its soul dies. Spengler thought that the soul of the West was dead and that Caesarism was about to begin. = Philosophy of causality = Narrative and causal approaches to history have often been contrasted or even opposed to one another, yet they can also be viewed as complementary.Hewitson, M. (2014) History and Causality, 127-48. Some philosophers of history such as Arthur Danto have claimed that \\"explanations in history and elsewhere\\" describe \\"not simply an event‚Äîsomething that happens‚Äîbut a change\\".Danto, A. (1968) Analytical Philosophy of History, 233. Like many practicing historians, they treat causes as intersecting actions and sets of actions which bring about \\"larger changes\\", in Danto's words: to decide \\"what are the elements which persist through a change\\" is \\"rather simple\\" when treating an individual's \\"shift in attitude\\", but \\"it is considerably more complex and metaphysically challenging when we are interested in such a change as, say, the break-up of feudalism or the emergence of nationalism\\".Danto, A. (1968) Analytical Philosophy of History, 249. Much of the historical debate about causes has focused on the relationship between communicative and other actions, between singular and repeated ones, and between actions, structures of action or group and institutional contexts and wider sets of conditions.Hewitson, M. (2014) History and Causality, 86-116. John Gaddis has distinguished between exceptional and general causes (following Marc Bloch) and between \\"routine\\" and \\"distinctive links\\" in causal relationships: \\"in accounting for what happened at Hiroshima on August 6, 1945, we attach greater importance to the fact that President Truman ordered the dropping of an atomic bomb than to the decision of the Army Air Force to carry out his orders.\\"Gaddis, J. L. (2002) The Landscape of History: How Historians Map the Past, 64. He has also pointed to the difference between immediate, intermediate and distant causes. For his part, Christopher Lloyd puts forward four \\"general concepts of causation\\" used in history: the \\"metaphysical idealist concept, which asserts that the phenomena of the universe are products of or emanations from an omnipotent being or such final cause\\"; \\"the empiricist (or Humean) regularity concept, which is based on the idea of causation being a matter of constant conjunctions of events\\"; \\"the functional/teleological/consequential concept\\", which is \\"goal-directed, so that goals are causes\\"; and the \\"realist, structurist and dispositional approach, which sees relational structures and internal dispositions as the causes of phenomena\\".Lloyd, C. (1993) Structures of History, 159. There is disagreement about the extent to which history is ultimately deterministic. Some argue that geography, economic systems, or culture prescribe laws that determine the events of history. Others see history as a sequence of consequential processes that act upon each other. Even determinists do not rule out that, from time to time, certain cataclysmic events occur to change course of history. Their main point is, however, that such events are rare and that even apparently large shocks like wars and revolutions often have no more than temporary effects on the evolution of the society. = Philosophy of neutrality = The question of neutrality concerns itself foremost with analysis of historiography and the biases of historical sources. One prominent manifestation of this analysis is the idea that \\"history is written by the victors\\". This phrase appears to have been coined by George Graham Vest to explain the Lost Cause of the losing side of the American Civil War. In his Society must be Defended, Michel Foucault posits that the victors of a social struggle use their political dominance to suppress a defeated adversary's version of historical events in favor of their own propaganda, which may go so far as historical negationism. Wolfgang Schivelbusch's Culture of Defeat takes an opposing approach that defeat is a major driver for the defeated to reinvent himself, while the victor, confirmed in his attitudes and methods, dissatisfied by the high losses and paltry gains made, may be less creative and fall back. For G. W. F. Hegel, the history of the world is also the Last Judgement. Hegel adopts the expression \\"Die Weltgeschichte ist das Weltgericht\\" (\\"World history is a tribunal that judges the World\\"; a quote from Friedrich Schiller's poem Resignation published in 1786) and asserts that history is what judges men, their actions and their opinions.Janez Juhant, Bojan ≈Ωalec (eds.), Reconciliation: The Way of Healing and Growth, LIT Verlag M√ºnster, 2012, p. 98. Since the twentieth century, Western historians have disavowed the aspiration to provide a judgement of history.Curran, Vivian Grosswald (2000) Herder and the Holocaust: A Debate About Difference and Determinism in the Context of Comparative Law in F. C. DeCoste, Bernard Schwartz (eds.) Holocaust's Ghost: Writings on Art, Politics, Law and Education pp.413-5 The goals of historical judgements or interpretations are separate to those of legal judgements, that need to be formulated quickly after the events and be final.Curran, Vivian Grosswald (2000) Herder and the Holocaust: A Debate About Difference and Determinism in the Context of Comparative Law in F. C. DeCoste, Bernard Schwartz (eds.) Holocaust's Ghost: Writings on Art, Politics, Law and Education p.415 Related to the issues of historical judgement are those of the pretension to neutrality and objectivity.Rubinoff, Lionel History, Philosophy and Historiography: Philosophy and the Critique of Historical Thinking, in William Sweet The Philosophy of History: A Re-Examination, Chapter 9 p.171Andrew Holland Access to History: Russia and its Rulers 1855-1964 (OCR): Historical Themes p.7 Analytic and critical philosophers of history have debated whether historians should express judgements on historical figures, or if this would infringe on their supposed role.Parkinson, G.H.R An Encyclopedia of Philosophy pp.800, 807, 820 In general, positivists and neopositivists oppose any value- judgement as unscientific.  Operative theories  = Teleological approaches = Early teleological approaches to history can be found in theodicies, which attempted to reconcile the problem of evil with the existence of God‚Äîproviding a global explanation of history with belief in a progressive directionality organized by a superior power, leading to an eschatological end, such as a Messianic Age or Apocalypse. However, this transcendent teleological approach can be thought as immanent to human history itself. Augustine of Hippo, Thomas Aquinas, Jacques-B√©nigne Bossuet, in his 1679 Discourse On Universal History, and Gottfried Leibniz, who coined the term, formulated such philosophical theodicies. Leibniz based his explanation on the principle of sufficient reason, which states that anything that happens, does happen for a specific reason. Thus, if one adopts God's perspective, seemingly evil events in fact only take place in the larger divine plan. In this way theodicies explained the necessity of evil as a relative element that forms part of a larger plan of history. However, Leibniz's principles were not a gesture of fatalism. Confronted with the antique problem of future contingents, Leibniz developed the theory of compossible worlds, distinguishing two types of necessity, in response to the problem of determinism. G. W. F. Hegel may represent the epitome of teleological philosophy of history. Hegel's teleology was taken up by Francis Fukuyama in his The End of History and the Last Man. Thinkers such as Nietzsche, Michel Foucault, Althusser, or Deleuze deny any teleological sense to history, claiming that it is best characterized by discontinuities, ruptures, and various time-scales, which the Annales School had demonstrated. Schools of thought influenced by Hegel also see history as progressive, but they see progress as the outcome of a dialectic in which factors working in opposite directions are over time reconciled. History was best seen as directed by a , and traces of the could be seen by looking backward. Hegel believed that history was moving man toward civilization, and some also claim he thought that the Prussian state incarnated the end of history. In his Lessons on the History of Philosophy, he explains that each epochal philosophy is in a way the whole of philosophy; it is not a subdivision of the Whole but this Whole itself apprehended in a specific modality. = Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel = Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel, philosopher of absolute idealism who developed a dialectic conception of history G. W. F. Hegel developed a complex theodicy in his 1807 Phenomenology of Spirit, which based its conception of history on dialectics. The negative was conceived by Hegel as the motor of history. Hegel argued that history is a constant process of dialectic clash, with each thesis encountering an opposing idea or event antithesis. The clash of both was \\"superated\\" in the synthesis, a conjunction that conserved the contradiction between thesis and its antithesis while sublating it. As Marx famously explained afterwards, concretely that meant that if Louis XVI's monarchic rule in France was seen as the thesis, the French Revolution could be seen as its antithesis. However, both were sublated in Napoleon, who reconciled the revolution with the Ancien R√©gime; he conserved the change. Hegel thought that reason accomplished itself, through this dialectical scheme, in History. Through labour, man transformed nature so he could recognize himself in it; he made it his \\"home.\\" Thus, reason spiritualized nature. Roads, fields, fences, and all the modern infrastructure in which we live is the result of this spiritualization of nature. Hegel thus explained social progress as the result of the labour of reason in history. However, this dialectical reading of history involved, of course, contradiction, so history was also conceived of as constantly conflicting: Hegel theorized this in his famous dialectic of the lord and the bondsman. According to Hegel, Thus, philosophy was to explain Geschichte (history) afterward. Philosophy is always late, it is only an interpretation of what is rational in the real‚Äîand, according to Hegel, only what is recognized as rational is real. This idealist understanding of philosophy as interpretation was famously challenged by Karl Marx's 11th thesis on Feuerbach (1845): \\"Philosophers have hitherto only interpreted the world in various ways; the point, however, is to change it.\\" = Thomas Carlyle = Thomas Carlyle, Scottish historian and philosopher of the great man theory After Hegel, who insisted on the role of great men in history, with his famous statement about Napoleon, \\"I saw the Spirit on his horse\\", Thomas Carlyle argued that history was the biography of a few central individuals, heroes, such as Oliver Cromwell or Frederick the Great, writing that \\"The history of the world is but the biography of great men.\\" His view of heroes included not only political and military figures, the founders or topplers of states, but artists, poets, theologians and other cultural leaders. His history of great men, of geniuses good and evil, sought to organize change in the advent of greatness. Explicit defenses of Carlyle's position have been rare since the late twentieth century. Most philosophers of history contend that the motive forces in history can best be described only with a wider lens than the one he used for his portraits. A.C. Danto, for example, wrote of the importance of the individual in history, but extended his definition to include social individuals, defined as \\"individuals we may provisionally characterize as containing individual human beings amongst their parts. Examples of social individuals might be social classes [...], national groups [...], religious organizations [...], large-scale events [...], large-scale social movements [...], etc.\\" (Danto, \\"The Historical Individual\\", 266, in Philosophical Analysis and History, edited by Williman H. Dray, Rainbow-Bridge Book Co., 1966). The great man theory of history was most popular with professional historians in the nineteenth century; a popular work of this school is the Encyclop√¶dia Britannica Eleventh Edition (1911), which contains lengthy and detailed biographies about the great men of history. After Marx's conception of a materialist history based on the class struggle, which raised attention for the first time to the importance of social factors such as economics in the unfolding of history, Herbert Spencer wrote \\"You must admit that the genesis of the great man depends on the long series of complex influences which has produced the race in which he appears, and the social state into which that race has slowly grown....Before he can remake his society, his society must make him.\\" = Social evolutionism = Inspired by the Enlightenment's ideal of progress, social evolutionism became a popular conception in the nineteenth century. Auguste Comte's (1798‚Äì1857) positivist conception of history, which he divided into the theological stage, the metaphysical stage and the positivist stage, brought upon by modern science, was one of the most influential doctrines of progress. The Whig interpretation of history, as it was later called, associated with scholars of the Victorian and Edwardian eras in Britain, such as Henry Maine or Thomas Macaulay, gives an example of such influence, by looking at human history as progress from savagery and ignorance toward peace, prosperity, and science. Maine described the direction of progress as \\"from status to contract,\\" from a world in which a child's whole life is pre-determined by the circumstances of his birth, toward one of mobility and choice. The publication of Darwin's The Origin of Species in 1859 introduced human evolution. However, it was quickly transposed from its original biological field to the social field, in social Darwinist theories. Herbert Spencer, who coined the term \\"survival of the fittest\\", or Lewis Henry Morgan in Ancient Society (1877) developed evolutionist theories independent from Darwin's works, which would be later interpreted as social Darwinism. These nineteenth-century unilineal evolution theories claimed that societies start out in a primitive state and gradually become more civilised over time, and equated the culture and technology of Western civilisation with progress. Ernst Haeckel formulated his recapitulation theory in 1867, which stated that \\"ontogeny recapitulates phylogeny\\": the evolution of each individual reproduces the species' evolution, such as in the development of embryos. Hence, a child goes through all the steps from primitive society to modern society. This was later discredited. Haeckel did not support Darwin's theory of natural selection introduced in The Origin of Species (1859), rather believing in a Lamarckian inheritance of acquired characteristics. Progress was not necessarily, however, positive. Arthur Gobineau's An Essay on the Inequality of the Human Races (1853‚Äì55) was a decadent description of the evolution of the Aryan race which was disappearing through miscegenation. Gobineau's works had a large popularity in the so-called scientific racism theories that developed during the New Imperialism period. After the first world war, and even before Herbert Butterfield (1900‚Äì1979) harshly criticized it, the Whig interpretation had gone out of style. The bloodletting of that conflict had indicted the whole notion of linear progress. Paul Val√©ry famously said: \\"We civilizations now know ourselves mortal.\\" However, the notion itself didn't completely disappear. The End of History and the Last Man (1992) by Francis Fukuyama proposed a similar notion of progress, positing that the worldwide adoption of liberal democracies as the single accredited political system and even modality of human consciousness would represent the \\"End of History\\". Fukuyama's work stems from a Kojevian reading of Hegel's Phenomenology of Spirit (1807). Unlike Maurice Godelier who interprets history as a process of transformation, Tim Ingold suggests that history is a movement of autopoiesisIngold, T.

P. 9, socionauki.ru A key component to making sense of all of this is to simply recognize that all these issues in social evolution merely serve to support the suggestion that how one considers the nature of history will impact the interpretation and conclusions drawn about history. The critical under- explored question is less about history as content and more about history as process. In 2011 Steven Pinker wrote a history of violence and humanity from an evolutionary perspective in which he shows that violence has declined statistically over time.\\" The better angels of our nature, a history of violence and humanity \\", by Steven Pinker, published 2012 by Penguin books  Contextual theories  As early as the 18th century, philosophers began focusing on contextual factors contributing to the course of history. Historians of the Annales School, founded in 1929 by Lucien Febvre and Marc Bloch, were a major landmark in the shift from a history centered on individual subjects to studies concentrating in geography, economics, demography, and other social forces. Fernand Braudel's studies on the Mediterranean Sea as \\"hero\\" of history and Emmanuel Le Roy Ladurie's history of climate were inspired by this School. = Karl Marx = Karl Marx, founder of Marxism and historical materialism Karl Marx is perhaps the most famous exponent of economic determinism. For him social institutions like religion, culture and the political system were merely by-products of the underlying economic system.Abhijit V. Banerjee and Esther Duflo. Under the Thumb of History? Political institutions and the Scope for Action However, he did not see history as completely deterministic. His essay The Eighteenth Brumaire of Louis Napoleon contains the most famous formulation of Marx's view of the role of the individual in history: = Michel Foucault = The historico-political discourse analyzed by Michel Foucault in Society Must Be Defended (1975‚Äì76) considers truth as the fragile product of a historical struggle, first conceptualized as race struggle‚Äîunderstood not in the modern sense of biological race but closer to that of a people or nation. Boulainvilliers, for example, was an exponent of nobility rights. He claimed that the French nobility were the racial descendants of the Franks who invaded France (while the Third Estate was descended from the conquered Gauls), and had right to power by virtue of right of conquest. He used this approach to formulate a historical thesis of the course of French political history‚Äîa critique of both the monarchy and the Third Estate. Foucault regards him as the founder of the historico-political discourse as political weapon. In Great Britain, this historico-political discourse was used by the bourgeoisie, the people and the aristocracy as a means of struggle against the monarchy‚Äîcf. Edward Coke or John Lilburne. In France, Boulainvilliers, Nicolas Fr√©ret, and then Siey√®s, Augustin Thierry, and Cournot reappropriated this form of discourse. Finally, at the end of the nineteenth century, this discourse was incorporated by racialist biologists and eugenicists, who gave it the modern sense of race and, even more, transformed this popular discourse into a state racism in Nazism. Foucault also presents that Marxists too seized this discourse and took it in a different direction, transforming the essentialist notion of race into the historical notion of class struggle, defined by socially structured position. This displacement of discourse constitutes one of the bases of Foucault's thought‚Äîthat discourse is not tied to the subject, rather the subject is a construction of discourse. Moreover, discourse is not the simple ideological and mirror reflexion of an economic infrastructure, but is a product and the battlefield of multiples forces‚Äîwhich may not be reduced to the simple dualist contradiction of two energies. Foucault shows that what specifies this discourse from the juridical and philosophical discourse is its conception of truth‚Äîthat truth is no longer absolute, it is the product of race struggle. History itself, which was traditionally the sovereign's science, the legend of his glorious feats and monument building, ultimately became the discourse of the people, thus a political stake. The subject is not any more a neutral arbitrator, judge, or legislator, as in Solon's or Kant's conceptions. Therefore, what became the historical subject must search in history's furor, under the \\"juridical code's dried blood\\", the multiple contingencies from which a fragile rationality temporarily finally emerged. This may be, perhaps, compared to the sophist discourse in Ancient Greece. Foucault warns that it has nothing to do with Machiavelli's or Hobbes's discourse on war, for to this popular discourse, the sovereign is nothing more than \\"an illusion, an instrument, or, at the best, an enemy. It is a discourse that beheads the king, anyway that dispenses itself from the sovereign and that denounces it\\".  Other approaches  = Narrative history = A current popular conception considers the value of narrative in the writing and experience of history. Important thinkers in this area include Paul Ric≈ìur, Louis Mink, W.B. Gallie, and Hayden White. Some have doubted this approach because it draws fictional and historical narrative closer together, and there remains a perceived \\"fundamental bifurcation between historical and fictional narrative\\" (Ric≈ìur, vol. 1, 52). In spite of this, most modern historians, such as Barbara Tuchman or David McCullough, consider narrative writing important to their approaches. The theory of narrated history (or historicized narrative) holds that the structure of lived experience, and such experience narrated in both fictional and non-fictional works (literature and historiography) have in common the figuration of \\"temporal experience.\\" In this way, narrative has a generously encompassing ability to \\"'grasp together' and integrate ... into one whole and complete story\\" the \\"composite representations\\" of historical experience (Ric≈ìur x, 173). Louis Mink writes that, \\"the significance of past occurrences is understandable only as they are locatable in the ensemble of interrelationships that can be grasped only in the construction of narrative form\\" (148). Marxist theorist Fredric Jameson also analyzes historical understanding this way, and writes that \\"history is inaccessible to us except in textual form ... it can be approached only by way of prior (re)textualization\\" (82).  Education and propaganda  Since Plato's Republic, civic education and instruction has had a central role in politics and the constitution of a common identity. History has thus sometimes become the target of propaganda, for example in historical revisionist attempts. Plato's insistence on the importance of education was relayed by Rousseau's Emile: Or, On Education (1762), a counterpart to The Social Contract (1762). Public education has been seen by republican regimes and the Enlightenment as a prerequisite of the masses' progressive emancipation, as conceived by Kant in Was Ist Aufkl√§rung? (What Is Enlightenment?, 1784). The creation of modern education systems, instrumental in the construction of nation states, also passed by the elaboration of a common, national history. History textbooks are one of the many ways through which this common history was transmitted. Le Tour de France par deux enfants, for example, was the French Third Republic's classic textbook for elementary school: it described the story of two French children who, following the German annexation of the Alsace-Lorraine region in 1870, go on a tour de France during which they become aware of France's diversity and the existence of the various patois.

Taylor was classically trained and was one of the pioneers of free jazz. His music is characterized by an energetic, physical approach, resulting in complex improvisation often involving tone clusters and intricate polyrhythms. His technique has been compared to percussion. Referring to the number of keys on a standard piano, Val Wilmer used the phrase \\"eighty-eight tuned drums\\" to describe Taylor's style. He has been referred to as being \\"like Art Tatum with contemporary-classical leanings\\". Early life and education Taylor was raised in the Corona, Queens neighborhood of New York City.Ratliff, Ben. \\"Lessons From the Dean of the School of Improv\\", The New York Times, May 3, 2012. Accessed December 9, 2017. \\"I recently spoke with the 83-year-old improvising pianist Cecil Taylor for about five hours over two days. One day was at his three-story home in Fort Greene, Brooklyn, where he has lived since 1983.... Raised in Corona, Queens, he started out as a Harlem jam-session musician in the early 1950s and talks with intense loyalty about a line of particularly New York-identified piano players: Fats Waller, Teddy Wilson, Thelonious Monk, Mary Lou Williams, Mal Waldron, John Hicks.\\" As an only child to a middle-class family, Taylor's mother encouraged him to play music at an early age. He began playing piano at age six and went on to study at the New York College of Music and New England Conservatory in Boston. At the New England Conservatory, Taylor majored in composition and arranging. During his time there, he also became familiar with contemporary European art music. Bela Bart√≥k and Karlheinz Stockhausen notably influenced his music. In 1955, Taylor moved back to New York City from Boston. He formed a quartet with soprano saxophonist, Steve Lacy, bassist Buell Neidlinger, and drummer Dennis Charles. Taylor's first recording, Jazz Advance, featured Lacy and was released in 1956. The recording is described by Richard Cook and Brian Morton in the Penguin Guide to Jazz: \\"While there are still many nods to conventional post-bop form in this set, it already points to the freedoms in which the pianist would later immerse himself.\\" Taylor's quartet featuring Lacy also appeared at the 1957 Newport Jazz Festival, which was made into the album At Newport. Taylor collaborated with saxophonist John Coltrane in 1958 on Stereo Drive, now available as Coltrane Time. 1950s and early 1960s Throughout the 1950s and 1960s, Taylor's music grew more complex and moved away from existing jazz styles. Gigs were often hard to come by, and club owners found that Taylor's approach of playing long pieces tended to impede business. His 1959 LP record Looking Ahead! showcased his innovation as a creator as compared to the jazz mainstream. Unlike others at the time, Taylor utilized virtuosic techniques and made swift stylistic shifts from phrase to phrase. These qualities, among others, still remained notable distinctions of Taylor's music for the rest of his life. Landmark recordings, like Unit Structures (1966), also appeared. Within the Unit, musicians were able to develop new forms of conversational interplay. In the early 1960s, an uncredited Albert Ayler worked with Taylor, jamming and appearing on at least one recording, Four, which was unreleased until appearing on the 2004 Ayler box set Holy Ghost: Rare & Unissued Recordings (1962‚Äì70). By 1961, Taylor was working regularly with alto saxophonist Jimmy Lyons, who would become one of his most important and consistent collaborators. Taylor, Lyons, and drummer Sunny Murray (and later Andrew Cyrille) formed the core personnel of the Cecil Taylor Unit, Taylor's primary ensemble until Lyons' death in 1986. Lyons' playing, strongly influenced by jazz icon Charlie Parker, retained a strong blues sensibility and helped keep Taylor's increasingly avant garde music tethered to the jazz tradition. Late 1960s and 1970s Taylor began to perform solo concerts in the latter half of the 1960s. The first known recorded solo performance was \\"Carmen With Rings\\" (59 minutes) in De Doelen concert hall in Rotterdam on July 1, 1967. Two days earlier, Taylor had played the same composition in the Amsterdam Concertgebouw. Many of his later concerts were released on album and include Indent (1973), side one of Spring of Two Blue-J's (1973), Silent Tongues (1974), Garden (1982), For Olim (1987), Erzulie Maketh Scent (1989), and The Tree of Life (1998).Cecil Taylor Unit Spring of Two Blue-J‚Äôs @ kathleen.frederator Tumblr He began to garner critical and popular acclaim, playing for Jimmy Carter on the White House Lawn, lecturing as an artist-in-residence at universities, and eventually being awarded a Guggenheim Fellowship in 1973 and a MacArthur Fellowship in 1991. In 1976, Taylor directed a production of Adrienne Kennedy's A Rat's Mass at La MaMa Experimental Theatre Club in the East Village of Manhattan. His production combined the original script with a chorus of orchestrated voices used as instruments. Jimmy Lyons, Rashid Bakr, Andy Bey, Karen Borca, David S. Ware, and Raphe Malik performed in the production as the Cecil Taylor Unit, among other musicians and actors.La MaMa Archives Digital Collections. \\"Production: Rat's Mass, A (1976)\\". Accessed August 8, 2018. 1990s and the Feel Trio Following Lyons' death in 1986, Taylor formed the Feel Trio in the early 1990s with William Parker on bass and Tony Oxley on drums. The group can be heard on Celebrated Blazons, Looking (Berlin Version) The Feel Trio and the 10-disc set 2 T's for a Lovely T. Compared to his prior groups with Lyons, the Feel Trio had a more abstract approach, tethered less to jazz tradition and more aligned with the ethos of European free improvisation. He also performed with larger ensembles and big band projects. Taylor's extended residence in Berlin in 1988 was documented by the German label FMP, resulting in a box set of performances in duet and trio with a large number of European free improvisors, including Oxley, Derek Bailey, Evan Parker, Han Bennink, Tristan Honsinger, Louis Moholo, and Paul Lovens. Most of his later recordings have been released on European labels, with the exception of Momentum Space (a meeting with Dewey Redman and Elvin Jones) on Verve/Gitanes. The classical label Bridge released his 1998 Library of Congress performance Algonquin, a duet with violinist Mat Maneri. Taylor continued to perform for capacity audiences around the world with live concerts, usually playing his favored instrument, a B√∂sendorfer piano featuring nine extra lower-register keys. A documentary on Taylor, entitled All the Notes, was released on DVD in 2006 by director Chris Felver. Taylor was also featured in a 1981 documentary film entitled Imagine the Sound, in which he discusses and performs his music, poetry, and dance. 2000s At the Moers Festival, 2008 Taylor recorded sparingly in the 2000s, but continued to perform with his own ensembles (the Cecil Taylor Ensemble and the Cecil Taylor Big Band) and with other musicians such as Joe Locke, Max Roach, and Amiri Baraka.Taylor Baraka Duo In 2004, the Cecil Taylor Big Band at the Iridium Jazz Club was nominated a best performance of 2004 by All About Jazz. The Cecil Taylor Trio was nominated for the same at the Highline Ballroom in 2009. The trio consisted of Taylor, Albey Balgochian, and Jackson Krall. In 2010, Triple Point Records released a deluxe limited-edition double LP titled Ailanthus/Altissima: Bilateral Dimensions of Two Root Songs, a set of duos with Taylor's longtime collaborator Tony Oxley that was recorded live at the Village Vanguard. In 2013, he was awarded the Kyoto Prize for Music. He was described as \\"An Innovative Jazz Musician Who Has Fully Explored the Possibilities of Piano Improvisation\\". In 2014, his career and 85th birthday were honored at the Painted Bride Art Center in Philadelphia with the tribute concert event \\"Celebrating Cecil\\".Ray Simon, \\"Out jazz great celebrated at local festival\\" Philadelphia Gay News, March 6, 2014.

In 2008, Taylor performed with Pauline Oliveros at the Curtis R Priem Experimental Media and Performing Arts Center at Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute. The concert was recorded and is available on a DVD which also features a 75 minute video of a Taylor poetry recital entitled Floating Gardens: The Poetry Of Cecil Taylor. Taylor, along with dancer Min Tanaka, was the subject of Amiel Courtin-Wilson's 2016 documentary film The Silent Eye.Gary Maddox, \\"Bold new projects for Amiel Courtin-Wilson and more Australian film news\\", Sydney Morning Herald, April 12, 2016. Retrieved August 2, 2017. Ballet and dance In addition to piano, Taylor was always interested in ballet and dance. Taylor's mother, who died while he was young, was a dancer and played the piano and violin. Taylor once said: \\"I try to imitate on the piano the leaps in space a dancer makes.\\" He collaborated with dancer Dianne McIntyre in the late 1970s and early 1980s. In 1979, Taylor composed and played the music for a twelve-minute ballet \\"Tetra Stomp: Eatin' Rain in Space\\", featuring Mikhail Baryshnikov and Heather Watts. Poetry Taylor was a poet, and cited Robert Duncan, Charles Olson, and Amiri Baraka as major influences.\\"being matter ignited...\\" Interview with Cecil Taylor by Chris Funkhouser, published in Hambone, No. 12 (Nathaniel Mackey, editor). He often integrated his poems into his musical performances, and they frequently appear in the liner notes of his albums.

In 1991, Taylor told a New York Times reporter \\"[s]omeone once asked me if I was gay. I said, 'Do you think a three-letter word defines the complexity of my humanity?' I avoid the trap of easy definition.\\" Taylor moved to Fort Greene, Brooklyn in 1983. He died at his Brooklyn residence on April 5, 2018, at the age of 89. At the time of Taylor's death, he was working on an autobiography and future concerts, among other projects.

Jumbo was exported to Jardin des Plantes, a zoo in Paris, and then transferred in 1865 to London Zoo in England. Despite public protest, Jumbo was sold to P. T. Barnum, who took him to the United States for exhibition in March 1882. The giant elephant's name has spawned the common word \\"jumbo,\\" meaning large in size. Examples of his lexical impact are phrases like \\"jumbo jet\\", \\"jumbo shrimp,\\" \\"jumbo marshmallows,\\" and \\"jumbotron.\\" Jumbo's shoulder height has been estimated to have been at the time of his death, and was claimed to be about by Barnum. Jumbo is the Tufts University mascot, and is referenced by a plaque outside the old Liberal Hall, now a Wetherspoons pub, in Crediton. History Jumbo was born around December 25, 1860 in Sudan, and after his mother was killed by hunters, the infant Jumbo was captured by Sudanese elephant hunter Taher Sheriff and German big-game hunter Johann Schmidt. The calf was sold to Lorenzo Casanova, an Italian animal dealer and explorer. Casanova transported the animals that he had bought from Sudan north to Suez, and then across the Mediterranean Sea to Trieste. This collection was sold to Gottlieb Christian Kreutzberg's \\"Menagerie Kreutzberg\\":de:Gottlieb Christian Kreutzberg in Germany. Soon after, the elephant was imported to France and kept in the Paris zoo Jardin des Plantes. In 1865, he was transferred to the London Zoo and arrived on 26 June. In the following years, Jumbo became a crowd favorite due to his size, and would give rides to children on his back, including those of Queen Victoria. London zookeeper association leader Anoshan Anathajeyasri gave Jumbo his name; it is likely a variation of one of two Swahili words: jambo, which means \\"hello\\"; or jumbe, meaning \\"chief\\". If Anathajeyasri was from India, he possibly named Jumbo after a gigantic rose-apple tree called jambu (which at that time would be transliterated as 'jumboo'), which grows on the mythical Mount Meru and whose fruits were said to be as large as elephants. While in Mexico, Jumbo broke two tusks, and when they regrew, he ground them down against the stonework of his enclosure. His keeper in London was Matthew Scott, whose 1885 autobiography details his life with Jumbo. In 1882, Abraham Bartlett, superintendent of the London zoo, sparked a national controversy with his decision to sell Jumbo to the American entertainer, Phineas T. Barnum of the Barnum & Bailey Circus for ¬£2,000 ($10,000 USD). This decision came as a result of concern surrounding Jumbo's growing aggression and potential to cause a public disaster. The sale of Jumbo, however, sent the citizens of London into a panic, because they viewed the transaction as an enormous loss for the British empire. 100,000 school children wrote to Queen Victoria begging her not to sell the elephant. John Ruskin, a fellow of the Zoological Society, wrote in The Morning Post in February 1882: \\"I, for one of the said fellows, am not in the habit of selling my old pets or parting with my old servants because I find them subject occasionally, perhaps even \\"periodically,\\" to fits of ill temper; and I not only \\"regret\\" the proceedings of the council, but disclaim them utterly, as disgraceful to the city of London and dishonourable to common humanity.\\"Complete works of John Ruskin, Vol 34 Page 560.http://www.lancaster.ac.uk/depts/ruskinlib/stormcloud and http://www.lancaster.ac.uk/depts/ruskinlib/Works%20of%20John%20Ruskin Despite a lawsuit against the Zoological Gardens alleging the sale was in violation of multiple zoo bylaws, and the zoo's attempt to renege on the sale, the court upheld the sale. Matthew Scott elected to go with Jumbo to the USA. The London Daily Telegraph begged Barnum to lay down terms on which he would return Jumbo, however no such terms existed in the eyes of Barnum. In New York, Barnum exhibited Jumbo at Madison Square Garden, earning enough in three weeks from the enormous crowds to recoup the money he spent to buy the animal.\\"Madison Square Garden I\\" on Ballpark.com In the 31-week season, the circus earned $1.75M, largely due to its star attraction. On May 17th 1884, Jumbo was one of Barnum's 21 elephants that crossed the Brooklyn Bridge to prove that it was safe after 12 people died during a stampede caused by mass panic over collapse fears a year earlier. Death Jumbo after being hit by a locomotive on September 15, 1885, in St. Thomas, Ontario An 1889 photograph of Jumbo remains at Barnum Hall Poster of Jumbo's skeleton Surviving fragments of Jumbo from the conflagration Jumbo died at a railway classification yard in St. Thomas, Ontario, Canada, on September 15, 1885. In those days the circus crisscrossed North America by train. St. Thomas was the perfect location for a circus because many rail lines converged there. Jumbo and the other animals had finished their performances that night, and as they were being led to their box car, a train came down the track. Jumbo was hit and mortally wounded, dying within minutes. Barnum told the story that Tom Thumb, a young circus elephant, was walking on the railroad tracks and Jumbo was attempting to lead him to safety. Barnum claimed that the locomotive hit and killed Tom Thumb before it derailed and hit Jumbo, and other witnesses supported Barnum's account. According to newspapers, the freight train hit Jumbo directly, killing him, while Tom Thumb suffered a broken leg.\\"Jumbo's Death\\", The Globe, September 17, 1885, p. 1. Many metallic objects were found in the elephant's stomach, including English pennies, keys, rivets, and a police whistle. Ever the showman, Barnum had portions of his star attraction separated, to have multiple sites attracting curious spectators. After touring with Barnum's circus, the skeleton was donated to the American Museum of Natural History in New York City, where it remains. The elephant's heart was sold to Cornell University. Jumbo's hide was stuffed by William J. Critchley and Carl Akeley, both of Ward's Natural Science, who stretched it during the mounting process; the mounted specimen traveled with Barnum's circus for two years. Barnum eventually donated the stuffed Jumbo to Tufts University, where it was displayed at P.T. Barnum Hall there for many years. The hide was destroyed in a fire in April 1975. Ashes from that fire, which are believed to contain the elephant's remains, are kept in a 14-ounce Peter Pan Crunchy Peanut Butter jar in the office of the Tufts athletic director, while his taxidermied tail, removed during earlier renovations, resides in the holdings of the Tufts Digital Collections and Archives. Legacy Remaining in the United Kingdom are statues and other memorabilia of Jumbo. The elephant - or rather his statuette in the Natural History Museum - was made holotype of Richard Lydekker's proposed subspecies (Loxodonta africana rothschildi) for the large elephants of the eastern Sahel. Modern authorities do not recognize this (or any other subspecies of African bush elephants), considering its purportedly diagnostic large size and peculiarly shaped ears to be individual variation. While Jumbo's hide resided at Tufts' P.T. Barnum Hall, a superstition held that dropping a coin into a nostril of the trunk would bring good luck on an examination or sports event. Although the hide was destroyed by a major fire,\\"The Immolation Of Jumbo\\", American Heritage, Vol. 26, Issue 6, October 1975. Jumbo remains the mascot of Tufts, and representations of the elephant are featured prominently throughout the campus. Jumbo statue in St. Thomas, Ontario, Canada A life-sized statue of the elephant was erected in 1985 in St. Thomas, Ontario, to commemorate the centennial of the elephant's death. It is located on Talbot Street on the west side of the city. In 2006 the Jumbo statue was inducted into the North America Railway Hall of Fame in the category of \\"Railway Art Forms & Events\\" as having local significance.The North America Railway Hall of Fame  Inductee: The Jumbo Statue Jumbo was the inspiration of the nickname of the 19th-century Jumbo Water Tower in the town of Colchester in Essex, England. Lucy the Elephant, a Jumbo-inspired building in New Jersey Lucy the Elephant, a six-story structure in Margate City, New Jersey, was modeled after Jumbo. Built by James V. Lafferty in 1881, Lucy is the oldest surviving roadside tourist attraction in America and a National Historic Landmark. Lafferty also made other Jumbo-shaped structures, including Elephantine Colossus, on Coney Island. Jumbo has been lionized on a series of sheet-music covers from roughly 1882‚Äì83. The four-colour lithograph of Jumbo was created by Alfred Concanen of England, with the music title \\"Why Part With Jumbo\\", a song by the lion comique of Victorian British music halls, G. H. MacDermott. It pictured children zoo visitors riding, somewhat precariously, on Jumbo's back. Multiple American lithographic music covers were done, including by J. H. Bufford's Sons. Canadian folk singer James Gordon wrote the song \\"Jumbo's Last Ride\\", which recounts the story of Jumbo's life and death. It is on his 1999 CD Pipe Street Dreams. Canadian professional ice hockey player Joe Thornton (b. 1979) from St. Thomas, Ontario is nicknamed Jumbo Joe as a homage to Jumbo. More evidence A television program about Jumbo, Attenborough and the Giant Elephant, presented by the naturalist and broadcaster David Attenborough, was transmitted on BBC One in the United Kingdom on 10 December 2017. An international team of scientists examined the skeleton and found: * Jumbo's molar teeth were malformed and out of line as a result of a long-term soft diet that did not wear his molar teeth down enough, obstructing the forward eruptive movement of the next molar. * Jumbo's nightly rages were probably caused by toothache, rather than musth, as his keeper thought at the time. * A post mortem photograph of Jumbo shows skin abrasions consistent with an illustration produced just after his death of the freight train hitting him on a hip from behind as he was being led across to his traveling carriage, and said that the likeliest cause of death was internal bleeding from his injuries. * Examination of Jumbo's limb bones showed overgrown tendon attachment areas consistent with a long-term history of being overloaded at his work. * Jumbo was still growing at the time of his death, as is normal for African male elephants of his age, and might eventually have attained the size claimed by Barnum.

Historically, the term referred to special operations units controlled by the main military intelligence service GRU (Spetsnaz GRU). It also describes task forces of other ministries (such as the Ministry of Internal Affairs' ODON and Ministry of Emergency Situations' special rescue unit) in post-Soviet countries. Russian special forces wear different berets depending on the branch of the armed forces they belong to. These include: *Ground Forces and Airborne Forces ‚Äì Blue beret *Navy and Marines ‚Äì Black beret *National Guard ‚Äì Maroon beret As Spetsnaz is a Russian term, it is typically associated with the special units of Russia, but other post-Soviet states often refer to their special forces units by the term as well, since these nations also inherited their special purpose units from the now-defunct Soviet security agencies. The 5th Spetsnaz Brigade of Belarus is such an example of non-Russian Spetsnaz forces. Etymology Spetsnaz SSO snipers. Spetsnaz GRU operators. The Russian abbreviations spetsnaz and osnaz are syllabic abbreviations typical of Soviet era Russian, for spetsialnovo naznacheniya and osobovo naznacheniya, both of which may be interpreted as \\"special purpose\\". As syllabic acronyms they are not normally capitalized. They are general terms that were used for a variety of Soviet special operations (spetsoperatsiya) units. In addition, many Cheka and Internal Troops units (such as OMSDON and ODON) also included osobovo naznacheniya in their full names. Regular forces assigned to special tasks were sometimes also referred to by terms such as spetsnaz and osnaz. Spetsnaz later referred specifically to special (spetsialnovo) purpose (naznacheniya) or special operations (spetsoperatsiya; spec ops) forces, and the word's widespread use is a relatively recent, post-perestroika development in Russian language. The Soviet public used to know very little about their country's special forces until many state secrets were disclosed under the glasnost (\\"openness\\") policy of Mikhail Gorbachev during the late 1980s. Since then, stories about spetsnaz and their purportedly incredible prowess, from the serious to the highly questionable, have captivated the imagination of patriotic Russians, particularly in the midst of the post-Soviet era decay in military and security forces during the era of perestroika championed by Mikhail Gorbachev and continued under Boris Yeltsin. A number of books about the Soviet military intelligence special forces, such as 1987's Spetsnaz: The Story Behind the Soviet SAS by defected GRU agent Viktor Suvorov, helped introduce the term to the Western public. In Aquarium,Aquarium (), 1985, Hamish Hamilton Ltd, a book published by Viktor Suvorov after defecting to the west, he alleges that the Spetsnaz used condemned criminals from the Gulag system (even other condemned secret operatives) as \\"dolls\\" and \\"gladiators\\" for to-the-death combat training. It is not known when the practice stopped. The author mentions duels to the death becoming more rare during the time of his service due to \\"procurement of dolls\\" becoming harder. Additionally Suvorov frequently references the co-location of some secret Spetsnaz training facilities that killed prisoners in this way, adjacent to Gulags for this reason. In post-Soviet Russia \\"Spetsnaz\\" became a colloquial term as special operations (spetsoperatsiya), from police raids to military operations in internal conflicts, grew more common. Coverage of these operations, and the celebrity status of special operations forces in state-controlled media, encouraged the public to identify many of these forces by name: SOBR, Alpha, Vityaz. The term Spetsnaz has also continued to be used in several other post- Soviet states such as Belarus, Ukraine and Kazakhstan for their own special operations forces. In Russia, foreign special operations forces are also known as \\"Spetsnaz\\" (for example, United States special operations forces would be called \\"amerikanskiy spetsnaz\\"). Known operations history =Second World War= Viktor Leonov helped lay the foundation for modern day Naval Spetsnaz operations. During the Second World War, it became clear early on for Soviet leadership that it had an urgent need for immediate intelligence on German land forces in northern Norway and Finland. On 5 July 1941 Admiral Arseniy Golovko of the Northern Fleet authorized the formation of a ground reconnaissance detachment. This unit, the 4th Special Volunteer Detachment, was to be recruited from the fleet's athletes and have an initial fill of 65 to 70 personnel. Later the unit was renamed the 181st Special Reconnaissance Detachment.Spetsnaz:Russia's Special Forces by Mark Galeotti The most prominent of these new recruits was Viktor Leonov, who joined the Soviet Navy in 1937. He was assigned to a submarine training detachment and then transferred to a repair station in the Northern Fleet at Polyarnyy. Leonov had trained as a scuba diver, after which he joined 4th Special Volunteer Detachment, where he proved his daring and leadership skills conducting numerous clandestine operations and twice being awarded the title of Hero of the Soviet Union. Initially the unit was confined to performing small scale reconnaissance missions, platoon sized insertions by sea and on occasion on land into Finland and later Norway. They began conducting sabotage missions and raids to snatch prisoners for interrogation. They would also destroy German ammunition and supply depots, communication centers, and harass enemy troop concentrations along the Finnish and Russian coasts.Heroes of the Soviet Union 1941‚Äì45 by Henry Sakaida When the European conflict ended, the Naval Scouts were sent to fight the Japanese. Leonov along with Capt. Kulebyakin and 140 men, landed on a Japanese airfield at Port Vonsan, not realizing they were opposed by over 3,500 enemy soldiers. A tense standoff ensued, until the commanding officers of the unit managed to bluff the Japanese forces into surrendering.Hardcore Heroes 1 Season 2014 =The Crabb Affair= Lieutenant- Commander Lionel Crabb was a British Royal Navy frogman and MI6 diver who vanished during a reconnaissance mission around a Soviet cruiser berthed at Portsmouth Dockyard in 1956. On 16 November 2007, the BBC and the Daily Mirror reported that Eduard Koltsov, a former Soviet frogman, claimed to have caught Crabb placing a mine on the Ordzhonikidze hull near the ammunition depot and cut his throat. In an interview for a Russian documentary film, Koltsov showed the dagger he allegedly used as well as an Order of the Red Star medal that he claimed to have been awarded for the deed. Koltsov, 74 at the time of the interview, stated that he wanted to clear his conscience and make known exactly what happened to Crabb. (It is perhaps worth noting that Peter Mercer of the Special Boat Service describes this incident in his autobiography: \\"The cruiser [Ordzhonikidze] was carrying the two Soviet leaders, Khrushchev and Bulganin, on a goodwill visit to Britain. His [Crabb's] task was to measure the cruiser's propeller and to discover how the ship managed to travel at twice the speed originally estimated by British naval intelligence.\\") =Soviet war in Afghanistan= A Spetsnaz group prepare for a mission in Afghanistan. Soviet special forces surround Tajbeg Palace following the operation. Soviet Spetsnaz forces took part in the Soviet‚ÄìAfghan War of 1979‚Äì1989 in Afghanistan, usually fighting fast insertion/extraction type warfare with helicopters. Their most famous operation, Operation Storm-333, was executed on 27 December 1979 which saw Soviet special forces storming the Tajbeg Palace in Afghanistan and killing Afghan President Hafizullah Amin, his son and over 300 of his personal guards in 40 minutes. The Soviets then installed Babrak Karmal as Amin's successor. The operation involved approximately 660 Soviet operators dressed in Afghan uniforms, including ca. 50 KGB and GRU officers from the Alpha Group and Zenith Group. The Soviet forces occupied major governmental, military and media buildings in Kabul, including their primary target ‚Äì the Tajbeg Palace. In the first one and a half years of the war, spetsnaz units in the form of the 459th special forces company, were exclusively responsible for reconnaissance missions and intelligence gathering for the 40th Army.–°–µ—Ä–≥–µ–π –ö–æ–∑–ª–æ–≤. –ö–Ω–∏–≥–∞ 3. –ê—Ñ–≥–∞–Ω–∏—Å—Ç–∞–Ω. –ó–≤—ë–∑–¥–Ω—ã–π —á–∞—Å —Å–ø–µ—Ü–Ω–∞–∑–∞. 1979‚Äî1989 // –°–ø–µ—Ü–Ω–∞–∑ –ì–†–£: –û—á–µ—Ä–∫–∏ –∏—Å—Ç–æ—Ä–∏–∏ / –ø–æ–¥ —Ä–µ–¥. –ì–µ—Ä–∞—Å–∏–º–æ–≤–∞ –î. –ú.. ‚Äî –ú–æ—Å–∫–≤–∞: –†—É—Å—Å–∫–∞—è –ø–∞–Ω–æ—Ä–∞–º–∞, 2013. ‚Äî –°. 30, 34‚Äî58, 61‚Äî81, 92‚Äî172, 186‚Äî539, 729‚Äî735. ‚Äî 736 —Å. ‚Äî 3000 —ç–∫–∑. ‚Äî . Aside from reconnaissance, the 459th was also tasked with capturing prisoners, kidnapping enemy agents and targeted assassination of leaders and field commanders of the Mujahideen. By 1985, the GRU had expanded its special forces footprint to two spetsnaz brigades in Afghanistan, comprising just under 5,000 troops. These were the: 15th Special Purpose Brigade ‚Äì paired up and supported by 239th Helicopter Squadron equipped with Mi-24 (16 units), Mi-8 (16 units), deployment in Ghazni. *154th Oospn *177th Oospn *334th Oospn *668th Oospn 22nd Special Purpose Brigade ‚Äì paired up and supported by 205th Helicopter Squadron equipped with Mi-24 (16 units) Mi-8 (16 units) deployed in Lashkar Gah. *173rd Oospn *186th Oospn *370th Oospn *411th Oospn The Spetsnaz often conducted missions to ambush and destroy enemy supply-convoys. The Mujahideen had great respect for the Spetsnaz, seeing them as a much more difficult opponent than the typical Soviet conscript soldier. They said that the Spetsnaz-led air assault operations had changed the complexion of the war. They also credited the Spetsnaz with closing down all the supply routes along the Afghan- Pakistani border in 1986. In April 1986, the rebels lost one of their biggest bases, at Zhawar in Paktia Province, to a Soviet Spetsnaz air-assault. The Spetsnaz achieved victory by knocking out several rebel positions above the base, a mile-long series of fortified caves in a remote canyon. One such successful mission was codenamed Operation \\"Curtain\\" or \\"Veil\\", from 1984‚Äì88, which aimed to close off the Afghan-Pakistani border and cut off supply routes coming in from Pakistan. The operation caused great distress to mujahedin war effort, with spetsnaz units intercepting 990 supply caravans resulting in 17,000 deaths for the insurgents.¬´–°–ø–µ—Ü–Ω–∞–∑ –Ω–∞ —Ç—Ä–æ–ø–µ –≤–æ–π–Ω—ã¬ª. –í–æ–ª–∫–æ–≤ –ê–ª–µ–∫—Å–∞–Ω–¥—Ä –í–ª–∞–¥–∏–ª–µ–Ω–æ–≤–∏—á. –ù–∞—É—á–Ω—ã–π —Å–æ—Ç—Ä—É–¥–Ω–∏–∫ –º—É–∑–µ—è ¬´–®—É—Ä–∞–≤–∏¬ª (–Ω–µ–¥–æ—Å—Ç—É–ø–Ω–∞—è —Å—Å—ã–ª–∫–∞). –î–∞—Ç–∞ –æ–±—Ä–∞—â–µ–Ω–∏—è 20 –æ–∫—Ç—è–±—Ä—è 2015. –ê—Ä—Ö–∏–≤–∏—Ä–æ–≤–∞–Ω–æ 20 –Ω–æ—è–±—Ä—è 2015 –≥–æ–¥–∞.

This unit was deployed disguised as Afghans, and provided support to the Mujahideen fighting the Soviets. A battle reported as having been fought between the Pakistanis and Soviet troops took place in Kunar Province in March 1986. According to Soviet sources, the battle was actually fought between the GRU's 15th Spetsnaz Brigade, and the Usama Bin Zaid regiment of Afghan Mujahideen under Commander Assadullah, belonging to Abdul Rasul Sayyaf's faction. Fighting is also alleged to have taken place during Operation Magistral where over 200 Mujahideen were killed in a failed attempt to capture the strategic Hill 3234 near the Pakistani border from a 39-man Soviet Airborne company. The Beirut hostage crisis In October 1985, specialist operators from the KGB's Group \\"A\\" (Alpha) were dispatched to Beirut, Lebanon. The Kremlin had been informed of the kidnapping of four Soviet diplomats by the militant group, the Islamic Liberation Organization (a radical offshoot of the Muslim Brotherhood). It was believed that this was retaliation for the Soviet support of Syrian involvement in the Lebanese Civil War. However, by the time Alpha arrived, one of the hostages had already been killed. It is alleged that through a network of supporting KGB operatives, members of the task force identified each of the perpetrators involved in the crisis; once these had been identified, the team began to take relatives of these militants as hostages. Following the standard Soviet policy of not negotiating with terrorists, some of the hostages taken by Alpha were dismembered, and their body parts sent to the militants. The warning was clear: more would follow unless the remaining hostages were released immediately. The show of force worked, and for 20 years, no Soviet or Russian officials was taken captive, until the June 2006 abduction and murder of four Russian embassy staff in Iraq. However, the veracity of this story has been brought into question. Another version says that the release of the Soviet hostages was the result of extensive diplomatic negotiations with the spiritual leader of Hezbollah, Grand Ayatollah Mohammad Hussein Fadlallah, who appealed to King Hussein of Jordan and the leaders of Libya and Iran to use their influence on the kidnappers. =After the breakup of Soviet Union= APC during the Tajikistani Civil War. Chechen soldiers of Sulim Yamadayev's Special Battalion Vostok during the 2008 Russo-Georgian War. After the collapse of the USSR, Spetsnaz forces of the Soviet Union's newly formed republics took part in many local conflicts such as the Civil war in Tajikistan, Chechen Wars, Russo-Georgian War and the Crimea Crisis. Spetsnaz forces also have been called upon to resolve several high-profile hostage situations such as the Moscow theatre hostage crisis and the Beslan school hostage crisis. Budyonnovsk hospital hostage crisis The crisis took place from 14 June to 19 June 1995, when a group of 80 to 200 Chechen terrorists led by Shamil Basayev attacked the southern Russian city of Budyonnovsk, where they stormed the main police station and the city hall. After several hours of fighting and Russian reinforcements imminent, the Chechens retreated to the residential district and regrouped in the city hospital, where they took between 1,500 and 1,800 hostages, most of them civilians (including about 150 children and a number of women with newborn infants). –ë—É–¥–µ–Ω–Ω–æ–≤—Å–∫ After three days of siege, the Russian authorities ordered the security forces to retake the hospital compound. The forces deployed were elite personnel from the Federal Security Service's Alpha Group, alongside MVD militsiya and Internal Troops. The strike force attacked the hospital compound at dawn on the fourth day, meeting fierce resistance. After several hours of fighting in which many hostages were killed by crossfire, a local ceasefire was agreed, and 227 hostages were released; 61 others were freed by the Russian forces. A second Russian attack on the hospital a few hours later also failed and so did a third, resulting in even more casualties. The Russian authorities accused the Chechens of using the hostages as human shields. According to official figures, 129 civilians were killed and 415 were injured in the entire event (of whom 18 later died of their wounds).History of Chechen rebels' hostage taking Gazeta.Ru, 24 October 2002 This includes at least 105 hostage fatalities. However, according to an independent estimate 166 hostages were killed and 541 injured in the special forces attack on the hospital.Russia: A Timeline Of Terrorism Since 1995, Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty, 30 August 2006Adam Dolnik, Understanding Terrorist Innovation: Technology, Tactics and Global Trends, 2007 (p. 105) At least 11 Russian police officers and 14 soldiers were killed. Basayev's force suffered 11 men killed and one missing; most of their bodies were returned to Chechnya in a special freezer truck. In the years following the hostage- taking, more than 40 of the surviving attackers were tracked down and have been assassinated, including Aslambek Abdulkhadzhiev in 2002 and Shamil Basayev in 2006, and more than 20 were sentenced, by the Stavropol territorial court, to various terms of imprisonment. Kizlyar-Pervomayskoye hostage crisis The mass sieges which saw people taken in the thousands also involved FSB's Alpha Group and the Spetsnaz GRU in attempted rescuing of the hostages. =Second Chechen war= 1999 Dagestan conflict. Russian special forces were instrumental in Russia's and the Kremlin backed government's success in the Second Chechen War after learning the shortcomings of the first war. Under joint command of Unified Group of Troops (OGV) formed on 23 September 1999. GRU, FSB and MVD Spetsnaz operators conducted a myriad of counter-insurgency and counter-terrorism operations, including targeted killings of separatist leadership, in the meantime inflicting heavy casualties among Islamist separatists. Some of the most infamous of these successful missions were internationally condemned terrorists and separatist leaders, like Aslan Maskhadov, Abdul Halim Sadulayev, Dokka Umarov, Akhmadov brothers, Turpal-Ali Atgeriyev, Akhmed Avtorkhanov, Ibn al-Khattab, Abu al-Walid, Abu Hafs al-Urduni, Muhannad, Ali Taziev, Supyan Abdullayev, Shamil Basayev, Ruslan Gelayev, Salman Raduyev, Sulim Yamadayev, Rappani Khalilov, Yassir al- Sudani. During these missions, many operators received honors for their courage and prowess in combat, including with the title Hero of the Russian Federation. At least 106 FSB and GRU operators died during the conflict. Moscow theatre hostage crisis The crisis was the seizure of the crowded Dubrovka Theatre on 23 October 2002 by 40 to 50 armed Chechens who claimed allegiance to the Islamist militant separatist movement in Chechnya. They took 850 hostages and demanded the withdrawal of Russian forces from Chechnya and an end to the Second Chechen War. The siege was officially led by Movsar Barayev. Due to the disposition of the theatre, special forces would have had to fight through of corridor and attack up a well defended staircase, before they could reach the hall in where the hostages were held. The terrorist also had numerous explosives, with the most powerful in the centre of the auditorium, that if detonated, could have brought down the ceiling and caused casualties in excess of 80 percent. After a two-and-a-half-day siege and the execution of two hostages, Spetsnaz operators from the Federal Security Service (FSB) Alpha and Vympel a.k.a. Vega Groups, supported by the Russian Ministry of Internal Affairs (MVD) SOBR unit, pumped an undisclosed chemical agent into the building's ventilation system and raided it. During the raid, all of the attackers were killed, with no casualties among Spetsnaz, but about 130 hostages, including nine foreigners, died due to poor first aid after falling unconscious from the gas. Most died after being evacuated from the theatre and laid outside on their backs instead of in the approved recovery position and then choking to death. Russian security agencies refused to disclose the gas used in the attack leading to doctors in local hospitals being unable to respond adequately to the influx of casualties.Moscow theatre siege: Questions remain unanswered BBC Retrieved on 16 December 2013 All but two of the hostages who died during the siege were killed by the toxic substance pumped into the theatre to subdue the militants.\\"Moscow court begins siege claims\\" , BBC News, 24 December 2002 The use of the gas was widely condemned as heavy-handed, but the American and British governments deemed Russia's actions justifiable. Physicians in Moscow condemned the refusal to disclose the identity of the gas that prevented them from saving more lives. Some reports said the drug naloxone was used to save some hostages. Beslan school siege Beslan school victim photos. Also referred to as the Beslan massacreBeslan mothers' futile quest for relief , BBC News, 4 June 2005 started on 1 September 2004, lasted three days and involved the capture of over 1,100 people as hostages (including 777 children), ending with the death of 334 people. The event led to security and political repercussions in Russia; in the aftermath of the crisis, there has been an increase in Ingush- Ossetian ethnic hostility, while contributing to a series of federal government reforms consolidating power in the Kremlin and strengthening of the powers of the President of Russia. The crisis began when a group of armed radical Islamist combatants, mostly Ingush and Chechen, occupied School Number One (SNO) in the town of Beslan, North Ossetia (an autonomous republic in the North Caucasus region of the Russian Federation) on 1 September 2004. The hostage-takers were the Riyadus-Salikhin Battalion, sent by the Chechen terrorist warlord Shamil Basayev, who demanded recognition of the independence of Chechnya at the United Nations and the withdrawal of Russian forces from Chechnya. On the third day of the standoff, counter terrorism units stormed the building using heavy weapons after several explosions rocked the building and children started escaping. It was in this chaos most of the officers were killed, trying to protect escaping children from gun fire. At least 334 hostages were killed as a result of the crisis, including 186 children. Official reports on how many members of Russia's special forces died in the fighting varied from 11, 12, 16 (7 Alpha and 9 Vega) to more than 20 killed. There are only 10 names on the special forces monument in Beslan. The fatalities included all three commanders of the assault group: Colonel Oleg Ilyin, Lieutenant Colonel Dmitry Razumovsky of Vega, and Major Alexander Perov of Alpha. At least 30 commandos suffered serious wounds. The attack also marked the end to the mass terrorism in the North Caucasus separatist conflict until 2010, when two Dagestani female suicide bombers attacked two railway stations in Russia. After Beslan, there was a period of several years without suicide attacks in and around Chechnya. Lessons learned targeted operations in the North Caucasus in 2006 alone, during which they killed more than 100 members of terrorist groups. By the mid 2000s, the special forces gained a firm upper hand over separatists and terrorist attacks in Russia dwindled, falling from 257 in 2005 to 48 in 2007. Military analyst Vitaly Shlykov praised the effectiveness of Russia's security agencies, saying that the experience learned in Chechnya and Dagestan had been key to the success. In 2008, the American Carnegie Endowment's Foreign Policy magazine named Russia as \\"the worst place to be a terrorist\\", particularly highlighting Russia's willingness to prioritize national security over civil rights. By 2010, Russian special forces, led by the FSB, had managed to eliminate the top leadership of the Chechen insurgency, except for Dokka Umarov. From 2009, the level of terrorism in Russia increased again. Particularly worrisome was the increase in suicide attacks. While between February 2005 and August 2008, no civilians were killed in such attacks, in 2008 at least 17 were killed and in 2009 the number rose to 45. In March 2010, Islamist militants organised the 2010 Moscow Metro bombings, which killed 40 people. One of the two blasts took place at Lubyanka station, near the FSB headquarters. Militant leader Doku Umarov‚Äîdubbed \\"Russia's Osama Bin Laden\\"‚Äîtook responsibility for the attacks. In July 2010, President Dmitry Medvedev expanded the FSB's powers in its fight against terrorism. In 2011, Federal Security Service exposed 199 foreign spies, including 41 professional spies and 158 agents employed by foreign intelligence services. The number has risen in recent years: in 2006 the FSB reportedly caught about 27 foreign intelligence officers and 89 foreign agents. Comparing the number of exposed spies historically, the then-FSB Director Nikolay Kovalyov said in 1996: \\"There has never been such a number of spies arrested by us since the time when German agents were sent in during the years of World War II.\\" The 2011 figure is similar to what was reported in 1995‚Äì1996, when around 400 foreign intelligence agents were uncovered during the two-year period.Counterintelligence Cases , by GlobalSecurity.org =Anti terrorist operations prior to 2014 Sochi Olympics= Olympic organizers received several threats prior to the Games. In a July 2013 video release, Chechen Islamist commander Dokka Umarov called for attacks on the Games, stating that the Games were being staged \\"on the bones of many, many Muslims killed ...and buried on our lands extending to the Black Sea.\\" Threats were received from the group Vilayat Dagestan, which had claimed responsibility for the Volgograd bombings under the demands of Umarov, and a number of National Olympic Committees had also received threats via e-mail, threatening that terrorists would kidnap or \\"blow up\\" athletes during the Games. In response to the insurgent threats, Russian special forces cracked down on suspected terrorist organizations, making several arrests and claiming to have curbed several plots, and killed numerous Islamist leaders including Eldar Magatov, a suspect in attacks on Russian targets and alleged leader of an insurgent group in the Babyurt district of Dagestan. Dokka Umarov himself was poisoned on 6 August 2013, and died on 7 September 2013. =2014 intervention in Ukraine= Troops without insignia at the building of the Verkhovna Rada of the Autonomous Republic of Crimea during its attack. Spetsnaz unit of the VDV RF took part in the 2014 Crimean crisis. Several hundred members of the 45th Detached Guards Spetsnaz Regiment and the 22nd Spetsnaz brigade were sent in, disguised as civilians. =Insurgency in the Caucasus= Although crime has been markedly reduced and stability increased throughout Russia compared to the previous year, about 350 militants in the North Caucasus have been killed in anti-terror operations in the first four months of 2014, according to an announcement by Interior Minister Vladimir Kolokoltsev in the State Duma. On 23 September 2014, Russian news agencies marked the 15th anniversary of the formation of the Unified Group of Troops (OGV, or –û–ì–í) in the North Caucasus. The OGV is the inter-service headquarters established at Khankala, Chechnya to command all Russian (MOD, MVD, FSB) operations from the start of the second Chechen war in 1999. Since its inception, the OGV combined operations has conducted 40,000 special missions, destroyed 5,000 bases and caches, confiscated 30,000 weapons, and disarmed 80,000 explosive devices and in the process has killed over 10,000 insurgents in the time frame of 15 years. The Ministry of Internal Affairs (MVD) noted that the decoration Hero of the Russian Federation has been awarded to 93 MVD servicemen in the OGV (including 66 posthumously). Overall, more than 23,000 MVD troops have received honors for their conduct during operations. Russian spetsnaz forces participated in the 2014 Grozny clashes. =Syrian Civil War= Various Russian special missions units have been openly supporting Syrian army units, and along with the Russian Aerospace Forces, have been invaluable in pushing back anti- government forces. At the peak of the deployment, there was a detachment of approximately 250 GRU spetsnaz soldiers, probably drawn from several units, including Naval Spetsnaz from the 431st Naval Reconnaissance Point, while SOF operators from the KSSO, reportedly conducted mainly snipers/counter-snipers, sabotage and reconnaissance missions behind enemy lines.http://publications.gc.ca/collections/collection_2017/mdn- dnd/D4-10-21-2017-eng.pdf History The Imperial Russian Army had hunter- commando units, formed by a decree of Emperor Alexander III in 1886, which saw action in World War I prior to the Russian Revolution of 1917. Also during World War I, General Aleksei Brusilov became one of the first senior commanders to utilize the tactics of fast-action shock troops for assaults following concentrated accurate artillery fire in what would be later be known as the Brusilov Offensive of 1916. Such tactics, considered revolutionary at the time, would later inspire people like Prussian Captain Willy Rohr in the development of the Prussian Stormtroopers (founded in 1915). =Timeline= ImageSize = width:550 height:550 PlotArea = width:50 height:530 left:50 bottom:10 DateFormat = yyyy Period = from:1950 till:1994 TimeAxis = orientation:vertical ScaleMajor = unit:year increment:5 start:1950 # there is no automatic collision detection, # so shift texts up or down manually to avoid overlap Define $dx = 25 # shift text to right side of bar PlotData= bar:Leaders color:red width:25 mark:(line,white) align:left fontsize:S from:start till:1950 shift:($dx,5) text:46 army Spetsnaz companies established by Georgy Zhukov (5,520 men). from:1950 till:1962 shift:($dx,5) text:Army and fleet Spetsnaz companies expanded to battalions. from:1962 till:1974 shift:($dx,5) text:Spetsnaz battalions expanded to 16 army and fleet brigades and a number of separate detachments. from:1974 till:1978 shift:($dx,5) text:First KGB special detachment, Alpha Group, established by Yuri Andropov (30 men). from:1978 till:1979 shift:($dx,5) text:First MVD special detachment, Vityaz, established by Nikolay Schyolokov (100 men). from:1981 till:1991 shift:($dx,5) text:Second KGB special detachment, Vega Group (Vympel), established by Yuri Andropov (100 men). from:1991 till:1992 shift:($dx,5) text:First FSIN special detachment, Saturn, established by Viktor Yerin. from:1992 till:1994 shift:($dx,5) text:VDV 45th Spetsnaz regiment established by Eugene Podkolzin (655 men). The Russian military theorist Colonel Mikhail Svechnykov originally proposed the concept of using special tactics and strategies. Svechnykov (executed during the Great Purge in 1938), envisaged the development of unconventional warfare capabilities to overcome disadvantages faced by conventional forces in the field. In the 1930s the \\"grandfather of the spetsnaz\\", Ilya Starinov, –î–µ–¥ —Å–æ–≤–µ—Ç—Å–∫–æ–≥–æ —Å–ø–µ—Ü–Ω–∞–∑–∞ began the implementation of the idea. During World War II, Red Army reconnaissance and sabotage detachments formed under the supervision of the Second Department of the General Staff of the Soviet Armed Forces. These forces were subordinate to front commanders.Carey Schofield, The Russian Elite: Inside Spetsnaz and the Airborne Forces, Greenhill, London, 1993, p.34-37 The infamous NKVD internal-security and espionage agency also had their own special purpose (osnaz) detachments, including many saboteur teams who were airdropped into enemy-occupied territories to work with (and often take over and lead) the Soviet Partisans. In 1950 Georgy Zhukov advocated the creation of 46 military spetsnaz companies, each consisting of 120 servicemen. This was the first use of \\"spetsnaz\\" to denote a separate military branch since World War II. These companies were later expanded to battalions and then to brigades. However, some separate companies (orSpN) and detachments (ooSpN) existed with brigades until the dissolution of the Soviet Union. The special-purpose forces of the Armed Forces of the Soviet Union included fourteen land brigades, two naval brigades and a number of separate detachments and companies, operating under the Main Intelligence Directorate (GRU) and collectively known as Spetsnaz GRU. These units and formations existed in the highest possible secrecy, disguised as Soviet paratroopers (Army spetsnaz) or naval infantrymen (Naval spetsnaz) by their uniforms and insignia. Twenty-four years after the birth of Spetsnaz, the Chairman of the KGB General Yuri Andropov (in that office from 1967 to 1982) established the first counter-terrorist unit. From the late 1970s through to the 1980s, a number of special-purpose units were founded in the KGB (1954‚Äì1991) and in the Ministry of Internal Affairs (MVD) (1946‚Äì1954). During the 1990s special detachments were established within the Federal Penitentiary Service (FSIN) and the Airborne Troops (VDV). Some civil agencies with non-police functions have formed special units also known as Spetsnaz, such as the Leader special centre in the Ministry of Emergency Situations (MChS). In total, by December 1991, at the time of the collapse of the USSR, the GRU reconnaissance and sabotage formations had: * 14 special purpose brigades * 2 special purposes regiments * 29 independent special purpose companies * 5 naval reconnaissance point In 2013 a Special Operations Forces Command was established for Special Operations Forces which had earlier been established from around 2009 following a study of Western special-operations forces units and commands. The Command was not under the control of the GRU but reported directly to the General Staff ‚Äì as did the GRU. List and structure of Soviet and Russian military special forces The elite units of the Soviet Armed Forces and Armed Forces of the Russian Federation are controlled, for the most part, by the military-intelligence GRU (Spetsnaz GRU) under the General Staff. They were heavily involved in secret operations and training pro-Soviet forces during the Cold War and in the wars in Afghanistan during the 1980s and Chechnya during the 1990s and 2000s. In 2010, as a result of the 2008 Russian military reform, GRU special forces came under the control of the Russian Ground Forces, being \\"directly subordinated to commanders of combined strategic commands.\\"Roger McDermott, Bat or Mouse? The Strange Case of Reforming Spetsnaz , Eurasia Daily Monitor Volume: 7 Issue: 198, 2 November 2010. However, in 2013, these Spetsnaz forces were placed back under the GRU. The Russian Airborne Troops (VDV, a separate branch of the Soviet and Russian Armed Forces) includes the 45th Guards Spetsnaz Brigade. In 2009, a Directorate of Special Operations was established that reported directly to the General Staff not the GRU to establish the Special Operations Forces which in 2013 became the Special Operations Forces Command. The FSB Spetsnaz maintain a training base near the village of Averkyevo. Most Russian military special forces units are known by their type of formation (company, battalion or brigade) and a number, like other Soviet or Russian military units. Two exceptions were the ethnic Chechen Special Battalions Vostok and Zapad (East and West) that existed during the 2000s.

The TsSN FSB consists of estimated 4,000 operators in three operative divisions: * Directorate \\"A\\" (Spetsgruppa Alpha) * Directorate \\"V\\" (Spetsgruppa Vympel) * Directorate \\"S\\" (Spetsgruppa Smerch) (Moscow city and Moscow Oblast) * Directorate \\"K\\" (Caucasus - formerly Special Purpose unit for the city of Yessentuki) * 2nd SN Service of the Special Purpose Center of FSB (Crimea) * Service of Use of Special Weapons TsSN FSB headquarters is a large complex of buildings and training areas, with dozens of hectares of land and scores of training facilities. The average training period for a TsSN officer is about five years. Spetsgruppa 'A' (Alpha Group) is a counter-terrorist unit created in 1974. It is a professional unit, consisting of about 720 personnel, of which about 250‚Äì300 are trained for assault operations and the rest are support personnel.http://www.academia.edu/17563421/Russian_Military_Forces_of_the_MVD_the_Border_Troops_and_the_Special_Forces These are dispersed in five operational detachments, including one permanent detachment in the Chechen Republic. Other units are stationed in Moscow, Krasnodar, Yekaterinburg and Khabarovsk. All Alpha operators undergo airborne, mountain and counter-sabotage dive training. Alpha has operated in other countries, most notably Operation Storm-333 (when Alpha and Zenith detachments supported the 154th Independent Spetsnaz Detachment‚Äîknown as the \\"Muslim Battalion\\"‚Äîof the GRU on a mission to overthrow and kill Afghan president Hafizullah Amin). Spetsgruppa \\"V\\", abbreviation of the Directorate –≤ (Russian Cyrillic for V), also known as \\"Vega\\" in period 1993‚Äì1995, was formed in 1981, merging two elite Cold War-era KGB special units‚ÄîCascade (Kaskad) and Zenith (Zenit)‚Äîwhich were similar to the CIA's Special Activities Division (responsible for clandestine / covert operations involving sabotage and assassination in other countries) and re-designated for counter-terrorist and counter-sabotage operations. It is tasked with the protection of strategic installations, such as factories and transportation centers. With its Alpha counterparts, it is heavily used in the North Caucasus. Vympel has four operative units in Moscow, with branch offices in nearly every city containing a nuclear power plant. Spetsgruppa \\"S\\", abbreviation of the Directorate C (Russian Cyrillic for S), also known as Smerch, but also known as the Service of Special Operations (–°–°–û), is a relatively new unit formed in July 1999. Officers from Smerch are frequently involved with the capture and transfer of various bandit and criminal leaders who help aid disruption in the North Caucasus and throughout Russia. Operations include both direct action against bandit holdouts in Southern Russia as well as high-profile arrests in more densely populated cities and guarding government officials. Because of its initials, this group is casually referred to as \\"Smerch\\". With the Centre of Special Operations and its elite units, many FSB special forces units operate at the regional level. These detachments are usually known as ROSN or ROSO (Regional Department of Special Designation), such as Saint Petersburg's Grad (Hail) or Murmansk's Kasatka (Orca). Foreign Intelligence Service of the Russian Federation The SVR RF, formerly the First Chief Directorate of the KGB of the USSR, has its own top secret elite special force within the Operations Department of Directorate Z known as (–ó–∞—Å–ª–æ–Ω) (meaning Screen, Barrier or Shield) about which extremely little is known. Formerly in PGU KGB SSSR called Vympel (e.g. French counterpart; Action Division). However, mere existence of such group within SVR is denied by Russian authorities. Nevertheless, there were some rumors that such group does indeed exist and is assigned to execute very specific special operations abroad primarily for protection of Russian embassy personnel and internal investigations. It is believed that the group is deep undercover and consists of approximately 300‚Äì500 highly experienced operatives speaking several languages and having extensive record of operations while serving in other secret units of the Russian military.

The special missions units of the National Guard of Russia (consolidated and replaced the forces of the MVD Internal Troops, SOBR, OMON) includes a number of Russian Internal Troops (VV, successor to the Soviet Internal Troops) paramilitary units to combat internal threats to the government, such as insurgencies and mutinies. These units usually have a unique name and official OSN (previously known as OSNAZ or osobogo naznacheniya meaning \\"special purpose\\") number, and some are part the ODON (also known as Dzerzhinsky Division).

Most of Russia's special-police officers belong to OMON units, which are primarily used as riot police and not considered an elite force‚Äîunlike the SOBR (known as the OMSN from 2002 to 2011) rapid-response units consisting of experienced, better-trained and -equipped officers.

Spetsnaz units in other post-Soviet countries =Ukrainian Spetsnaz= Like all post-Soviet states, Ukraine inherited its Spetsnaz units from the remnants of the Soviet armed forces, GRU and KGB units. Ukraine now maintains its own Spetsnaz structure under the control of the Ministry of Interior, and under the Ministry of Defence, while the Security Service of Ukraine maintains its own Spetsnaz force, the Alpha group. The term \\"Alpha\\" is also used by many other post Soviet states such as Russia, Belarus, and Kazakhstan as these units are based on the Soviet Union's Alpha Group. Ukraine's Berkut special police force gained mainstream attention during the 2014 Ukrainian revolution as it was alleged to have been used by the government to quell the uprising. However, this is disputed as many officers were also wounded and killed in the action. =Belarusian Spetsnaz= The 5th Spetsnaz Brigade is a special forces brigade of the Armed Forces of Belarus, formerly part of the Soviet Spetsnaz. In addition, the State Security Committee (KGB) of Belarus that was formed from the inherited personnel and operators after the break up of the Soviet Union. KGB of Belarus has its own Spetsgruppa \\"A\\" (Alpha Group), which is the country's primary counter- terrorism unit. =Kazakh Spetsnaz= As with many post Soviet states, Kazakhstan adopted the term Alpha Group to be used by its special forces.

History Early accounts reported that in 1661 a local landowner, John Mompesson, owner of a house in the town of Tedworth (now called Tidworth, in Wiltshire), had brought a lawsuit against an unlicensed vagrant drummer William Drury, whom he accused of collecting money by false pretences. After he had won judgment against the drummer, the drum was turned over to Mompesson by the local bailiff. Mompesson then found his house plagued by nocturnal drumming noises. It was alleged that the drummer had brought these plagues of noise upon Mompesson's head by witchcraft.Aldridge, Alfred Owen. \\"Franklin and the Ghostly Drummer of Tedworth\\", The William and Mary Quarterly, Vol. 7, No. 4 (Oct., 1950), pp. 559-567 DOI: 10.2307/1917046 Drury was said to have been associated with a band of gypsies. Glanvill, who visited the house in 1663, had claimed to have heard strange scratching noises under a bed in the children's room.Davidson, Jane. (2012).

Trows are generally inclined to be short of stature, ugly, and shy in nature. Trows are nocturnal creatures, like the troll of Scandinavian legend with which the trow shares many similarities. They venture out of their 'trowie knowes' (earthen mound dwellings) solely in the evening, and often enter households as the inhabitants sleep. Trows traditionally have a fondness for music, and folktales tell of their habit of kidnapping musicians or luring them to their dens.  Sea trow  The sea trow (Trowis) of Stronsay, according to Jo Ben's Description of the Orkney Islands (1529), was a maritime monster resembling a colt whose entire body was cloaked in seaweed, with a coiled or matted coat of hair, sexual organs like a horse's, and known to copulate with the women of the island.  Trows in general  According to Sir Walter Scott (1835): \\"Possession of supernatural wisdom is still imputed by the natives of Orkney and Zetland Islands, to the people called Drows, who may, in most other respects, be identified with the Caledonian fairies\\".p  Origins and parallels  Ben's sea trow (trowis) bore resemblance to the anciently known incubus, as it \\"seems to have occupied the visions of the female sex\\", as noted by John Graham Dalyell (1835). Dey (1991) speculates that the tradition, and perhaps that of the selkie, may be based in part on the Norse invasions of the Northern Isles. She states that the conquest by the Vikings sent the indigenous, dark-haired Picts into hiding and that \\"many stories exist in Shetland of these strange people, smaller and darker than the tall, blond Vikings who, having been driven off their land into sea caves, emerged at night to steal from the new land owners\\".

Zalta (ed.) highlighting the apparent lack of justification for: # Generalizing about the properties of a class of objects based on some number of observations of particular instances of that class (e.g., the inference that \\"all swans we have seen are white, and, therefore, all swans are white\\", before the discovery of black swans) or # Presupposing that a sequence of events in the future will occur as it always has in the past (e.g., that the laws of physics will hold as they have always been observed to hold). Hume called this the principle of uniformity of nature.#9662: Most recently updated in 16 October 2007 The most famous formulation of the problem was proposed by David Hume in the mid-18th century, although versions of the problem date back to the Pyrrhonist school of Hellenistic philosophy and the CƒÅrvƒÅka school of ancient Indian philosophy. The problem calls into question the traditional inductivist account of all empirical claims made in everyday life or through the scientific method, and, for that reason, C. D. Broad once said that \\"induction is the glory of science and the scandal of philosophy\\". In contrast, Karl Popper's critical rationalism claimed that induction is never used in science and proposed instead that science is based on the procedure of conjecturing hypotheses, deductively calculating consequences, and then empirically attempting to falsify them.  Formulation of the problem  In inductive reasoning, one makes a series of observations and infers a new claim based on them. For instance, from a series of observations that a woman walks her dog by the market at 8 am on Monday, it seems valid to infer that next Monday she will do the same, or that, in general, the woman walks her dog by the market every Monday. That next Monday the woman walks by the market merely adds to the series of observations, it does not prove she will walk by the market every Monday. First of all, it is not certain, regardless of the number of observations, that the woman always walks by the market at 8 am on Monday. In fact, David Hume would even argue that we cannot claim it is \\"more probable\\", since this still requires the assumption that the past predicts the future. Second, the observations themselves do not establish the validity of inductive reasoning, except inductively. Bertrand Russell illustrated this point in The Problems of Philosophy: In several publications it is presented as a story about a turkey, fed every morning without fail, who following the laws of induction concludes this will continue, but then his throat is cut on Thanksgiving Day.This story is found in Alan Chalmers, What is this thing Called Science, Open University Press, Milton Keynes, 1982, p. 14. =Ancient and early modern origins= Pyrrhonism The works of the Pyrrhonist philosopher Sextus Empiricus contain the oldest surviving questioning of the validity of inductive reasoning. He wrote:Sextus Empiricus. Outlines of Pyrrhonism, Book II, Chapter 15 Section 204 trans. Robert Gregg Bury (Loeb ed.) (London: W. Heinemann, 1933), p. 283. The focus upon the gap between the premises and conclusion present in the above passage appears different from Hume's focus upon the circular reasoning of induction. However, Weintraub claims in The Philosophical QuarterlyWeintraub, R. (1995). What was Hume's Contribution to the Problem of Induction? The Philosophical Quarterly 45(181):460‚Äì470 that although Sextus's approach to the problem appears different, Hume's approach was actually an application of another argument raised by Sextus:Sextus Empiricus. Against the Logicians, trans. Robert Gregg Bury (Loeb ed.) (London: W. Heinemann, 1935), p. 179 Although the criterion argument applies to both deduction and induction, Weintraub believes that Sextus's argument \\"is precisely the strategy Hume invokes against induction: it cannot be justified, because the purported justification, being inductive, is circular.\\" She concludes that \\"Hume's most important legacy is the supposition that the justification of induction is not analogous to that of deduction.\\" She ends with a discussion of Hume's implicit sanction of the validity of deduction, which Hume describes as intuitive in a manner analogous to modern foundationalism. Indian philosophy The CƒÅrvƒÅka, a materialist and skeptic school of Indian philosophy, used the problem of induction to point out the flaws in using inference as a way to gain valid knowledge. They held that since inference needed an invariable connection between the middle term and the predicate, and further, that since there was no way to establish this invariable connection, that the efficacy of inference as a means of valid knowledge could never be stated.Dr. S. Radhakrishnan, Indian Philosophy Vol I, p. 279S. Dasgupta, A history of Indian philosophy, Vol III. pg 533 The 9th century Indian skeptic, Jayarasi Bhatta, also made an attack on inference, along with all means of knowledge, and showed by a type of reductio argument that there was no way to conclude universal relations from the observation of particular instances.Piotr Balcerowicz, \\"JayarƒÅ≈õi\\"Franco, Eli, 1987, Perception, Knowledge and Disbelief: A Study of JayarƒÅ≈õi's Scepticism Medieval philosophy Medieval writers such as al- Ghazali and William of Ockham connected the problem with God's absolute power, asking how we can be certain that the world will continue behaving as expected when God could at any moment miraculously cause the opposite.Franklin, J. (2001), The Science of Conjecture: Evidence and Probability Before Pascal (Baltimore: Johns Hopkins University Press), 232‚Äì233, 241. Duns Scotus, however, argued that inductive inference from a finite number of particulars to a universal generalization was justified by \\"a proposition reposing in the soul, 'Whatever occurs in a great many instances by a cause that is not free, is the natural effect of that cause.Duns Scotus: Philosophical Writings, trans. A. Wolter (Edinburgh: 1962), 109‚Äì110; Franklin, Science of Conjecture, 206. Some 17th-century Jesuits argued that although God could create the end of the world at any moment, it was necessarily a rare event and hence our confidence that it would not happen very soon was largely justified.Franklin, Science of Conjecture, 223‚Äì224. = David Hume = David Hume, a Scottish thinker of the commercial era, is the philosopher most often associated with induction. His formulation of the problem of induction can be found in An Enquiry concerning Human Understanding, ¬ß4. Here, Hume introduces his famous distinction between \\"relations of ideas\\" and \\"matters of fact.\\" Relations of ideas are propositions which can be derived from deductive logic, which can be found in fields such as geometry and algebra. Matters of fact, meanwhile, are not verified through the workings of deductive logic but by experience. Specifically, matters of fact are established by making an inference about causes and effects from repeatedly observed experience. While relations of ideas are supported by reason alone, matters of fact must rely on the connection of a cause and effect through experience. Causes of effects cannot be linked through a priori reasoning, but by positing a \\"necessary connection\\" that depends on the \\"uniformity of nature.\\" Hume situates his introduction to the problem of induction in A Treatise of Human Nature within his larger discussion on the nature of causes and effects (Book I, Part III, Section VI). He writes that reasoning alone cannot establish the grounds of causation. Instead, the human mind imputes causation to phenomena after repeatedly observing a connection between two objects. For Hume, establishing the link between causes and effects relies not on reasoning alone, but the observation of \\"constant conjunction\\" throughout one's sensory experience. From this discussion, Hume goes onto present his formulation of the problem of induction in A Treatise of Human Nature, writing \\"there can be no demonstrative arguments to prove, that those instances, of which we have had no experience, resemble those, of which we have had experience.\\" In other words, the problem of induction can be framed in the following way: we cannot apply a conclusion about a particular set of observations to a more general set of observations. While deductive logic allows one to arrive at a conclusion with certainty, inductive logic can only provide a conclusion that is probably true. It is mistaken to frame the difference between deductive and inductive logic as one between general to specific reasoning and specific to general reasoning. This is a common misperception about the difference between inductive and deductive thinking. According to the literal standards of logic, deductive reasoning arrives at certain conclusions while inductive reasoning arrives at probable conclusions. Hume's treatment of induction helps to establish the grounds for probability, as he writes in A Treatise of Human Nature that \\"probability is founded on the presumption of a resemblance betwixt those objects, of which we have had experience, and those, of which we have had none\\" (Book I, Part III, Section VI). Therefore, Hume establishes induction as the very grounds for attributing causation. There might be many effects which stem from a single cause. Over repeated observation, one establishes that a certain set of effects are linked to a certain set of causes. However, the future resemblance of these connections to connections observed in the past depends on induction. Induction allows one to conclude that \\"Effect A2\\" was caused by \\"Cause A2\\" because a connection between \\"Effect A1\\" and \\"Cause A1\\" was observed repeatedly in the past. Given that reason alone can not be sufficient to establish the grounds of induction, Hume implies that induction must be accomplished through imagination. One does not make an inductive reference through a priori reasoning, but through an imaginative step automatically taken by the mind. Hume does not challenge that induction is performed by the human mind automatically, but rather hopes to show more clearly how much human inference depends on inductive‚Äînot a priori‚Äîreasoning. He does not deny future uses of induction, but shows that it is distinct from deductive reasoning, helps to ground causation, and wants to inquire more deeply into its validity. Hume offers no solution to the problem of induction himself. He prompts other thinkers and logicians to argue for the validity of induction as an ongoing dilemma for philosophy. A key issue with establishing the validity of induction is that one is tempted to use an inductive inference as a form of justification itself. This is because people commonly justify the validity of induction by pointing to the many instances in the past when induction proved to be accurate. For example, one might argue that it is valid to use inductive inference in the future because this type of reasoning has yielded accurate results in the past. However, this argument relies on an inductive premise itself‚Äîthat past observations of induction being valid will mean that future observations of induction will also be valid. Thus, many solutions to the problem of induction tend to be circular. =Nelson Goodman's new riddle of induction= Nelson Goodman's Fact, Fiction, and Forecast presented a different description of the problem of induction in the chapter entitled \\"The New Riddle of Induction\\". Goodman proposed the new predicate \\"grue\\". Something is grue if and only if it has been (or will be, according to a scientific, general hypothesisGoodman, Nelson. Fact, Fiction, and Forecast (Fourth Edition). Harvard University Press, 1983, p.74, \\"will each confirm the general hypothesis that all emeralds are grue\\"Goodman‚Äôs original definition of grue) observed to be green before a certain time t, or blue if observed after that time. The \\"new\\" problem of induction is, since all emeralds we have ever seen are both green and grue, why do we suppose that after time t we will find green but not grue emeralds? The problem here raised is that two different inductions will be true and false under the same conditions. In other words: * Given the observations of a lot of green emeralds, someone using a common language will inductively infer that all emeralds are green (therefore, he will believe that any emerald he will ever find will be green, even after time t). * Given the same set of observations of green emeralds, someone using the predicate \\"grue\\" will inductively infer that all emeralds, which will be observed after t, will be blue, despite the fact that he observed only green emeralds so far. Goodman, however, points out that the predicate \\"grue\\" only appears more complex than the predicate \\"green\\" because we have defined grue in terms of blue and green. If we had always been brought up to think in terms of \\"grue\\" and \\"bleen\\" (where bleen is blue before time t, or green thereafter), we would intuitively consider \\"green\\" to be a crazy and complicated predicate. Goodman believed that which scientific hypotheses we favour depend on which predicates are \\"entrenched\\" in our language. W. V. O. Quine offers a practical solution to this problem Reprinted in: Quine (1969), Ontological Relativity and Other Essays, Ch. 5. by making the metaphysical claim that only predicates that identify a \\"natural kind\\" (i.e. a real property of real things) can be legitimately used in a scientific hypothesis. R. Bhaskar also offers a practical solution to the problem. He argues that the problem of induction only arises if we deny the possibility of a reason for the predicate, located in the enduring nature of something. For example, we know that all emeralds are green, not because we have only ever seen green emeralds, but because the chemical make-up of emeralds insists that they must be green. If we were to change that structure, they would not be green. For instance, emeralds are a kind of green beryl, made green by trace amounts of chromium and sometimes vanadium. Without these trace elements, the gems would be colourless. Notable interpretations =Hume= Although induction is not made by reason, Hume observes that we nonetheless perform it and improve from it. He proposes a descriptive explanation for the nature of induction in ¬ß5 of the Enquiry, titled \\"Skeptical solution of these doubts\\". It is by custom or habit that one draws the inductive connection described above, and \\"without the influence of custom we would be entirely ignorant of every matter of fact beyond what is immediately present to the memory and senses\\".Enquiry, ¬ß5.1. The result of custom is belief, which is instinctual and much stronger than imagination alone.Enquiry, ¬ß5.2. =David Stove and Donald Williams= David Stove's argument for induction, based on the statistical syllogism, was presented in the Rationality of Induction and was developed from an argument put forward by one of Stove's heroes, the late Donald Cary Williams (formerly Professor at Harvard) in his book The Ground of Induction., Stove argued that it is a statistical truth that the great majority of the possible subsets of specified size (as long as this size is not too small) are similar to the larger population to which they belong. For example, the majority of the subsets which contain 3000 ravens which you can form from the raven population are similar to the population itself (and this applies no matter how large the raven population is, as long as it is not infinite). Consequently, Stove argued that if you find yourself with such a subset then the chances are that this subset is one of the ones that are similar to the population, and so you are justified in concluding that it is likely that this subset \\"matches\\" the population reasonably closely. The situation would be analogous to drawing a ball out of a barrel of balls, 99% of which are red. In such a case you have a 99% chance of drawing a red ball. Similarly, when getting a sample of ravens the probability is very high that the sample is one of the matching or \\"representative\\" ones. So as long as you have no reason to think that your sample is an unrepresentative one, you are justified in thinking that probably (although not certainly) that it is.D. Stove, The Rationality of Induction, Clarendon Press, Oxford, 1986, ch. 6. =Biting the bullet: Keith Campbell and Claudio Costa= An intuitive answer to Hume would be to say that a world inaccessible to any inductive procedure would simply not be conceivable. This intuition was taken into account by Keith Campbell by considering that, to be built, a concept must be reapplied, which demands a certain continuity in its object of application and consequently some openness to induction.\\"One form of Skepticism about Induction\\", in Richard Swinburne (ed.) The Justification of the Induction. Oxford, Oxford University Press, 1974. Recently, Claudio Costa has noted that a future can only be a future of its own past if it holds some identity with it. Moreover, the nearer a future is to the point of junction with its past, the greater are the similarities tendentially involved. Consequently, ‚Äì contra Hume ‚Äì some form of principle of homogeneity (causal or structural) between future and past must be warranted, which would make some inductive procedure always possible.Claudio Costa: Philosophical Semantics: Reintegrating Theoretical Philosophy, Appendix to Ch. V, CSP, 2018. =Karl Popper= Karl Popper, a philosopher of science, sought to solve the problem of induction. He argued that science does not use induction, and induction is in fact a myth. Instead, knowledge is created by conjecture and criticism. The main role of observations and experiments in science, he argued, is in attempts to criticize and refute existing theories. According to Popper, the problem of induction as usually conceived is asking the wrong question: it is asking how to justify theories given they cannot be justified by induction. Popper argued that justification is not needed at all, and seeking justification \\"begs for an authoritarian answer\\". Instead, Popper said, what should be done is to look to find and correct errors. Popper regarded theories that have survived criticism as better corroborated in proportion to the amount and stringency of the criticism, but, in sharp contrast to the inductivist theories of knowledge, emphatically as less likely to be true.Logic of Scientific Discovery, section 43 Popper held that seeking for theories with a high probability of being true was a false goal that is in conflict with the search for knowledge. Science should seek for theories that are most probably false on the one hand (which is the same as saying that they are highly falsifiable and so there are many ways that they could turn out to be wrong), but still all actual attempts to falsify them have failed so far (that they are highly corroborated). Wesley C. Salmon criticizes Popper on the grounds that predictions need to be made both for practical purposes and in order to test theories. That means Popperians need to make a selection from the number of unfalsified theories available to them, which is generally more than one. Popperians would wish to choose well-corroborated theories, in their sense of corroboration, but face a dilemma: either they are making the essentially inductive claim that a theory's having survived criticism in the past means it will be a reliable predictor in the future; or Popperian corroboration is no indicator of predictive power at all, so there is no rational motivation for their preferred selection principle. David Miller has criticized this kind of criticism by Salmon and others because it makes inductivist assumptions. Popper does not say that corroboration is an indicator of predictive power. The predictive power is in the theory itself, not in its corroboration. The rational motivation for choosing a well- corroborated theory is that it is simply easier to falsify: Well-corroborated means that at least one kind of experiment (already conducted at least once) could have falsified (but did not actually falsify) the one theory, while the same kind of experiment, regardless of its outcome, could not have falsified the other. So it is rational to choose the well-corroborated theory: It may not be more likely to be true, but if it is actually false, it is easier to get rid of when confronted with the conflicting evidence that will eventually turn up. Accordingly, it is wrong to consider corroboration as a reason, a justification for believing in a theory or as an argument in favor of a theory to convince someone who objects to it.Thomas Bullemore, \\"Some Remarks on the Pragmatic Problem of Induction\\", Academia.edu See also * A priori and a posteriori * Abductive reasoning * Bayesian inference * Consilience * Hasty generalization * Inductive logic programming * Law of large numbers * Solomonoff's theory of inductive inference Notes References  External links  (1973) by David Stove * Discovering Karl Popper by Peter Singer * The Warrant of Induction by D.

Although the doctrine is rejected by the LDS Church today, it is still an accepted part of the modern theology of some Mormon fundamentalists. According to Young, he was taught by Joseph SmithMinutes of Meeting, at Historian's Office; Great Salt Lake City; 7 P.M. April 4, 1860 published in The Office Journal of Brigham Young 1858-1863, Appendix B. \\"It was Joseph's doctrine that Adam was God &c; When in Luke Johnson's\\". that Adam is \\"our Father and our God, and the only God with whom we have to do.\\" (statement given in the general conference of the LDS Church on April 9, 1852). According to the doctrine, Adam was once a mortal man who became resurrected and exalted. From another planet, he then came as Michael to form Earth.Journal of Discourses 7:285‚Äì90. Adam then was given a physical body and a spouse, Eve, where they became mortal by eating the forbidden fruit in the Garden of Eden. After bearing mortal children and establishing the human race, Adam and Eve returned to their heavenly thrones, where Adam serves as God and is the Heavenly Father of humankind. Later, Adam returned to the Earth to the ancient prophets and to become the literal father of Jesus. During the 19th century and the early 20th century, the Adam‚ÄìGod doctrine was featured as part of the church's endowment ceremony. However, the doctrine was startling to most members when it was introduced and remained controversial. Most Mormons and some breakoff groups, the most notable being apostle Orson Pratt, rejected the doctrine in favor of more traditional biblical Adam and Eve theory. Soon after Brigham Young died, the Adam‚ÄìGod doctrine fell out of favor within the LDS Church and was replaced by a theology more similar to Pratt's, as expounded by turn-of-the century Mormon theologians James E. Talmage, B. H. Roberts, and John A. Widtsoe. In 1976, church president Spencer W. Kimball stated the LDS Church does not support the doctrine. Most Mormons accept Adam as \\"the Ancient of Days,\\" \\"father of all,\\"Doctrine and Covenants 138:38‚Äì39. and \\"Michael the Archangel\\" but do not recognize him as being \\"God the Father.\\" Background Though Joseph Smith, the founder of the Latter Day Saint movement, never used the term \\"Adam‚ÄìGod\\" in any of his recorded public statements, he provided several teachings from which the doctrine's adherents draw support. For example, Smith taught in an 1839 sermon that Adam was actually the archangel Michael, who held the First Presidency in the premortal life. (Before the world was formed, the First Presidency \\"was first given to Adam.... He is Michael the Archangel, spoken of in the Scriptures.\\"); (doctrine of Adam as Michael and as premortal First President cited as a precursor for the Adam‚ÄìGod doctrine). In the same sermon, Smith taught that Adam holds \\"the keys of the universe,\\" (\\"Adam delivers up his stewardship to Christ, that which was delivered to him as holding the keys of the universe, but retains his standing as head of the human family.\\"). and so it is through his authority that all priesthood \\"keys,\\" the abilities to unlock particular priesthood powers, are revealed from heaven. (Adam's assignment of the keys of the universe cited as a precursor for the Adam‚ÄìGod doctrine). In 1840, Smith taught that Adam is the one \\"through whom Christ has been revealed from heaven, and will continue to be revealed from henceforth.\\"; (Adam-as-mediator doctrine cited as a precursor for the Adam‚ÄìGod doctrine). Finally, Smith taught in his 1844 King Follett discourse that God was once a man \\"like one of us.\\" (God \\"once was a man like one of us and... God Himself, the Father of us all, once dwelled on an earth the same as Jesus Christ himself did in the flesh.\\"); (citing teaching that God is an exalted man as a precursor for the Adam‚ÄìGod doctrine). Young and other adherents of the doctrine claim that Smith was its originator; ; (same); ; . and that Smith privately taught it to them before his death, in 1844. (citing minutes of meeting of the Quorum of Twelve, 4 April 1860, in which it was recorded: \\"It was Joseph's doctrine that Adam was God.... God comes to earth and eats and partakes of fruit. Joseph could not reveal what was revealed to him, and if Joseph had it revealed, he was not told to reveal it.\\"); (citing Wilford Woodruff Journal of 4 September 1860, in which George Q. Cannon said \\"that Adam is our Father [and] is a true doctrine revealed from God to Joseph & Brigham. For this same doctrine is taught in some of the old Jewish records which have never been in print.\\"); (citing Wilford Woodruff Journal of 16 December 1867, stating that \\"President Young said Adam was Michael the Archangel, & he was the Father of Jesus Christ & was our God & that Joseph taught this principle.\\"); (citing an 1877 reminiscence of Anson Call, who said he heard Smith say that \\"now regarding Adam: He came here from another planet [as] an immortalized being and brought his wife, Eve, with him, and by eating of the fruits of the earth became subject to death and decay and he became of the earth, earthly, was made mortal and subject to death.\\"). However, the prevailing academic view is that the doctrine taught by Young and others was an elaboration of Smith's vague references to Adam's unique role in Mormon doctrine.; (\\"Young's Adam‚ÄìGod teachings were an expansion of Joseph Smith's sermons in 1839-44\\"); (stating that there is \\"no reliable evidence contemporary to Smith's lifetime which lends support\\" to the view that Smith taught the Adam‚ÄìGod doctrine, and that Young \\"was not above inventing support for beliefs where none existed previously\\"). Although Young is generally credited with originating the doctrine, the original source may also have been Young's counselor in the First Presidency, Heber C. Kimball. (noting that Orson Pratt and contemporary historian T. B. H. Stenhouse both attributed the doctrine to Kimball). Description The Adam‚ÄìGod doctrine teaches that Adam is the father of both the spirits and physical bodies of all humans born on Earth, including Jesus. (describing the Adam‚ÄìGod doctrine as \\"that Adam was at once the spiritual as well as the physical father of all persons born on this world, including Jesus Christ\\"). Under the doctrine, Adam had a number of roles. First, he was a creator god. He and his wife, Eve, had become gods by living a mortal life, becoming resurrected, and receiving their exaltation.. As a god before the creation of the Earth, he was known as Michael, or the \\"Ancient of Days.\\" Michael was not the only creator god, however, as he was a member of a council of Earth's creator gods, which also included the gods \\"Elohim\\" and \\"Jehovah.\\" In Smith's original endowment ceremony, the gods involved in the creation were called \\"Elohim, Jehovah, and Michael,\\" but unlike in modern Mormon theology, \\"Jehovah\\" was not identified as Jesus. Rather, it was explained by Joseph F. Smith that \\"Elohim, Jehovah and Michael are Father, Son, and Grandson. They made this Earth and Michael became Adam.\\"Joseph F. Smith Journal, 6/17/1871) (describing Michael as a \\"God in the Council of Gods\\".); Within the council, Jehovah and Michael were subordinate to Elohim and created the Earth, under the direction of Elohim. Michael was selected by the heads of this council of gods to be the Father of this Earth.; (citing Joseph Smith's statement in ). Also, the doctrine teaches that Michael was the father of the spirits in heaven who are associated with this Earth.. With Eve, and possibly his other wives, Michael had fathered the spirits of spirit offspring in the preexistence. The spirits included Jesus, his firstborn, and Lucifer (the fallen angel who Mormons believe is Satan). (stating that Adam was the spiritual father of \\"Jehovah and Lucifer,\\" but since the advent of 20th-century Mormon theology, mainstream Mormons have identified Jehovah as Jesus). Michael became the heavenly \\"Father\\" and formed a \\"Godhead\\" that included Jesus and the Holy Spirit.Lacking source pertaining to Godhead being formed with Michael, Jesus and the Holy Spirit. Next, the doctrine teaches that Michael came to the Earth with one of his wives, where they became known as Adam and Eve, and became the progenitor of the human race and the father of mortal bodies of all his spirit offspring so that they could progress and achieve godhood like themselves.; . The names \\"Adam\\" and \\"Eve\\" are titles that reflect their roles as the parents of humanity, Adam meaning man or \\"[father] of mankind\\" and Eve meaning the \\"mother[s] of all living.\\"The privilege of peopling the Earth was part of Adam and Eve's eternal purpose as exalted beings and eternal parents of their spirit children. (citing ). To bear mortal children, Adam and Eve had to take on mortal bodies. The bodies of Adam and Eve fell to a mortal state when they ate the fruit of tree of knowledge of good and evil in the Garden of Eden.. Then, the doctrine teaches that after his mortal existence, Adam returned to his throne and reigned as the immortal God of this Earth.. He is thus considered to be the Biblical God of Israel. (noting that in the late 19th century, several Mormon leaders who still adhered to the Adam‚ÄìGod doctrine began to adopt the modern Mormon belief that the Old Testament deity was also Jesus). Smith stated that Adam's ascension to godhood took place at or after a gathering at a holy place of the same name. Smith taught that a similar gathering is to prelude the second coming of Christ. (LDS Church edition). The naming of Adam-ondi-Ahman is also recorded in the History of the Reorganized Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints in volume 2, chapter 9, pages 153‚Äì154. Finally, the doctrine teaches that Michael/Adam was the literal, biological father of the mortal body of Jesus.; (describing the Adam‚ÄìGod doctrine as \\"that Adam was at once the spiritual as well as the physical father of all persons born on this world, including Jesus Christ\\"); (Adam \\"later begot Jesus, his firstborn spirit son, in the flesh\\"). History =Brigham Young's 1852 explanation = Whether or not Smith had taught the doctrine, the first recorded explanation of the doctrine using the term \\"Adam‚ÄìGod\\" was by Young, who first taught the doctrine at the church's spring general conference on April 9, 1852. This sermon was recorded stenographically by George D. Watt, Young's private secretary, who was an expert in Pitman shorthand.. Watt published the sermon in 1854 in the British periodical Journal of Discourses, which was endorsed by Young and his counselors in the church's First Presidency.. In Watt's transcript of the sermon, Young said he intended to discuss \\"who it was that begat the Son of the Virgin Mary,\\" a subject which he said \\"has remained a mystery in this kingdom up to this day.\\". The transcript reads: > When our father Adam came into the garden of Eden, he came into it with a > celestial body, and brought Eve, one of his wives, with him. He helped to > make and organize this world. He is MICHAEL, the Archangel, the ANCIENT OF > DAYS! about whom holy men have written and spoken--He is our FATHER and our > GOD, and the only God with whom WE have to do. Every man upon the earth, > professing Christians or non-professing, must hear it, and will know it > sooner or later. The transcript then reads: \\"When the Virgin Mary conceived the child Jesus, the Father had begotten him in his own likeness. He was not begotten by the Holy Ghost. And who is the Father? He is the first of the human family\\".. The full text from Journal of Discourses 1:51 reads as follows: \\"It is true that the earth was organized by three distinct characters, namely, Eloheim, Yahovah, and Michael, these three forming a quorum, as in all heavenly bodies, and in organizing element, perfectly represented in the Deity, as Father, Son, and Holy Ghost. Again, they will try to tell how the divinity of Jesus is joined to his humanity, and exhaust all their mental faculties, and wind up with this profound language, as describing the soul of man, \\"it is an immaterial substance!\\" What a learned idea! Jesus, our elder brother, was begotten in the flesh by the same character that was in the garden of Eden, and who is our Father in Heaven. Now, let all who may hear these doctrines, pause before they make light of them, or treat them with indifference, for they will prove their salvation or damnation. I have given you a few leading items upon this subject, but a great deal more remains to be told. Now, remember from this time forth, and for ever,that Jesus Christ was not begotten by the Holy Ghost.\\" Young explained that Adam \\"was begotten by his Father in heaven\\" in the same way that Adam begat his own sons and daughters, and that there were \\"three distinct characters, namely, Eloheim, Yahovah, and Michael\\".. Then, reiterating, he said that \\"Jesus, our elder brother, was begotten in the flesh by the same character that was in the Garden of Eden, and who is our Father in Heaven.\\". Watt's transcript of the sermon was the only known stenographic recording; however, several other witnesses summarized it in their journals. These recountings vary somewhat in wording. For example, attendee Samuel Hollister Rogers wrote several days later, confirming that Young said that when Adam went to the Garden, he \\"brought his wife or one of his wives with him\\", that \\"Adam was the only God that we would have, and that Christ was not begotten by the Holy Ghost, but of the Father Adam.\\" Brigham Young Addresses 2:12; Samuel Hollister Rogers Journal 145. Young's bodyguard Hosea Stout wrote that night in his diary that \\"President B. Young taught that Adam was the father of Jesus and the only God to us.\\" Diary of Hosea Stout 2:435 (April 9, 1852). Wilford Woodruff wrote that Young said God went to the Garden of Eden with \\"one of his wifes\\", that \\"Adam is Michael or God And all the God that we have any thing to do with\\", and \\"when the VIRGIN MARY was begotton with Child it was By the Father and in no other way ownly as we were begotton.\\" Journal of Wilford Woodruff 4:127‚Äì30 (April 9, 1852). Young concluded, \\"I could tell you much more about this; but were I to tell you the whole truth, blasphemy would be nothing to it, in the estimation of the superstitious and overrighteous mankind .... Now, let all who may hear these doctrines, pause before they make light of them, or treat them with indifference, for they will prove their salvation or damnation.\\". =Further development by Young= In a special conference on August 28, 1852, Young explained in greater detail the mechanism by which celestial beings like Adam and Eve could give birth to mortal offspring. According to Young, when a couple first become gods and goddesses, they first begin to create spiritual offspring. Then, they begin creating \\"mortal tabernacles\\" in which those spirits can dwell, by going to a newly created world, where they: \\"eat and drink of the fruits of the corporal world, until this grosser matter is diffused sufficiently through their celestial bodies, to enable them according to the established laws to produce mortal tabernacles for their spiritual children\\" . This is what Adam and Eve did, Young said, and \\"Adam is my Father\\". . On February 19, 1854, Young reiterated the doctrine in a sermon.Journal of Wilford Woodruff, February 19, 1854. He also reiterated the doctrine at the October 1854 general conference,Journal of Joseph L. Robinson, October 6, 1854. in a sermon that was reported to have \\"held the vast audience as it were spellbound\\"Minutes of the General Conference, Deseret News, October 12, 1853. In the October conference, Young is reported as clarifying that Adam and Eve were \\"natural father and mother of every spirit that comes to this planet, or that receives tabernacles on this planet, consequently we are brother and sisters, and that Adam was God, our Eternal Father.\\"Journal of Joseph Lee Robinson, October 6, 1854. See also Diary of Thomas D. Brown, October 6, 1854, pp. 87‚Äì88 (\\"There are Lords many and there are Gods many, & the Father of our Spirits is the Father of Jesus Christ: He is the Father of Jesus Christ, Spirit & Body and he is the beginner of the bodies of all men\\"); John Pulsipher Papers, Mss 1041, p. 35‚Äì37, BYU Special Collections (\\"There are Lords many & Gods many But the God that we have to account to, is the father of our Spirits--Adam.\\"). When Young discussed the doctrine again in early 1857, he emphasized again that \\"to become acquainted with our Father and our God\\" was \\"one of the first principles of the doctrine of salvation\\", and that \\"no man can enjoy or be prepared for eternal life without that knowledge\\".Journal of Discourses 4:215. Nevertheless, he later said: > Whether Adam is the personage that we should consider Our Heavenly Father, > or not, is considerable of a mystery to a good many. I do not care for one > moment how that is; it is no matter whether we are to consider Him our God, > or whether His Father, or his Grandfather, for in either case we are of one > species of one family and Jesus Christ is also of our species.Journal of > Discourses 4:2217. =Initial reactions to the doctrine= The reaction within the Mormon community to Young's Adam‚ÄìGod teachings was mixed. While many accepted the doctrine, others regarded it as misguided, or interpreted it to adhere to their prior understanding. Young's initial 1852 announcement of the doctrine was greeted by some as prophetic. For example, the clerk of the conference, Thomas Bullock, recorded that during Young's sermon, \\"the Holy Ghost rest[ed] upon him with great power\\".Thomas Bullock, Minutes of the LDS General Conference Deseret News, April 17, 1852, p. 2. In a session of general conference the next day, Heber C. Kimball stated his agreement that \\"the God and Father of Jesus Christ was Adam\\".Journal of Wilford Woodruff, April 10, 1852. Another apostle, Franklin D. Richards, accepted the doctrine \\"that Adam is our Father and our God\\" as well, stating in a conference held in June 1854 that \\"the Prophet and Apostle Brigham has declared it, and that it is the word of the Lord\\".Franklin D. Richards, reported in \\"Minutes of the Special General Council\\", Millennial Star 16:534, 26 August 1854 (emphasis in original). Kimball readily adopted Young's views, and preached on June 29, 1856, that \\"I have learned by experience that there is but one God that pertains to this people, and He is the God that pertains to this earth‚Äîthe first man. That first man sent his own Son to redeem the world.\\"Journal of Discourses 4:1. A number of hymns acknowledging this doctrine were sung in local congregations of the LDS Church. One published in 1856, entitled \\"We Believe in Our God\\", stated: \\"We believe in our God the great Prince of His race, / The Archangel Michael, the Ancient of Days, / Our own Father Adam, earth's Lord, as is plain\\".Sacred Hymns and Spiritual Songs for The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (11th ed., Liverpool, 1856) p. 375. This hymn was not found in subsequent editions. The first line of a poem published in 1861, titled \\"Sons of Michael\\", stated: \\"Sons of Michael, he approaches! / Rise; the Eternal Father greet\\".E. L. T. Harrison, \\"Sons of Michael\\", Millennial Star 23: 240 (13 April 1861). The poem is included as a hymn in the current LDS Church hymnal, but the wording has been altered from \\"Eternal Father\\" to \\"ancient father\\".\\"Sons of Michael, He Approaches\\", Hymns of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, hymn 51. Acceptance of the doctrine by the LDS Church continued through the 19th century. George Q. Cannon, a member of the First Presidency, when asked by his son about the conception of Jesus by Mary, asked \\"what was to prevent Father Adam from visiting and overshadowing the mother of Jesus[?]\\"Daily Journal of Abraham H. Cannon, March 10, 1888, Brigham Young University. =Resistance to the doctrine= However, some prominent members of the church took issue with the doctrine. Most significantly, apostle and philosopher Orson Pratt disagreed with the doctrine, and expressed that disagreement publiclyJournal of Thomas Evans Jeremy Sr., September 30, 1852 (\\"Also he did not believe that Father Adam had flesh and bones, when he came to the garden of Eden, but he and his wife Eve were spirits, and that God formed their bodies out of the dust of the ground, and the (sic) became a living souls. He also said that he believed that Jesus Christ and Adam are brothers in the Spirit, and that Adam is not the God that he is praying unto.\\"). See generally, . and in private meetings with other apostles.Journal of William Clayton, October 3, 1852. Pratt also published his disagreement in his publication The Seer for which he was censured.Orson Pratt, \\"The Pre-Existence of Man\\", The Seer, 1:3, 158‚Äì59 (March, October 1853). Pratt did, however, teach similar doctrines in the same publication. For example, he stated that on the way to exaltation, one would have to \\"pass by\\" and \\"pay tribute to\\" various apostles and prophets, then Jesus, and \\"at length ... Father Adam.\\" He said many would be surprised and humiliated, after passing by Jesus, to find \\"Father Adam\\" standing there; however, he said, \\"those are ideas which do not concern us at present, although it is written in the Bible‚Äî'This is eternal life, to know thee the only true God, and Jesus Christ whom thou hast sent.'\\" Pratt continued to debate the issue in public forums for months, despite being rebuked privately and publicly by Young on more than one occasion , until 1860, when faced with possible disfellowshipment from the church for teaching false doctrine, Pratt agreed to the language of a public confession affirming the doctrine as \\"the doctrine of the church.\\" This confession was negotiated during a series of meetings among the church hierarchy . A less open opposition to the doctrine may have been carried out by Mormon editors Samuel W. Richards and Franklin D. Richards who, according to one researcher, interpreted the idea of Adam being \\"our God\\" or \\"our Father\\" as meaning merely that Adam, as the first mortal man, stands at the head of the human family. For instance, \\"the Lord made Moses a god to Pharaoh\\" (Exodus 7:1) and as Paul was \\"as Christ Jesus\\" to the Galatians (4:14). In this way, Adam as our great progenitor, will preside over the human family as \\"father and God.\\"Stephen E. Robinson, \\"The Apocalypse of Adam\\", BYU Studies, vol. 17, no. 2, p. 131 (\\"this was the interpretation of Brigham Young's statement advocated in 1853 by Samuel W. Richards, who, as editor of the Millennial Star and President of the Church in the British Isles, first published President Young's initial sermon on the subject (Millennial Star, December 10, 1853)\\"; Robinson also argues that Franklin D. Richards, who replaced Samuel W. Richards in this position, also promoted this interpretation). =Adam‚ÄìGod in Young's later administration= After the public debates between Young and Pratt subsided in 1860, Young continued to maintain his belief in the doctrine, but may have been disappointed that the people did not give the doctrine universal acceptance. In 1861, he stated: > Some years ago, I advanced a doctrine with regard to Adam being our father > and God, that will be a curse to many of the Elders of Israel because of > their folly. With regard to it they yet grovel in darkness and will. It is > one of the most glorious revealments of the economy of heaven, yet the world > hold derision. Had I revealed the doctrine of baptism from [sic] the dead > instead [of] Joseph Smith there are men around me who would have ridiculed > the idea until dooms day [sic?]. But they are ignorant and stupid like the > dumb ass.Quoted from Manuscript Addresses of Brigham Young . Watt, G.D., > transcriber, October 8, 1861, with minor misspellings corrected. Nevertheless, Young and the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles continued to discuss the doctrine. (citing minutes of meeting of the Quorum of Twelve, 4 April 1860, in which it was recorded: \\"It was Joseph's doctrine that Adam was God ... God comes to earth and eats and partakes of fruit. Joseph could not reveal what was revealed to him, and if Joseph had it revealed, he was not told to reveal it.\\"). (citing Wilford Woodruff Journal of 4 September 1860, in which George Q. Cannon said \\"that Adam is our Father [and] is a true doctrine revealed from God to Joseph & Brigham. For this same doctrine is taught in some of the old Jewish records which have never been in print\\"). (citing Wilford Woodruff Journal of 16 December 1867, stating that \\"President Young said Adam was Michael the Archangel, & he was the Father of Jesus Christ & was our God & that Joseph taught this principle.\\") In 1873, Young again taught the doctrine publicly, and indicated that when Adam came to the Earth, he left behind many wives other than Eve at the place from which Adam came; however, he said he was \\"not disposed to give any farther knowledge concerning ... the great and glorious doctrine that pertains to this\\".Brigham Young (August 31, 1873), Journal of Discourses 16:160. \\"How much unbelief exists in the minds of the Latter-day Saints in regard to one particular doctrine which is revealed to them, and which God revealed to me‚Äînamely that Adam is our father and God .... Our Father Adam is the man who stands at the gate and holds the keys of everlasting life and salvation to all his children who have or ever will come upon the earth\\".Sermon delivered on June 8, 1873. Printed in the Deseret Weekly News, June 18, 1873. Just before his death, Young took steps to ensure that the Adam‚ÄìGod doctrine was taught in the church's temples as part of the endowment ceremony. In 1877, while he was standardizing the endowment for use in the St. George Temple, Young introduced as part of the endowment the \\"lecture at the veil.\\" The final draft of the lecture is today kept private in the St. George Temple. L. John Nuttall, Young's secretary, recorded in his journal a transcription of Young's temple lecture regarding the Adam-God doctrine: A portion of that journal entry reads as follows: > Adam was an immortal being when he came. on this earth he had lived on an > earth similar to ours ‚Ä¶ and had begotten all the spirit that was to come to > this earth. and Eve our common Mother who is the mother of all living bore > those spirits in the celestial world .... Father Adam‚Äôs oldest son (Jesus > the Saviour) who is the heir of the family is Father Adams first begotten in > the spirit World. who according to the flesh is the only begotten as it is > written. In his divinity he having gone back into the spirit World. and come > in the spirit [glory] to Mary and she conceived for when Adam and Eve got > through with their Work in this earth. they did not lay their bodies down in > the dust, but returned to the spirit World from whence they came.Journal of > L.

This meeting was held in Young's private winter home in St. > George, Utah. During the course of the meeting, Young gave some teachings > which Nuttall later recorded in his personal journal. It appears that > Nuttall recorded Young's instructions on the 8 February, not on the 7th when > they were delivered.

It would appear that Nuttall wrote the > majority of that entry on the following day, the 8th. =After Young's death= There is some controversy as to whether or not Young considered Adam‚ÄìGod to be official church doctrine. At the end of his 1852 sermon, he stated, \\"Now, let all who may hear these doctrines, pause before they make light of them, or treat them with indifference, for they will prove their salvation or damnation.\\"Journal of Discourses 1:51. Nevertheless, in 1854, after a great deal of controversy concerning the doctrine, Young minimized the importance of the doctrine, stating that the \\"subject ... does not immediately concern yours or my welfare .... I do not pretend to say that the items of doctrine and ideas I shall advance are necessary for the people to know\\".October 8, 1854, Historical Department of the Church [HDC]. After Young's death, church leaders began to cast the various interpretations of this teaching as mere speculation and denied that any particular interpretation was binding on the church. In 1897, Joseph F. Smith, then an apostle and counselor in the First Presidency, wrote a private letter concerning Young's teachings on Adam, stating: > The doctrine was never submitted to the councils of the Priesthood nor to > the church for approval or ratification, and was never formally or otherwise > accepted by the church. It is therefore in no sense binding upon the Church. > Brigham Young's \\"bare mention\\" was \\"without indubitable evidence and > authority being given of its truth.\\" Only the scripture, the \\"accepted word > of God,\\" is the Church's standard.Joseph F. Smith, letter to A. Saxey, > January 7, 1897, HDC. Beginning around 1892, church leaders privately decided to no longer publicly teach the doctrine. In a private meeting held on April 4, 1897, church president Wilford Woodruff said. \\"Adam is our father and God and no use to discuss it with [the] Josephites [Reorganized Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints] or any one else.\\"Brigham Young Jr. Journal, April 4, 1897 ‚Äì February 2, 1899, 30:107; CHO/Ms/f/326, December 16, 1897. In 1892, the doctrine was publicly opposed in St. George, Utah, by Edward Bunker. The First Presidency‚ÄîWoodruff, George Q. Cannon, and Joseph F. Smith‚Äîtraveled to St. George to address the issue. Records of the meeting state that Bunker was corrected: \\"Pres Woodruff and Cannon showed ... that Adam was an immortal being when he came to this earth and was made the same as all other men and Gods are made.\\"Diary of Charles Lowell Walker, 2:740‚Äì41, June 11, 1892 (typescript pp. 43‚Äì44). \\"The doctrine preached and contended for by Father Edward Bunker of Bunkerville was investigated, condemned and Father Bunker set right. Presidents Woodruff and Cannon present.\\"Journal of J. D. T. McAllister, p. 99; BYU, Mor/M270.1/m/v.6, June 11, 1892. After the start of the 20th century, church leaders openly took the position that the doctrine should no longer to be taught publicly.See, e.g., the Proceedings of the First Sunday School Convention, November 28, 1898; Letter to Bishop Edward Bunker, February 27, 1902; Messages of the First Presidency 4:199‚Äì206; Journal of Thomas A. Clawson, 1912‚Äì1917, pp. 69‚Äì70, April 8, 1912; B. H. Roberts, Deseret News, July 23, 1921; Joseph Fielding Smith,Utah Genealogical Magazine, pp. 146‚Äì51, October 1930; Joseph Fielding Smith, Doctrines of Salvation 1:18, 76‚Äì77, 92 (1954). As early as 1902, apostle Charles W. Penrose claimed, \\"The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints has never formulated or adopted any theory concerning the subject treated upon by President Young as to Adam.\\"Charles W. Penrose, \\"Our Father Adam\\", Improvement Era (September 1902): 873, reprinted in Charles W. Penrose, \\"Our Father Adam\\", Millennial Star (11 December 1902): 785‚Äì90 at 789. = Current position of the LDS Church = Eventually, the doctrine was publicly denounced as false by LDS Church leaders.Van Hale, \\"What About the Adam-God Theory?,\\" Mormon Miscellaneous response series #3. In 1976, church president Spencer W. Kimball stated, \\"We denounce that theory and hope that everyone will be cautioned against this and other kinds of false doctrine.\\"Conference Report, p. 115 (October 1‚Äì3, 1976).Spencer W. Kimball, \\"Our Own Liahona,\\" Ensign, November 1976, p. 77. In 1980, apostle Bruce R. McConkie gave a speech elaborating upon the church's position towards the Adam‚ÄìGod theory: > There are those who believe or say they believe that Adam is our father and > our god, that he is the father of our spirits and our bodies, and that he is > the one we worship. The devil keeps this heresy alive as a means of > obtaining converts to cultism. It is contrary to the whole plan of salvation > set forth in the scriptures, and anyone who has read the Book of Moses, and > anyone who has received the temple endowment and who yet believes the > Adam‚ÄìGod theory does not deserve to be saved.* Those who are so ensnared > reject the living prophet and close their ears to the apostles of their day. > \\"We will follow those who went before,\\" they say. And having so determined, > they soon are ready to enter polygamous relationships that destroy their > souls. We worship the Father, in the name of the Son, by the power of the > Holy Ghost; and Adam is their foremost servant, by whom the peopling of our > planet was commenced.BYU Devotional, June 1, 1980. *This is what McConkie > said in the audio recording of this sermon. The print version has > subsequently been changed to \\"has no excuse whatever for being led astray by > it.\\" Compare PDF text with MP3 audio at 26:48:. Later the same year, apostle Mark E. Petersen stated: > Adam was not our God, nor was he our Savior. But he was the humble servant > of both in his status as an angel. ... God had only one begotten son in the > flesh. But Adam had many, including Cain and Abel and Seth. He lived nearly > a thousand years. He could have had hundreds of children in that time. Then > how could it be said by anyone that he had \\"an only begotten\\" son? How could > all of his other children be accounted for? Were they not all begotten in > the flesh? Were Cain and Abel and Seth and their brothers and sisters all > orphans? Was any child ever begotten without a father? Adam was their > father, and he had many sons. In no way whatever does he qualify as a father > who had only one son in the flesh. Yet God our Eternal Father had only one > son in the flesh, who was Jesus Christ. Then was Adam our God, or did God > become Adam? Ridiculous! Adam was neither God nor the Only Begotten Son of > God. He was a child of God in the spirit as we all are (see Acts 17:29). > Jesus was the firstborn in the spirit, and the only one born to God in the > flesh. ... If any of you have been confused by false teachers who come among > us, if you have been assailed by advocates of erroneous doctrines, counsel > with your priesthood leaders. They will not lead you astray, but will direct > you into paths of truth and salvation.Mark E. Petersen, \\"Adam, the > Archangel\\", Ensign, November 1980. =Acceptance by Mormon fundamentalists= Adherents of Mormon fundamentalism generally accept the Adam‚ÄìGod doctrine. The LDS Church's disavowal of the doctrine contributes to what fundamentalists perceive to be a general intellectual or spiritual retreat from important principles that were rejected due to unpopularity. Along with the practice of plural marriage, belief in the Adam‚ÄìGod doctrine became a defining aspect of the Mormon fundamentalist movement. Apostolic United Brethren The Apostolic United Brethren (AUB), a fundamentalist Mormon group, accepts the Adam‚ÄìGod teaching, and their leader Joseph W. Musser wrote a book on it in the 1930s. In the book, Musser contended that the rejection of the doctrine by the LDS Church can be linked to its rejection of plural marriage, which occurred around the same time: > And let us here remind the reader that as long as belief in the Patriarchal > order of marriage and other advanced principles of the Gospel was > maintained, the minds of the Saints were open and receptive. ... But with > the surrender of the glorious principle of Celestial Marriage‚Äîa union for > time and eternity‚Äîcame darkness, mental drowsiness, a detour from the Gospel > path, until all sorts of speculation pertaining to the plan of Salvation was > indulged in.Musser, Joseph W. Michael, Our Father and Our God. Salt Lake > City, Utah: Truth Publishing Company, 1963. School of the Prophets The School of the ProphetsSchool of the Prophets (Crossfield)#School of the Prophets spoken of in the book Under the Banner of Heaven claims revelation showing that Young was inaccurate in some points of his Adam‚ÄìGod teachings, but otherwise he was correct. The understanding from these revelations is that Jesus was the Only Begotten Son in the flesh of the Savior of the previous Earth where the father of all Spirits, Michael/Adam, had his mortal probation. The lineage of Michael/Adam, which includes all but Jesus on this Earth, will never become saviors of worlds. Thus the Adam‚ÄìGod doctrine of Young is simply a fuller understanding of the New Testament doctrine of joint-heirs with Christ.

It was developed by Gunpei Yokoi's company Koto Laboratory and Bandai, and was the last piece of hardware Yokoi developed before his death in 1997. Released in 1999 in the fifth generation of video game consoles, the WonderSwan and its two later models, the WonderSwan Color and SwanCrystal were officially supported until being discontinued by Bandai in 2003. During its lifespan, no variation of the WonderSwan was released outside of Japan. Powered by a 16-bit central processing unit, the WonderSwan took advantage of a low price point and long battery life in comparison to its competition, Nintendo's Game Boy Color and SNK's Neo Geo Pocket Color. Later improvements took advantage of quality upgrades to the handheld's screen and added color. The WonderSwan is playable both vertically and horizontally, and features a unique library of games, including numerous first-party titles based on licensed anime properties, as well as significant third-party support from developers such as Squaresoft, Namco, Capcom and Banpresto. Overall, the WonderSwan in all its variations combined to sell an estimated 3.5 million units and managed to obtain as much as 8% of the Japanese handheld video game console market before being marginalized by Nintendo's Game Boy Advance. Retrospective feedback praises the potential of the WonderSwan despite its low sales and its brief time holding its own against Nintendo in the marketplace. History Founded in 1950 by Naoharu Yamashina, Bandai was originally a manufacturer of toy cars and plastic models, but became a major player in the toy industry through the licensing of popular anime characters beginning with Tetsuwan Atomu in 1963. In the 1970s, Bandai manufactured both LCD games based on television programs and dedicated consoles. In 1982, the company released the Intellivision in Japan, and in 1985 it became one of the first third-party licensees on the Family Computer. However, the company's greatest success in electronic games, was the Tamagotchi virtual pet first released in 1996. Despite plans for Bandai to merge with Sega to form Sega Bandai Ltd. in 1997, the merger was called off suddenly. Bandai's board of directors decided to oppose the merger less than a week after approving it, and Sega in turn decided to accept Bandai's actions at an emergency board meeting later that day. Bandai president Makoto Yamashina took responsibility for failing to gain the support of his company for the merger. As a result, Bandai entered the market without outside support. Engineer Gunpei Yokoi is known for creating the Game Boy handheld system at Nintendo. After the failure of the Virtual Boy, however, he left the company in 1996 in order to create his own engineering firm, Koto Laboratory. It was then that Bandai approached Yokoi to create the WonderSwan to compete with the Game Boy. Yokoi was involved in development of the new handheld, but died in 1997 in a car accident before it was released. The WonderSwan was officially unveiled in Tokyo on October 8, 1998. Bandai chose the name of the system to highlight its aesthetics and technical capabilities because the swan is recognized as an elegant bird with powerful legs that aid its graceful swimming. The company promised a 30-hour battery life, a low retail price, and a launch lineup of roughly fifty games. The WonderWave accessory is an infrared communicator that could transfer data between two WonderSwans. It is also compatible with the PocketStation (right) for select Bandai games. The WonderSwan launched on March 4, 1999 and was available in nine casing colors: pearl white, skeleton green, silver metallic, skeleton red, blue metallic, skeleton blue, skeleton black, camouflage, and gold. Three limited edition two-tone models were also released in frozen mint, sherbet melon and soda blue. These colors were chosen through an online poll at Bandai‚Äôs website, with the metallic and pearl white models being discontinued on July 22 to make room for the special two-tone editions. Despite Nintendo's release of the Game Boy Color five months before, Bandai remained confident that the WonderSwan and its monochromatic screen would perform well because the original black-and-white Game Boy had previously been more successful than its color-screen competitors, the Sega Game Gear and Atari Lynx, on the basis of its battery life and the quality of its game library. With a retail price , the WonderSwan was also cheaper than its competition. In 2000, Bandai signed an agreement with Mattel to bring the handheld to North America, but ultimately decided against a Western release. The exact reason for this is unknown, but the crowded handheld video game console market has been suggested as a factor. Later that year, Bandai announced the which would incorporate a color screen while retaining backward compatibility with the original WonderSwan. It was released on December 9, 2000 in Japan and was available in pearl blue, pearl pink, crystal black, crystal blue, and crystal orange. The launch was a moderate success, with the system selling 270,632 units in under a month after its release. Before the WonderSwan Color could be released, however, Nintendo announced the Game Boy Advance, which featured superior hardware. The WonderSwan Color still retailed at a lower price point at compared to the Advance at , but despite peaking at 8% of the handheld market share in Japan, the WonderSwan's sales never recovered after the Game Boy Advance reached store shelves in March 2001. A redesign of the WonderSwan Color, titled , was released in Japan on July 12, 2002 for , less than the Game Boy Advance. Once again, Bandai held a poll on its website to determine casing colors and released the system in blue violet, wine red, crystal blue, and crystal black. Despite its low price and an improved LCD screen, the SwanCrystal was unable to compete, so Bandai announced the discontinuation of the WonderSwan line in 2003 due to low demand and backed out of producing video game hardware altogether. In all, the handheld sold 3.5 million units, of which 1.55 million were of the original WonderSwan and at least 1.1 million were of the WonderSwan Color. Technical specifications All WonderSwan models are powered by a single AA battery. The main CPU of the WonderSwan is a 16-bit NEC V30 MZ. The original model's screen is capable of displaying up to eight shades of gray, in contrast to the four displayed by the WonderSwan's main competitor, the Game Boy. Similar to the Atari Lynx, the handheld has an extra set of buttons allowing the console to be played at different angles; for the WonderSwan, these buttons were used to allow gamers to play games in both the portrait and landscape orientations. The WonderSwan series are all powered by a single AA battery, with the original monochrome version having a battery life of 40 hours. It also allows players to record their personal information, such as their name, birth date, and blood type, which then can be accessed and used by the game. Its LCD screen is and displays at a resolution of 224 √ó 144. Its sound capabilities consist of four PCM channels, each of which can play 32-sample, 4-bit sounds at selectable volume and pitch levels. The physical measurements of the WonderSwan Color are , slightly larger than the original WonderSwan, and it weighs . Its CPU is a 3.072 MHz NEC V30 MZ, and it includes 512 kbit of RAM, which is shared between the video RAM and the work RAM. The screen on the WonderSwan Color can display up to 241 colors out of a palette of 4096, and up to 28 sprites per line. It offers backward compatibility with all previous WonderSwan titles. Its LCD screen is also larger than that of the original WonderSwan, measuring . The WonderSwan Color has an approximate battery life of 20 hours. The SwanCrystal improves upon the design of the WonderSwan Color through the use of a TFT LCD monitor, which has a superior response time to the FSTN monitor used in the former system. This helped to reduce motion blur in the handheld's graphics. The unit's case was also redesigned to be more durable. Its approximate battery life is 15 hours. The original WonderSwan's cartridges were solid black in color, while the WonderSwan Color's cartridges were clear. Games for the original WonderSwan would not have color on a WonderSwan Color, and would display in its original grayscale. Several features and accessories were developed for the WonderSwan. The WonderWitch is an official software development kit aimed at amateur programmers that was released by Qute Corporation. It sold at a cost of and allows for games to be developed in the C programming language. An adapter was created to connect headphones to the handheld, as the WonderSwan lacks a headphone port. A remote-controlled robot known as the WonderBorg can be operated through the unit. In addition, the handheld can be connected to a PocketStation, a memory card peripheral for the PlayStation console, through a device known as the WonderWave. The WonderSwan and its later models were also capable of connecting to the internet via a mobile phone network. Game library A screenshot of Gunpey for the original WonderSwan. Gunpey was named for Gunpei Yokoi, developer of the system. Koto Laboratories claims that the WonderSwan sold 10 million game cartridges in all. In developing games for the WonderSwan, Bandai leveraged the assistance of several developers. Banpresto‚Äîpart-owned by Bandai at the time‚Äîadded support by way of anime licenses and licensed titles, while Namco and Capcom also developed titles for the handheld. Squaresoft contributed remakes of Final Fantasy, Final Fantasy II, and Final Fantasy IV which later also came to the Game Boy Advance. Taito contributed well-received ports such as Space Invaders and Densha de Go!. Bandai augmented these releases with games of its own, including exclusive titles in the Digimon and Gundam franchises. To compete with Tetris, Gunpei Yokoi developed a puzzle game for the system ultimately named Gunpey in his honor. A sequel known as Gunpey EX was a launch title for the WonderSwan Color. Certain games produced through the WonderWitch kit, such as Judgement Silversword, have also been noted as excellent titles. Support for the WonderSwan has been considered underwhelming. Although some well known third- party developers supported the console, most publishers continued to exclusively support Nintendo's handhelds. The departure of Squaresoft as a developer and its return to Nintendo has been cited as a factor in the WonderSwan's diminishing sales in later years. After the discontinuation of the WonderSwan in 2003, several developers ported WonderSwan games to the Game Boy Advance. Reception Selling 3.5 million units, the WonderSwan only picked up 8% of the marketshare in Japan and was ultimately outperformed by Nintendo's Game Boy Advance. Due to its brightly colored screen and deep game library, the Game Boy Advance ensured Nintendo would have a near-monopoly on the handheld console market in Japan until the release of the PlayStation Portable by Sony in 2004. Retrospective feedback to the handheld praises its accomplishments but defines it as a \\"niche\\" device that appeals to only certain gamers. Writing for USgamer, Jeremy Parish considers the WonderSwan the ultimate expression of Gunpei Yokoi's design philosophy and notes its modest impact on the market, but blames Bandai for its lack of success, stating, \\"While WonderSwan ultimately will be remembered as a highly localized blip in the history of handheld games, as a platform it genuinely held its own... the system's obscurity resulted more from poor timing and Bandai's strangely meek strategy, not from any inherent flaws in the design of the machine itself.\\" Parish also goes on to hypothesize on the lack of a WonderSwan release in North America, stating, \\"given how hard it was to find Neo Geo Pocket systems and games at U.S. retail, it's hard to imagine they were clamoring for yet another niche portable from Japan.\\" Luke Plunkett from Kotaku praised the WonderSwan's challenge to Nintendo, stating, \\"t tried some pretty unique and interesting things, and put up a much sterner fight than most other handhelds ever managed.\\" Retro Gamer's Kim Wild criticizes some aspects of the handheld, including its lack of a headphone and AC port, as well as its poor control scheme for left-handed individuals and inability to play multiplayer link games with the headphone adapter connected. Wild offers some praise for the handheld, however, stating \\"what [Bandai] managed with the WonderSwan was impressive given the competition. The low price even today makes it more than worthy of consideration.\\" Notes References External links (archive) Computer-related introductions in 1999 1999 establishments in Japan 2003 disestablishments in Japan x86-based game consoles Bandai consoles Fifth- generation video game consoles Handheld game consoles Discontinued handheld game consoles Japan-only video game hardware Monochrome video game consoles ","title":"WonderSwan"},{"id":"177473","text":"Vietlish, Vietnaminglish, Vietglish or Vietnamese English, is an informal term for a mixture of elements from Vietnamese and English.Minero, Luis (2006) \\"Globaliza√ß√£o e Expans√£o Conscienciol√≥gica Atrav√©s dos Idiomas.\\" Conscientia 10(4):302-316.

The Duva family promoted boxing events in over twenty countries on six continents. Lou Duva was inducted into the International Boxing Hall of Fame, the New Jersey Boxing Hall of Fame, the National Italian American Sports Hall of Fame, and The Meadowlands Sports Hall of Fame. Early years Duva was born in New York City to Italian immigrants, the sixth of seven children. After spending time growing up in Little Italy, New York, his family then moved to Saint James Place in Totowa, a suburb of Paterson, New Jersey. He lived next door to his Sister, Ann Belmont of Belmont Fashions in one of two identical flat roofed houses.James, George. \\"IN PERSON; Slugging It Out All These Years\\", The New York Times, June 9, 2002. Accessed November 4, 2007. \\"Lou Duva grew up the second youngest of seven children in a working-class family in Paterson.\\" Duva's childhood was an impoverished one and he had to do many jobs to try to help his family. Duva's 23-year-old brother, Carl Duva, introduced young Lou to boxing when the boy was only 10 years old. Lou polished his own boxing skills and by age 12 was both an amateur and ballroom brawler. However Lou as a boxer did not have much luck, although that might have been due to the fact he barely had time to train, having to go out to the street and perform many types of jobs to try to help the Duva family make ends meet. In 1938 Lou went to try to join the Civilian Conservation Corps (CCC). He had problems getting in because applicants were required to be at least 18, but Duva was only 16 years old when he applied to join. He went and changed his birth certificate and all his personal information and they accepted him, thinking that he had been born two years earlier, in 1920. The CCC sent him to Boise, Idaho, and then to Walla Walla, Washington, where he learned to drive trucks. Duva went to the U.S. Army after World War II broke out. He went to Jackson, Mississippi, to train, but was dismissed from the base after many fistfights with fellow soldiers, as well as an altercation with two lieutenants when he defended a black woman being harassed on a public bus. After that, he was sent to Camp Hood in Texas, where he was given a job as a boxing instructor. He went back home in 1944 to help run a restaurant and to begin a career as a professional boxer, compiling a record of 6 wins, 10 losses and one draw. After retiring, he started a trucking company. Soon after, he met his wife Enes while he was performing as a clown at a ministry. They married in 1949. Lou spent a good portion of the early 1950s at Stillman's Boxing Gym. Stillman's Gym was known for two things: its legendary fame as a filthy gym where windows were kept closed so the smell of sweat could not escape; and the large number of celebrities from Hollywood and the boxing world the gym attracted. It was here Lou began friendships with Frank Sinatra, Sammy Davis Jr., Frankie Valli, and other celebrities. Duva, already enamored with the world of boxing, felt his passion for the sport increase every time he visited Stillman's Gym. Duva's trucking business was doing well, so he decided to open, with the blessing of Enes, his own gym, named Garden Gym. After he sold his fleet of 32 trucks, he became a bail bondsman, and he tracked offenders who jumped bail to avoid trial. Around this time he also worked as a union representative in North Jersey.  Rise to fame  By 1963, Duva had become close friends with former world heavyweight champion Rocky Marciano, one of the people who rejoiced when Duva crowned his first world boxing champion, middleweight Joey Giardello, who dethroned Dick Tiger that year to become world middleweight champion. Duva was one of the last persons that Marciano spoke to before Marciano's plane crashed in 1969. Lou's son, Dan Duva (died 1996), was a lawyer who was also involved in the boxing game. When Leon Spinks' management came for help in 1978, Dan gladly helped them. With his earning of $500,000 dollars, Dan formed Main Events in April 1978. The company still exists today, and is managed by Dan's widow Kathy Duva. Also during that period, Main Events put on boxing cards at the Ice World facility in Totowa, New Jersey. The Duva's used to resemble tactics used by the World Wrestling Entertainment (WWE) when promoting a card, once even going as far as selling a truck driver from New Jersey as a Prince from Zaire just to hype the show and sell tickets. In 1979, ESPN became interested in showing Main Events shows from Ice World, and they began to do so soon after. The shows and presence caught the eyes of future world champions such as Rocky Lockridge, Bobby Czyz and Livingstone Bramble, all of which signed up with Main Events. However, trouble came with success: as a result of all the work Lou was putting in as a trainer, bail bondsman and everything else he was doing, he suffered his first heart attack during that year. Doctors told him he needed to step off some of his activities, so Lou decided to drop any activities which weren't related to boxing. He became a full-time boxing manager and trainer. Dan Duva formed a friendship with Shelly Finkel, a powerful boxing power broker who convinced middleweight contender Alex Ramos, future world light welterweight champion Johnny Bumphus, future world heavyweight champion Tony Tucker, the late light middleweight prospect Tony Ayala Jr. and heavyweight prospect Mitch Green to join Main Events. Lou was trainer and manager. In 1981, Main Events became the promoter of the first bout between Sugar Ray Leonard and Thomas Hearns, won by Leonard by a knockout in round 14. It was the largest grossing non-heavyweight bout until then, making $40 million. Duva, however, could not celebrate long, as wife Enes had been diagnosed with Multiple sclerosis. 1984 was a highly successful year for Duva and Main Events. He had Bumphus, Lockridge, Bramble and Mike McCallum crowned as world champions, and he signed future world champions Mark Breland, Evander Holyfield, Pernell Whitaker and Meldrick Taylor right after their participation in the Olympics in Los Angeles. He also signed Olympian Tyrell Biggs. In 1985 he was named manager of the year by the American Boxing Writer's Association. Holyfield was the next to be crowned world champion, when he beat Dwight Muhammad Qawi in 1986. That was the year that his wife Enes died after fighting her disease for five years. Breland and Vinny Pazienza followed the championship route for Main Events, winning their first world titles in 1987, year in which he was named Trainer of The Year by the WBA. Taylor followed Whitaker and Pazienza by beating Buddy McGirt in 1988 for the world light welterweight title. In 1989, he was another triumphant year for Duva and Main Events, when Whitaker, Darrin Van Horn and Puerto Rico's John John Molina crowned themselves champions, adding to the Main Events line of world champion boxers. Holyfield gave Main Events another championship, when he knocked out Buster Douglas in three rounds to win the world heavyweight title with Duva as his co trainer along with George Benton. After that, Duva attained mainstream fame, appearing in cameos at different television series and even visiting the \\"Late Night with David Letterman\\" show as a guest. He also acted as wrestler Rowdy Roddy Piper's trainer at the World Wrestling Federation's WrestleMania 2 pay-per-view in 1986; coincidentally, Duva was a distant cousin to WWF manager \\"Captain\\" Lou Albano, who had instigated the story line involving Piper. In 1992, Eddie Hopson became Duva's 13th world champion. In 1996, Dan Duva (his son) died of cancer and his widow, Kathy, became chairman of the Board and Dan's brother, Dino Duva, became president. After four years Dino left the company and Kathy Duva became the Chief Executive Officer. Dino went on to form Duva Boxing. Lou has worked with such other former or future world champions as Michael Moorer and Arturo Gatti among others. On the night of the infamous riot after the first Andrew Golota- Riddick Bowe bout, Duva was lifted out of the ring on a stretcher after his defibrillator went off. He was found out to be ok after testing was done to his heart later that night. For a period during the 1980s Duva was involved in a restaurant named \\"Lou Duva's Seafood Grille and Sports Club \\" in Totowa, New Jersey. Duva was inducted into the International Boxing Hall Of Fame in 1998 and lived in Wayne, New Jersey, just a few miles from where his family once lived in Paterson, New Jersey.Staff. \\"Keith Idec's boxing index\\", The Record (Bergen County), March 18, 2011. Accessed March 31, 2011. \\"Duva, a Wayne resident who trained and/or managed numerous world champions, was inducted into the International Boxing Hall of Fame in 1998.\\" Duva remained active as an advisor and manager for a few select fighters and is also involved in his son Dino's company, Duva Boxing. He was an outspoken advocate of fighter's rights and of helping inner city kids get \\"off the streets and into the ring\\". Duva died of natural causes on March 8, 2017 after a period of declining health.

It was particularly prominent in England during the late 19th century, supported by notable figures such as Walter Pater and Oscar Wilde. The movement started in a small way in the 1860s in the studios and houses of a radical group of artists and designers, including William Morris and Dante Gabriel Rossetti, reformers who explored new ways of living in defiance of the design standards of the age as revealed in the 1851 Great Exhibition at Hyde Park, London. Flourishing in Britain in the 1870s and 1880s, critic Walter Hamilton was the first writer to identify the movement, publishing The Aesthetic Movement in England in 1882. Aestheticism challenged the values of mainstream Victorian culture, as many Victorians believed that literature and art fulfilled important ethical roles. Writing in The Guardian, Fiona McCarthy states, ‚Äúthe aesthetic movement stood in stark and sometimes shocking contrast to the crass materialism of Britain in the 19th century.‚Äù By the 1890s, decadence, a term with origins in common with aestheticism, was in use as an aesthetic term across Europe. More contemporary critics are associated with the movement, such as Harold Bloom, who argued against projecting social and political ideology onto literary works, which he believed was a growing problem in humanities departments over the 20th century. Aesthetic literature The British decadent writers were much influenced by the Oxford professor Walter Pater and his essays published during 1867‚Äì68, in which he stated that life had to be lived intensely, with an ideal of beauty. His text Studies in the History of the Renaissance (1873) was very well regarded by art-oriented young men of the late 19th century. Writers of the Decadent movement used the slogan \\"Art for Art's Sake\\" (L'art pour l'art), the origin of which is debated. Some claim that it was invented by the philosopher Victor Cousin, although Angela Leighton in the publication On Form: Poetry, Aestheticism and the Legacy of a Word (2007) notes that the phrase was used by Benjamin Constant as early as 1804.Angela Leighton (2007) 32. It is generally accepted to have been promoted by Th√©ophile Gautier in France, who interpreted the phrase to suggest that there was not any real association between art and morality. Punch cartoons about √¶sthetes The artists and writers of Aesthetic style tended to profess that the Arts should provide refined sensuous pleasure, rather than convey moral or sentimental messages. As a consequence, they did not accept John Ruskin, Matthew Arnold, and George MacDonald's conception of art as something moral or useful, \\"Art for truth's sake\\".Raeper, William (1987) George MacDonald, p. 183. Tring, Herts., and Batavia, IL: Lion Publishing. Instead, they believed that Art did not have any didactic purpose; it only needed to be beautiful. The Aesthetes developed a cult of beauty, which they considered the basic factor of art. Life should copy Art, they asserted. They considered nature as crude and lacking in design when compared to art. The main characteristics of the style were: suggestion rather than statement, sensuality, great use of symbols, and synaesthetic/Ideasthetic effects‚Äîthat is, correspondence between words, colours and music. Music was used to establish mood. Predecessors of the Aesthetics included John Keats and Percy Bysshe Shelley, and some of the Pre- Raphaelites who themselves were a legacy of the Romantic spirit. There are a few significant continuities between the Pre-Raphaelite philosophy and that of the Aesthetes: Dedication to the idea of ‚ÄòArt for Art‚Äôs Sake‚Äô; admiration of, and constant striving for, beauty; escapism through visual and literary arts; craftsmanship that is both careful and self-conscious; mutual interest in merging the arts of various media. This final idea is promoted in the poem L‚ÄôArt by Th√©ophile Gautier, who compared the poet to the sculptor and painter. Dante Gabriel Rossetti and Edward Burne-Jones are most strongly associated with Aestheticism. However, their approach to Aestheticism did not share the creed of ‚ÄòArt for Art‚Äôs Sake‚Äô but rather ‚Äúa spirited reassertion of those principles of colour, beauty, love, and cleanness that the drab, agitated, discouraging world of the mid-nineteenth century needed so much.‚Äù This reassertion of beauty in a drab world also connects to Pre-Raphaelite escapism in art and poetry. In Britain the best representatives were Oscar Wilde and Algernon Charles Swinburne, both influenced by the French Symbolists, and James McNeill Whistler and Dante Gabriel Rossetti. The style and these poets were satirised by Gilbert and Sullivan's comic opera Patience and other works, such as F. C. Burnand's drama The Colonel, and in comic magazines such as Punch, particularly in works by George Du Maurier. Compton Mackenzie's novel Sinister Street makes use of the type as a phase through which the protagonist passes as he is influenced by older, decadent individuals. The novels of Evelyn Waugh, who was a young participant of aesthete society at Oxford, describe the aesthetes mostly satirically, but also as a former participant. Some names associated with this assemblage are Robert Byron, Evelyn Waugh, Harold Acton, Nancy Mitford, A.E. Housman and Anthony Powell. Aesthetic visual arts Canaries by Albert Joseph Moore, ca. 1875-1880. He was among a group of artists whose work was exhibited at the Grosvenor Gallery in London. Artists associated with the Aesthetic style include Simeon Solomon, James McNeill Whistler, Dante Gabriel Rossetti, Albert Joseph Moore, GF Watts and Aubrey Beardsley. Although the work of Edward Burne-Jones was exhibited at the Grosvenor Gallery which promoted the movement, it also contains narrative and conveys moral or sentimental messages hence it falls outside the given definition. Aesthetic movement in decorative arts Aesthetic Movement antiques at Florian Papp, New York City According to Christopher Dresser, the primary element of Decorative Art is utility. The maxim \\"art for art's sake,\\" identifying art or beauty as the primary element in other branches of the Aesthetic Movement, especially fine art, cannot apply in this context. That is, Decorative art must first have utility, but may also be beautiful.Christopher Dresser. The Art of Decorative Design 1862. However, according to Michael Shindler, the decorative art branch of the Aesthetic Movement, was less the utilitarian cousin of Aestheticism's main 'pure' branch, and more the very means by which aesthetes exercised their fundamental aesthetic strategy. Like contemporary art, Shindler writes that aestheticism was born of \\"the conundrum of constituting one‚Äôs life in relation to an exterior work\\" and that it \\"attempted to overcome\\" this problem \\"by subsuming artists within their work in the hope of yielding‚Äîmore than mere objects‚Äîlives which could be living artworks.\\" Thus, \\"beautiful things became the sensuous set pieces of a drama in which artists were not like their forebears a sort of crew of anonymous stagehands, but stars. Consequently, aesthetes made idols of portraits, prayers of poems, altars of writing desks, chapels of dining rooms, and fallen angels of their fellow men.\\" Important elements of the Aesthetic Movement have been identified as Reform and Eastern Art.Christopher Morley. Reform and Eastern Art Decorative Arts Society Journal, 2010. The Government Schools of Design were founded from 1837 onwards in order to improve the design of British goods. Following the Great Exhibition of 1851 efforts were intensified and Oriental objects purchased for the schools teaching collections. Owen Jones, architect and Orientalist was requested to set out key principles of design and these became not only the basis of the schools teaching but also the propositions which preface The Grammar of Ornament (1856), which is still regarded as the finest systematic study or practical sourcebook of historic world ornament. Jones identified the need for a new and modern style that would meet the requirements of the modern world, rather than the continual re-cycling of historic styles, but saw no reason to reject the lessons of the past. Christopher Dresser, a student and later Professor at the school worked with Owen Jones on The Grammar of Ornament, as well as on the 1863 decoration of The Oriental Courts (Chinese, Japanese, and Indian) at the South Kensington Museum, advanced the search for a new style with his two publications The Art of Decorative Design 1862, and Principles of Design 1873. Production of Aesthetic style furniture was limited to approximately the late 19th century. Aesthetic style furniture is characterized by several common themes: * Ebonized wood with gilt highlights. * Far Eastern influence. * Prominent use of nature, especially flowers, birds, ginkgo leaves, and peacock feathers. * Blue and white on porcelain and other fine china. Ebonized furniture means that the wood is painted or stained to a black ebony finish. The furniture is sometimes completely ebony-colored. More often however, there is gilding added to the carved surfaces of the feathers or stylized flowers that adorn the furniture. As aesthetic movement decor was similar to the corresponding writing style in that it was about sensuality and nature, nature themes often appear on the furniture. A typical aesthetic feature is the gilded carved flower, or the stylized peacock feather. Colored paintings of birds or flowers are often seen. Non-ebonized aesthetic movement furniture may have realistic-looking three-dimensional-like renditions of birds or flowers carved into the wood. Oscar Wilde lectured on the \\"English Renaissance in Art\\" during his North America tour in 1882 Contrasting with the ebonized-gilt furniture is use of blue and white for porcelain and china. Similar themes of peacock feathers and nature would be used in blue and white tones on dinnerware and other crockery. The blue and white design was also popular on square porcelain tiles. It is reported that Oscar Wilde used aesthetic decorations during his youth. This aspect of the movement was also satirised by Punch magazine and in Patience. In 1882 Oscar Wilde visited Canada, where he toured the town of Woodstock, Ontario and gave a lecture on May 29 titled \\"The House Beautiful\\".O'brien (1982) 114. This particular lecture featured the early Aesthetic art movement, also known as the \\"Ornamental Aesthetic\\" art style, where local flora and fauna were celebrated as beautiful and textured, layered ceilings were popular. An example of this can be seen in Annandale National Historic Site, located in Tillsonburg, Ontario, Canada. The house was built in 1880 and decorated by Mary Ann Tillson, who happened to attend Oscar Wilde's lecture in Woodstock, and was influenced by it. Since the Aesthetic art movement was only prevalent from about 1880 until about 1890, there are not many surviving examples of this particular style but one such example is 18 Stafford Terrace, London, which provides an insight into how the middle classes interpreted the principles of Aesthetics. Olana, the home of Frederic Edwin Church in upstate New York, is an important example of exoticism in Aesthetic movement decorative arts.

Notably, crime statistics can be the result of two rather different processes: * scientific research, such as criminological studies, victimisation surveys; * official figures, such as published by the police, prosecution, courts, and prisons. However, in their research, criminologists often draw on official figures as well.Hermann Mannheim and Thomas J. Bernard: Methods in criminology, Encyclop√¶dia Britannica October 18, 2019  Methods  There are several methods for the measuring of crime. Public surveys are occasionally conducted to estimate the amount of crime that has not been reported to police. Such surveys are usually more reliable for assessing trends. However, they also have their limitations and generally don't procure statistics useful for local crime prevention, often ignore offenses against children and do not count offenders brought before the criminal justice system. Law enforcement agencies in some countries offer compilations of statistics for various types of crime. Two major methods for collecting crime data are law enforcement reports, which only reflect crimes that are reported, recorded, and not subsequently canceled; and victim study (victimization statistical surveys), which rely on individual memory and honesty. For less frequent crimes such as intentional homicide and armed robbery, reported incidences are generally more reliable, but suffer from under-recording; for example, no criming in the United Kingdom sees over one third of reported violent crimes being not recorded by the police.Victims let down by poor crime-recording Because laws and practices vary between jurisdictions, comparing crime statistics between and even within countries can be difficult: typically only violent deaths (homicide or manslaughter) can reliably be compared, due to consistent and high reporting and relative clear definition. The U.S. has two major data collection programs, the Uniform Crime Reports from the FBI and the National Crime Victimization Survey from the Bureau of Justice Statistics. However, the U.S. has no comprehensive infrastructure to monitor crime trends and report the information to related parties such as law enforcement. Research using a series of victim surveys in 18 countries of the European Union, funded by the European Commission, has reported (2005) that the level of crime in Europe has fallen back to the levels of 1990, and notes that levels of common crime have shown declining trends in the U.S., Canada, Australia and other industrialized countries as well. The European researchers say a general consensus identifies demographic change as the leading cause for this international trend. Although homicide and robbery rates rose in the U.S. in the 1980s, by the end of the century they had declined by 40%. However, the European research suggests that \\"increased use of crime prevention measures may indeed be the common factor behind the near universal decrease in overall levels of crime in the Western world\\", since decreases have been most pronounced in property crime and less so, if at all, in contact crimes. Counting rules Relatively few standards exist and none that permit international comparability beyond a very limited range of offences. However, many jurisdictions accept the following: * There must be a prima facie case that an offence has been committed before it is recorded. That is either police find evidence of an offence or receive a believable allegation of an offense being committed. Some jurisdictions count offending only when certain processes happen, such as an arrest is made, ticket issued, charges laid in Court or only upon securing a conviction. * Multiple reports of the same offence usually count as one offence. Some jurisdictions count each report separately, others count each victim of offending separately. * Where several offences are committed at the same time, in one act of offending, only the most serious offense is counted. Some jurisdictions record and count each and every offense separately, others count cases, or offenders, that can be prosecuted. * Where multiple offenders are involved in the same act of offending only one act is counted when counting offenses but each offender is counted when apprehended. * Offending is counted at the time it comes to the attention of a law enforcement officer. Some jurisdictions record and count offending at the time it occurs. * As \\"only causing pain\\" is counted as assault in some countries, it let higher assault rates except in Austria, Finland, Germany, the Netherlands, Portugal and Sweden. But there are exceptions, like Czech Republic and Latvia. France was the contrasting exception having a high assault ratio without counting minor assaults.European Sourcebook of Crime and Criminal Justice Statistics ‚Äì 2010 , fourth edition, p30. Offending that is a breach of the law but for which no punishment exists is often not counted. For example: Suicide, which is technically illegal in most countries, may not be counted as a crime, although attempted suicide and assisting suicide are. Also traffic offending and other minor offending that might be dealt with by using fines rather than imprisonment, is often not counted as crime. However separate statistics may be kept for this sort of offending. Surveys Because of the difficulties in quantifying how much crime actually occurs, researchers generally take two approaches to gathering statistics about crime. However, as officers can only record crime that comes to their attention and might not record a matter as a crime if the matter is considered minor and is not perceived as a crime by the officer concerned. For example, when faced with a domestic violence dispute between a couple, a law enforcement officer may decide it is far less trouble to arrest the male party to the dispute, because the female may have children to care for, despite both parties being equally culpable for the dispute. This sort of pragmatic decisionmaking asked if they are victims of crime, without needing to provide any supporting evidence. In these surveys it is the participant's perception, or opinion, that a crime occurred, or even their understanding about what constitutes a crime that is being measured. As a consequence differing methodologies may make comparisons with other surveys difficult. One way in which, while other types of crime are under reported. These surveys also give insights as to why crime is reported, or not. The surveys show that the need to make an insurance claim, seek medical assistance, and the seriousness of an offence tend to increase the level of reporting, while the inconvenience of reporting, the involvement of intimate partners and the nature of the offending tend to decrease reporting. This allows degrees of confidence to be assigned to various crime statistics. For example: Motor vehicle thefts are generally well reported because the victim may need to make the report for an insurance claim, while domestic violence, domestic child abuse and sexual offences are frequently significantly under- reported because of the intimate relationships involved, embarrassment and other factors that make it difficult for the victim to make a report. Attempts to use victimisation surveys from different countries for international comparison had failed in the past. A standardised survey project called the International Crime Victims Survey Results from this project have been briefly discussed earlier in this article. Classification While most jurisdictions could probably agree about what constitutes a murder, what constitutes a homicide may be more problematic, while a crime against the person could vary widely. Legislation differences often means the ingredients of offences vary between jurisdictions. The International Crime victims Survey has been done in over 70 countries to date and has been a 'de facto' standard for defining common crimes. Complete list of countriesUNCRI ICVS participating countries participating and the 11 defined crimesUNCRI ICVS overview can be found at the project web site. In March 2015 the UNODC published the first version of the International Classification of Crime for Statistical Purposes (ICCS). Measures More complex measures involve measuring the numbers of discrete victims and offenders as well as repeat victimisation rates and recidivism. Repeat victimisation involves measuring how often the same victim is subjected to a repeat occurrence of an offence, often by the same offender. Repetition rate measures are often used to assess the effectiveness of interventions.

This is usually accomplished by excavating a pit or trench, placing the deceased and objects in it, and covering it over. A funeral is a ceremony that accompanies the final disposition. Humans have been burying their dead since shortly after the origin of the species. Burial is often seen as indicating respect for the dead. It has been used to prevent the odor of decay, to give family members closure and prevent them from witnessing the decomposition of their loved ones, and in many cultures it has been seen as a necessary step for the deceased to enter the afterlife or to give back to the cycle of life. Methods of burial may be heavily ritualized and can include natural burial (sometimes called \\"green burial\\"); embalming or mummification; and the use of containers for the dead, such as shrouds, coffins, grave liners, and burial vaults, all of which can retard decomposition of the body. Sometimes objects or grave goods are buried with the body, which may be dressed in fancy or ceremonial garb. Depending on the culture, the way the body is positioned may have great significance. The location of the burial may be determined by taking into account concerns surrounding health and sanitation, religious concerns, and cultural practices. Some cultures keep the dead close to provide guidance to the living, while others \\"banish\\" them by locating burial grounds at a distance from inhabited areas. Some religions consecrate special ground to bury the dead, and some families build private family cemeteries. Most modern cultures document the location of graves with headstones, which may be inscribed with information and tributes to the deceased. However, some people are buried in anonymous or secret graves for various reasons. Sometimes multiple bodies are buried in a single grave either by choice (as in the case of married couples), due to space concerns, or in the case of mass graves as a way to deal with many bodies at once. Alternatives to burial may include cremation (and subsequent interment), burial at sea, promession, cryopreservation, and others. Some human cultures may bury the remains of beloved animals. Humans are not the only species which bury their dead; the practice has been observed in chimpanzees, elephants, and possibly dogs.  History  Reconstruction of the Mesolithic tomb of two women from T√©viec, Brittany. Intentional burial, particularly with grave goods, may be one of the earliest detectable forms of religious practice since, as Philip Lieberman suggests, it may signify a \\"concern for the dead that transcends daily life.\\" Evidence suggests that the Neanderthals were the first human species to practice burial behavior and intentionally bury their dead, doing so in shallow graves along with stone tools and animal bones.Chris Scarre, The Human Past Exemplary sites include Shanidar in Iraq, Kebara Cave in Israel and Krapina in Croatia. Some scholars, however, argue that these bodies may have been disposed of for secular reasons. Though there is ongoing debate regarding the reliability of the dating method, some scholars believe the earliest human burial dates back 100,000 years. Human skeletal remains stained with red ochre were discovered in the Skhul cave at Qafzeh, Israel. A variety of grave goods were present at the site, including the mandible of a wild boar in the arms of one of the skeletons. In ancient Egypt, customs developed during the Predynastic period. Round graves with one pot were used in the Badarian Period (4400-3800 B.C.E.), continuing the tradition of Omari and Maadi cultures. Prehistoric cemeteries are referred to by the more neutral term grave field. They are one of the chief sources of information on prehistoric cultures, and numerous archaeological cultures are defined by their burial customs, such as the Urnfield culture of the European Bronze Age. Reasons for human burial After death, a body will decay. Burial is not necessarily a public health requirement. Contrary to conventional wisdom, the WHO advises that only corpses carrying an infectious disease strictly require burial. Human burial practices are the manifestation of the human desire to demonstrate \\"respect for the dead\\". Cultures vary in their mode of respect. Some reasons follow: * Respect for the physical remains. If left lying on top of the ground, scavengers may eat the corpse, considered disrespectful to the deceased in many (but not all) cultures. In Tibet, sky burials deliberately encourage scavenging of human remains in the interest of returning them to nature, just as within Zoroastrianism, where burial and cremation were often seen as impure (as human remains are polluted, while the earth and fire are sacred). * Burial can be seen as an attempt to bring closure to the deceased's family and friends. Psychologists in some Western Judeo-Christian quarters, as well as the US funeral industry, claim that by interring a body away from plain view the pain of losing a loved one can be lessened. * Many cultures believe in an afterlife. Burial is sometimes believed to be a necessary step for an individual to reach the afterlife. * Many religions prescribe a particular way to live, which includes customs relating to disposal of the dead. * A decomposing body releases unpleasant gases related to decomposition. As such, burial is seen as a means of preventing smells from expanding into open air. Burial methods In many cultures, human corpses were usually buried in soil. The roots of burial as a practice reach back into the Middle Palaeolithic and coincide with the appearance of Homo neanderthalensis and Homo sapiens, in Europe and Africa respectively. As a result, burial grounds are found throughout the world. Through time, mounds of earth, temples, and caverns were used to store the dead bodies of ancestors. In modern times, the custom of burying dead people below ground, with a stone marker to indicate the burial place, is used in most cultures; although other means such as cremation are becoming more popular in the West (cremation is the norm in India and mandatory in big metropolitan areas of Japan). Some burial practices are heavily ritualized; others are simply practical. =Burial depth= It is a common misconception that graves must be dug to a depth of six feet (1.8 metres). This is reflected in the common euphemism for death of six feet under.James K. Crissman, Death and Dying in Central Appalachia: Changing Attitudes and Practices, University of Illinois Press, 1994 . In fact, graves are rarely dug to this depth except when it is intended to later bury a further coffin or coffins on top of the first one. In such cases, more than six feet may be dug in order to provide the required depth of soil above the top coffin.Mary LaCoste, Death Embraced: New Orleans Tombs and Burial Customs, Lulu, 2015 . In the United States, there is no nationwide regulation of burial depth. Each local authority is free to determine its own rules. Requirements for depth can vary according to soil type and by method of burial. California, for instance, requires only 19 inches of soil above the top of the coffin, but more commonly 30 to 36 inches are required in other places. In some areas, such as central Appalachia, graves were indeed once dug to a depth of six feet to prevent the body being disturbed by burrowing animals. However, this was unnecessary once metal caskets and concrete vaults started to be used. In the United Kingdom, soil is required to be to a depth of three feet above the highest point of the coffin, unless the burial authority consider the soil to be suitable for a depth of only two feet.ICCM, \\"Policy Relating to Shallow Depth Graves\\", Institute of Cemetry & Crematorium Management, May 2004, accessed and archived 6 July 2019. The earliest known reference to a requirement for a six-foot burial occurred in 1665 during the Great Plague of London. John Lawrence, the Lord Mayor of London,A. Lloyd Moote, Dorothy C. Moote, The Great Plague: The Story of London's Most Deadly Year, Johns Hopkins University Press, 2006 . ordered that the bodies of plague victims \\"...shall be at least six foot deep.\\" The city officials apparently believed this would inhibit the spread of the disease, not realising that the true vector was fleas living on rats in the streets. In the event, there were so many victims that very few were buried in individual graves. Most were placed in massive plague pits so it is unlikely that this event alone gave rise to the \\"six feet\\" tradition.Chris Raymond, \\"Why Are Graves Dug 6 Feet Deep?\\", Verywell Health, accessed and archived 21 July 2019. =Natural burial= Natural burial‚Äîalso called \\"green burial\\"‚Äîis the process by which a body is returned to the earth to decompose naturally in soil, and in some cases even protect native and endangered wildlife. Natural burial became popularized in the United Kingdom in the early 1990s by Ken West, a professional cremator operator for the city of Carlisle, responding to the U.K's call for changes in government that aligned with the United Nations' Environmental Program Local Agenda 21. In addition, there are multiple green burial sites in the United States. Green burials are developing in Canada (Victoria, BC, and Cobourg, Ontario), as well as in Australia and Ireland. The increase in popularity of alternative burials can be seen as a direct choice of the individual's want to distance him/herself from religious practices and spiritual locations as well as an opportunity to exercise their act of choice. The desire to live through nature as well as concern for the environment have been the backbone of the green burial movement. The use of coffins made from alternative materials such as wicker and biodegradable materials as well as trees and other flora are being used in place of headstones. Both practices provide sustainable alternatives to traditional burial practices. Natural burials have been attracting people for reasons outside of environmental and sustainability factors as well. With the expansion of urban centres, ecological corridors gradually disappear. Cemeteries for burial plots preclude alternative uses of the land for a long time. By combining these two aspects (need for connectivity and land take imposed by cemeteries), two positive results can be achieved: protecting memories of the past and connecting ecosystems with multiple-use corridors. Green burials appeal to people for economic reasons. Traditional burial practices can be a financial burden causing some to turn to green burials as a cheaper alternative. Some people view green burials as more meaningful, especially for those who have a connection to a piece of land, such as current residence or other places that hold meaning for them. Types of natural burial =Conservation burial= Conservation burial is a type of burial where burial fees fund the acquisition and management of new land to benefit native habitat, ecosystems and species. This usually involves a legal document such as a conservation easement. Such burials go beyond other forms of natural burial, which aim to prevent environmental damage caused by conventional burial techniques, by actually increasing benefits for the environment. The idea is for the burial process to be a net positive for the earth rather than just neutral. Scientists have argued that such burials could potentially generate enough funds to save every endangered species on the planet. The Green Burial Council certifies natural and conservation burial grounds in the United States and Canada. =Memorial reef= The memorial reef is a natural, alternative approach to burial. The cremated remains of a person are mixed in with concrete and then placed into a mold to make the memorial reef or eternal reef. After the concrete sets, family members are allowed to customize the reef with writing, hand prints and chalk drawings. After this, the eco-friendly reefs are placed into the ocean among other coral reefs where they help to repair damage to the reefs while also providing new habitats for fish and other sea communities. It has become a new way to memorialize the passing person while also protecting the marine environment. The high cost of the memorial reefs has caused this alternative form of burial to remain minimal and uncommon. This kind of natural burial is practiced in permitted oceans in the United States specifically in locations around Florida, South Carolina, North Carolina, Maryland, New Jersey, Texas and Virginia. =Alkaline hydrolysis= Alkaline hydrolysis, also referred to as resomation, is another approach to natural burial. It uses high temperature water mixed with potassium hydroxide to dissolve human remains. During this process, the body is put into an enclosed, stainless steel chamber. The chamber fills with the chemical and water solution and is then lightly circulated. After a couple of hours, the body is worn down and bone is the only thing that remains. The bones are then pressed down into a powder and returned to the associated family. The outcome is comparable to cremation but results in an environmentally friendly process that does not release chemical emissions and greenhouse gases into the atmosphere. After this process, the water used goes to a regular water treatment facility where it is filtered and cleaned and returned to the water cycle. At this time, resomation is permitted for commercial use in areas throughout the United States. However, several other countries, including the United Kingdom are considering using this technology within their medical schools and universities. =Mushroom burial= Mushroom burial has been developed by Jae Rhim Lee and her colleagues to address the impact traditional burial approaches have on the environment. It is an eco-friendly process which consists of dressing the cadaver in a bodysuit with mushroom spores woven into it, nicknamed the Infinity Burial Suit. Rhim developed her own mushrooms by feeding them her hair, skin, and nails to create a mushroom variety that will best decompose human remains. As the mushrooms grow, they consume the remains within the suit as well as the toxins that are being released by the body. Rhim and her colleagues created this suit as a symbol of a new way for people to think about the relationship between their body after death and the environment. = Tree pod burials = Another method of natural burial is being developed to plant the human body in fetal position inside an egg shaped pod. The pod containing the body will form a biodegradable capsule that will not harm the surrounding earth. The biodegradable capsule doubles as a seed which can be customized to grow into either a birch, maple, or eucalyptus tree. The goal of this method is to create parks full of trees that loved ones can walk through and mourn, as opposed to a graveyard full of tombstones. This method aims to return the body to the earth in the most environmentally friendly way possible. The tree pod method originated in the United Kingdom but is now becoming a more popular method of burial. The definition of natural burial grounds suggests that people are being buried without any kind of formaldehyde-based embalming fluid or synthetic ingredients, and that the bodies that are being returned to the earth will also be returning nutrients to the environment, in a way that is less expensive than other available burial methods. Not only are tree pods a more cost effective and environmentally friendly way to memorialize loved ones, this method also offers emotional support. The memories of loved ones will be immortalized through the concept of a deceased person having a medium (trees) that will continue to live and grow. =Prevention of decay= A naturally mummified body in the British Museum. Embalming is the practice of preserving a body against decay and is used in many cultures. Mummification is a more extensive method of embalming, further delaying the decay process. Bodies are often buried wrapped in a shroud or placed in a coffin (or in some cases, a casket). A larger container may be used, such as a ship. In the United States, coffins are usually covered by a grave liner or a burial vault, which prevents the coffin from collapsing under the weight of the earth or floating away during a flood. These containers slow the decomposition process by (partially) physically blocking decomposing bacteria and other organisms from accessing the corpse. An additional benefit of using containers to hold the body is that if the soil covering the corpse is washed away by a flood or some other natural process then the corpse will still not be exposed to open air. =Inclusion of clothing and personal effects= The body may be dressed in fancy and/or ceremonial clothes. Personal objects of the deceased, such as a favorite piece of jewelry or photograph, may be included with the body. This practice, also known as the inclusion of grave goods, serves several purposes: * In funeral services, the body is often put on display. Many cultures feel that the deceased should be presented looking his or her finest. Others dress the deceased in burial shrouds, which range from very simple to elaborate depending on the culture. * The inclusion of ceremonial garb and sacred objects is sometimes viewed as necessary for reaching the afterlife. * The inclusion of personal effects may be motivated by the beliefs that in the afterlife people will wish to have with them what was important to them on earth. Alternatively, in some cultures, it is felt that, when a person dies, their possessions (and sometimes people connected to them such as wives) should go with them out of loyalty or ownership. * Although not generally a motivation for the inclusion of grave goods with a corpse, it is worth considering that future archaeologists may find the remains (compare time capsule). Artifacts such as clothing and objects provide insight into how the individual lived. This provides a form of immortality for the deceased. In general, however, clothing buried with a body decays more rapidly than the same buried alone. Traditions = Body positioning = A Muslim cemetery in Sahara, all graves point across the desert placed at right angles to Mecca Burials may be placed in a number of different positions. Bodies with the arms crossed date back to ancient cultures such as Chaldea in the 10th century BC, where the \\"X\\" symbolized their sky god. Later ancient Egyptian gods and royalty, from approximately 3500 B.C. are shown with crossed arms, such as the god Osiris, the Lord of the Dead, or mummified royalty with crossed arms in high and low body positions, depending upon the dynasty. The burial of bodies in the extended position, i.e., lying flat with arms and legs straight, or with the arms folded upon the chest, and with the eyes and mouth closed. Extended burials may be supine (lying on the back) or prone (lying on the front). However, in some cultures, being buried face down shows marked disrespect like in the case of the Sioux. Other ritual practices place the body in a flexed position with the legs bent or crouched with the legs folded up to the chest. Warriors in some ancient societies were buried in an upright position. In Islam, the body is placed in supine position, hands along the sides and the head is turned to its right with the face towards the Qibla. Many cultures treat placement of dead people in an appropriate position to be a sign of respect even when burial is impossible. In nonstandard burial practices, such as mass burial, the body may be positioned arbitrarily. This can be a sign of disrespect to the deceased, or at least nonchalance on the part of the inhumer, or due to considerations of time and space. Orientation Historically, Christian burials were made supine east- west, with the head at the western end of the grave. This mirrors the layout of Christian churches, and for much the same reason; to view the coming of Christ on Judgment day (Eschaton). In many Christian traditions, ordained clergy are traditionally buried in the opposite orientation, and their coffins carried likewise, so that at the General Resurrection they may rise facing, and ready to minister to, their people. In Islam, the grave should be aligned perpendicular to the Qibla (i.e. Mecca) and the face turned to the right and facing Qibla. (see Islamic funeral) Inverted burial For humans, maintaining an upside down position, with the head vertically below the feet, is highly uncomfortable for any extended period of time, and consequently burial in that attitude (as opposed to attitudes of rest or watchfulness, as above) is highly unusual and generally symbolic. Occasionally suicides and assassins were buried upside down, as a post-mortem punishment and (as with burial at cross-roads) to inhibit the activities of the resulting undead. In Gulliver's Travels, the Lilliputians buried their dead upside down: Swift's notion of inverted burial might seem the highest flight of fancy, but it appears that among English millenarians the idea that the world would be \\"turned upside down\\" at the Apocalypse enjoyed some currency. There is at least one attested case of a person being buried upside down by instruction; a Major Peter Labilliere of Dorking (d. 4 June 1800) lies thus upon the summit of Box Hill. Similar stories have attached themselves to other noted eccentrics, particularly in southern England, but not always with a foundation in truth. = Burial traditions throughout the world =  South Korea  South Korea's funeral arrangements have drastically changed in the course of only two decades according to Chang-Won Park. Park states that around the 1980s at home funeral ceremonies were the general norm, straying away from anywhere that was not a family home. Dying close to home, with friends and family, was considered a 'good death', while dying away from home was considered a 'bad death'. This gradually changed as the upper and middle class started holding funerals in the mortuaries of hospitals. This posed an issue for hospitals because of the rapid increase in funerals being held and maxing occupancy. This resolved when a law was passed to allow the civilian population to hold funerals in the mortuaries of hospitals. The lower class then followed suit, copying the newly set traditions of the upper classes. With this change, the practice of cremation became viewed more as an alternative to traditional burials. Cremation was first introduced by Buddhism, but was banned in 1470. It wasn't until the Japanese colonization period that cremation was re-introduced in 1945 and later lifted the ban. It took until 1998 for cremation to rapidly grow in popularity.  Tana Toraja  A Ted Talk done by Kelli Swazey discusses how Tana Toraja, a Sulawesi province in Eastern Indonesia, experiences death as a process, rather than an event. The culture of Tana Toraja views funerals as the most important event in a person's life. Because of this importance placed on death, Tana Toraja landscape is covered in the rituals and events transpired after death. The hierarchy of an individual's life is based on the sacrifices of animals made after their death. Funerals tend to be celebrated by Tana Toraja people, typically lasting days to even weeks long. Death is seen as a transformation, rather than a private loss. A Torajan is not considered 'dead' until their family members are able to collect the resources necessary to hold a funeral that expresses the status of the deceased. Until these funerals are upheld the deceased are held in Tongkonan, built to house corpses that are not considered 'dead'. The deceased can be held in Tongkonan for years, waiting for their families to collect the necessary resources to hold a funeral. The Tongkonan represents both the identity of the family and the process of birth and death. The process of birth and death is shown by having the houses that individuals are born in be the same structure as the Tongkonan, houses that individuals die in. Up until the funeral the deceased being housed in the Tongkonan are symbolically treated as members of the family, still being cared for by family members.  Australian Aboriginals (Northern Territory)  Northern Territory Australian Aboriginals have unique traditions associated with a loved one's death. The death of a loved one sparks a series of events such as smoking out the spirit, a feast, and leaving out the body to decompose. Immediately after death, a smoking ceremony is held in the deceased's home. The smoking ceremonies purpose is to expel the spirit of the deceased from their living quarters. A feast is held where mourners are covered in ochre, an earthy pigment associated with clay, while they eat and dance. The traditional corpse disposal of the Aboriginals includes covering the corpse in leaves on a platform. The corpse is then left to decompose. =Burial among African- American slaves= In the African-American slave community, slaves quickly familiarized themselves with funeral procedures and the location of gravesites of family and friends. Specific slaves were assigned to prepare dead bodies, build coffins, dig graves, and construct headstones. Slave funerals were typically at night when the workday was over, with the master present to view all the ceremonial procedures. Slaves from nearby plantations were regularly in attendance. At death, a slave's body was wrapped in cloth. The hands were placed across the chest, and a metal plate was placed on top of their hands. The reasoning for the plate was to hinder their return home by suppressing any spirits in the coffin. Often, personal property was buried with slaves to appease spirits. The coffins were nailed shut once the body was inside, and carried by hand or wagon, depending on the property designated for slave burial site. Slaves were buried oriented East to West, with feet at the Eastern end (head at the Western end, thus raising facing East). According to Christian doctrine, this orientation permitted rising to face the return of Christ without having to turn around upon the call of Gabriel's trumpet. Gabriel's trumpet would be blown near the Eastern sunrise. =Burial in the Bah√° º√≠ Faith= In the Bah√° º√≠ Faith, burial law prescribes both the location of burial and burial practices and precludes cremation of the dead. It is forbidden to carry the body for more than one hour's journey from the place of death. Before interment the body should be wrapped in a shroud of silk or cotton, and a ring should be placed on its finger bearing the inscription \\"I came forth from God, and return unto Him, detached from all save Him, holding fast to His Name, the Merciful, the Compassionate\\". The coffin should be of crystal, stone or hard fine wood. Also, before interment, a specific Prayer for the Dead is ordained. The body should be placed with the feet facing the Qiblih. The formal prayer and the ring are meant to be used for those who have reached fifteen years of age. Locations =Where to bury= Apart from sanitary and other practical considerations, the site of burial can be determined by religious and socio-cultural considerations. Thus in some traditions, especially with an animistic logic, the remains of the dead are \\"banished\\" for fear their spirits would harm the living if too close; others keep remains close to help surviving generations. Religious rules may prescribe a specific zone, e.g. some Christian traditions hold that Christians must be buried in consecrated ground, usually a cemetery; an earlier practice, burial in or very near the church (hence the word churchyard), was generally abandoned with individual exceptions as a high posthumous honour; also many existing funeral monuments and crypts remain in use. Royalty and high nobility often have one or more \\"traditional\\" sites of burial, generally monumental, often in a palatial chapel or cathedral; see examples on Heraldica.org. In North America, private family cemeteries were common among wealthy landowners during the 18th and 19th centuries. Many prominent people were buried in private cemeteries on their respective properties, sometimes in lead-lined coffins. Many of these family cemeteries were not documented and were therefore lost to time and abandon; their grave markers having long since been pilfered by vandals or covered by forest growth. Their locations are occasionally discovered during construction projects. =Marking the location of the burial= Kanji inscriptions engraved on headstones in the Japanese Cemetery in Broome, Western Australia Most modern cultures mark the location of the body with a headstone. This serves two purposes. First, the grave will not accidentally be exhumed. Second, headstones often contain information or tributes to deceased. This is a form of remembrance for loved ones; it can also be viewed as a form of immortality, especially in cases of famous people's graves. Such monumental inscriptions may subsequently be useful to genealogists and family historians. In many cultures graves will be grouped, so the monuments make up a necropolis, a \\"city of the dead\\" paralleling the community of the living. Unmarked grave In many cultures graves are marked with durable markers, or monuments, intended to help remind people of the buried person. An unmarked grave is a grave with no such memorial marker. Anonymous burial Another sort of unmarked grave is a burial site with an anonymous marker, such as a simple cross; boots, rifle and helmet; a sword and shield; a cairn of stones; or even a monument. This may occur when identification of the deceased is impossible. Although many unidentified deceased are buried in potter's fields, some are memorialized, especially in smaller communities or in the case of deaths publicized by local media. Anonymous burials also happen in poorer or disadvantaged populations' communities in countries such as South Africa, where in the past the Non-white population was simply too poor to afford headstones. At the cemetery in a small rural town of Harding, KwaZulu-Natal, many grave sites have no identification, and just have a border of stones which mark out the dimensions of the grave site itself. Many countries have buried an unidentified soldier (or other member of the military) in a prominent location as a form of respect for all unidentified war dead. The United Kingdom's Tomb of the Unknown Warrior is in Westminster Abbey, France's is buried underneath the Arc de Triomphe, Italy's is buried in the Monumento al Milite Ignoto in Rome, Canada's is buried at the National War Memorial in Ottawa, Australia's Tomb of the Unknown Soldier is located at the Australian War Memorial in Canberra, New Zealand's Tomb of the Unknown Warrior is in Wellington, the Tomb of the Unknown Soldier in Russia is in Alexander Garden in Moscow and the United States' Tomb of the Unknown Soldier is located at Arlington National Cemetery. Many cultures practice anonymous burial as a norm, not an exception. For instance, in 2002 a survey for the Federal Guild of German Stonemasons found that, depending on the location within Germany, from 0% to 43% of burials were anonymous. According to Christian Century magazine, the perspective of the Roman Catholic Church is that anonymous burials reflect a dwindling belief in God. Others claim that this trend is mainly driven by secularism and the high costs of traditional burials. Secret burial In rare cases, a known person may be buried without identification, perhaps to avoid desecration of the corpse, grave robbing, or vandalism of the burial site. This may be particularly the case with infamous or notorious figures. In other cases, it may be to prevent the grave from becoming a tourist attraction or a destination of pilgrimage. Survivors may cause the deceased to be buried in a secret location or other unpublished place, or in a grave with a false name (or no name at all) on the marker. When Walt Disney was cremated his ashes were buried in a secret location in Forest Lawn Memorial Park Cemetery, California. Some burial sites at Forest Lawn, such as those of Humphrey Bogart, Mary Pickford and Michael Jackson, are secluded in private gated gardens or mausoleums with no public access. A number of tombs are also kept from the public eye. Forest Lawn's Court of Honor indicates that some of its crypts have plots which are reserved for individuals who may be \\"voted in\\" as \\"Immortals\\"; no amount of money can purchase a place. Photographs taken at Forest Lawn are not permitted to be published, and their information office usually refuses to reveal exactly where the remains of famous people are buried. Multiple bodies per grave Some couples or groups of people (such as a married couple or other family members) may wish to be buried in the same plot. In some cases, the coffins (or urns) may simply be buried side by side. In others, one casket may be interred above another. If this is planned for in advance, the first casket may be buried more deeply than is the usual practice so that the second casket may be placed over it without disturbing the first. In many states in Australia all graves are designated two or three depth (depending of the water table) for multiple burials, at the discretion of the burial rights holder, with each new interment atop the previous coffin separated by a thin layer of earth. As such all graves are dug to greater depth for the initial burial than the traditional six feet to facilitate this practice. Mass burial is the practice of burying multiple bodies in one location. Civilizations attempting genocide often employ mass burial for victims. However, mass burial may in many cases be the only practical means of dealing with an overwhelming number of human remains, such as those resulting from a natural disaster, an act of terrorism, an epidemic, or an accident. This practice has become less common in the developed world with the advent of genetic testing, but even in the 21st century remains which are unidentifiable by current methods may be buried in a mass grave. Individuals who are buried at the expense of the local authorities and buried in potter's fields may be buried in mass graves. Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart was once believed to have been buried in such a manner, but today it is known that such burials were never allowed in Mozart's Vienna whose Magistrate refused to agree to the burial regulations decreed by Joseph II. In some cases, the remains of unidentified individuals may be buried in mass graves in potter's fields, making exhumation and future identification troublesome for law enforcement. Naval ships sunk in combat are also considered mass graves by many countries. For example, U.S. Navy policy declares such wrecks a mass grave (such as the USS Arizona Memorial) and forbids the recovery of remains. In lieu of recovery, divers or submersibles may leave a plaque dedicated to the memory of the ship or boat and its crew, and family members are invited to attend the ceremony. Sites of large former battlefields may also contain one or more mass graves. Douaumont ossuary is one such mass grave, and it contains the remains of 130,000 soldiers from both sides of the Battle of Verdun. Catacombs also constitute a form of mass grave. Some catacombs, for example those in Rome, were designated as a communal burial place. Some, such as the catacombs of Paris, only became a mass grave when individual burials were relocated from cemeteries marked for demolition. Judaism does not generally allow multiple bodies in a grave. An exception to this is a grave in the military cemetery in Jerusalem, where there is a kever achim (Hebrew, \\"grave of brothers\\") where two soldiers were killed together in a tank and are buried in one grave. As the bodies were so fused together with the metal of the tank that they could not be separately identified, they were buried in one grave (along with parts of the tank). =Cremation= Honor Oak Crematorium, Camberwell New Cemetery, London. Architect Maurice Webb ‚Äì geograph.org.uk ‚Äì 45058 There are several common alternatives to burial. In cremation the body of the deceased is burned in a special oven. Most of the body is burnt during the cremation process, leaving only a few pounds of bone fragments. Bodies of small children and infants often produce very little in the way of \\"ashes\\", as ashes are composed of bone, and young people have softer bones, largely cartilage. Often these fragments are processed (ground) into a fine powder, which has led to cremated remains being called ashes. In recent times, cremation has become a popular option in the western world. There is far greater flexibility in dealing with the remains in cremation as opposed to the traditional burial. Some of the options include scattering the ashes at a place that was loved by the deceased or keeping the ashes at home. Ashes can also be buried underground or in a columbarium niche. A method with similar benefits is freeze-drying the corpse. =Live burial= Live burial sometimes occurs, in which individuals are buried while still alive. Having no way of escaping interment, they die in place, typically by asphyxiation, dehydration, starvation, or exposure to climate. People may come to be buried alive in a number of different ways; * Intentional: buried alive as a method of execution or murder, called immurement when the person is entombed within walls. In ancient Rome, Vestal Virgins who broke their vows were punished in this way. * Accidental: A person or group of people in a cave, mine, or other underground area may be sealed underground due to an earthquake, cave in, or other natural disaster or accident. Live burial may also occur due to avalanches on mountain slopes. * Inadvertent: People have been unintentionally buried alive because they were pronounced dead by a coroner or other official, when they were in fact still alive. Writer Edgar Allan Poe wrote a number of stories and poems about premature burial, including a story called \\"The Premature Burial.\\" These works inspired a widespread popular fear of this appalling but unlikely event. Various expedients have been devised to prevent this event, including burying live telephones or telemetry sensors in graves. =Burial at cross-roads= Historically, burial at cross-roads was the method of disposing of executed criminals and suicides. In Great Britain this tradition was altered by the Burial of Suicide Act 1823, which abolished the legal requirements of burying suicides and other people at crossroads. Cross-roads form a crude cross shape and this may have given rise to the belief that these spots were selected as the next best burying-places to consecrated ground. Another possible explanation is that the ancient Teutonic (Germanic) ethnic groups often built their altars at the cross-roads, and since human sacrifices, especially of criminals, formed part of the ritual, these spots came to be regarded as execution grounds. Hence after the introduction of Christianity, criminals and suicides were buried at the cross-roads during the night, in order to assimilate as far as possible their funeral to that of the pagans. An example of a cross-road execution-ground was the famous Tyburn in London, which stood on the spot where the Roman road to Edgware and beyond met the Roman road heading west out of London. Superstition also played a part in the selection of crossroads in the burial of suicides. Folk belief often held such individuals could rise as some form of undead (such as a vampire) and burying them at crossroads would inhibit their ability to find and wreak havoc on their living relations and former associates. =Burial of animals= By humans Soldiers' dog cemetery at Edinburgh Castle In addition to burying human remains, many human cultures also regularly bury animal remains. Pets and other animals of emotional significance are often ceremonially buried. Most families bury deceased pets on their own properties, mainly in a yard, with a shoe box or any other type of container served as a coffin. The ancient Egyptians are known to have mummified and buried cats, which they considered deities. By other animals Humans are not always the only species to bury their dead. Chimpanzees and elephants are known to throw leaves and branches over fallen members of their family groups. In a particularly odd case, an elephant which trampled a human mother and child buried its victims under a pile of leaves before disappearing into the bushes. In 2013, a viral video caught a dog burying a dead puppy by pushing sand with its own nose. It is presumed, however, that since dogs retain the instinct to bury food, this is what is being depicted in the video. In social insects, ants and termites also bury their dead nestmates depending on the properties of the corpse and the social context.L√≥pez-Riquelme, Germ√°n & Fanjul-Moles, Maria. (2013). \\"The funeral ways of social insects. Social strategies for corpse disposal\\". Trends in Entomology. 9. 71‚Äì129. Exhumation Exhumation, or disinterment, is the act of digging up, especially a corpse. This is most often done to relocate a body to a different burial spot. Families may make this decision to locate the deceased in a more pertinent or convenient place. In shared family burial sites (e.g. a married couple), if the previously deceased person has been buried for an insufficient period of time the second body may be buried elsewhere until it is safe to relocate it to the requested grave. In most jurisdictions a legal exhumation usually requires a court order or permission by the next of kin of the deceased. Also in many countries permits are required by some governing agency like the board of health in order to legally conduct a disinterment.Exhumation of the remains of a deceased person. Citizens Information Ireland. Retrieved on 29 June 2014. Exhumation of human remains occur for a number of reasons unrelated to the burial location, including identification of the deceased or as part of a criminal investigation. If an individual dies in suspicious circumstances, the police may request exhumation in order to determine the cause of death. Exhumations may also occur as part of grave robbing, or as an act of desecration to show disrespect. In rare, historical cases (e.g. Pope Formosus or Oliver Cromwell), a body may be exhumed for posthumous execution, dissection, or gibbeting. Notable individuals may be exhumed to answer historical questions. Many Ancient Egyptian mummies have been removed for study and public display. Exhumation enables archaeologists to search the remains to better understand human culture. In folklore and mythology, exhumation has also been frequently associated with the performance of rites to banish undead manifestations. An example is the Mercy Brown Vampire Incident of Rhode Island, which occurred in 1892. =Changing burial location= Remains may be exhumed in order to be reinterred at a more appropriate location for various reasons. *The passing of time may mean political situations change and a burial can take place in different circumstances. Roger Casement was executed at Pentonville Prison in London on 3 August 1916 and buried in the prison grounds but his body was exhumed and given a state funeral in Dublin on 1 March 1965.National Archives, London, CAB 128/39 *Deceased individuals who were either not identified or misidentified at the time of burial may be reburied if survivors so wish. For example, when the remains of MIA soldiers are discovered, or the case of Nicholas II of Russia and his family, who were exhumed from unmarked graves near Yekaterinburg to be reinterred in the Peter and Paul Fortress in St. Petersburg. *Cemeteries sometimes have a limited number of plots in which to bury the dead. Once all plots are full, older remains may be moved to an ossuary to accommodate more bodies, in accordance with burial contracts, religious and local burial laws. In Hong Kong where real estate is at a premium, burials in government-run cemeteries are disinterred after six years under exhumation order. Remains are either collected privately for cremation or reburied in an urn or niche. Unclaimed burials are exhumed and cremated by the government. Permanent burial in privately run cemeteries is allowed. *Remains may be exhumed and reburied en masse when a cemetery is relocated, once local planning and religious requirements are met. It also enables construction agencies to clear the way for new constructions. One example of this is cemeteries in Chicago next to O'Hare International Airport to expand the runways.*The remains of the Venerable or the Blessed are sometimes exhumed to ensure their bodies lie in their correctly marked graves, as their gravesites usually become places for devotees to gather, and also to collect relics. The bodies may also be transferred to a more dignified place. It also serves the purpose to see if they are supernaturally Incorrupt. An incorrupt corpse is no longer considered miraculous, but it is a characteristic of several known saints. Exhumation is no longer a requirement in the beatification process, but still may be carried out. *For ethical and cultural reasons, repatriation and reburial of human remains may be carried out when museums return remains to their place of origin. =Cultural aspects of exhumation= Frequently, cultures have different sets of exhumation taboos. Occasionally these differences result in conflict, especially in cases where a culture with more lenient exhumation rules wishes to operate on the territory of a different culture. For example, United States construction companies have run into conflict with Native American groups that have wanted to preserve their burial grounds from disturbance. In Southern Chinese culture, graves are opened after a period of years. The bones are removed, cleaned, dried, and placed in a ceramic pot for reburial (in Taiwan), or in a smaller coffin and to be reburied in another location (in Vietnam). The practice is called ji«éng«î in Taiwan, or boc mo in Vietnam 'ÊèÄÈ™® \\"digging up bones\\" and is an important ritual in the posthumous \\"care\\" of children for their deceased parents and ancestors. Failure to carry out this ritual is considered a failure of filial piety. Jewish law forbids the exhumation of a corpse. In England and Wales once the top of a coffin has been lowered below ground level in a burial if it raised again, say for example the grave sides are protruding and need further work, this is considered an exhumation and the Home Office are required to be notified and a full investigation undertaken. Therefore, grave diggers in England and Wales are particularly careful to ensure that grave sites are dug with plenty of room for the coffin to pass. Reinterment Reinterment refers to the reburial of a corpse. Secondary burial Secondary burial is a burial, cremation, or inhumation that is dug into a pre-existing barrow or grave any time after its initial construction. It is often associated with the belief that there is a liminal phase between the time that a person dies and finally decays.1991 Metcalf, Peter & Richard Huntington. Celebrations of Death: The Anthropology of Mortuary Ritual. Cambridge Press, New York. Print. Alternatives to burial Adashino Nembutsuji in Kyoto, Japan stands on a site where Japanese people once abandoned the bodies of the dead without burial Alternatives to burial variously show respect for the dead, accelerate decomposition and disposal, or prolong display of the remains. * Burial at sea is the practice of depositing the body or scattering its ashes in an ocean or other large body of water instead of soil. The body may be disposed in a coffin, or without one. * Funerary cannibalism is the practice of eating the remains. This may be done for many reasons: for example to partake of their strength, to spiritually \\"close the circle\\" by reabsorbing their life into the family or clan, to annihilate an enemy, or due to pathological mental conditions. The Yanomami have the practice of cremating the remains and then eating the ashes with banana paste. * Cremation is the incineration of the remains. This practice is common amongst Hindus and is becoming increasingly common in other cultures as well. If a family member wishes, the ashes can now be turned into a gem, similar to creating synthetic diamonds. * Whether cryonics constitutes a method of interment, rather than a form of medical treatment, remains under debate. See also information-theoretic death and clinical death. * Excarnation is the practice of removing the flesh from the corpse without interment. The Zoroastrians have traditionally left their dead on Towers of Silence, where the flesh of the corpses is left to be devoured by vultures and other carrion-eating birds. Alternatively, it can also mean butchering the corpse by hand to remove the flesh (also referred to as \\"defleshing\\"). * Gibbeting was the semi-ancient practice of publicly displaying remains of criminals. * Hanging coffins are coffins placed on cliffs, found in various locations, including China and the Philippines. * Ossuaries were used for interring human skeletal remains by Second Temple Jews and early Christians. * Promession is a method of increasing the rate of decomposition in order to help fertilize the soil. * Resomation accelerates disposal through the process of alkaline hydrolysis. * Sky burial places the body on a mountaintop, where it decomposes in the elements or is scavenged by carrion eaters, particularly vultures. * Promession freeze dries human remains before burial. = Adapting traditions =  Burial  As the human population progresses, cultures and traditions change with it. Evolution is generally slow, sometimes more rapid. South Korea's funeral arrangements have drastically changed in the course of only two decades according to Chang-Won Park. Around the 1980s at home funeral ceremonies were the general norm, straying away from anywhere that was not a family home. Dying close to home, with friends and family, was considered a ‚Äògood death‚Äô, while dying away from home was considered a ‚Äòbad death‚Äô. This gradually changed as the upper and middle class started holding funerals in the mortuaries of hospitals. This posed an issue for hospitals because of the rapid increase in funerals being held and maxing occupancy. This quickly resolved when a law was passed to allow the civilian population holding funerals in the mortuaries of hospitals. The lower class quickly followed suit, copying the newly set traditions of the upper classes. With this change, cremation also practice more as an alternative to traditional burials. Cremation was first introduced by Buddhism, and was quickly banned in 1470. It wasn‚Äôt until the Japanese colonization period that cremation was re-introduced in 1945 and later on lifted the ban. It took until 1998 for cremation to rapidly grow in popularity.  Funeral ceremonies  According to Margaret Holloway, funerals are believed to be driven by the consumer's choice, personalisation, secularization, and stories that place individual traditional meta-narratives. It has been studied that funeral homes in the United Kingdom are most concerned with comforting the grieving, rather than focusing on the departed. This study found that modern day funerals focus on the psycho-social-spiritual event. Modern day funerals also help the transition of the recently passed transitioning to the social status of 'the deceased'. The article found that funeral homes do not adhere to traditional religious beliefs, but do follow religious traditions.

It can also be considered a subfield or method in economics. Scroll to chapter-preview links. Economic geography takes a variety of approaches to many different topics, including the location of industries, economies of agglomeration (also known as \\"linkages\\"), transportation, international trade, development, real estate, gentrification, ethnic economies, gendered economies, core-periphery theory, the economics of urban form, the relationship between the environment and the economy (tying into a long history of geographers studying culture-environment interaction), and globalization.  Theoretical background and influences  There are varied methodological approaches. Neoclassical location theorists, following in the tradition of Alfred Weber, tend to focus on industrial location and use quantitative methods. Since the 1970s, two broad reactions against neoclassical approaches have significantly changed the discipline: Marxist political economy, growing out of the work of David Harvey; and the new economic geography which takes into account social, cultural, and institutional factors in the spatial economy. Economists such as Paul Krugman and Jeffrey Sachs have also analyzed many traits related to economic geography. Krugman called his application of spatial thinking to international trade theory the \\"new economic geography\\", which directly competes with an approach within the discipline of geography that is also called \\"new economic geography\\".From S.N.

The name geographical economics has been suggested as an alternative. History coffee trade is a worldwide industry. Early approaches to economic geography are found in the seven Chinese maps of the State of Qin, which date to the 4th century BC and in the Greek geographer Strabo's Geographika, compiled almost 2000 years ago. As cartography developed, geographers illuminated many aspects used today in the field; maps created by different European powers described the resources likely to be found in American, African, and Asian territories. The earliest travel journals included descriptions of the native peoples, the climate, the landscape, and the productivity of various locations. These early accounts encouraged the development of transcontinental trade patterns and ushered in the era of mercantilism. World War II contributed to the popularization of geographical knowledge generally, and post-war economic recovery and development contributed to the growth of economic geography as a discipline. During environmental determinism's time of popularity, Ellsworth Huntington and his theory of climatic determinism, while later greatly criticized, notably influenced the field. Valuable contributions also came from location theorists such as Johann Heinrich von Th√ºnen or Alfred Weber. Other influential theories include Walter Christaller's Central place theory, the theory of core and periphery. Fred K. Schaefer's article \\"Exceptionalism in geography: A Methodological Examination\\", published in the American journal Annals of the Association of American Geographers, and his critique of regionalism, made a large impact on the field: the article became a rallying point for the younger generation of economic geographers who were intent on reinventing the discipline as a science, and quantitative methods began to prevail in research. Well-known economic geographers of this period include William Garrison, Brian Berry, Waldo Tobler, Peter Haggett and William Bunge. Contemporary economic geographers tend to specialize in areas such as location theory and spatial analysis (with the help of geographic information systems), market research, geography of transportation, real estate price evaluation, regional and global development, planning, Internet geography, innovation, social networks. Approaches to study As economic geography is a very broad discipline, with economic geographers using many different methodologies in the study of economic phenomena in the world some distinct approaches to study have evolved over time: *Theoretical economic geography focuses on building theories about spatial arrangement and distribution of economic activities. *Regional economic geography examines the economic conditions of particular regions or countries of the world. It deals with economic regionalization as well as local economic development. *Historical economic geography examines the history and development of spatial economic structure. Using historical data, it examines how centers of population and economic activity shift, what patterns of regional specialization and localization evolve over time and what factors explain these changes. *Evolutionary economic geography adopts an evolutionary approach to economic geography. More specifically, Evolutionary Economic Geography uses concepts and ideas from evolutionary economics to understand the evolution of cities, regions, and other economic systems. *Critical economic geography is an approach taken from the point of view of contemporary critical geography and its philosophy. *Behavioral economic geography examines the cognitive processes underlying spatial reasoning, locational decision making, and behavior of firms and individuals. Economic geography is sometimes approached as a branch of anthropogeography that focuses on regional systems of human economic activity. An alternative description of different approaches to the study of human economic activity can be organized around spatiotemporal analysis, analysis of production/consumption of economic items, and analysis of economic flow. Spatiotemporal systems of analysis include economic activities of region, mixed social spaces, and development. Alternatively, analysis may focus on production, exchange, distribution, and consumption of items of economic activity. Allowing parameters of space-time and item to vary, a geographer may also examine material flow, commodity flow, population flow and information flow from different parts of the economic activity system. Through analysis of flow and production, industrial areas, rural and urban residential areas, transportation site, commercial service facilities and finance and other economic centers are linked together in an economic activity system. =Branches= Thematically, economic geography can be divided into these subdisciplines: * Geography of agriculture It is traditionally considered the branch of economic geography that investigates those parts of the Earth's surface that are transformed by humans through primary sector activities. It thus focuses on structures of agricultural landscapes and asks for the processes that lead to these spatial patterns. While most research in this area concentrates rather on production than on consumption,[1] a distinction can be made between nomothetic (e.g. distribution of spatial agricultural patterns and processes) and idiographic research (e.g. human-environment interaction and the shaping of agricultural landscapes). The latter approach of agricultural geography is often applied within regional geography. * Geography of industry * Geography of international trade * Geography of resources * Geography of transport and communication * Geography of finance These areas of study may overlap with other geographical sciences. =Economists and economic geographers= Generally, spatially interested economists study the effects of space on the economy. Geographers, on the other hand, are interested in the economic processes' impact on spatial structures. Moreover, economists and economic geographers differ in their methods in approaching spatial-economic problems in several ways. An economic geographer will often take a more holistic approach to the analysis of economic phenomena, which is to conceptualize a problem in terms of space, place, and scale as well as the overt economic problem that is being examined. The economist approach, according to some economic geographers, has the main drawback of homogenizing the economic world in ways economic geographers try to avoid. Variation by industry Industries have different patterns of economic geography. Extractive industries tend to be concentrated around their specific natural resources. In Norway, for example, most oil industry jobs occur within a single electoral district. Industries are geographically concentrated if they do not need to be close to their end customers, such as the automotive industry concentration in Detroit, US. Agriculture also tends to be concentrated. Industries are geographically diffuse if they need to be close to their end customers, such as hairdressers, restaurants, and the hospitality industry. New economic geography With the rise of the New Economy, economic inequalities are increasing spatially. The New Economy, generally characterized by globalization, increasing use of information and communications technology, the growth of knowledge goods, and feminization, has enabled economic geographers to study social and spatial divisions caused by the rising New Economy, including the emerging digital divide. The new economic geographies consist of primarily service-based sectors of the economy that use innovative technology, such as industries where people rely on computers and the internet. Within these is a switch from manufacturing-based economies to the digital economy. In these sectors, competition makes technological changes robust. These high technology sectors rely heavily on interpersonal relationships and trust, as developing things like software is very different from other kinds of industrial manufacturing‚Äîit requires intense levels of cooperation between many different people, as well as the use of tacit knowledge. As a result of cooperation becoming a necessity, there is a clustering in the high-tech new economy of many firms. = Social and spatial divisions = As characterized through the work of Diane Perrons, in Anglo-American literature, the New Economy consists of two distinct types. New Economic Geography 1 (NEG1) is characterized by sophisticated spatial modelling. It seeks to explain uneven development and the emergence of industrial clusters. It does so through the exploration of linkages between centripetal and centrifugal forces, especially those of economies of scale. New Economic Geography 2 (NEG2) also seeks to explain the apparently paradoxical emergence of industrial clusters in a contemporary context, however, it emphasizes relational, social, and contextual aspects of economic behaviour, particularly the importance of tacit knowledge. The main difference between these two types is NEG2's emphasis on aspects of economic behaviour that NEG1 considers intangible. Both New Economic Geographies acknowledge transport costs, the importance of knowledge in a new economy, possible effects of externalities, and endogenous processes that generate increases in productivity. The two also share a focus on the firm as the most important unit and on growth rather than development of regions. As a result, the actual impact of clusters on a region is given far less attention, relative to the focus on clustering of related activities in a region. However, the focus on the firm as the main entity of significance hinders the discussion of New Economic Geography. It limits the discussion in a national and global context and confines it to a smaller scale context. It also places limits on the nature of the firm's activities and their position within the global value chain. Further work done by Bjorn Asheim (2001) and Gernot Grabher (2002) challenges the idea of the firm through action-research approaches and mapping organizational forms and their linkages. In short, the focus on the firm in new economic geographies is undertheorized in NEG1 and undercontextualized in NEG2, which limits the discussion of its impact on spatial economic development. Spatial divisions within these arising New Economic geographies are apparent in the form of the digital divide, as a result of regions attracting talented workers instead of developing skills at a local level (see Creative Class for further reading). Despite increasing inter-connectivity through developing information communication technologies, the contemporary world is still defined through its widening social and spatial divisions, most of which are increasingly gendered. Danny Quah explains these spatial divisions through the characteristics of knowledge goods in the New Economy: goods defined by their infinite expansibility, weightlessness, and nonrivalry. Social divisions are expressed through new spatial segregation that illustrates spatial sorting by income, ethnicity, abilities, needs, and lifestyle preferences. Employment segregation is evidence by the overrepresentation of women and ethnic minorities in lower-paid service sector jobs. These divisions in the new economy are much more difficult to overcome as a result of few clear pathways of progression to higher-skilled work.

This approach, in which observable properties of a macroscopic system are influenced by direct alteration of a molecular structure, falls into the broader category of ‚Äúbottom-up‚Äù design. Molecular engineering deals with material development efforts in emerging technologies that require rigorous rational molecular design approaches towards systems of high complexity. Molecular engineering is highly interdisciplinary by nature, encompassing aspects of chemical engineering, materials science, bioengineering, electrical engineering, physics, mechanical engineering, and chemistry. There is also considerable overlap with nanotechnology, in that both are concerned with the behavior of materials on the scale of nanometers or smaller. Given the highly fundamental nature of molecular interactions, there are a plethora of potential application areas, limited perhaps only by one's imagination and the laws of physics. However, some of the early successes of molecular engineering have come in the fields of immunotherapy, synthetic biology, and printable electronics (see molecular engineering applications). Molecular engineering is a dynamic and evolving field with complex target problems; breakthroughs require sophisticated and creative engineers who are conversant across disciplines. A rational engineering methodology that is based on molecular principles is in contrast to the widespread trial-and-error approaches common throughout engineering disciplines. Rather than relying on well-described but poorly-understood empirical correlations between the makeup of a system and its properties, a molecular design approach seeks to manipulate system properties directly using an understanding of their chemical and physical origins. This often gives rise to fundamentally new materials and systems, which are required to address outstanding needs in numerous fields, from energy to healthcare to electronics. Additionally, with the increased sophistication of technology, trial-and-error approaches are often costly and difficult, as it may be difficult to account for all relevant dependencies among variables in a complex system. Molecular engineering efforts may include computational tools, experimental methods, or a combination of both. History Molecular engineering was first mentioned in the research literature in 1956 by Arthur R. von Hippel, who defined it as \\"‚Ä¶ a new mode of thinking about engineering problems. Instead of taking prefabricated materials and trying to devise engineering applications consistent with their macroscopic properties, one builds materials from their atoms and molecules for the purpose at hand.\\" This concept was echoed in Richard Feynman's seminal 1959 lecture There's Plenty of Room at the Bottom, which is widely regarded as giving birth to some of the fundamental ideas of the field of nanotechnology. In spite of the early introduction of these concepts, it was not until the mid-1980s with the publication of Engines of Creation: The Coming Era of Nanotechnology by Drexler that the modern concepts of nano and molecular-scale science began to grow in the public consciousness. The discovery of electrically-conductive properties in polyacetylene by Alan J. Heeger in 1977 effectively opened the field of organic electronics, which has proved foundational for many molecular engineering efforts. Design and optimization of these materials has led to a number of innovations including organic light- emitting diodes and flexible solar cells. Applications Molecular design has been an important element of many disciplines in academia, including bioengineering, chemical engineering, electrical engineering, materials science, mechanical engineering and chemistry. However, one of the ongoing challenges is in bringing together the critical mass of manpower amongst disciplines to span the realm from design theory to materials production, and from device design to product development. Thus, while the concept of rational engineering of technology from the bottom-up is not new, it is still far from being widely translated into R&D; efforts. Molecular engineering is used in many industries. Some applications of technologies where molecular engineering plays a critical role: = Consumer Products = * Antibiotic surfaces (e.g. incorporation of silver nanoparticles or antibacterial peptides into coatings to prevent microbial infection) * Cosmetics (e.g. rheological modification with small molecules and surfactants in shampoo) * Cleaning products (e.g. nanosilver in laundry detergent) * Consumer electronics (e.g. organic light- emitting diode displays (OLED)) * Electrochromic windows (e.g. windows in the Boeing 787 Dreamliner) * Zero emission vehicles (e.g. advanced fuel cells/batteries) * Self-cleaning surfaces (e.g. super hydrophobic surface coatings) = Energy Harvesting and Storage = * Flow batteries - Synthesizing molecules for high-energy density electrolytes and highly- selective membranes in grid-scale energy storage systems. * Lithium-ion batteries - Creating new molecules for use as electrode binders, electrolytes, electrolyte additives, or even for energy storage directly in order to improve energy density (using materials such as graphene, silicon nanorods, and lithium metal), power density, cycle life, and safety. * Solar cells - Developing new materials for more efficient and cost-effective solar cells including organic, quantum dot or perovskite-based photovoltaics. * Photocatalytic water splitting - Enhancing the production of hydrogen fuel using solar energy and advanced catalytic materials such as semiconductor nanoparticles = Environmental Engineering = * Water desalination (e.g. new membranes for highly-efficient low-cost ion removal) * Soil remediation (e.g. catalytic nanoparticles that accelerate the degradation of long-lived soil contaminants such as chlorinated organic compounds) * Carbon sequestration (e.g. new materials for CO2 adsorption) = Immunotherapy = * Peptide-based vaccines (e.g. amphiphilic peptide macromolecular assemblies induce a robust immune response) *Peptide-containing biopharmaceuticals (e.g. nanoparticles, liposomes, polyelectrolyte micelles as delivery vehicles) = Synthetic Biology = * CRISPR - Faster and more efficient gene editing technique * Gene delivery/gene therapy - Designing molecules to deliver modified or new genes into cells of live organisms to cure genetic disorders * Metabolic engineering - Modifying metabolism of organisms to optimize production of chemicals (e.g. synthetic genomics) * Protein engineering - Altering structure of existing proteins to enable specific new functions, or the creation of fully artificial proteins *DNA-functionalized materials - 3D assemblies of DNA-conjugated nanoparticle lattices  Techniques and instruments used  Molecular engineers utilize sophisticated tools and instruments to make and analyze the interactions of molecules and the surfaces of materials at the molecular and nano-scale. The complexity of molecules being introduced at the surface is increasing, and the techniques used to analyze surface characteristics at the molecular level are ever-changing and improving.

The show lasts a week, usually beginning on the Monday of the last full week in July. During the gathering, the airport's control tower, frequency 118.5, is the busiest in the world.\\"EAA AirVenture takes flight for the future\\" , Milwaukee Journal Sentinel  History  F-86 Sabre (top), A-10 Thunderbolt II (mid), and P-51D Mustang (bottom) performing at Oshkosh in 2009 EAA was founded in Hales Corners, Wisconsin in 1953 by Paul Poberezny, who originally started the organization in the basement of his home for builders and restorers of recreational aircraft. Although homebuilding is still a large part of the organization's activities, it has grown to include almost every aspect of recreational, commercial and military aviation, as well as aeronautics and astronautics. The first EAA fly-in was held in September 1953 at what is now Timmerman Field as a small part of the Milwaukee Air Pageant, fewer than 150 people registered as visitors the first year and only a handful of airplanes attended the event. In 1959, the EAA fly-in grew too large for the Air Pageant and moved to Rockford, Illinois. In 1970, when it outgrew its facilities at the Rockford airport, it moved to Oshkosh, Wisconsin. For many years the official name of the event was The EAA Annual Convention and Fly-In. In 1998, the name was changed to AirVenture Oshkosh, but many regular attendees still call it as The Oshkosh Airshow or just Oshkosh. For many years, access to the flight line was restricted to EAA members. In 1997, the fee structure for the show was changed allowing all visitors access to the entire grounds. EAA AirVenture holds nearly 1,000 forums and workshops, in addition to their many vendors which bring a variety of aircraft supplies, general merchandise, and name brand sponsors such as Ford, Honda, Bose, John Deere, and more located in the Fly Mart. On May 1, 2020, the EAA announced that the 2020 AirVenture convention and air show would be canceled due to the COVID-19 pandemic. =Historical aircraft debuts= Christen Eagle II at AirVenture 2013 AirVenture has hosted the debut of numerous revolutionary designs. Richard VanGrunsven debuted his Van's RV-3 at the 1972 AirVenture Oshkosh, a homebuilt that defined new ways of aircraft performance. VanGrunsven would eventually go on to build more homebuilts than anyone else in the world, exceeding the annual production of all commercial general aviation companies combined. In 1975, aircraft designer Burt Rutan introduced his VariEze canard aircraft at Oshkosh, pioneering the use of moldless glass- reinforced plastic construction in homebuilts, a technique that several aircraft went on to adopt in the ensuing years including composite commercial airliners. At the 1987 AirVenture, Cirrus Aircraft's founders, the Klapmeier brothers, unveiled the Cirrus VK-30 kit aircraft, which later led to the creation of the successful SR20 and SR22, the first designs to incorporate all-composite fiberglass construction, glass-panel cockpits and airframe ballistic parachutes for use in manufactured light aircraft. Other past notable designs introduced at AirVenture include Frank Christensen's Christen Eagle II aerobatic kit biplane in 1978, Tom Hamilton's Glasair 1 in 1980, and Lance Nebeur's Lancair 200 in 1985. Attendance Aeroshell Aerobatic Team performing at EAA AirVenture 2007 Commercial display at 2011 airshow The EAA estimated the attendance in 2018 at over 600,000, with 2,714 visitors registered from 87 nations. There were approximately 10,000 aircraft, 2,979 show planes, and 976 media representatives on-site from six continents, along with 867 commercial exhibitors. In the past, attendance at the event was tabulated on daily basis rather than an individual basis. It is unclear whether this practice still exists at EAA Airventure. For example, in 2006 the Oshkosh Northwestern reported that attendance was estimated at 625,000 by the EAA. The estimate was for total attendees each day, so one person attending 7 days would count as 7 attendees. The paper estimated that between 200,000 and 300,000 individuals attended the event. The large number of aircraft arrivals and departures during the fly-in week makes the Wittman Field FAA control tower the busiest in the world for that week in number of movements. To accommodate the huge flow of aircraft around the airport and the nearby airspace, a special NOTAM is published each year, choreographing the normal and emergency procedures to follow. More than 4,000 volunteers contribute approximately 250,000 hours before, during and after the event. The F-35 Lightning II at EAA AirVenture Oshkosh 2019 alt=Viking Air Canadair CL-415EAF at EAA AirVenture Oshkosh 2019 Economic impact The EAA AirVenture fly-in has a large economic impact to the Oshkosh area as well as the state of Wisconsin. In 1982, the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel reported that the fly-in had a large economic benefit to the Fox Valley region. At the time EAA estimated the benefit to be around $30 million ($ in ) and the Oshkosh Convention and Tourism bureau estimated it to be lower, at $21 million ($ in ). In 1989, the Oshkosh Chamber of Commerce said that Winnebago County had a $47 million benefit from the fly in. Additionally, a 1987 UW-Oshkosh study reported a $65 million ($ in ) benefit to the entire state of Wisconsin. In 2008, a UW-Oshkosh Center for Community Partnerships study showed a $110 million economic impact for the Oshkosh area. Of that, $84 million was direct impact with a $26 million multiplier from secondary spending. Additionally, the fly in provided 1,700 jobs and $39 million in labor income for Winnebago, Outagamie, and Fond du Lac counties. Air-traffic operation FAA tower team in pink remotely managing departures in 2011 Control tower decorated with banner proclaiming \\"World's Busiest Control Tower\\" In 1961, The Rockford EAA airshow had 10,000 aircraft movements. In 1971, the EAA airshow at Oshkosh brought in 600 planes and 31,653 movements. Today AirVenture brings in more than 10,000 airplanes. Special air traffic procedures are used to ensure safe, coordinated operations. For example, in 2014 the special flight procedures NOTAM was 32 pages long. FAA air traffic staff, including controllers, supervisors, and managers, compete throughout the FAA's 17-state Central Terminal Service Area to work the event. In 2008, 172 air traffic professionals representing 56 facilities volunteered to staff the facilities at Oshkosh (OSH), Fond du Lac (FLD), and Fisk. They wear bright pink shirts to stand out in the crowd. Due to the budget sequestration in 2013, the Federal Aviation Administration announced that it was not able to send resources to support the AirVenture. Rather than cancelling the event, the Experimental Aircraft Association was forced to sign a $447,000 contract to repay the government for FAA resources during the AirVenture. EAA filed a petition in Federal court arguing that the FAA could not withhold services without specific Congressional action. However, in March 2014 EAA signed a settlement agreement agreeing to pay the 2013 costs and a further agreement that guaranteed FAA participation for another nine years. The agreement required the association to reimburse the government for AirVenture specific costs that had been provided at government expense in the years prior to 2013. =Host airports= * Wittman Regional Airport (OSH): Airplanes * Pioneer Airport (WS17): Helicopters & airships *Ultralight Fun Fly Zone: Ultralights, homebuilt rotorcraft, hot air balloons * Vette/Blust Seaplane Base (96WI): Seaplanes * Fond du Lac County Airport (FLD): Diversion airport, additional parking * Appleton International Airport (ATW): Diversion airport, additional parking, U.S. Customs and Border Protection processing * Planeacres Airport (2WN7): Emergency diversion airport (Fisk approach) EAA AirVenture Oshkosh NOTAM (2019) =Technical operations= Several days prior to the event, members of the FAA's Technical Operation team from around the Central Service Area arrive in Oshkosh to set up the temporary communication facilities (mobile communication platforms, Fisk VFR approach control and Fond du Lac (FLD) tower). These technicians maintain the facilities during the event and tear down and store the equipment after AirVenture ends. Volunteering EAA AirVenture relies heavily on volunteers who arrive in the weeks leading up to the air show. The tasks they perform range from parking cars and airplanes, to painting buildings, to helping set up and tear down concerts and shows presented by the EAA. Long-time volunteers receive free meals, tee-shirts, embroidered patches, and free admission into the EAA AirVenture event. National Blue Beret National Blue Beret (NBB) is a National Cadet Special Activity in the Civil Air Patrol. The event is two weeks long and is set up so that the second week will overlap with the AirVenture airshow. Participants are Civil Air Patrol cadet and senior members who must go through a competitive selection process in order to attend the event. Participants help conduct event operations, including flight marshaling, crowd control, and emergency services.

Though an incremental improvement of the Me 210, it had a new wing plan, longer fuselage and engines of greater power. The changes were significant enough for the aircraft to be renamed the Me 410. Design and development Development of the Me 210 had been underway since 1939 but the aircraft proved unstable and was never considered for full-scale production. Modifications to the layout produced the Me 210C and 210D, which proved somewhat superior. As studies progressed on the Me 210D, and with a separate parallel attempt to improve upon the 210 with the Messerschmitt Me 310 in the second half of 1943 ‚Äî which provided almost no aerodynamic improvement over the 210's risky handling qualities ‚Äî it was instead decided to introduce a new model, the Me 410. The major change between the Me 210 and 410 was the introduction of the larger (at 44.5 litre, 2,715 in3 displacement) and more powerful Daimler-Benz DB 603A engines, which increased power to 1,750 PS (1,730 hp, 1,290 kW) compared to the 1,475 PS DB 605s used on the Me 210C - the interim Me 310 design experiment actually used the DB 603 powerplant choice first. The engine performance increased the Me 410's maximum speed to 625 km/h (388 mph), greatly improved rate of climb, service ceiling, and most notably the cruising speed which jumped to 579 km/h (360 mph). It also improved payload capability to the point where the aircraft could lift more war load than could fit into the bomb bay under the nose. To address this, shackles were added under the wings for four 50 kg (110 lb) bombs. The changes added an extra 680 kg (1,500 lb) to the Me 210 design, but the extra engine power more than made up for the difference. As with the Me 210, the 410's rear gunner used the same pair of Ferngerichtete Drehringseitenlafette FDSL 131/1B turrets mounted on each side of the aircraft, each still armed with a 13 mm (.51 in) MG 131 machine guns, retaining the same pivoting handgun-style grip, trigger and gunsight to aim and fire the ordnance as the 210 did. Basic side-by-side comparison of the Me 210 and Me 410 wing planforms The new version included a lengthened fuselage and new, automatic leading edge slats, both of which had been tested on Me 210s and were found to dramatically improve handling. The slats had originally been featured on the earliest Me 210 models, but had been removed on production models due to poor handling. When entering a steep turn, the slats had a tendency to open due to the high angle of attack, analogous to the opening of the slats during the landing approach. (This problem was first observed on the Bf 109V14 and V15 prototypes for the Bf 109E), which added to the problems keeping the aircraft flying smoothly. However, when the problems with the general lateral instability were addressed, this was no longer a real problem. The wing panels of the earlier Me 210 had been designed with a planform geometry that placed the aerodynamic center in a rearwards direction in comparison to the earlier Bf 110, giving the outer sections of the wing planform beyond each engine nacelle a slightly greater, 12.6¬∞ leading edge sweepback angle than the inner panels' 6.0¬∞ leading edge sweep angle. This resulted in unreasonable handling characteristics in flight for the original Me 210 design. The new Me 410 outer wing panels had their planform geometry revised to bring the aerodynamic center further forwards in comparison to the Me 210, thus making the leading edge sweepback of the outer panels identical to the inner wing panels with both having identical 5.5¬∞ sweepback angles, which improved handling. Deliveries began in January 1943, two years late and continued until September 1944, by which point a total of 1,160 of all versions had been produced by Messerschmitt Augsburg and Dornier M√ºnchen. When it arrived, it was liked by its crews, even though its improved performance was not enough to protect it from the swarms of high performance Allied fighters they faced at this stage of the war. Operational history An Me 410A-1/U4 with a BK 5 cannon peels off during attack on USAAF B-17s 4./KG 51, shot down June 6th, 1944 The Me 410 night bomber proved to be an elusive target for the RAF night fighters. The first unit to operate over the UK was V./KG 2, which lost its first Me 410 on the night of 13‚Äì14 July 1943, when it was shot down by a de Havilland Mosquito of No. 85 Squadron RAF. The Me 410 was also used as a bomber destroyer against the daylight bomber formations of the USAAF, upgraded with Umr√ºst-Baus√§tze factory conversion kits, all bearing a /U suffix, for the design ‚Äî these suffixes could vary in meaning between subtypes. As one example, the earlier Me 410 A-1/U1 designation signified a camera-fitting in the under-nose ordnance bay for reconnaissance use (as the A-3 was meant to do from its start), while the same /U1 designation or the later Me 410 B-2 signified a mount of a pair of the long barreled, 30mm calibre MK 103 cannon in the undernose ordnance bay. The /U2 suffix designated a fitment of two additional 20 mm MG 151/20 cannons in the under-nose ordnance bay instead ‚Äî the A-1/U4 subtype fitted the massive, 540 kg (1,190 lb) weight Bordkanone series 50 mm (2 in) BK 5 cannon, loaded with 21 rounds in the same undernose ordnance bay in place of either the /U1's cameras or MK 103s, or the /U2's added pair of MG 151/20 autocannon. For breaking up the bomber formations, many Me 410s also had four underwing tubular launchers, two per wing panel, firing converted 21 cm (8 in) Werfer-Granate 21 infantry barrage rockets. Two Geschwader, Zerst√∂rergeschwader 26 and 76, were thus equipped with the Me 410 by late 1943. They were moderately successful against unescorted bombers through 1943, with a considerable number of kills against USAAF day bomber formations being achieved. However, the Me 410 was no match in a dogfight with the lighter Allied single-engine fighters such as the North American P-51 Mustang and Supermarine Spitfire. In early 1944, the Me 410 formations encountered swarms of Allied fighters protecting the bomber streams, usually flying far ahead of the combat box formations as an air supremacy move in clearing the skies of any Luftwaffe opposition, resulting in the Me 410's previous successes against escorted bombers now often being offset by their losses. An example of this ‚Äî as part of a campaign started two days earlier by the USAAF ‚Äî was on 6 March 1944 during an attack on Berlin by 750 8th AF heavy bombers, when 16 Me 410s were shot down in return for eight B-17s and four P-51s (which were destroyed by Bf 109 and Fw 190 fighters escorting the Me 410s). The following month on 11 April, with 8th AF raids hitting Sorau, Rostock and Oschersleben, II./ZG 26's Me 410s accounted for a rare clear success, initially bringing down 10 B-17s without any losses. During the course of the same raid, their second sortie was intercepted by P-51s that destroyed eight Me 410s and three Bf 110s. Sixteen crewmen were killed and three wounded. From mid-1944, despite being Hitler's favourite bomber destroyer, the Me 410 units were taken from Defence of the Reich duties and production was phased out in favour of heavily armed single-engine fighters as dedicated bomber destroyers, with the Me 410s remaining in service flying on reconnaissance duties only. Some Me 410s were used with Junkers Ju 188s during the Battle of Normandy, for high-altitude night reconnaissance. Variants The basic A-series aircraft were armed with two 7.92 mm (.312 in) MG 17 machine guns and two 20 mm MG 151/20 cannons in the nose and delivered as the Me 410 A-1 light bomber. The originally planned Me 410 A-2 heavy fighter was cancelled because the dual 30 mm (1.18 in) MK 103 cannon mount, also available for the later Me 410B-2 subtype as the aforementioned Umr√ºst- Bausatz /U1 factory ordnance upgrade available by 1944, was not ready in time. The Me 410A featured a bomb bay for carrying air-to-ground ordnance or for the installation of additional air-to-air weaponry or other equipment. Initially, three Umr√ºst-Baus√§tze (factory conversion kits) were available: U1 which contained a palette of cameras for the photo-reconnaissance role, U2 with two 20 mm MG 151/20 cannon with 250 rpg for the heavy fighter use, and U4 which used the 50 mm (2 in) Bordkanone series weapon, the BK-5 cannon with 22 rounds (21 rounds to load and 1 extra round already loaded into the cannon), to turn either an Me 410A or B-series aircraft into a dedicated bomber destroyer. The BK 5 cannon - derived from the Panzer III tank's main armament, the 50 mm (2 in) KwK 39 L/60 - allowed the Me 410s to shoot at their targets from over 914 m (1,000 yd), a distance at which the bombers' defensive armament, usually consisting of the \\"light-barrel\\", .50 calibre AN/M2 aviation version of the M2 Browning machine guns, was useless. Frequent problems with jamming and limited ammunition supply, together with the extra 540 kg (1,200 lb) weight of the large-calibre gun under the nose, made the other anti-bomber versions of Me 410, especially those with extra 20 mm MG 151/20s, much more useful. The dedicated reconnaissance version Me 410 A-3 received a deeper fuselage for additional cameras and fuel. The Me 410 A-3 entered service in small numbers in early 1944, and equipped three long-range reconnaissance Aufkl√§rungsstaffel reconnaissance squadrons, usually assembled with other recon squadrons as parts of larger, three or four-squadron Fernaufkl√§rungsgruppen (one Gruppe on the Western Front and the other two on the Eastern Front). The Me 410B-series was largely the same as the A-series, but replaced the pair of 7.92 mm (.312 in) MG 17s with a pair of the harder-hitting 13 mm (.51 in) MG 131 machine guns. The originally planned 1,900 hp (1,400 kW) DB 603G engine had been cancelled in early 1944, so all Me 410Bs used DB 603A or DB 603AA engines. The DB 603G would have increased the maximum speed to 630 km/h (392 mph), and cruising speed to 595 km/h (370 mph), although the weight increased once again. The versions were the same as with the A-series, the Me 410 B-1, and Me 410 B-3 filling the same roles as the earlier A-1, and A-3 versions, also with the options of using the same Umr√ºst-Baus√§tze factory conversion kits as the A-series aircraft used. Several experimental models were also developed. The Me 410 B-5 added shackles under the fuselage to carry a torpedo, and removed the MG 131s in the nose to make room for the FuG 200 Hohentwiel 550 MHz UHF- band maritime patrol radar. The bomb bay was not used in this version in order to make room for a 650 L (170 US gal) fuel tank, and the rearward-firing remote turrets were replaced by another 700 L (180 US gal) fuel tank for long- range missions. The Me 410 B-6 was a similar anti-shipping conversion, but intended for the short-range coastal defence role only. For this mission, it did not use a torpedo, and was instead a simple modification of the B-1 with the FuG 200 radar. The Me 410 B-7/B-8 were updated B-3 reconnaissance models that were only built as prototypes. The Me 410C was a high-altitude version drawn up in early 1944, with two new wing designs that increased span to 18.25 m (60 ft) or 20.45 m (67 ft). The larger wings allowed the gear to retract directly to the rear. A new universal engine mount would allow for the use of any of the DB 603JZ or BMW 801J turbocharged engines or the Jumo 213E two- stage mechanically supercharged engines, driving a new four-blade propeller with very wide blades. The BMW 801 radials were air-cooled and the DB 603 and Jumo 213 used an annular radiator, all housed as unitized Kraftei (power-egg) engine \\"modules\\" onto an airframe for ease of installation and field maintenance, so the normal under-wing radiators were removed. None were ever built, as Me 410 production was canceled before the engines matured. The Me 410D was a simpler upgrade to the B-series to improve altitude performance, but not to the same degree as the C-series. It would be powered by the DB 603JZ engines, and had a revised forward fuselage to increase the field of view of the pilot and reduce drag. It also replaced portions of the outer wing panels with ones made of wood to conserve strategic materials. Several were built, but like many other attempts at wood construction by the German aviation industry late in World War II, the loss of the Goldschmitt Tego film factory in Wuppertal, in a Royal Air Force nighttime bombing raid, meant the acidic replacement adhesives available were too corrosive to the materials being bonded, and the wooden portions tended to fail. Production was eventually cancelled to concentrate on Bf 109Gs in August 1944, after 1,160 Me 410s had been built, the month after the J√§gernotprogramm had gone into effect.

He lived in the 1st century BC, taught in Alexandria and flourished shortly after the life of Cicero. Photius saysA. A. Long,D. N. Sedley, The Hellenistic Philosophers, 1987, p 469. he was a member of Plato's Academy, but he came to dispute their theories, adopting Pyrrhonism instead. Diogenes La√´rtius claims an unbroken lineage of teachers of Pyrrhonism through Aenesidemus, with his teacher being Heraclides and his student being Zeuxippus.Diogenes Laertius, Lives of Eminent Philosophers \\"Life of Timon of Phlius\\" Book IX Chapter 12 Section 116 However, little is known about several of the names between Timon of Phlius and Aenesidemus, so this lineage is suspect. Whether Aenesidemus re-founded the Pyrrhonist school or merely revitalized it is unknown.  Life  There is no definite evidence about the life of Aenesidemus, but his most important work, the Pyrrhonian Discourses was known to be dedicated to Lucius Aelius Tubero, a friend of Cicero and member of Plato's Academy whom Photius described as a colleague. Based on this information, scholars have assumed that Aenesidemus himself was also a member of the Academy. Furthermore, it has been assumed that he took part under the leadership of Philo of Larissa and probably adopted Pyrrhonism either in reaction to Antiochus of Ascalon introduction of Stoic and Peripatetic dogma into the Academy or Philo's acceptance of provisional beliefs. What little we know of Aenesidemus is by way of Photius (in his Myriobiblion), Sextus Empiricus, and also to a lesser extent by Diogenes La√´rtius and Philo of Alexandria.  Pyrrhonian Discourses  His chief work, known in Ancient Greek as Pyrrhoneioi logoi (Œ†œÖœÅœÅœéŒΩŒµŒπŒøŒπ Œª√≥Œ≥ŒøŒπ) and often rendered into English as the Pyrrhonian Discourses or Pyrrhonian Principles, dealt primarily with man's need to suspend judgment due to our epistemological limitations. It was divided into eight books, but it has not survived. We have this summary of its contents from Photius (in his Myriobiblion). > I read Aenesidemus' eight Pyrrhonist Discourses. The overall aim of the book > is to establish that there is no firm basis for cognition, either through > sense-perception, or indeed through thought. Consequently, he says, neither > the Pyrrhonists nor the others know the truth in things; but the > philosophers of other persuasions, as well as being ignorant in general, and > wearing themselves out uselessly and expending themselves in ceaseless > torments, are also ignorant of the very fact that they have cognition of > none of the things of which they think that they have gained cognition. But > he who philosophizes after the fashion of Pyrrho is happy not only in > general but also, and especially, in the wisdom of knowing that he has firm > cognition of nothing. And even with regard to what he knows, he has the > propriety to assent no more to its affirmation than to its denial. The whole > scheme of the book is directed towards the purpose I have mentioned. In > writing the discourses Aenesidemus addresses them to Lucius Tubero, one of > his colleagues from the Academy, a Roman by birth, with an illustrious > ancestry and a distinguished political career. In the first discourse he > differentiates between the Pyrrhonists and the Academics in almost precisely > the following words. He says that the Academics are doctrinaire: they posit > some things with confidence and unambiguously deny others. The Pyrrhonists, > on the other hand, are aporetic and free of all doctrine. Not one of them > has said either that all things are incognitive, or that they are cognitive, > but that they are no more of this kind than of that, or that they are > sometimes of this kind, sometimes not, or that for one person they are of > this kind, for another person not of this kind, and for another person not > even existent at all. Nor do they say that all things in general, or some > things, are accessible to us, or not accessible to us, but that they are no > more accessible to us than not, or that they are sometimes accessible to us, > sometimes not, or that they are accessible to one person but not to another. > Nor indeed, do they say there is true or false, convincing or unconvincing, > existent or non-existent. But the same thing is, it might be said, no more > true than false, convincing than unconvincing, or existent or non-existent; > or sometimes the one, sometimes the other; or of such a kind for one person > but not for another. For the Pyrrhonist determines absolutely nothing, not > even this very claim that nothing is determined. (We put it this way, he > says, for lack of a way to express the thought.) But the Academics, he says, > especially those from the present-day Academy, are sometimes in agreement > with Stoic beliefs, and to tell the truth turn out to be Stoics fighting > with Stoics. Moreover, they are doctrinaire about many things. For they > introduce virtue and folly, and posit good and bad, truth and falsity, > convincing and unconvincing, existent and non-existent. They give firm > determinations for many other things too. It is only about the cognitive > impression that they express dissent. Thus the followers of Pyrrho, in > determining nothing, remain absolutely above reproach, whereas the > Academics, he says, incur a scrutiny similar to that faced by the other > philosophers. Above all, the Pyrrhonists, by entertaining doubts about every > thesis, maintain consistency and do not conflict with themselves, whereas > the Academics are unaware that they are conflicting with themselves. For to > make unambiguous assertions and denials, at the same time as stating as a > generalization that no things are cognitive, introduces an undeniable > conflict: how is it possible to recognize that this is true, this false, yet > still entertain perplexity and doubt, and not make a clear choice of the one > and avoidance of the other? For if it is not known that this is good or bad, > or that this is true but that false, and this existent but that non- > existent, it must certainly be admitted that each of them is incognitive. > But if they receive self-evident cognition by means of sense-perception or > thought, we must say that each is cognitive. These similar considerations > are set out by Aenesidemus of Aegae at the beginning of his discourses, to > indicate the difference between the Pyrrhonists and Academics. He goes on in > the same discourse, the first, also to report in summary outline the entire > way of life of the Pyrrhonists.  The ten modes of Aenesidemus  Aenesidemus is considered the creator of the ten modes of Aenesidemus (also known as ten tropes of Aenesidemus)‚Äîalthough whether he invented the tropes or just systematized them from prior Pyrrhonist works is unknown. The tropes represent reasons for epoch√© (suspension of judgment). These are as follows: # Different animals manifest different modes of perception; # Similar differences are seen among individual men; # For the same man, information perceived with the senses is self-contradictory # Furthermore, it varies from time to time with physical changes # In addition, this data differs according to local relations # Objects are known only indirectly through the medium of air, moisture, etc. # These objects are in a condition of perpetual change in colour, temperature, size and motion # All perceptions are relative and interact one upon another # Our impressions become less critical through repetition and custom # All men are brought up with different beliefs, under different laws and social conditions In other words, Aenesidemus argues that experience varies infinitely under circumstances whose importance to one another cannot be accurately judged by human observers. He therefore rejects any concept of absolute knowledge of reality, since every each person has different perceptions, and they arrange their sense-gathered data in methods peculiar to themselves.  Heraclitean view  Either in the Pyrrhonian Discourses or some other work that did not survive, Aenesidemus assimilated the theories of Heraclitus, as is discussed in the Outlines of Pyrrhonism of Sextus Empiricus. For admitting that contraries co-exist for the perceiving subject, he was able to assert the co-existence of contrary qualities in the same object. Below, Burnet discusses Sextus Empiricus' reproduction of Aenesidemus account of the theories of Heraclitus. The embedded quote from Ritter and Preller (1898) Historia Philosophiae Graecae (in italics) is Burnet's translation of Ritter and Preller's Greek. > \\"The locus classicus on this is a passage of Sextus Empiricus, which > reproduces the account given by Ainesidemos. It is as follows (Ritter and > Preller (1898) Historia Philosophiae Graecae section 41): \\"The natural > philosopher is of opinion that what surrounds us is rational and endowed > with consciousness.

Following Hegel's theory of dialectic, Baur argued that second century Christianity represented the synthesis of two opposing theses: Jewish Christianity (Petrine Christianity) and Gentile Christianity (Pauline Christianity). This and the rest of Baur's work had a profound impact upon higher criticism of biblical and related texts. Adolf Hilgenfeld followed Baur's lead and edited the T√ºbingen School's journal, though he was less radical than Baur.\\"Hilgenfeld, Adolf\\" and \\"T√ºbingen School.\\" Cross, F. L., ed.

The Oxford dictionary of the Christian church. New York: Oxford University Press. 2005 Baur's views were revolutionary, but \\"one thing is certain: New Testament study, since his time, has had a different colour\\" (H.S. Nash). He had a number of followers, who in many cases modified his positions, and the groundwork laid by Baur continues to be built upon in the twenty-first century. Early years Baur was born at Schmiden, near Cannstatt. After training at the theological seminary of Blaubeuren, he went in 1809 to the University of T√ºbingen. Here he studied for a time under Ernst Bengel, grandson of the eminent New Testament critic, Johann Albrecht Bengel, and at this early stage in his career he seems to have been under the influence of the old T√ºbingen School. But at the same time the philosophers Johann Gottlieb Fichte and Friedrich Schelling were creating a wide and deep impression. In 1817 Baur returned to the theological seminary at Blaubeuren as professor. This move marked a turning-point in his life, for he now set to work on the investigations on which his reputation rests. He had already, in 1817, written a review of G. Kaiser's Biblische Theologie for Bengel's Archiv f√ºr Theologie (ii. 656); its tone was moderate and conservative. Early works When, a few years after his appointment at Blaubeuren, he published his first important work, Symbolik und Mythologie oder die Naturreligion des Altertums (\\"Symbol and mythology: the natural religion of Antiquity\\", 1824‚Äì1825), it became evident that he had made a deeper study of philosophy, and had come under the influence of Schelling and more particularly of Friedrich Schleiermacher. The learning of the work was fully recognized, and in 1826 the author was called to T√ºbingen as professor of theology. It is with T√ºbingen that his greatest literary achievements are associated. His earlier publications here treated of mythology and the history of dogma. Das manich√§ische Religionssystem (\\"The Manichaean religious system\\") appeared in 1831, Apollonius von Tyana in 1832, Die christliche Gnosis (\\"Christian Gnosis\\") in 1835, and √úber das Christliche im Platonismus oder Socrates und Christus (\\"On Christianity in Platonism: Socrates and Christ\\") in 1837. As Otto Pfleiderer (Pflederer 1890 p. 285) observes, \\"the choice not less than the treatment of these subjects is indicative of the large breadth of view and the insight of the historian into the comparative history of religion.\\" Simon Magus and Paul Ferdinand Christian Baur Baur rested his ideas about the New Testament on the Clementines, and his ideas about the Clementines on St. Epiphanius, who found the writings used by an Ebionite sect in the 4th century. This Judeo-Christian sect at that date rejected St. Paul as an apostate. It was assumed that this 4th century opinion represented the Christianity of the Twelve Apostles; Paulinism was originally a heresy, and a schism from the Jewish Christianity of James and Peter and the rest; Marcion was a leader of the Pauline sect in its survival in the 2nd century, using only the Pauline Gospel, St. Luke (in its original form), and the Epistles of St. Paul (without the Pastoral Epistles). The Clementine literature had its first origin in the Apostolic Age, and belonged to the original Jewish, Petrine, legal Church. It is directed wholly against St. Paul and his sect. Simon Magus never existed; it is a nickname for St. Paul. The Acts of the Apostles, compiled in the 2nd century, have borrowed their mention of Simon from the earliest form of the Clementines. Catholicism under the presidency of Rome was the result of the adjustment between the Petrine and Pauline sections of the Church in the second half of the 2nd century. The Fourth Gospel is a monument of this reconciliation, in which Rome took a leading part, having invented the fiction that both Peter and Paul were the founders of her Church, both having been martyred at Rome, and on the same day, in perfect union. Throughout the middle of the 19th century this theory, in many forms, was dominant in Germany. The demonstration, mainly by English scholars, of the impossibility of the late dates ascribed to the New Testament documents (four Epistles of St. Paul and the Apocalypse were the only documents generally admitted as being of early date), and the proofs of the authenticity of the Apostolic Fathers and of the use of St. John's Gospel by Justin, Papias, and Ignatius, gradually brought Baur's theories into discredit. Of the original school, Adolf Hilgenfeld may be considered the last survivor (died 1907). He was induced to admit that Simon Magus was a real personage, though he persisted that in the Clementines he is meant for St. Paul. In 1847 Hilgenfeld dated the original nucleus of the Clementine literature (Kerygmata Petrou) soon after the Jewish war of 70; successive revisions of it were anti- Basilidian, anti-Valentinian, and anti-Marcionite respectively. Baur placed the completed form, ‚Äò‚ÄòH‚Äô‚Äô, soon after the middle of the 2nd century, and Schliemann (1844) agreed, placing ‚Äò‚ÄòR‚Äô‚Äô, as a revision, between 211 and 230. Other writers dated both ‚Äò‚ÄòH‚Äô‚Äô and ‚Äò‚ÄòR‚Äô‚Äô to between the 2nd and 4th centuries: * R. 2nd century: Sixtus Senensis (Sixtus of Siena) (1520-1569), David Blondel (David Blondellus Catalaunensis) (1590-1655), Jean-Baptiste Cotelier (1629-1686), William Cave (1637-1713), Casimir Oudin (1638-1717), No√´l Alexandre (Natalis Alexander) (1639-1724), Denis-Nicolas Le Nourry (Nourri) (1647-1724), Johann Georg Heinsius (d. 1733), Ernst Friedrich Karl Rosenm√ºller (1768-1835), Christian Wilhelm Fl√ºgge (1773-1828), Karl Gottlieb Bretschneider (1776-1848), Johann Georg Veit Engelhardt (1791-1855), Johann Karl Ludwig Gieseler (1792-1854), Friedrich August Gottreu Tholuck (1799-1877), and August Friedrich Gfr√∂rer (1803-1861). * R. 2nd or 3rd century: Schr√∂ck, Stark, Lumper, Krabbe, Locherer, Gersdorf. * R. 3rd century: Strunzius (on Bardesanes, 1710), Weismann (17l8), Mosheim, Kleuker, Schmidt (Kirchengesch.) * R. 4th century: Corrodi, Lentz (Dogmengesch.). * H. 2nd century (beginning): Credner, Bretschneider, Kern, Rothe. * H. 2nd century: Clericus, Beausobre, Fl√ºgge, M√ºnscher, Hoffmann, D√∂llinger, Hilgers; (middle of 2nd) Hase. * H. end of 2nd century: Schr√∂ck, C√∂lln, Gieseler (3rd ed.), Schenkel, Gfr√∂rer, L√ºcke. * H. 3rd century: Mill, Mosheim, Gallandi, Gieseler (2nd ed.). * H. 2nd or 3rd century: Neander, Krabbe, Baur, Ritter, Paniel, D√§hne. * H. 4th century: Lentz. Hegel's influence Meantime Baur had exchanged one master in philosophy for another, Schleiermacher for Hegel. In doing so, he had adopted completely the Hegelian philosophy of history. \\"Without philosophy,\\" he has said, \\"history is always for me dead and dumb.\\" The change of view is illustrated clearly in the essay, published in the T√ºbinger Zeitschrift for 1831, on the Christ-party in the Corinthian Church, Die Christuspartei in der korinthischen Gemeinde, der Gegensatz des paulinischen und petrinischen Christentums in der √§ltesten Kirche, der Apostel Petrus in Rom, the trend of which is suggested by the title (in English, 'The Christ Party in the Corinthian Community, the Opposition of Pauline and Petrine Christianity in the earliest Church, the apostle Peter in Rome'). Baur contends that the apostle Paul was opposed in Corinth by a Jewish Christian party that wished to set up its own form of Christian religion instead of his universal Christianity. He found traces of a keen conflict of parties in the post- apostolic age, which have passed into the mainstream of Early Christian historiography. Pauline epistles The theory is further developed in a later work (1835, the year in which David Strauss' Leben Jesu was published), √úber die sogenannten Pastoralbriefe. In this Baur attempts to prove that the false teachers mentioned in the Second Epistle to Timothy and Epistle to Titus are the Gnostics, particularly the Marcionites, of the 2nd century, and consequently that the Pastoral Epistles were produced in the middle of the 2nd century in opposition to Gnosticism. He next proceeded to investigate other Pauline epistles and the Acts of the Apostles in the same manner, publishing his results in 1845 under the title Paulus, der Apostel Jesu Christi, sein Leben und Wirken, seine Briefe und seine Lehre. In this he contends that only the Epistle to the Galatians, First and Second Epistle to the Corinthians and Epistle to the Romans are genuinely Pauline, and that the Paul of the Acts of the Apostles is a different person from the Paul of these genuine Epistles, the author being a Paulinist who, with an eye to the different parties in the Church, is at pains to represent Peter as far as possible as a Paulinist and Paul as far as possible as a Petrinist. Early Christian conflicts Baur was prepared to apply his theory to the whole of the New Testament; in the words of H. S. Nash, \\"he carried a sweeping hypothesis into the examination of the New Testament.\\" He considers those writings alone genuine in which the conflict between Jewish-Christians and Gentile-Christians is clearly marked. In his Kritische Untersuchungen √ºber die kanonischen Evangelien, ihr Verh√§ltniss zu einander, ihren Charakter und Ursprung (1847) he turns his attention to the Gospels, and here again finds that the authors were conscious of the conflict of parties; the Gospels reveal a mediating or conciliatory tendency (Tendenz) on the part of the writers or redactors. The Gospels, in fact, are adaptations or redactions of an older Gospel, such as the Gospel of the Hebrews, of Peter, of the Egyptians, or of the Ebionites. The Petrine Matthew bears the closest relationship to this original Gospel (Urevangelium); the Pauline Luke is later and arose independently; Mark represents a still later development according to Baur; the account in John is idealistic: it \\"does not possess historical truth, and cannot and does not really lay claim to it.\\" Baur's theory starts with the supposition that Christianity was gradually developed out of Judaism, see also List of events in early Christianity. Before it could become a universal religion, it had to struggle with Jewish limitations and to overcome them. The early Christians were Jewish-Christians, to whom Jesus was the Messiah. Paul, on the other hand, represented a breach with Judaism, the Temple, and the Law. Thus there was some antagonism between the Jewish apostles Peter, James and John, and Paul the \\"Apostle to the Gentiles\\", and this struggle continued down to the middle of the 2nd century. In short, the conflict between Petrinism and Paulinism is, as Karl Schwarz puts it, the key to the literature of the 1st and 2nd century. Theology Baur was a theologian and historian as well as a Biblical critic. As early as 1834 he published a strictly theological work, Gegensatz des Katholicismus und Protestantismus nach den Prinzipien und Hauptdogmen der beiden Lehrbegriffe, a strong defence of Protestantism on the lines of Schleiermacher's Glaubenslehre, and a vigorous reply to J. M√∂hler's Symbolik (1833). This was followed by his larger histories of dogma, Die christliche Lehre von der Vers√∂hnung in ihrer geschichtlichen Entwicklung bis auf die neueste Zeit (1838), Die christliche Lehre von der Dreieinigkeit und Menschwerdung Gottes in ihrer geschichtlichen Entwicklung (3 vols., 1841‚Äì1843), and the Lehrbuch der christlichen Dogmengeschichte (1847). The value of these works is impaired somewhat by Baur's habit of making the history of dogma conform to the formulae of Hegel's philosophy, a procedure \\"which only served to obscure the truth and profundity of his conception of history as a true development of the human mind\\" (Pfleiderer). Baur, however, soon came to attach more importance to personality, and to distinguish more carefully between religion and philosophy. The change is noticeable in his Epochen der kirchlichen Geschichtschreibung (1852), Das Christenthum und die christiche Kirche der drei ersten Jahrhunderte (1853), and Die christliche Kirche von Anfang des vierten bis zum Ende das sechsten Jahrhunderts (1859), works preparatory to his Kirchengeschichte, in which the change of view is specially pronounced. Death and posthumous publication Baur died, aged 68, in T√ºbingen. The Kirchengeschichte was published in five volumes during the years 1853-1863, partly by Baur himself, partly by his son, Ferdinand Baur, and his son-in-law, Eduard Zeller, from notes and lectures which the author left behind him. Pfleiderer describes this work, especially the first volume, as a classic for all time. \\"Taken as a whole, it is the first thorough and satisfactory attempt to explain the rise of Christianity and the Church on strictly historical lines, i.e. as a natural development of the religious spirit of our race under the combined operation of various human causes\\" (Development of Theology, p. 288). Baur's lectures on the history of dogma, Ausf√ºhrlichere Vorlesungen uber die christliche Dogmengeschichte, were published later by his son (1865‚Äì1868). T√ºbingen School The T√ºbingen School was at the height of its influence in the 1840s, but lost ground to later historical analysis. Since Adolf von Harnack proposed very early dates for the synoptics and Acts (c. 1910), the T√ºbingen School has been generally abandoned.\\"Harnack, Adolf\\" and \\"T√ºbingen School.\\" Cross, F.

It was one of four aircraft designed to compete for the 1933 fighter contract of the Luftwaffe, in which it came second behind the Messerschmitt Bf 109. Small numbers were used for a short time by the Luftwaffe and some were built for other countries, around 100 being completed. Design and development In the early 1930s, the German authorities started placing orders for new aircraft, initially training and utility aircraft. Heinkel, as one of the most experienced firms in the country, received contracts for a number of two-seat aircraft, including the He 45, He 46 and He 50. The company also worked on single-seat fighter designs, which culminated in the He 49 and later with the improved He 51. When the He 51 was tested in combat in the Spanish Civil War, it was shown that speed was far more important than maneuverability. The Luftwaffe took this lesson to heart and started a series of design projects for much more modern aircraft. In October 1933, Hermann G√∂ring sent out a letter requesting aircraft companies consider the design of a \\"high speed courier aircraft\\" ‚Äì a thinly veiled request for a new fighter. Each company was asked to build three prototypes for run-off testing. By spring 1935, both the Arado and Focke-Wulf aircraft were ready, the BFW arriving in March, and the He 112 in April. In early May 1934, despite Germany being under a prohibition from the development of new military aircraft, the Reichsluftfahrtministerium (RLM) issued a request for a new single-seat monoplane fighter under the guise that the proposal was for creating a new 'sports plane'. The Technisches Amt outlined specifications, for the supply of a new fighter aircraft, that submissions for the competition had to meet certain characteristics, including; a) have an all metal construction, b) have a monoplane configuration, c) have retractable landing gear, d) be capable of achieving a top speed of at least at an altitude of , e) endure ninety minutes at full throttle at f) reach an altitude of in seven minutes and have a service ceiling of g) be able to be fitted with a Junkers Jumo 210 engine h) be armed with either two 7.92mm fixed machine guns or one 20mm cannon and i) have a wing loading of less than 100 kg/m^2. In February 1934 three companies, Arado, Bayerische Flugzeugwerke (BFW) and Heinkel, were awarded contracts to develop prototypes for the competition with a fourth company, Focke-Wulf, being awarded the contract more than six months later in September 1934. The prototypes that were eventually submitted for the competition were the Arado Ar 80, Focke-Wulf Fw 159, Heinkel He 112 and the Messerschmitt Bf 109. Heinkel had begun development of their submission in late 1933 in anticipation of the announcement. At the helm of their design project were the G√ºnter brothers, Siegfried and Walter, designers of the He 111, who were then working on the design for the He 112. The first prototype had its first flight in September 1935. Heinkel's design was created primarily by twin brothers Walter and Siegfried G√ºnter, whose designs would dominate most of Heinkel's work. They started work on Projekt 1015 in late 1933 under the guise of the original courier aircraft, based around the BMW XV inline engine. Work was already under way when the official request went out on 2 May, and on 5 May the design was renamed the He 112. The primary source of inspiration for the He 112 was their earlier He 70 Blitz (\\"Lightning\\") design. The Blitz was a single-engine, four-passenger aircraft originally designed for use by Lufthansa, and it, in turn, was inspired by the famous Lockheed Model 9 Orion mail plane. Like many civilian designs of the time, the aircraft was pressed into military service and was used as a two-seat bomber (although mostly for reconnaissance) and served in this role in Spain. The Blitz introduced a number of new construction techniques to the Heinkel company; it was their first low-wing monoplane, their first with retractable landing gear, their first all-metal monocoque design, and its elliptical, reverse-gull wing would be seen on a number of later projects. The Blitz could almost meet the new fighter requirements itself, so it is not surprising that the G√ºnters would choose to work with the existing design as much as possible. Ernst Heinkel's He 112 submission was a scaled-down version of the He 70, a fast mail-plane, sharing numerous features with it including; an all-metal construction ‚Äì including its oval cross-section fuselage and two-spar monoplane wings which were covered with flush-head rivets and stressed metal skin-, similar inverted semi-elliptical gullwings and retractable landing gear. The wide-track of the undercarriage, a result of having outward retraction from the low point of the wing's gull-bend, granted the aircraft excellent ground handling for take-off and landing. The open cockpit and fuselage spine behind the headrest mounted into the deep-section fuselage offered the pilot a good view when taxiing and were included to provide excellent vision and make the biplane-trained pilots feel more comfortable. =Prototypes= The first prototype, V1, was completed on 1 September 1935. Specifications of the Technisches Amt required that the competing aircraft be fitted with the Junkers Jumo 210, however, as the engine was unavailable, a Rolls-Royce Kestrel V was fitted instead. The V1 prototype of the Heinkel had comparatively large wings and was heavier than its contemporaries, however, due to the wing size, the mass was more evenly spread out resulting in lower wing-loading. The upshot of this was that the aircraft had better turn performance; the downshot was that it generated more drag than expected and had a slowed roll rate. The second prototype, V2, was completed in November. It was powered by a Jumo 210C engine and fitted with a three-blade propeller, but was otherwise identical to the V1. Meanwhile, the data from the V1 factory flights was studied to discover where the unexpected drag was coming from. The G√ºnter brothers identified the large, thick wing as the main culprit, and designed an entirely new smaller and thinner wing with an elliptical planform. As a stop-gap measure, the V2 had its wings clipped by to allow it to compete with the 109. This made the He 112 creep over the wing loading requirements in the specifications, but with the 109 way over the limit, this was not seen as a problem, and the V2 was sent off for testing. The V2, like its predecessor, had problems with spin stability and eventually crashed and was destroyed when test pilot Gerhard Nitschke bailed from the aircraft after losing control during a set of spin tests. The V3 took to the air in January. Largely similar to the V2 and powered with the same engine, the V3 had minor changes including having a larger radiator, fuselage spine and vertical stabilizer, having a single cover over the exhaust ports instead of the more common \\"stack\\", and it also included modifications to allow armament to be installed in the cowling. The V3 was the first prototype fitted with armament in the form of two MG17 machine guns. It was later modified once more to include a sliding canopy and a new fully elliptical wing. It was expected to join the V2 in testing but instead was assigned back to Heinkel in early 1937 for tests with rocket propulsion. During a test, the rocket exploded and the aircraft was destroyed, but in an amazing effort the V3 was rebuilt with several changes, including an enclosed cockpit. =The contest= At the competing aircraft's demonstration flight for the RLM in October 1935, the thick high-lift aerofoil and open cockpit of the He 112 generated more drag than its contemporary opponent, the Bf 109, causing its performance to suffer despite being equipped with an identical engine. Whereas the Bf 109 prototype was able to clock in a top speed of 467 km/h (290 mph), the He 112 could only manage 440 km/h (273 mph). The other competing aircraft, the Arado Ar 80 and the Focke-Wulf Fw 159, had been plagued with problems from the outset and were outclassed by both the Bf 109 and the He 112 resulting in them being eliminated from any serious consideration. At the end of the demonstrations, Messerschmitt and Heinkel were awarded contracts to produce ten prototypes for further testing and competitive trials. At this point, the He 112 was the favorite over the \\"unknown\\" Bf 109, but opinions changed when the Bf 109 V2 arrived on 21 March. All the competitor aircraft had initially been equipped with the Rolls-Royce Kestrel engine, but the Bf 109 V2 had the Jumo. From that point on, it started to outperform the He 112 in almost every way, and even the arrival of the Jumo-engined He 112 V2 on 15 April did little to address this imbalance. The He 112 had better turn performance due to its larger wing, but the Bf 109 was faster at all altitudes and had considerably better agility and aerobatic abilities. During spin tests on 2 March, the Bf 109 V2 showed no problems while the He 112 V2 crashed. Repairs were made to the aircraft and it was returned in April, but it crashed again and was written off. The V1 was then returned to Heinkel on 17 April and fitted with the V2's clipped wings. Meanwhile, news came in that Supermarine had received a contract for full- scale production of the Spitfire. The Spitfire was far more advanced than any existing German aircraft and this caused a wave of concern in the high command of the Luftwaffe. Time now took on as much importance as any quality of the winning aircraft itself, and the RLM was ready to put any reasonable design into production. That design was the Bf 109, which in addition to demonstrating better performance, was considerably easier to build due to fewer compound curves and simpler construction throughout. On 12 March RLM produced a document called Bf 109 Priority Procurement which indicated which aircraft was now preferred. There were some within the RLM who still favored the Heinkel design, and as a result the RLM then sent out contracts for 10 \\"zero series\\" aircraft from both companies. Testing continued until October, at which point some of the additional zero series aircraft had arrived. At the end of September, there were four He 112s being tested, yet none was a match for the Bf 109. From October on, the Bf 109 appears to have been selected as the winner of the contest. Although no clear date is given, in Stormy Life Ernst Udet himself delivered the news to Heinkel that the Bf 109 had entered series production in 1936. He is quoted as saying, \\"Pawn your crate off on the Turks or the Japanese or the Romanians. They'll lap it up.\\" With a number of air forces looking to upgrade from biplanes and various designs from the early 1930s, the possibility for foreign sales was promising. He 112A =Prototypes= Heinkel had expected orders for additional aircraft beyond the initial three prototypes, and was able to respond quickly to the new contract for the 10 zero series aircraft. The new aircraft would be given the series designation He 112 A-0. The first of these new versions, V4, was completed in June 1936. It featured a new elliptical wing, a more powerful 210D engine with a two-speed supercharger that brought the power to for takeoff and a smaller tailplane. Like the V3, it also sported two fuselage- mounted MG 17 machine guns, unlike the V3, it featured two wing-mounted Oerlikon MG FF cannons that earned it the nickname kanonenvogel (literally, cannon bird). A prototype, known as the V5, was designed and built by engineer Wernher von Braun, who would later design the V-2 rocket. This variant of the fighter He 112 was powered by an additional rocket engine. First flown in early 1937, the He 112 V5 demonstrated the feasibility of rocket power for aircraft. In July, both V5 and V6 were completed. V5 was identical to V4, with the Jumo 210D engine. V6, on the other hand, was completed as the pattern aircraft for the A series production run, and thus included the 210C engine instead of the more powerful, but less available 210D. The only other change was a modification to the radiator, but this would not appear on later A-0 series models. V6 suffered a forced landing on 1 August and was repaired and joined V4 for testing in October. The last of the prototype A-0 series was V8, which was completed in October. It switched engines entirely and mounted the Daimler-Benz DB 600Aa, along with a three-bladed, fully adjustable, all-metal propeller. The engine was a huge change for the aircraft, producing 716 kW (960 hp) for takeoff and had 33.9 L (2,069 in¬≥) displacement at 686 kg (1,510 lb), compared that to the Jumo 210D's from 19.7 L (1,202 in¬≥) at about the same weight. V8 was seen primarily as a testbed for the new engine, and more importantly, its cooling systems. The DB used a dry liner in the engine that resulted in poor heat flow, so more of the heat was removed by oil as opposed to water, requiring changes to the cooling systems. In March 1937, the aircraft was assigned to rocket propulsion tests at Peenem√ºnde. It completed these tests later that summer and was returned to the factory, where it was converted back into a normal model. At the end of the year, it was sent to Spain, where it was seriously damaged on 18 July 1938. Once again, it was put back together and was flying four months later. Its fate after this time is not recorded. =Production models= At this point, the prototype stage was ostensibly over, and Heinkel continued building the A-0 as production line models. The naming changed, adding a production number to the end of the name, so the next six examples were known as He 112 A-01 through A-06. All of these included the 210C engine and were essentially identical to V6, with the exception of the radiator. These aircraft were used in just as varied a manner as the earlier V series had been. A-01 flew in October 1936 and was used as the prototype for a future 112 C-0 carrier-based aircraft. It was later destroyed during rocket tests. A-02 flew in November, and then joined the earlier V models at Rechlin-L√§rz Airfield for further testing in the contest. A-03 and A-04 were both completed in December, A-03 was a show aircraft and was flown by Heinkel pilots at various air shows and exhibitions, A-04 was kept at Heinkel for various tests. The last two models of the A-0 series, A-05 and A-06, were completed in March 1937. They were both shipped to Japan as the initial machines of the 30 for the Imperial Japanese Navy. He 112B =Prototypes= Prototype V9 D-IGSI In October 1936, the RLM changed the orders for the zero series 112s, instructing Heinkel to complete any A-0s already under construction and then switch the remaining aircraft to an updated design. This gave Heinkel a chance to improve the He 112, which they did by completely redesigning it into an almost entirely new aircraft called the He 112B. It is at this point that it became a modern design that could compete head-to-head with the Bf 109. The He 112B had a redesigned and cut- down rear fuselage, a new fin and rudder and a completely enclosed cockpit with a bubble-style canopy. The canopy was somewhat more complex than later bubble designs; instead of having two pieces with the majority sliding to the rear, the He 112B canopy was in three pieces, the middle sliding back and over a fixed rear section. Even with the additional framing, the He 112 had excellent visibility for its day. Armament was also standardized on the B model with two 7.92 mm (.312 in) MG 17 machine guns in the sides of the cowling with 500 rpg and two 20 mm MG FF cannons in the wings with 60 rpg. For aiming, the cockpit included the new Revi 3B reflector gunsight. The first B series airframe to be completed was V7 in October 1936. V7 used the DB 600Aa engine like the A-series V8, and it also used the original V1 style larger wing. This wing was later replaced with a smaller one but instead of the clipped version from the earlier V models, a new single-spar fully elliptical wing was produced. This design became standard for the entire B series. V7 was turned over to von Braun in April 1937 for yet more rocket tests and managed to survive the experience. It was then returned in the summer and sent to Rechlin where it was used as a test aircraft. The next type was V9 which flew in July 1937, powered by the Jumo 210D engine. V9 can be considered to be the \\"real\\" B series prototype, as V7 had received the DB 600Aa originally for experimental reasons. The entire surface was now flush riveted and the aircraft had several other aerodynamic refinements. The radiator was changed again, this time to a semi-retractable design for reduced drag in flight. The aircraft also underwent a weight reduction program which reduced the empty weight to 1,617 kg (3,565 lb). As a result of all of these changes, the V9 had a maximum speed of 485 km/h (301 mph) at 4,000 m (13,120 ft), and 430 km/h (270 mph) at sea level. This was a full 20 km/h (10 mph) faster than the contemporary Bf 109B. Nevertheless, by this time, the Bf 109 was already being mass-produced and the RLM saw no need for another similar aircraft. It is also worth noting that users of the aircraft generally found it impossible to reach this speed and rarely managed to exceed 418 km/h (260 mph). The RLM had already contracted for another six He 112s, so production of the prototypes continued. V10 was supposed to receive the 670 kW (960 hp) Junkers Jumo 211A (Junker's new DB 600 competitor) but the engine was not available in time and V10 instead received the new 876 kW (1,175 hp) DB 601Aa. The engine drove V10 to 570 km/h (350 mph) and increased climb rate significantly. V11 was also supposed to get the Jumo 211A but instead received the DB 600Aa. The last prototype, V12, was actually an airframe taken off the B-1 series production line (which had started by this point). The Jumo 210D was replaced with the new fuel-injected 210Ga, which improved performance of the engine to 522 kW (700 hp) for takeoff, and a sustained output of 503 kW (675 hp) at the reasonably high altitude of 4,700 m (15,420 ft). Better yet, the Ga also decreased fuel consumption, thus increasing the aircraft's endurance. The new engine gave V12 such a boost that it became the pattern aircraft for the planned B-2 series production. With all of these different versions and experimental engine fits, it might seem like every aircraft differed significantly but with the exception of the engines, the Bs were identical. Due to the shortage of just about any German engine at the time and the possibility that advanced versions could be blocked for export, various models had to be designed with different installations. Thus the B models were different only in their engine, the Jumo 210C in the He 112 B-0, the Jumo 210D in the B-1, and the Jumo 210Ga for the B-2. =Production models= In order to show off the He 112, V9 spent much of the later half of 1937 being flown by pilots from all over the world. It was also sent around Europe for tours and air shows. The effort was a success and orders quickly started coming in. However, a variety of problems meant few of these were ever delivered. The first order was from the Imperial Japanese Navy, who had a requirement for a fast climbing interceptor to deal with Tupolev SB bombers over China. After seeing V9 in flight, they quickly placed an order for 24 112Bs, with an option for 48 more. The first four were shipped in December 1937, another eight in the spring, and promises for the rest to arrive in May. Before delivery, the Luftwaffe unexpectedly took over 12 of the aircraft to bolster its forces during the Sudetenland Crisis. The aircraft were then returned to Heinkel in November, but the Japanese, who were unhappy with the high maintenance workload and lower manoeuvrability compared with fighters like the Mitsubishi A5M, refused to accept them this late and Heinkel was left holding the aircraft. In November 1937, an Austrian delegation came to see the aircraft, led by Generaloberst Alexander L√∂hr, Command-in-Chief of the Luftstreitkr√§fte (Austrian Air Force). Test pilot Hans Schalk flew both the Bf 109 and the He 112V9 back to back. Although he felt that both models performed the same, the Heinkel had more balanced steering pressures and better equipment possibilities. They placed an order on 20 December for 42 He 112Bs. Pending the license for the MG FF cannon, these aircraft would remove the cannon and add six THM 10/I bomb shackles which carried small 10 kg (22 lb) anti- personnel bombs. The order was later reduced to 36 examples due to a lack of funds (the He 112B cost 163,278 Reichsmarks), but the aircraft were never delivered due to the annexation of Austria in the March 1938 Anschluss. Spain was so impressed with the He 112's performance during evaluation in the civil war that the Spanish Air Force purchased the 12 aircraft in early 1938, and later increased the order by another six (some sources say five). Of the first 12, two were shipped in November, another six in January, and the rest in April. In April, it looked like Yugoslavia would be the next user of the He 112. It placed an order for 30 aircraft, but later cancelled the order and decided to produce other designs under license. Finland appeared to be another potential customer. From January‚ÄìMarch 1938, the famous Finnish pilot Gustaf Erik Magnusson travelled to Germany to gain experience in new tactics. He had been on similar tours in France in the past and was interested to see how the Germans were training their pilots. On a visit to the Heinkel plant in Marienehe, he flew the He 112 and reported it to be the best aircraft he had flown. In May, Heinkel sent the first of the He 112 B-1s to Finland to join an air show. It remained for the next week and was flown by a number of pilots, including Magnusson, who had since returned to Finland. Although all of the pilots liked the aircraft, the cost was so high that the Suomen Ilmavoimat (Finnish Air Force) decided to stick with the much less expensive Fokker D.XXI. A similar setback would accompany sales efforts targeting the Dutch Air Force, who was looking to purchase 36 fighters to form two new squadrons. A He 112 B-1 arrived for testing on 12 July and quickly proved to be the best aircraft in the competition. Nevertheless, they decided to purchase the locally built (and rather outdated) Koolhoven F.K.58 instead. In the end, the F.K.58s were never delivered because the factory was bombed on 10 May 1940. Fortunes would be seem to be reversed with Hungary. In June 1938, three pilots of the Magyar Kir√°lyi Honv√©d L√©gier√∂ (Royal Hungarian Home Defense Air Force or MKHL) were sent to Heinkel to study V9. They were impressed with what they saw, and on 7 September, an order was placed for 36 aircraft, as well as an offer to license the design for local construction. Through a variety of political mishaps, only three aircraft were ever delivered and licensed production never happened. The final and perhaps most successful customer for the He 112B was Romania. The For≈£√£ Aeronautic√£ Regal√£ Rom√¢n√£ (Royal Romanian Air Force) ordered 24 aircraft in April 1939, and increased the order to 30 on 18 August. Deliveries started in June, with the last being delivered on 30 September. By this point, war had broken out, and with better models on the market ‚Äì including Heinkel's own He 100 ‚Äì no one else was interested in purchasing the design. The production line was closed after a total of only 98 aircraft, 85 of those being the B series models. He 112R =Early experiments with rocket propulsion= In 1931, the Army Weapons Office testing ground at Kummersdorf had taken over research into liquid-fuel rockets. In 1932, Wernher von Braun designed a rocket of this kind which used high percentage spirit and liquid oxygen. With this he made the first experiments. In 1934 he fired his second rocket type, the A2, from the North Sea island of Borkum. Having completed the programme of experiments, von Braun was interested in evaluating an aircraft with a rocket motor propulsion system. For this he needed an aircraft and support team. Initially the highest levels at the Army High Command and the Reich Air Ministry (RLM) were opposed to such \\"fantasies\\", as they called them. Many people, technicians and academic experts in positions of influence in aeronautics, maintained that an aircraft driven by a tail thrust would experience a change in the centre of gravity and flip over. Very few believed the contrary, but one of them was Ernst Heinkel. Following his offer of unhesitating support, Heinkel placed at the disposal of von Braun an He 112 fuselage shell less wings for the standing tests. In 1936 von Braun had advanced far enough to begin trials. A great tongue of flame from the rocket motor roared through the fuselage tail to set up the back thrust. Late in 1936 Erich Warsitz was seconded by the RLM to Wernher von Braun and Ernst Heinkel, because he had been recognized as one of the most experienced test pilots of the time, and because he also was technically proficient. Warsitz wrote: The RLM agreed to lend Neuhardenberg, a large field about 70 kilometres east of Berlin, listed as a reserve airfield in the event of war. Since Neuhardenberg had no buildings or facilities, a number of marquees were erected to house the aircraft. In the spring of 1937 the Kummersdorf Club transferred to Neuhardenberg and continued the standing trials with the He 112 fuselage. In June 1937 Erich Warsitz undertook the initial flight testing of the He 112 fitted with von Braun's rocket engine. Despite the wheels-up landing and having the fuselage on fire, it proved to official circles that an aircraft could be flown satisfactorily with a back- thrust system through the rear. Also the firm of Hellmuth Walter at Kiel had been commissioned by the RLM to build a rocket engine for the He 112, so there were two different new rocket motor designs at Neuhardenberg; whereas the von Braun's engines were powered by alcohol and liquid oxygen, Walter engines had hydrogen peroxide and calcium permanganate as a catalyst. Von Braun's engine used direct combustion and created fire, the Walter produced hot vapours from a chemical reaction, but both created thrust and provided high speed. The subsequent flights with the He 112 used the Walter-rocket instead of von Braun's; it was more reliable, simpler to operate and the dangers to test pilot Erich Warsitz and machine were less. After conclusion of the He 112 tests using both rocket motors, the marquees at Neuhardenberg were dismantled at the end of 1937. This coincided with the construction of Peenem√ºnde. Operational service =Condor Legion= When it was clear the 112 was losing the contest to the Bf 109, Heinkel offered to re-equip V6 with 20 mm cannon armament as an experimental aircraft. She was then broken down and shipped to Spain on 9 December and assigned to Versuchsjagdgruppe 88, a group within the Legion Condor devoted to testing new aircraft and joined three V-series Bf 109s which were also in testing. Wilhelm Balthasar, later a Battle of Britain ace pilot used it to attack an armoured train and an armoured car. Other pilots flew it, but the engine seized during landing in July and she was written off. For the annexation of the Sudetenland, every flight-worthy fighter was pressed into service. The batch of He 112Bs for the Japanese Navy was taken over, but not used before the end of the crisis and shipped to Japan to fulfil orders. The Japanese rejected the He 112 as a fighter but took 30 for training duties and V11 with its DB 600Aa was used for testing. The Spanish government purchased 12 He 112Bs. This increased to 19. The He 112s were to operate as top cover for Fiat fighters in the opening stages of the Civil War, the Fiat having considerably worse altitude performance. In the event, only a single kill was made with the He 112 as a fighter and it was moved onto ground-attack work. During World War II, when Allied forces landed in North Africa, Spanish forces in Morocco intercepted stray aircraft of both Allied and German forces. None of these incidents resulted in losses. In 1943, one He 112 of Grupo n¬∫27 attacked the tail-end aircraft of 11 Lockheed P-38s forcing it down in Algeria after they re-entered French territory having crossed into Spanish Morocco. By 1944, the aircraft were largely grounded due to a lack of fuel and maintenance. =Hungary= thumb Hungarian Royal Air Force (MKHL - Magyar Kir√°lyi Honv√©d L√©gier√∂), 1942 Like the Germans, Hungary had stiff regulations imposed on its armed forces with the signing of the Treaty of Trianon. In August 1938, the armed forces were re-formed, and with Austria (historically her partner for centuries) being incorporated into Germany, Hungary found herself in the German sphere. One of the highest priorities for the forces was to re-equip the Hungarian Air Force (Magyar Kir√°lyi Honv√©d L√©gier≈ë or MKHL) as soon as possible. Of the various aircraft being considered, the He 112B eventually won out over the competition, and on 7 September, an order was placed for 36 aircraft. The Heinkel production line was just starting, and with Japan and Spain in the queue, it would be some time before the aircraft could be delivered. Repeated pleas to be moved to the top of the queue failed. Germany had to refuse the first order at the beginning of 1939 because of its claimed neutrality in the Hungarian/Romanian dispute over Transylvania. In addition, the RLM refused to license the 20 mm MG FF cannon to the Hungarians, likely as a form of political pressure. This later insult did not cause a problem, because they planned to replace it with the locally designed 20 mm Danuvia cannon anyway. V9 was sent to Hungary as a demonstrator after a tour of Romania, and arrived on 5 February 1939. It was test flown by a number of pilots over the next week, and on 14 February, they replaced the propeller with a new three-bladed Junkers design (licensed from Hamilton). While being tested against a CR.32 that day, V9 crashed. On 10 March, a new He 112 B-1/U2 arrived to replace the V9 and was flown by a number of pilots at different fighter units. It was during this time that the Hungarian pilots started to complain about the underpowered engine, as they found that they could only reach a top speed of 430 km/h (270 mph) with the Jumo 210Ea. With the Japanese and Spanish orders filled, things were looking up for Hungary. However, at that point, Romania placed its order, and was placed at the front of the queue. It appeared that the Hungarian production machines might never arrive, so the MKHL started pressing for a license to build the aircraft locally. In May, the Hungarian Manfred-Weiss company in Budapest received the license for the aircraft, and on 1 June, an order was placed for 12 aircraft. Heinkel agreed to deliver a Jumo 210Ga-powered aircraft to serve as a pattern aircraft. As it turns out, the He 112 B-2 was never delivered; two more of the B-1/U2s with the Jumo 210Ea were sent instead. On arrival in Hungary, the 7.92 mm (.312 in) MG 17 machine guns were removed and replaced with the local 8 mm (.315 in) 39.M machine guns, and bomb racks were added. The resulting fit was similar to those originally ordered by Austria. Throughout this time, the complaints about the engines were being addressed by continued attempts to license one of the newer 30 L (1,831 in¬≥)-class engines, the Junkers Jumo 211A or the DB 600Aa. Late in March, the He 100 V8 took the world absolute speed record, but in stories about the record attempt, the aircraft was referred to as the He 112U. Upon hearing of the record, the Hungarians decided to switch production to this \\"new version\\" of the 112, which was based on the newer engines. Then in August, the Commander-in-Chief of the MKHL recommended that the 112 be purchased as the standard fighter for Hungary (although likely referring to the earlier versions, not the \\"112U\\"). At this point, the engine issue came to a head. It was clear that no production line aircraft would ever reach Hungary, and now that the war was underway, the RLM was refusing to allow their export anyway. Shipments of the Jumo 211 or DB 601 were not even able to fulfill German needs, so export of the engine for locally built airframes was likewise out of the question. By September, the ongoing negotiations with the RLM for the license to build the engines locally stalled, and as a result, the MKHL ordered Manfred-Weiss to stop tooling up for the production line aircraft. The license was eventually canceled in December. The MKHL turned to the Italians and purchased the Fiat CR.32 and Reggiane Re.2000. The latter would be the backbone of the MKHL for much of the war. Nevertheless, the three He 112 B-1/U2 aircraft continued to serve on. In the summer of 1940, tensions with Romania over Transylvania started to heat up again and the entire MKHL was placed on alert on 27 June. On 21 August, the He 112s were moved forward to the Debrecen airfield to protect a vital railway link. The next week, a peaceful resolution was found, and the settlement was signed in Vienna on 30 August. The He 112s returned home the following week. By 1941, the aircraft were ostensibly assigned to defend the Manfred-Weiss plant, but were actually used for training. When Allied bomber raids started in the spring of 1944, the aircraft were no longer airworthy, and it appears all were destroyed in a massive raid on the Budapest-Ferihegy airport on 9 August 1944. After the licensed production of the He 112B fell through in 1939, the plan was to switch the production line to build a Manfred-Weiss-designed aircraft called the W.M.23 Ez√ºst Ny√≠l (\\"Silver Arrow\\"). The aircraft was basically a He 112B adapted to local construction; the wings were wooden versions of the He 112's planform, the fuselage was made of plywood over a steel frame, and the engine was a licensed version of the 746 kW (1,000 hp)-class Gnome-Rhone Mistral- Major radial. It would seem that this 'simplified' aircraft would be inferior to the He 112, but in fact the higher-powered engine made all the difference and the W.M.23 proved to be considerably faster than the He 112. Nevertheless, work proceeded slowly and only one prototype was built. The project was eventually canceled outright when the prototype crashed in early 1942. It is still a mystery why so little work had been done in those two years on what appeared to be an excellent design. =Japan= The Imperial Japanese Navy purchased 12 Heinkel He 112B-0 fighters, which it designated both as the Heinkel A7He1 and as the Navy Type He Air Defense Fighter. The Japanese flew the A7He1 briefly during the Second Sino-Japanese War, but phased it out of service before the attack on Pearl Harbor in December 1941 in favor of the Mitsubishi A6M Zero. Assuming it still to be in Japanese use, however, the Allies assigned the reporting name \\"Jerry\\" to the A7He1 during World War II. =Romania= A Heinkel He 112 in FARR Romanian livery at Foc»ôani airport in the end of 1942. The Treaty of Versailles ratified the wish of the nations of Central and Eastern Europe, by recognizing the national states of Poland, Czechoslovakia and Yugoslavia as well as the Union of the Romanian people, by integration of former provinces of the defunct Tsarist and Austro-Hungarian empires, with a Romanian ethnic majority, into the Romanian Kingdom (see Union of Transylvania with Romania, Union of Bessarabia with Romania). Also Romania had been granted Southern Dobruja after the Second Balkan War. These territorial changes did not go well with Bulgaria, and the successor states of the former empires (Hungary, USSR), which adopted a hostile stance. Throughout the 1920s and 1930s, Romania entered a number of alliances with the nearby nations which were in a similar situation, notably Czechoslovakia and Yugoslavia. They were interested in blocking any changes to the Treaty of Versailles which could lead to reintegration by force in a multinational empire and, eventually, the loss of national identity. Germany looked on Romania as an important supplier of war material, notably oil and grain. Looking to secure Romania as an ally, throughout the middle of the 1930s, Germany applied increasing pressure in a variety of forms, best summed up as the \\"carrot and stick\\" approach. The carrot came in the form of generous trade agreements for a variety of products and by the late 1930s, Germany formed about ¬Ω of all of Romania's trade. The stick came in the form of Germany siding with Romania's enemies in various disputes. On 26 June 1940, the Soviet Union gave Romania a 24-hour ultimatum to return Bessarabia and cede northern Bukovina, even though the latter had never even been a part of Russia. Germany's ambassador to Romania advised the king to submit, and he did. In August, Bulgaria reclaimed southern Dobruja, with German and Soviet backing. Later that month, German and Italian foreign ministers met with Romanian diplomats in Vienna and presented them with an ultimatum to accept the ceding of northern Transylvania to Hungary. Romania was placed in an increasingly bad position as her local allies were gobbled up by Germany, and her larger allies' (Britain and France) assurances of help proved empty, as demonstrated by their lack of action during the invasion of Poland. Soon the king was forced from the throne and a pro-German government was formed. With Romania now firmly in the German sphere of influence, her efforts to re-arm for the coming war were suddenly strongly backed. The primary concern was the air force, the FARR. Their fighter force at the time consisted of just over 100 Polish PZL P.11 aircraft, primarily the P.11b or the locally modified f model, and P.24E. Although these aircraft had been the most advanced fighters in the world in the early 1930s, by the late 1930s, they were hopelessly outclassed by practically everything. In April 1939, the FARR was offered the Bf 109 as soon as production was meeting German demands. In the meantime, they could take over 24 He 112Bs that were already built. The FARR jumped at the chance and then increased the order to 30 aircraft. Late in April, a group of Romanian pilots arrived at Heinkel for conversion training, which went slowly because of the advanced nature of the He 112 in comparison to the PZL. When the training was complete, the pilots returned home in the cockpits of their new aircraft. The aircraft, all of them B-1s or B-2s, were \\"delivered\\" in this manner starting in July and ending in October. Two of the aircraft were lost, one in a fatal accident during training in Germany on 7 September, and another suffered minor damage on landing while being delivered and was later repaired at SET in Romania. When the first aircraft started arriving, they were tested competitively against the locally designed IAR.80 prototype. This interesting and little known aircraft proved to be superior to the He 112B in almost every way. At the same time, the test flights revealed a number of disadvantages of the He 112, notably the underpowered engine and poor speed. The result of the fly-off was that the IAR.80 was ordered into immediate production, and orders for any additional He 112s were cancelled. By 15 September, enough of the aircraft had arrived to re-equip Escadrila 10 and 11. The two squadrons were formed into the Grupul 5 v√¢n√£toare (5th Fighter Group), responsible for the defense of Bucharest. In October, they were renamed as the 51st and 52nd squadrons, still forming the 5th. The pilots had not been a part of the group that had been trained at Heinkel, so they started working their way toward the He 112 using Nardi F.N.305 monoplane trainers. Training lasted until the spring of 1940, when a single additional He 112 B-2 was delivered as a replacement for the one that crashed in Germany the previous September. During the troubles with Hungary, the 51st was deployed to Transylvania. Hungarian Ju 86s and He 70s started making reconnaissance flights over Romanian territory. Repeated attempts to intercept them failed because of the He 112's low speed. On 27 August, Locotenent Nicolae Polizu was over Hungarian territory when he encountered a Caproni Ca.135bis bomber flying on a training mission. Several of his 20 mm rounds hit the bomber, which was forced down safely at the Hungarian Debrecen airbase ‚Äì home of the Hungarian He 112s. Polizu became the first Romanian to shoot down an aircraft in aerial combat. When Germany prepared to invade the USSR in 1941, Romania joined it in an effort to regain the territories lost the year before. The FARR was made part of Luftflotte 4, and in preparation for the invasion, Grupul 5 v√¢n√£toare was sent to Moldavia. At the time, 24 of the He 112s were flyable. Three were left at their home base at Pipera to complete repairs, two others had been lost to accidents, and the fate of the others is unknown. On 15 June, the aircraft were moved again, to Foscani-North in northern Moldavia. With the opening of the war on 22 June, the He 112s were in the air at 1050 supporting an attack by Potez 63s of Grupul 2 bombardment on the Soviet airfields at Bolgrad and Bulg√£rica. Although some flak was encountered on the way to and over Bolgrad, the attack was successful and a number of Soviet aircraft were bombed on the ground. By the time they reached Bulg√£rica, fighters were in the air waiting for them, and as a result the 12 He 112s were met by about 30 I-16s. The results of this combat were mixed; Sublocotenent Teodor Moscu shot down one of a pair of I-16s still taking off. When he was pulling out, he hit another in a head-on pass and it crashed into the Danube. He was set upon by several I-16s and received several hits, his fuel tanks were punctured but did not seal. Losing fuel rapidly, he formed up with his wingman and managed to put down at the Romanian airfield at B√¢rlad. His aircraft was later repaired and returned to duty. Of the bombers, three of the 13 dispatched were shot down. Over the next few days, the He 112s would be used primarily as ground-attack aircraft, where their heavy armament was considered to be more important than their ability to fight in the air. Typical missions would start before dawn and would have the Heinkels strafe Soviet airbases. Later in the day, they would be sent on search and destroy missions, looking primarily for artillery and trains. Losses were heavy, most not due to combat, but simply because the aircraft were flying an average of three missions a day and were not receiving adequate maintenance. This problem affected all of the FARR, which did not have the field maintenance logistics worked out at the time. On 29 July, a report on the readiness of the air forces listed only 14 He 112s in flyable condition, and another eight repairable. As a result, the aircraft of the 52nd were folded into the 51st to form a single full strength squadron on 13 August. The men of the 52nd were merged with the 42nd who flew IAR.80s, and were soon sent home to receive IAR.80s of their own. A report from August on the He 112 rated it very poorly, once again noting its lack of power and poor speed. For a time, the 51st continued in a front-line role, although it saw little combat. When Odessa fell on 16 October, the Romanian war effort ostensibly ended, and the aircraft were considered to be no longer needed at the front. 15 were kept at Odessa and the rest were released to Romania for training duty (although they seem to have seen no use). On 1 November, the 51st moved to Tatarka and then returned to Odessa on the 25th, performing coastal patrol duties all the while. On 1 July 1942, the 51st returned to Pipera and stood down after a year in action. On 19 July one of the He 112s took to the air to intercept Soviet bombers in what was the first night mission by a Romanian aircraft. As the Soviets were clearly gearing up for a night offensive on Bucharest, the 51st was then re-equipped with Bf 110 night fighters and became the only Romanian night fighter squadron. By 1943, the IAR.80 was no longer competitive, and the FARR started an overdue move to a newer fighter. The fighter in this case was the Bf 109G. The He 112s found themselves actively being used in the training role at last. The inline engine and general layout of the German designs was considered similar enough to make it useful in this role, and as a result the He 112s came under the control of the Corpul 3 Aerian (3rd Air Corps). Several more of the He 112s were destroyed in accidents during this time. It soldiered on in this role into late 1944, even after Romania had changed sides and joined the Allies.

In 1848, after public service as Secretary of the Massachusetts State Board of Education, Mann was elected to the United States House of Representatives (1848‚Äì1853). From September 1852 to his death, he served as President of Antioch College. About Mann's intellectual progressivism, the historian Ellwood P. Cubberley said: Arguing that universal public education was the best way to turn unruly American children into disciplined, judicious republican citizens, Mann won widespread approval from modernizers, especially in the Whig Party, for building public schools. Most U.S. states adopted a version of the system Mann established in Massachusetts, especially the program for normal schools to train professional teachers. Educational historians credit Horace Mann, along with Henry Barnard and Catherine Beecher as one of the major advocates of the Common School Movement. Early career =Education= Horace Mann was born on May 4, 1796 in Franklin, Massachusetts. His father was a farmer without much money. From ten years of age to twenty, he had no more than six weeks' schooling during any year, but he made use of the Franklin Public Library, the first public library in America. At the age of twenty, he enrolled at Brown University and graduated in three years as valedictorian (1819). The theme of his oration was \\"The Progressive Character of the Human Race.\\" He learned Greek and Latin from Samuel Barrett, who later became a famous Unitarian minister. He then studied law for a short time in Wrentham, Massachusetts and was a tutor of Latin and Greek (1820‚Äì1822) and a librarian (1821‚Äì1823) at Brown. During 1822, he also studied at Litchfield Law School and, in 1823, was admitted to the bar in Dedham, Massachusetts. =Massachusetts legislature= Mann was elected to the Massachusetts legislature in 1827, and in that role was active in the interests of education, public charities, and laws for the suppression of intemperance and lotteries. He established an asylum in Worcester, and in 1833 was chairman of its board of trustees. Mann continued to be returned to the legislature as representative from Dedham until his removal to Boston in 1833. While in the legislature he was a member and part of the time chairman of the committee for the revision of the state statutes, and a large number of salutary provisions were incorporated into the code at his suggestion. After their enactment he was appointed one of the editors of the work, and prepared its marginal notes and its references to judicial decisions. He was elected to the Massachusetts State Senate from Boston in 1835, and was its president in 1836‚Äì1837. As a member of the Senate, he spent time as the majority leader, and aimed his focus at infrastructure, funding the construction of railroads and canals. =Marriages= In 1830, Mann married Charlotte Messer, who was the daughter of the president of Brown University. She died two years later on August 1, 1832, and he never fully recovered from the intense grief and shock that accompanied her death. In 1843, he married Mary Tyler Peabody. Afterward, the couple accompanied Samuel Gridley Howe and Julia Ward Howe on a dual honeymoon to Europe. They then purchased a home in West Newton, Massachusetts at the corner of Chestnut and Highland Streets. Horace and Mary had three sons: Horace Mann Jr., George Combe Mann, and Benjamin Pickman Mann. Education reform It was not until he was appointed Secretary in 1837 of the newly created Massachusetts Board of Education that he began the work which was to place him in the foremost rank of American educators. On entering on his duties, he withdrew from all other professional or business engagements and from politics. He held this position, and worked with a remarkable intensity, holding teachers' conventions, delivering numerous lectures and addresses, carrying on an extensive correspondence, and introducing numerous reforms. Mann persuaded his fellow modernizers, especially those in the Whig Party, to legislate tax-supported elementary public education in their states and to feminize the teaching force. Most northern states adopted one version or another of the system he established in Massachusetts, especially the program for \\"normal schools\\" to train professional teachers. Mann traveled to every school in the state so he could physically examine each school ground. He planned and inaugurated the Massachusetts normal school system in Lexington (which shortly thereafter moved to Framingham), Barre (which shortly thereafter moved to Westfield) and Bridgewater, and began preparing a series of annual reports, which had a wide circulation and were considered as being \\"among the best expositions, if, indeed, they are not the very best ones, of the practical benefits of a common school education both to the individual and to the state\\".Hinsdale (1898). By his advocacy of the disuse of corporal punishment in school discipline, he was involved in a controversy with some of the Boston teachers that resulted in the adoption of his views. In 1838, he founded and edited The Common School Journal. In this journal, Mann targeted the public school and its problems. His six main principles were: # the public should no longer remain ignorant; # that such education should be paid for, controlled, and sustained by an interested public; # that this education will be best provided in schools that embrace children from a variety of backgrounds; # that this education must be non-sectarian; # that this education must be taught using the tenets of a free society; and # that education should be provided by well-trained, professional teachers. Under the auspices of the board, but at his own expense, he went to Europe in 1843 to visit schools, especially in Prussia, and his seventh annual report, published after his return, embodied the results of his tour. Many editions of this report were printed, not only in Massachusetts but in other states, in some cases by private individuals and in others by legislatures; several editions were issued in England. Mann hoped that by bringing all children of all classes together, they could have a common learning experience. This would also give an opportunity to the less fortunate to advance in the social scale and education would \\"equalize the conditions of men.\\" Moreover, it was viewed also as a road to social advancement by the early labor movement and as a goal of having common schools. Mann also suggested that by having schools it would help those students who did not have appropriate discipline in the home. Building a person's character was just as important as reading, writing and arithmetic. Instilling values such as obedience to authority, promptness in attendance, and organizing the time according to bell ringing helped students prepare for future employment. Mann faced some resistance from parents who did not want to give up the moral education to teachers and bureaucrats. The normal schools trained mostly women, giving them new career opportunities as teachers. Mann believed that women were better suited for teaching, regardless of their status as a mother, and used his position to push for a feminization of the profession. The practical result of Mann's work was a revolution in the approach used in the common school system of Massachusetts, which in turn influenced the direction of other states. In carrying out his work, Mann met with bitter opposition by some Boston schoolmasters who strongly disapproved of his innovative pedagogical ideas, and by various religious sectarians, who contended against the exclusion of all sectarian instruction from the schools. =Secular nature= As the Old Deluder Satan Act and other Massachusetts School Laws attest, early education in Massachusetts had a clear religious intent. However, by the time of Mann's leadership in education, various developments (including a vibrant populist Protestant faith and increased religious diversity) fostered a secular school system with a religiously passive stance. While Mann affirmed that \\"our Public Schools are not Theological Seminaries\\" and that they were \\"debarred by law from inculcating the peculiar and distinctive doctrines of any one religious denomination amongst us ... or all that is essential to religion or to salvation,\\" he assured those who objected to this secular nature that \\"our system earnestly inculcates all Christian morals; it founds its morals on the basis of religion; it welcomes the religion of the Bible; and, in receiving the Bible, it allows it to do what it is allowed to do in no other system‚Äîto speak for itself. But here it stops, not because it claims to have compassed all truth; but because it disclaims to act as an umpire between hostile religious opinions.\\" Mann stated that this position resulted in a near-universal use of the Bible in the schools of Massachusetts and that this served as an argument against the assertion by some that Christianity was excluded from his schools, or that they were anti-Christian. A devotee of phrenology, Mann believed education could eliminate or reduce human failings and compensate for any biological flaws. Mann also once stated that \\"it may not be easy theoretically, to draw the line between those views of religious truth and of Christian faith which is common to all, and may, therefore, with propriety be inculcated in schools, and those which, being peculiar to individual sects, are therefore by law excluded; still it is believed that no practical difficulty occurs in the conduct of our schools in this regard.\\" Rather than sanctioning a particular church as was often the norm in many states, the Legislature proscribed books \\"calculated to favor the tenets of any particular set of Christians.\\" =Reading instruction= Like many nineteenth century reformers, Horace Mann believed that \\"children would find it far more interesting and pleasurable to memorize words and read short sentences and stories without having to bother to learn the names of the letters\\". According to Diane Ravitch, he condemned the alphabet method, claiming that it was \\"repulsive and soul-deadening to children\\". He described the letters of the alphabet as \\"skeleton-shaped, bloodless, ghostly apparitions\\". To him, teaching the alphabet was entirely illogical: \\"When we wish to give a child the idea of a new animal, we do not present successively the different parts of it,‚Äîan eye, an ear, the nose, the mouth, the body, or a leg: but we present a whole animal, as one object\\". Mann believed that \\"children's earliest books should teach whole words, skipping the alphabet and the sounds of the letters\\", though he may have been confused between \\"the alphabet method of learning letters through words and a word method, now called the look-and-say method, or learning to read through saying the word as a whole\\". U.S. Congress In the spring of 1848 he was elected to the United States Congress as a Whig to fill the vacancy caused by the death of John Quincy Adams. His first speech in that role was in advocacy of its right and duty to exclude slavery from the territories, and in a letter in December of that year he said: \\"I think the country is to experience serious times. Interference with slavery will excite civil commotion in the South. But it is best to interfere. Now is the time to see whether the Union is a rope of sand or a band of steel.\\" Again he said: \\"I really think if we insist upon passing the Wilmot proviso for the territories that the south‚Äîa part of them‚Äîwill rebel; but I would pass it, rebellion or not. I consider no evil so great as the extension of slavery.\\" During the first session, he volunteered as counsel for Drayton and Sayres, who were indicted for stealing 76 slaves in the District of Columbia, and at the trial was engaged for 21 successive days in their defense. In 1850, he was engaged in a controversy with Daniel Webster in regard to the extension of slavery and the Fugitive Slave Law, calling Webster's support for the Compromise of 1850 a \\"vile catastrophe\\", and comparing him to \\"Lucifer descending from Heaven\\".https://www.senate.gov/artandhistory/history/minute/Speech_Costs_Senator_His_Seat.htm Mann was defeated by a single vote at the ensuing nominating convention by Webster's supporters; but, on appealing to the people as an independent anti- slavery candidate, he was re-elected, serving from April 1848 until March 1853. Leadership of Antioch College and last years Original daguerreotype of Rep. Mann (Mass.) from Mathew Brady's studio, c. 1849. In September 1852, he was nominated for governor of Massachusetts by the Free Soil Party, and the same day was chosen president of the newly established Antioch College at Yellow Springs, Ohio. Failing in the election for governor, he accepted the presidency of the college, in which he continued until his death. There he taught economics, philosophy, and theology; he was popular with students and with lay audiences across the Midwest who attended his lectures promoting public schools. Mann also employed the first female faculty member to be paid on an equal basis with her male colleagues, Rebecca Pennell, his niece. His commencement message to the class of 1859 was to \\"be ashamed to die until you have won some victory for humanity\\". Antioch College was founded by the Christian Connexion, which later withdrew its financial support causing the college to struggle for many years with meager financial resources due to sectarian infighting. Mann himself was charged with nonadherence to sectarianism because, previously a Congregationalist by upbringing, he joined the Unitarian Church. He collapsed shortly after the 1859 commencement and died that summer. Antioch historian Robert Straker wrote that Mann had been \\"crucified by crusading sectarians.\\" Ralph Waldo Emerson lamented \\"what seems the fatal waste of labor and life at Antioch.\\" Mann's wife, who wrote in anguish that \\"the blood of martyrdom waters the spot,\\" later disinterred his body from Yellow Springs. He is buried in the North Burial Ground in Providence, Rhode Island,Horace Mann next to his first wife, Charlotte Messer Mann. (Charlotte Messer Mann was the daughter of Asa Messer, an early president of Brown University.) Legacy Many historians treat Mann as one of the most important leaders of education reform in the antebellum period. = Reading instruction = Mann's endorsement of \\"word method\\" for reading instruction made a lasting impression on other reformers of the period, and \\"by 1890 the alphabet method had virtually died out\\". Francis Parker and John Dewey used the \\"word method\\" as one of the features of the \\"Progressive\\" system of education. As Nancy Millichap notes, \\"Despite the enthusiasm of educators for their new methods of teaching, the illiteracy rate remained high. Among American soldiers enlisted in World War I, 24.9 percent proved unable to read or write, and during World War II approximately the same percentage of British servicemen [who were taught using the same method] were found to be similarly handicapped. In 1940, one third of high school students were incapable of mastering reading and writing well enough to profit from textbook instruction, and one half of the adult population in the United States was functionally illiterate\\". The backlash against \\"word method\\" culminated in a 1955 book Why Johnny Can't Read by Rudolf Flesch, in which he condemned this method for \\"treating children as if they were dogs\\" and recommended returning to teaching phonics. Nevertheless, the \\"ill-informed, ineffective reading instruction\\" remains the norm in American colleges of education and, accordingly, in American elementary schools. = Commemoration = Famous Americans seriesalt= Many places, including schools, around the world are named after Mann, among them the Horace Mann Auditorium at Bridgewater State University (formerly known as Bridgewater State College and Bridgewater State Normal School), and Horace Mann Elementary School in St Joseph, Missouri. Horace Mann's statue stands in front of the Massachusetts State House along with that of Daniel Webster. At Antioch College a monument carries his quote, which has been recently adopted as the college motto: \\"Be Ashamed to Die Until You Have Won Some Victory for Humanity.\\" The University of Northern Colorado named the gates to their campus in his dedication, a gift of the Class of 1910. The Springfield, Illinois-based Illinois Education Association Mutual Insurance Company, was renamed in honor of Mann in 1950 as the Horace Mann Educators Corporation. Pittsburg State University in Pittsburg, Kansas, has a building named Horace Mann School. It currently houses the Student Welcoming Center. In Massachusetts, public charter schools that are authorized by local school districts are known as Horace Mann charters. ‚Ä¢ Horace Mann Middle School, El Portal, Florida Emulation of the Prussian education system in the United States American educators were fascinated by German educational trends. In 1818, John Griscom gave a favorable report of Prussian education. Beginning in 1830, English translations were made of French philosopher Victor Cousin's work, \\"Report on the State of Public Education in Prussia.\\" Calvin E. Stowe, Henry Barnard, Horace Mann, George Bancroft and Joseph Cogswell all had a vigorous interest in German education. In 1843, Mann traveled to Germany to investigate how the educational process worked. Mann focused on two aspects of Prussian education upon his return to the United States: the creation of Normal Schools (although unlike Prussia, Mann advocated for a female-only teaching force) and well- appointed, safe, and well-resourced schoolhouses.

The mission launched from Kennedy Space Center in Florida on 16 January 2003 and during its 15 days, 22 hours, 20 minutes, 32 seconds in orbit conducted a multitude of international scientific experiments. An in-flight break up during reentry into the atmosphere on 1 February killed all seven crew members and disintegrated Columbia. Immediately after the disaster, NASA convened the Columbia Accident Investigation Board to determine the cause of the disintegration. The source of the failure was determined to have been caused by a piece of foam that broke off during launch and damaged the thermal protection system (reinforced carbon-carbon panels and thermal protection tiles) on the leading edge of the orbiter's left wing. During re-entry the damaged wing slowly overheated and came apart, eventually leading to loss of control and disintegration of the vehicle. The cockpit window frame is now exhibited in a memorial inside the Space Shuttle Atlantis Pavilion at the Kennedy Space Center in Florida. The damage to the thermal protection system on the wing was similar to that Atlantis had sustained back in 1988 during STS-27, the second mission after the Space Shuttle Challenger disaster. However, the damage on STS-27 occurred at a spot that had more robust metal, and that mission survived the re-entry. Mission highlights STS-107 carried the SPACEHAB Double Research Module on its inaugural flight, the Freestar experiment (mounted on a Hitchhiker Program rack), and the Extended Duration Orbiter pallet. SPACEHAB was first flown on STS-57. One of the experiments, a video taken to study atmospheric dust, may have detected a new atmospheric phenomenon, dubbed a \\"TIGER\\" (Transient Ionospheric Glow Emission in Red). On board Columbia was a copy of a drawing by Petr Ginz, the editor-in-chief of the magazine Vedem, who depicted what he imagined the Earth looked like from the Moon when he was a 14-year-old prisoner in the Terez√≠n concentration camp. The copy was in the possession of Ilan Ramon and was lost in the disintegration. Ramon also traveled with a dollar bill received from the Lubavitcher Rebbe. An Australian experiment, conducted by students from Glen Waverley Secondary College, was designed to test the reaction of zero gravity on the web formation of the Garden Orb Spider. =Major experiments= Examples of some of the experiments and investigations on the mission. In SPACEHAB RDM: *9 commercial payloads with 21 investigations, *4 payloads for the European Space Agency with 14 investigations *1 payload for ISS Risk Mitigation *18 payloads NASA's Office of Biological and Physical Research (OBPR) with 23 investigations In the payload bay attached to RDM: *Combined Two-Phase Loop Experiment (COM2PLEX), *Miniature Satellite Threat Reporting System (MSTRS) *Star Navigation (STARNAV).

Because much of the data was transmitted during the mission, there was still large return on the mission objectives even though it was lost on re-entry. Some of the experiments were also found on the ground. =Unsuccessful re-entry= Part of one of Columbias main engines later recovered. Columbia began re-entry as planned, but the heat shield was compromised due to damage sustained during the initial ascent. The heat of re- entry was free to spread into the damaged portion of the orbiter, ultimately causing its disintegration and the loss of all hands. The accident triggered a 7-month investigation and a search for debris, and over 85,000 pieces were collected over the course of the initial investigation. This amounted to roughly 38 percent of the orbiter vehicle. Crew Insignia STS-107 Robbins Medallion The mission insignia itself is the only patch of the shuttle program that is entirely shaped in the orbiter's outline. The central element of the patch is the microgravity symbol, ¬µg, flowing into the rays of the astronaut symbol. The mission inclination is portrayed by the 39-degree angle of the astronaut symbol to the Earth's horizon. The sunrise is representative of the numerous experiments that are the dawn of a new era for continued microgravity research on the International Space Station and beyond. The breadth of science and the exploration of space is illustrated by the Earth and stars. The constellation Columba (the dove) was chosen to symbolize peace on Earth and the Space Shuttle Columbia. The seven stars also represent the mission crew members and honor the original astronauts who paved the way to make research in space possible. Six stars have five points, the seventh has six points like a Star of David, symbolizing the Israeli Space Agency's contributions to the mission. An Israeli flag is adjacent to the name of Payload Specialist Ramon, who was the first Israeli in space. The crew insignia or 'patch' design was initiated by crew members Dr. Laurel Clark and Dr. Kalpana Chawla. First-time crew member Clark provided most of the design concepts as Chawla led the design of her maiden voyage STS-87 insignia. Clark also pointed out that the dove in the Columba constellation was mythologically connected to the explorers the Argonauts who released the dove.

Ramon was a space shuttle payload specialist of STS-107, the fatal mission of Columbia, in which he and six other crew members were killed in the re-entry accident. At 48, he was the oldest member of the crew. Ramon is the only foreign recipient of the United States Congressional Space Medal of Honor, which he was awarded posthumously. Biography Ramon was born in Ramat Gan, Israel, to Tonya (1929‚Äì2003) and Eliezer Wolferman (1923‚Äì2006). He grew up in Beersheba. His father was from Germany, and his family fled Nazi persecution in 1935. His mother and grandmother were from Poland, and were Holocaust survivors, having been in Auschwitz. They emigrated to Israel in 1949. His first name, Ilan, means \\"tree\\" in Hebrew. Ilan changed his last name from Wolferman to Ramon, a more \\"Israeli\\" name, when he joined the IAF. This was customary and expected of IAF pilots at the time. Ramon graduated from high school in 1972. In 1987, he graduated with a B.Sc. degree in electronics and computer engineering from Tel Aviv University. Air Force career Ramon as a Colonel in the Israeli Air Force The F-16 Netz 243 flown by Ramon in Operation Opera. The green and black triangular emblem on the nose commemorates the attack. Ilan Ramon was a Colonel (Aluf Mishne) and a fighter pilot in the Israeli Air Force, with thousands of hours of flying experience. He began the fighter pilot's course at the Israeli Air Force Flight Academy in 1972 but was forced to suspend his studies after breaking his hand. He served in an electronic warfare unit in the Sinai during the Yom Kippur War, and afterwards returned to the flight academy. He graduated from the fighter pilots' course in 1974. From 1974 to 1976 he participated in A-4 Skyhawk Basic Training and Operations. From 1976 to 1980 he participated in training and operations for the Mirage III-C. In 1980, as one of the IAF's establishment team of the first F-16 Squadron in Israel, he attended the F-16 Training Course at Hill Air Force Base, Utah. From 1981 to 1983, he served as the Deputy Squadron Commander B, F-16 Squadron. In 1981 he was the youngest pilot taking part in Operation Opera, Israel's strike against Iraq's unfinished Osiraq nuclear reactor. The facility was destroyed, killing ten Iraqi soldiers and one French researcher. He participated in the 1982 Lebanon War. After attending the Tel Aviv University, he served as Deputy Squadron Commander A, 119 Squadron, flying the F-4 Phantom (1988‚Äì90). During 1990, he attended the Squadron Commanders Course and between 1990 and 1992, commanded 117 Squadron, flying the F-16. From 1992‚Äì94, he was Head of the Aircraft Branch in the Operations Requirement Department. In 1994, he was promoted to the rank of Colonel and assigned as Head of the Department of Operational Requirement for Weapon Development and Acquisition. He stayed at this post until 1998. Ramon accumulated over 3,000 flight hours on the A-4, Mirage III-C, and F-4, and over 1,000 flight hours on the F-16. NASA experience Ramon in November 2001 =NASA on-ground trainings= In 1997, Ramon was selected as a Payload Specialist. He was designated to train as prime for a space shuttle mission with a payload that included a multispectral camera for recording desert aerosol (dust). In July 1998, he reported for training at the Johnson Space Center, Houston, Texas, where he trained until 2003. He flew aboard STS-107, logging 15 days, 22 hours and 20 minutes in space. =Space flight: STS-107, Space Shuttle Columbia= Ramon photographed aboard Columbia on January 26, 2003 STS-107 Columbia (January 16 ‚Äì February 1, 2003), a 16-day flight, was a dedicated science and research mission. Working 24 hours a day, in two alternating shifts, the crew successfully conducted approximately 80 experiments. Personally nonreligious, Ramon performed traditional observance while in orbit: \\"I feel I am representing all Jews and all Israelis.\\" He was the first spaceflight participant to request kosher food, and marked the Sabbath. The STS-107 mission ended abruptly when Space Shuttle Columbia was destroyed and its crew died during re-entry, 16 minutes before scheduled landing. Ramon, whose mother and grandmother were survivors of Auschwitz, was asked by S. Isaac Mekel, director of development at the American Society for Yad Vashem, to take an item from Yad Vashem aboard STS-107. Ramon carried with him a pencil sketch, Moon Landscape, drawn by 16-year-old Petr Ginz, who died in Auschwitz. Ramon also took with him a microfiche copy of the Torah given to him by Israeli president Moshe Katsav and a miniature Torah scroll (from the Holocaust) that was given him by Prof. Yehoyachin Yosef, a Bergen Belsen survivor. Ramon asked the 1939 Club, a Holocaust survivor organization in Los Angeles, for a symbol of the Holocaust to take into outer space with him. A barbed wire mezuzah by the San Francisco artist Aimee Golant was selected. Ramon also took with him a dollar of the Lubavitcher Rebbe, Rabbi Menachem M. Schneerson. Ramon and the rest of the Columbia crew died over East Texas in the Southern United States during entry into Earth's atmosphere, 16 minutes prior to scheduled landing. On November 10, 2013, the American Society for Yad Vashem held a special event with the participation of Petr Ginz's nephew and Ramon's son Tal, who performed a song he wrote in memory of his father. =Diary= Among the recovered 40% from the contents of the Columbia space shuttle that crashed outside Palestine, Texas were 37 pages of Ramon's diary, which NASA returned to his wife. These 37 pages from the diary he was keeping while in orbit survived the crash and were returned to his widow, Rona, who has shared an excerpt with the Israeli public in a display at Jerusalem's Israel Museum. Rona Ramon brought it to Israel Museum forensic experts. Only two pages were displayed, one containing Ramon's notes, and the other is a copy of the Kiddush prayer. Curator Yigal Zalmona said the diary was partially restored in one year, and needed four more, for police scientists to decipher 80% of the text. Zalmona stated: \\"The diary survived extreme heat in the explosion, extreme atmospheric cold, and then \\"was attacked by microorganisms and insects. It's almost a miracle that it survived ‚Äî it's incredible. There is 'no rational explanation' for how it was recovered when most of the shuttle was not, he said.\\" Ramon wrote on the last day of the journal: Inscribed in black ink and pencil, it covered the first six days of the 16-day mission. The papers remained white even though, exposed at high speed above the Earth, they should have burned. Family Ramon was survived by his wife Rona and their four children (Assaf, Tal, Yiftah, and Noa), who were in Florida at the time of the accident. =Assaf Ramon= Ramon's eldest son, Assaf (February 10, 1988 ‚Äì September 13, 2009), died aged 21 during a routine training flight while piloting his F-16A, three months after graduating from the IAF flight school Hatzerim Airbase as the top cadet in his class.Death of Ilan Ramon's son, Asaf Ramon (hebrew) He lost consciousness during a spell of vertigo, as a result of the high speed and G-force conditions to which he was subjected. This led to the plane crash and Ramon's subsequent death. Assaf was considered an excellent pilot. A lieutenant of the Israeli Air Force, he was posthumously promoted to the rank of captain. =Rona Ramon= Ramon's widow, Rona Ramon, served in the Israel Defense Forces as a paramedic and later earned a BA at the Wingate Institute. After Assaf's death, Rona returned to school and earned a master's degree in holistic health at Massachusetts' Lesley University. She also began to lecture about dealing with grief and finding coping mechanisms. She served as founding CEO of the nonprofit Ramon Foundation for youth academic excellence and social leadership through science and technology. Rona died on December 17, 2018, after battling pancreatic cancer. After her death, she was awarded Israel prize for lifetime achievement.

The Ar 80 was uninspiring in terms of performance and also suffered a number of failures. The contest was eventually won by the Messerschmitt Bf 109, and the Ar 80 prototypes ended their days as test aircraft. Design and development With the Nazi rise to power in February 1933, a plan was put into place to dramatically expand the Luftwaffe. The new and highly-political Reichsluftfahrtministerium (RLM) demanded that the large industrial firms cooperate, keeping construction as secret as possible. Arado Flugzeugwerke, under the direction of Erich Serno and Felix Wagenf√ºhr, largely stopped being a designer of aircraft and increasingly became a production facility for other companies. However, the company had just completed the Ar 65 biplane fighter. Several orders were placed for the Ar 65, and a follow-on Ar 68 model. This made Arado one of the few companies with actual fighter design experience, and they were considered for future developments In 1933, the Technisches Amt, the technical department of the RLM, concluded a series of research projects into the future of air combat. One of these was R√ºstungsflugzeug IV for an all- metal monoplane single-seat fighter aircraft, replacing the Ar 64 and Heinkel He 51 biplanes then in service. The plane needed to have a top speed of 400 km/h (250 mph) at 6,000 m (19,590 ft) which it could maintain for 20 minutes, while staying in the air for a total of 90 minutes. It was to be powered by the new Junkers Jumo 210 engine. It also needed to be armed with at least three machine guns with 1,000 rounds each, or one 20 mm cannon with 200 rounds. The plane needed to keep wing loading below 100 kg/m2, which is a way of defining its ability to turn and climb. The priorities for the plane were level speed, rate of climb, and maneuverability, in that order. Hermann G√∂ring sent out a letter in October 1933 asking for a \\"high speed courier aircraft\\" in order to start the work, and in May 1934, the actual R-IV request was sent out and made official. In addition to Heinkel and Arado, Focke-Wulf, and Bayerische Flugzeugwerke competed. They had to deliver three prototypes for head-to-head testing in late 1934. Although Blume was officially the director of design at Arado, it was Rethel who did most of the early work on the design. Rethel was well aware of the advantages and disadvantages of the monocoque technique, but the company had never built such a design and was thus at a distinct disadvantage in relation to Heinkel who had used it on their He 70 Blitz design from 1932. However he felt that he could not only design a successful monocoque aircraft, but in fact make one that was both lighter and easier to build than the techniques being used at other companies. His solution was to use two sets of skinning plates formed in long strips running front to back along the plane. The first set of plates was formed roughly into the shape of a C, which a small flange at the open ends of the C where they could be easily riveted to the hoop bulkheads. Using this system he was able to eliminate one more piece of internal structure, the stringers that would normally run between the bulkheads. He used a second set of sheets that were flat, so they could easily bend front-to-back. They were cut into teardrop shapes, which exactly fit into the gaps between the main stringers. Not only did this system allow for the \\"perfect\\" aerodynamic shape, but in theory it was also lighter and easier to build. The system looked so hopeful that other parts of the aircraft's design were allowed to be heavier and less risky as the weight savings in the fuselage should compensate. The rest of the plane was conventional. The forward fuselage and inner wings were formed up from steel tubing with removable aluminium sheeting over it, the outer wings were aluminium formers and skinned with aluminium on top and fabric on the bottom. Like the Heinkel designs, the wing included a reverse-gull bend to shorten the landing gear legs, but unlike the Heinkel it was almost straight on the leading and trailing edges instead of the more complex elliptical planform favoured by the G√ºnter brothers. In order to avoid cutting the outer wing formers with outward retracting gear, Rether decided to have the landing gear retract directly to the rear. To lie flat, the wheel would have to be rotated through 90¬∞ as it retracted, with its mainwheel resting atop the lower end of the strut as with the contemporary American Curtiss P-36 Hawk fighter design. To do this, Rethel placed the main oleo strut inside a larger tube that was mounted to the pivot point on the lower leading edge of the box-spar. As the gear retracted a small arm would pull on a lever mounted to the oleo, turning the leg inside the larger tube. Prototypes and testing The design, now known as the Ar 80, was completed without the aid of Rethel; he left the company in 1934 to join BFW leaving Blume in charge of the project. The plane was designed to mount the Jumo 210 engine, driving a wooden two-blade fixed- pitch propeller. However, this engine was not going to be ready until the contest was supposed to be over, so all of the contestants looked for other engines to fill the hole. In this case Arado proved to have the advantage, as they had already purchased a 391 kW (525 hp) Rolls-Royce Kestrel VI engine for use on their Ar 67 design. The engine had less than optimal supercharging which led to poor performance for the Ar 67. The V1 prototype first took to the air in the spring of 1935, one of the first of the planes in the contest to do so. However, one of the company test pilots lost control at low altitude only weeks later, and V1 was written off. The landing gear had already proven to be a real problem in these few short weeks. It continued to stick half- closed when retracted, although luckily it returned to the down position for landing. Repeated attempts to find the problem were fruitless, when they put the plane on blocks in the hangar it would always work flawlessly. Eventually, it was found that the air pressure on the front of the strut in flight made the oleo jam in its tube so it couldn't rotate. Another problem discovered during construction of the V1 was that Rethel's monocoque technique in fact turned out to be much heavier than expected. Some of this was a problem in the actual design; since the sheets ran the length of the plane, they had to be as thick as the thickest point on the entire plane. More traditional designs could use lighter or heavier gauges in various places. The main problem, however, was that the design required considerably more rivets than expected, and as a result the plane was overweight. V2 was rushed to completion but the Jumo was still unavailable. In order to give the contestants some sort of realistic engine, the RLM had traded Rolls-Royce an He 70 for four 518 kW (695 hp) Kestrel V engines. Although the V was the same basic engine as the VI, it had much better supercharging and was in fact the most powerful inline engine of the day. The various companies competed heavily for access to these engines for their prototypes. Perhaps some idea of the future outcome can be seen in the fact that BFW received two, Arado and Heinkel one each, and Focke-Wulf none at all. V2 was completed with the Kestrel by autumn of 1937, and started company testing. Once again, the gear proved to be a problem. Blume immediately blamed all of the problems on Rethel, after noting that he was always skeptical of the design. He decided that the performance problems of having fixed gear would be offset by its lighter weight, and the Ar 80 then reverted to using a well-spatted and faired set of gear similar to those used on their various biplane designs. Several months were lost in the conversion. The use of the fixed gear didn't save as much weight as expected and the plane was still 16% over the design weight at 1,630 kg (3,590 lb) empty. Fully loaded the plane was 2,100 kg (4,630 lb) even without armament, which made it underpowered even with the Kestrel V. Drag was also higher than expected. Thus, the plane proved to have very disappointing performance, reaching only 410 km/h (255 mph). In early 1936, the Jumo engines finally arrived. The 210 had even less takeoff power than the Kestrel, but its altitude performance was comparable. Speed did increase with this engine at higher altitudes, but low- level speed and climb performance both dropped. Arado argued that the fitting of a constant speed propeller would boost both, with the speed climbing to 425 km/h (264 mph), but this was not attempted before the plane was sent off to the contest. Although the Ar 80 had been one of the first planes to fly, the continued problems with the gear and engine supply meant it was one of the last to arrive for the head-to-head fly-off. It was delivered to Travem√ºnde on 8 February 1936, and later moved to meet the rest of the planes at Rechlin- L√§rz Airfield in March. It was clear all along that the plane had no chance against the Heinkel and BFW designs, a fact that Arado was made officially aware of after only one month. By this point, V3 was already finished. In order to try to save weight, the design had removed the gull-wing and replaced it with a \\"flat\\" one, requiring slightly longer gear legs. It also mounted the Jumo 210C with the constant-speed propeller, which boosted speed to 410 km/h (255 mph). By this time, the RLM had already given up on the design, so the plane was not sent for testing and instead hangared at the Arado plant. In 1937, the V3 was resurrected as a flying testbed for several experiments. It was fitted with a second seat behind the pilot for an observer, and also added an enclosed canopy. The plane was first used for testing a 20 mm cannon firing through the spinner, making it the first German cannon-armed fighter. This system, called the \\"motorkanone\\" - an armament format pioneered with the 37 mm cannon-armed French SPAD S.XII in World War I - would become a standard feature of most German inline engined fighter designs during the war. In 1938, the V3 was rebuilt once again, this time to test a new Fowler Flap design Arado was intending to use on their Ar 198 and Ar 240. Testing showed that the flap was so effective that the lift distribution along the wing changed radically, so a further modification was added to \\"droop\\" the ailerons along with the flaps. Testing continued for some time in this form, resulting in the \\"Arado traveling aileron\\" and \\"Arado landing flap\\".

She first flew on Space Shuttle Columbia in 1997 as a mission specialist and primary robotic arm operator. In 2003, Chawla was one of the seven crew members who died in the Space Shuttle Columbia disaster when the spacecraft disintegrated during its re-entry into the Earth's atmosphere. Chawla was posthumously awarded the Congressional Space Medal of Honor, and several streets, universities, and institutions have been named in her honor. She is regarded as a national hero in India. Early life Chawla was born on March 17, 1962, in Karnal, Haryana. Her family originally hails from Multan District (now in Pakistan), who settled in Karnal following the Partition of India. Kalpana‚Äôs official date of birth was altered to July 1, 1961, to allow her to become eligible for the matriculation exam. As a child, she was fascinated by aeroplanes and flying. She went to local flying clubs and watched planes with her father. Chawla said \\"Every once in a while we'd ask my dad if we could get a ride in one of these planes. And, he did take us to the flying club and we had a joyride in the Pushpak and a glider that the flying club had.\\" In 1976, Chawla graduated from the Tagore School, where she was a high-performing student. After getting a Bachelor of Engineering degree in Aeronautical Engineering from Punjab Engineering College, India, she moved to the United States in 1982 and obtained a Master of Science degree in Aerospace Engineering from the University of Texas at Arlington in 1984. Chawla went on to earn a second Masters in 1986 and a PhD in aerospace engineering in 1988 from the University of Colorado Boulder. Chawla was married to Jean-Pierre Harrison.Kalpana Chawla: Biography & Columbia Disaster Space.com, 2017-12-20.Columbia Shuttle Mission Imagery NASA, 2003-04-16.10 years after Columbia disaster, family members remember Denver Post, 2013-01-30. \\"Her husband Jean-Pierre Harrison remarried and has a young son. He runs a publishing company in Los Gatos, Calif.\\" Career In 1988, she began working at NASA Ames Research Center, where she did computational fluid dynamics (CFD) research on vertical and/or short take-off and landing (V/STOL) concepts. Much of Chawla's research is included in technical journals and conference papers. In 1993, she joined Overset Methods, Inc. as Vice President and Research Scientist specializing in simulation of moving multiple body problems. Chawla held a Certificated Flight Instructor rating for airplanes, gliders and Commercial Pilot licenses for single and multi-engine airplanes, seaplanes and gliders. After becoming a naturalized U.S. citizen in April 1991, Chawla applied for the NASA Astronaut Corps. She joined the corps in March 1995 and was selected for her first flight in 1996. = First space mission = Her first space mission began on November 19, 1997, as part of the six-astronaut crew that flew the Space Shuttle Columbia flight STS-87. Chawla was the first Indian woman to fly in space. She spoke the following words while traveling in the weightlessness of space, \\"You are just your intelligence.\\" On her first mission, Chawla traveled over 10.4 million miles (16737177.6 km) in 252 orbits of the earth, logging more than 372 hours (15 days and 12 hours) in space. During STS-87, she was responsible for deploying the Spartan Satellite which malfunctioned, necessitating a spacewalk by Winston Scott and Takao Doi to capture the satellite. A five-month NASA investigation fully exonerated Chawla by identifying errors in software interfaces and the defined procedures of the flight crew and ground control. After the completion of STS-87 post-flight activities, Chawla was assigned to technical positions in the astronaut office to work on the space station. = Second space mission = In 2001, Chawla was selected for her second flight as part of the crew of STS-107. This mission was repeatedly delayed due to scheduling conflicts and technical problems such as the July 2002 discovery of cracks in the shuttle engine flow liners. On January 16, 2003, Chawla finally returned to space aboard Space Shuttle Columbia on the ill-fated STS-107 mission. The crew performed nearly 80 experiments studying Earth and space science, advanced technology development, and astronaut health and safety. During the launch of STS-107, Columbias 28th mission, a piece of foam insulation broke off from the Space Shuttle external tank and struck the left-wing of the orbiter. Previous shuttle launches had seen minor damage from foam shedding, but some engineers suspected that the damage to Columbia was more serious. NASA managers limited the investigation, reasoning that the crew could not have fixed the problem if it had been confirmed. When Columbia re-entered the atmosphere of Earth, the damage allowed hot atmospheric gases to penetrate and destroy the internal wing structure, which caused the spacecraft to become unstable and break apart. After the disaster, Space Shuttle flight operations were suspended for more than two years, similar to the aftermath of the Challenger disaster. Construction of the International Space Station (ISS) was put on hold; the station relied entirely on the Russian Roscosmos State Corporation for resupply for 29 months until Shuttle flights resumed with STS-114 and 41 months for crew rotation.

From left to right: Brown, Husband, Clark, Kalpana Chawla, Anderson, McCool, Ramon Chawla died on February 1, 2003, in the Space Shuttle Columbia disaster, along with the other six crew members, when the Columbia disintegrated over Texas during re-entry into the Earth's atmosphere, shortly before it was scheduled to conclude its 28th mission, STS-107. Her remains were identified along with those of the rest of the crew members and were cremated and scattered at Zion National Park in Utah in accordance with her wishes.

Karl Schwarz (19 November 1812 - 25 March 1885) was a German Protestant theologian. Life =Birth and early life= He was born at Wiek, R√ºgen. His father, Theodor Schwarz, pastor at Wiek, was well known as a preacher, and as the writer of a number of popular works (parables, romances, etc.) under the pseudonym \\"Theodor Melas\\". =University studies= Karl Schwarz studied theology and philosophy at Halle, and afterwards at Bonn (1831) and Berlin (1832‚Äì1834). At Berlin he came under the influence of Schleiermacher and G. W. F. Hegel, whose influences are seen in his work Das Wesen der Religion (1847). In 1837 he was imprisoned for six months on account of his advanced political opinions. After his release he helped (from 1838) with the Hallische Jahrb√ºcher. =Later life and distinctions= From 1843 to 1845, he lectured at Halle, and was then suspended by the government. In 1849, however, he was appointed professor extraordinarius, and later received a number of distinctions (in 1858 chief court preacher, etc.). Schwarz took an important part in the founding and directing of the German Protestantenverein and became an eminent exponent of liberal theology. His work Zur Geschichte der neuesten Theologie (1856, 4th ed. 1869) is a valuable source for the history of theology in Germany. His other works include Lessing als Theologe (1854) and Grundriss der christ. Lehre (1873, 5th ed. 1876).

The disaster was the second fatal accident in the Space Shuttle program, after the 1986 breakup of Challenger soon after liftoff. During the launch of STS-107, Columbias 28th mission, a piece of foam insulation broke off from the Space Shuttle external tank and struck the left wing of the orbiter. Similar foam shedding had occurred during previous shuttle launches, causing damage that ranged from minor to nearly catastrophic, but some engineers suspected that the damage to Columbia was more serious.

The light-colored triangle visible at the base of the strut near the nose of the orbiter is the left bipod foam ramp which damaged the wing. The shuttle's main fuel tank was covered in thermal insulation foam intended to prevent ice from forming when the tank is full of liquid hydrogen and oxygen. Such ice could damage the shuttle if shed during lift-off. Mission STS-107 was the 113th Space Shuttle launch. Planned to begin on January 11, 2001, the mission was delayed 18 times and eventually launched on January 16, 2003, following STS-113. The Columbia Accident Investigation Board determined these delays had nothing to do with the catastrophic failure. At 81.7 seconds after launch from Kennedy Space Center's LC-39A, a suitcase- sized piece of foam broke off from the external tank (ET), striking Columbias left wing reinforced carbon-carbon (RCC) panels. As demonstrated by ground experiments conducted by the Columbia Accident Investigation Board, it is likely that this created a hole, allowing hot gases to enter the wing when Columbia later reentered the atmosphere. At the time of the foam strike, the orbiter was at an altitude of about , traveling at . The left bipod foam ramp is an approximately aerodynamic component made entirely of foam. The foam, not normally considered to be a structural material, is required to bear some aerodynamic loads. Because of these special requirements, the casting-in-place and curing of the ramps may be performed only by a senior technician. The bipod ramp (having left and right sides) was originally designed to reduce aerodynamic stresses around the bipod attachment points at the external tank, but it was proven unnecessary in the wake of the accident and was removed from the external tank design for tanks flown after STS-107 (another foam ramp along the liquid oxygen line was also later removed from the tank design to eliminate it as a foam debris source, after analysis and tests proved this change safe). Close-up of the left bipod foam ramp that broke off and damaged the shuttle wing Space Shuttle external tank foam block Bipod ramp insulation had been observed falling off, in whole or in part, on four previous flights: STS-7 (1983), STS-32 (1990), STS-50 (1992), and most recently STS-112 (just two launches before STS-107). All affected shuttle missions completed successfully. NASA management referred to this phenomenon as \\"foam shedding\\". As with the O-ring erosion problems that ultimately doomed the , NASA management became accustomed to these phenomena when no serious consequences resulted from these earlier episodes. This phenomenon was termed \\"normalization of deviance\\" by sociologist Diane Vaughan in her book on the Challenger launch decision process. As it happened, STS-112 had been the first flight with the \\"ET cam\\", a video feed mounted on the ET for the purpose of giving greater insight to the foam shedding problem. During that launch a chunk of foam broke away from the ET bipod ramp and hit the SRB-ET attachment ring near the bottom of the left solid rocket booster (SRB) causing a dent wide and inches deep in it. After STS-112, NASA leaders analyzed the situation and decided to press ahead under the justification that \\"[t]he ET is safe to fly with no new concerns (and no added risk)\\" of further foam strikes. Video taken during lift-off of STS-107 was routinely reviewed two hours later and revealed nothing unusual. The following day, higher-resolution film that had been processed overnight revealed the foam debris striking the left wing, potentially damaging the thermal protection on the Space Shuttle. At the time, the exact location where the foam struck the wing could not be determined due to the low resolution of the tracking camera footage. Meanwhile, NASA's judgment about the risks was revisited. Linda Ham, chair of the Mission Management Team (MMT), said, \\"Rationale was lousy then and still is.\\" Ham and Shuttle Program manager Ron Dittemore had both been present at the October 31, 2002 meeting where the decision to continue with launches was made. Post- disaster analysis revealed that two previous shuttle launches (STS-52 and -62) also had bipod ramp foam loss that went undetected. In addition, protuberance air load (PAL) ramp foam had also shed pieces, and there were also spot losses from large-area foams. Flight risk management In a risk-management situation similar to that of the Challenger disaster, NASA management failed to recognize the relevance of engineering concerns for safety and suggestions for imaging to inspect possible damage, and failed to respond to engineers' requests about the status of astronaut inspection of the left wing. Engineers made three separate requests for Department of Defense (DoD) imaging of the shuttle in orbit to determine damage more precisely. While the images were not guaranteed to show the damage, the capability existed for imaging of sufficient resolution to provide meaningful examination. NASA management did not accede to the requests, and in some cases intervened to stop the DoD from assisting. The CAIB recommended subsequent shuttle flights be imaged while in orbit using ground-based or space-based DOD assets. Details of the DoD's unfulfilled participation with Columbia remain secret; retired NASA official Wayne Hale stated in 2012 that \\"activity regarding other national assets and agencies remains classified and I cannot comment on that aspect of the Columbia tragedy\\". Throughout the risk assessment process, senior NASA managers were influenced by their belief that nothing could be done even if damage were detected. This affected their stance on investigation urgency, thoroughness and possible contingency actions. They decided to conduct a parametric \\"what-if\\" scenario study more suited to determine risk probabilities of future events, instead of inspecting and assessing the actual damage. The investigation report in particular singled out NASA manager Linda Ham for exhibiting this attitude.Columbia Accident Investigation Board, (2003) Volume 1, Chapter 6, p. 138. CAIB Report Volume 1 Part 2 (pdf). Retrieved June 8, 2006. In 2013, Hale recalled that Director of Mission Operations Jon C. Harpold shared with him before Columbias destruction a mindset which Hale himself later agreed was widespread at the time, even among the astronauts themselves: Much of the risk assessment hinged on damage predictions to the thermal protection system. These fall into two categories: damage to the silica tile on the wing lower surface, and damage to the reinforced carbon- carbon (RCC) leading-edge panels. The TPS includes a third category of components, thermal insulating blankets, but damage predictions are not typically performed on them. Damage assessments on the thermal blankets can be performed after an anomaly has been observed, and this was done at least once after the return to flight following Columbias loss. Before the flight NASA believed that the RCC was very durable. Charles F. Bolden, who worked on tile- damage scenarios and repair methods early in his astronaut career, said in 2004 that \\"never did we talk about [the RCC] because we all thought that it was impenetrable\\": Damage-prediction software was used to evaluate possible tile and RCC damage. The tool for predicting tile damage was known as \\"Crater\\", described by several NASA representatives in press briefings as not actually a software program but rather a statistical spreadsheet of observed past flight events and effects. The \\"Crater\\" tool predicted severe penetration of multiple tiles by the impact if it struck the TPS tile area, but NASA engineers downplayed this. It had been shown that the model overstated damage from small projectiles, and engineers believed that the model would also overstate damage from larger Spray-On Foam Insulation (SOFI) impacts. The program used to predict RCC damage was based on small ice impacts the size of cigarette butts, not larger SOFI impacts, as the ice impacts were the only recognized threats to RCC panels up to that point. Under one of 15 predicted SOFI impact paths, the software predicted an ice impact would completely penetrate the RCC panel. Engineers downplayed this, too, believing that impacts of the less dense SOFI material would result in less damage than ice impacts. In an e-mail exchange, NASA managers questioned whether the density of the SOFI could be used as justification for reducing predicted damage. Despite engineering concerns about the energy imparted by the SOFI material, NASA managers ultimately accepted the rationale to reduce predicted damage of the RCC panels from possible complete penetration to slight damage to the panel's thin coating. Ultimately the NASA Mission Management Team felt there was insufficient evidence to indicate that the strike was an unsafe situation, so they declared the debris strike a \\"turnaround\\" issue (not of highest importance) and denied the requests for the Department of Defense images. On January 23, flight director Steve Stich sent an e-mail to Columbia, informing commander Husband and pilot McCool of the foam strike while unequivocally dismissing any concerns about entry safety. Reentry timeline Columbia was scheduled to land at 09:16 EST. * 02:30 EST, February 1, 2003: The Entry Flight Control Team began duty in the Mission Control Center. :The Flight Control Team had not been working on any issues or problems related to the planned de-orbit and reentry of Columbia. In particular, the team had indicated no concerns regarding the debris that hit the left wing during ascent, and treated the reentry like any other. The team worked through the de-orbit preparation checklist and reentry checklist procedures. Weather forecasters, with the help of pilots in the Shuttle Training Aircraft, evaluated landing-site weather conditions at the Kennedy Space Center. * 08:00: Mission Control Center Entry Flight Director LeRoy Cain polled the Mission Control room for a decision for the de-orbit burn. :All weather observations and forecasts were within guidelines set by the flight rules, and all systems were normal. * 08:10: The Capsule Communicator (CAPCOM) (and astronaut) Charles O. Hobaugh told the crew that they were \\"go\\" for de-orbit burn. * 08:15:30 (EI-1719): Husband and McCool executed the de-orbit burn using Columbias two Orbital Maneuvering System engines. :The Orbiter was upside down and tail-first over the Indian Ocean at an altitude of and speed of when the burn was executed. A 2-minute, 38-second de-orbit burn during the 255th orbit slowed the Orbiter to begin its reentry into the atmosphere. The burn proceeded normally, putting the crew under about one-tenth gravity. Husband then turned Columbia right side up, facing forward with the nose pitched up. * 08:44:09 (EI+000): Entry Interface (EI), arbitrarily defined as the point at which the Orbiter entered the discernible atmosphere at , occurred over the Pacific Ocean. :As Columbia descended, the heat of reentry caused wing leading-edge temperatures to rise steadily, reaching an estimated during the next six minutes. Former Space Shuttle Program Manager Wayne Hale said in a press briefing that about 90% of this heating is the result of compression of the atmospheric gas caused by the orbiter's supersonic flight, rather than the result of friction. Columbia at about 08:57. Debris is visible coming from the left wing (bottom). The image was taken at Starfire Optical Range at Kirtland Air Force Base. * 08:48:39 (EI+270): A sensor on the left wing leading edge spar showed strains higher than those seen on previous Columbia reentries. :This was recorded only on the Modular Auxiliary Data System, which is similar to a flight data recorder, and was not sent to ground controllers or shown to the crew. * 08:49:32 (EI+323): Columbia executed a planned roll to the right. Speed: Mach 24.5. :Columbia began a banking turn to manage lift and therefore limit the Orbiter's rate of descent and heating. * 08:50:53 (EI+404): Columbia entered a 10-minute period of peak heating, during which the thermal stresses were at their maximum. Speed: Mach 24.1; altitude: . * 08:52:00 (EI+471): Columbia was about west of the California coastline. :The wing leading-edge temperatures usually reached at this point. * 08:53:26 (EI+557): Columbia crossed the California coast west of Sacramento. Speed: Mach 23; altitude: . Columbia debris (in red, orange, and yellow) detected by National Weather Service radar over Texas and Louisiana :The Orbiter's wing leading edge typically reached more than at this point. * 08:53:46 (EI+577): Various people on the ground saw signs of debris being shed. Speed: Mach 22.8; altitude: . :The hot air surrounding the Orbiter suddenly brightened, causing a streak in the Orbiter's luminescent trail that was quite noticeable in the predawn skies over the West Coast. Observers witnessed four similar events during the following 23 seconds. Dialogue on some of the amateur footage indicates the observers were aware of the abnormality of what they were filming. * 08:54:24 (EI+615): The MMACS officer, Jeff Kling, informed the Flight Director that \\"four hydraulic fluid temperature sensors in the left wing had stopped reporting.\\" In Mission Control, reentry had been proceeding normally up to this point. * 08:54:25 (EI+616): Columbia crossed from California into Nevada airspace. Speed: Mach 22.5; altitude: . :Witnesses observed a bright flash at this point and 18 similar events in the next four minutes. * 08:55:00 (EI+651): Nearly 11 minutes after Columbia reentered the atmosphere, wing leading-edge temperatures normally reached nearly . * 08:55:32 (EI+683): Columbia crossed from Nevada into Utah. Speed: Mach 21.8; altitude: . * 08:55:52 (EI+703): Columbia crossed from Utah into Arizona. * 08:56:30 (EI+741): Columbia began a roll reversal, turning from right to left over Arizona. * 08:56:45 (EI+756): Columbia crossed from Arizona to New Mexico. Speed: Mach 20.9; altitude: . * 08:57:24 (EI+795): Columbia passed just north of Albuquerque. * 08:58:00 (EI+831): At this point, wing leading- edge temperatures typically decreased to . * 08:58:20 (EI+851): Columbia crossed from New Mexico into Texas. Speed: Mach 19.5; altitude: . :At about this time, the Orbiter shed a Thermal Protection System tile, the most westerly piece of debris that has been recovered. Searchers found the tile in a field in Littlefield, Texas, just northwest of Lubbock. * 08:59:15 (EI+906): MMACS informed the Flight Director that \\"pressure readings on both left main landing-gear tires were indicating 'off-scale low'.\\" :\\"Off-scale low\\" is a reading that falls below the minimum capability of the sensor, and it usually indicates that the sensor has stopped functioning, due to internal or external factors, not that the quantity it measures is actually below the sensor's minimum response value. * 08:59:32 (EI+923): A broken response from mission commander Rick Husband was recorded: \\"Roger, uh, bu ‚Äì [cut off in mid-word] ...\\" It was the last communication from the crew and the last telemetry signal received in Mission Control. The Flight Director then instructed the Capsule Communicator (CAPCOM) to let the crew know that Mission Control saw the messages and was evaluating the indications, and added that the Flight Control Team did not understand the crew's last transmission. * 08:59:37 (EI+928): Hydraulic pressure, which is required to move the flight control surfaces, was lost at about 08:59:37. At that time, the Master Alarm would have sounded for the loss of hydraulics, used to move flight control surfaces. The shuttle would have started to roll and yaw uncontrollably, and the crew would have become aware of the serious problem. * 09:00:18 (EI+969): Videos and eyewitness reports by observers on the ground in and near Dallas indicated that the Orbiter had disintegrated overhead, continued to break up into smaller pieces, and left multiple ion trails, as it continued eastward. In Mission Control, while the loss of signal was a cause for concern, there was no sign of any serious problem. Before the orbiter broke up at 09:00:18, the Columbia cabin pressure was nominal and the crew was capable of conscious actions. Although the crew module remained mostly intact through the breakup, it was damaged enough that it lost pressure at a rate fast \\"enough to incapacitate the crew within seconds\\", and was completely depressurized no later than 09:00:53. * 09:00:57 (EI+1008): The crew module, intact to this point, was seen breaking into small subcomponents. It disappeared from view at 09:01:10. The crew members, if not already dead, were killed no later than this point. * 09:05: Residents of north central Texas, particularly near Tyler, reported a loud boom, a small concussion wave, smoke trails and debris in the clear skies above the counties east of Dallas. * 09:12:39 (EI+1710): After hearing of reports of the orbiter being seen to break apart, Entry Flight Director LeRoy Cain declared a contingency (events leading to loss of the vehicle) and alerted search-and-rescue teams in the debris area. He called on the Ground Control Officer to \\"lock the doors\\", meaning no one would be permitted to enter or leave until everything needed for investigation of the accident had been secured. Two minutes later, Mission Control put contingency procedures into effect. Crew survivability aspects In 2008, NASA released a detailed report on survivability aspects of the Columbia reentry. In 2014, NASA released a further report detailing the aeromedical aspects of the disaster. The crew were exposed to five lethal events in the following order: =Depressurization= After the initial loss of control, Columbias cabin pressure remained normal, and the crew were not incapacitated. During this period the crew attempted to regain control of the shuttle. As Columbia spun out of control, aerodynamic forces caused the orbiter to yaw to the right, exposing its underside to extreme aerodynamic forces and causing it to break up. Depressurization began when the shuttle forebody separated from the midbody 41 seconds after loss of control. The crew module pressure vessel was penetrated when it collided with the fuselage, and the \\"depressurization rate was high enough to incapacitate the crew members within seconds so that they were unable to perform actions such as lowering their visors.\\" The crew lost consciousness, suffering massive pulmonary barotrauma, ebullism and cessation of respiration. =Off-nominal dynamic G environment= The shuttle's separated nose section rotated unsteadily about all three axes. The crew (now unconscious or dead) were unable to brace against this motion, and were also harmed by aspects of their protective equipment: * Lack of upper-body and limb restraints: the crew's torsos were free to move because the strap velocity was lower than the locking threshold velocity of the inertia reel system, and because the seat restraints did not prevent lateral movement. Fractures consistent with flailing arms and legs were also observed. * Non-conformal helmets: unlike a racing helmet, the ACES suit helmets allowed the crew's heads to move inside the helmet, causing blunt force trauma during collisions. The helmet neck ring acted as a fulcrum for cervical vertebrae fractures as the skull whipped backwards, as well as inflicting jaw injuries when wind blasted the helmet off. =Separation of the crew members from the crew module and the seats= As the crew module disintegrated, the crew received lethal trauma from their seat restraints and were exposed to the hostile aerodynamic and thermal environment of reentry, as well as molten Columbia debris. =Exposure to high-speed and high-altitude environment= After separation from the crew module, the bodies of the crew members entered an environment with almost no oxygen, very low atmospheric pressure, and both high temperatures caused by deceleration, and extremely low ambient temperatures. NASA stated that despite not being certified for those conditions, the ACES suit \\"may potentially be capable of protecting the crew\\" above 100,000 feet, although in Columbia's case the crew's suits had already been destroyed by the cabin's thermal environment during breakup. Recovered tissue samples showed evidence of ebullism, indicating the crew was exposed to an altitude above 63,500 feet when depressurization of the cabin occurred. =Ground impact= The bodies of the crew members \\"had lethal-level injuries caused by ground impact.\\" The official NASA report omitted some of the more graphic details on the recovery of the remains; witnesses reported finds such as a skull, human heart, a portion of an upper torso, and parts of femur bones. All evidence indicated that crew error was in no way responsible for the disintegration of the orbiter, and they had acted correctly and according to procedure at the first indication of trouble. Although some of the crew were not wearing gloves or helmets during reentry and some were not properly restrained in their seats, doing these things would have added nothing to their survival chances other than perhaps keeping them alive and conscious another 30 or so seconds. Presidential response President George W. Bush's address on the Columbias destruction, February 1, 2003 At 14:04 EST (19:04 UTC), President George W. Bush said, \\"My fellow Americans, this day has brought terrible news, and great sadness to our country. At 9 o'clock this morning, Mission Control in Houston lost contact with our Space Shuttle Columbia. A short time later, debris was seen falling from the skies above Texas. The Columbia is lost; there are no survivors.\\" Despite the disaster, Bush said, \\"The cause in which they died will continue...Our journey into space will go on.\\" Bush later declared East Texas a federal disaster area, allowing federal agencies to help with the recovery effort.Introduction to Emergency Management, Fourth Edition, Butterworth-Heinemann, Burlington, 2010, p. 166. Recovery of debris A grid on the floor is used to organize recovered debris Recovered power-head of one of Columbias main engines Debris from the spacecraft was found in more than 2,000 separate fields in eastern Texas, western Louisiana and the southwestern counties of Arkansas. A large amount of debris was recovered between Tyler, Texas, and Palestine, Texas. One field stretched from south of Fort Worth to Hemphill, Texas, and into Louisiana.Columbia Accident Investigation Board, (2003) Volume 1, Chapter 2, p. 41. Places that had debris included Stephen F. Austin State University in Nacogdoches, Texas, and several casinos in Shreveport, Louisiana. Along with pieces of the shuttle and bits of equipment, searchers also found human body parts, including arms, feet, a torso, and a heart. These recoveries occurred along a line south of Hemphill, Texas and west of the Toledo Bend Reservoir. Much of the terrain being searched for the crew was densely forested and difficult to traverse. The bodies of five of the seven crew of Columbia were found within three days of the shuttle's breakup; the last two were found 10 days after that. In the months after the disaster, the largest-ever organized ground search took place. Thousands of volunteers descended upon Texas to participate in the effort to gather the Shuttle's remains. According to Mike Ciannilli, Project Manager of the Columbia Research and Preservation Office, the searchers \\"put their life on hold to help out the nation's space program,\\" showing \\"what space means to people.\\" NASA issued warnings to the public that any debris could contain hazardous chemicals, that it should be left untouched, its location reported to local emergency services or government authorities, and that anyone in unauthorized possession of debris would be prosecuted. Some firefighters used Geiger counters to test those who had picked up debris. These same people were also asked to put their clothes into medical waste bags and use anti-microbial soap. Because of the widespread area, volunteer amateur radio operators accompanied the search teams to provide communications support. A group of small () adult Caenorhabditis elegans worms, living in petri dishes enclosed in aluminum canisters, survived reentry and impact with the ground and were recovered weeks after the disaster. The culture was found to be alive on April 28, 2003.Worms Survive Shuttle Disaster Fall 2003 The worms were part of a biological research in canisters experiment designed to study the effect of weightlessness on physiology; the experiment was conducted by Cassie Conley, NASA's planetary protection officer. Debris Search Pilot Jules F. Mier Jr. and Debris Search Aviation Specialist Charles Krenek died in a helicopter crash that injured three others during the search. Some Texas residents recovered some of the debris, ignoring the warnings, and attempted to sell it on the online auction site eBay, starting at $10,000. The auction was quickly removed, but prices for Columbia merchandise such as programs, photographs and patches, went up dramatically following the disaster, creating a surge of Columbia-related listings. A three-day amnesty offered for \\"looted\\" shuttle debris brought in hundreds of illegally recovered pieces. During the amnesty period, \\"quite a few\\" individuals called about turning in property to NASA, including some who had debris from the Challenger accident. About 40,000 recovered pieces of debris have never been identified. The largest pieces recovered include the front landing gear and a window frame. The glow of reentry as seen out of the front windows On May 9, 2008, it was reported that data from a disk drive on board Columbia had survived the shuttle accident, and while part of the 340 MB drive was damaged, 99% of the data was recovered. The drive was used to store data from an experiment on the properties of shear thinning. On July 29, 2011, Nacogdoches authorities told NASA that a piece of debris had been found in a lake. NASA identified the piece as a power reactant storage and distribution tank. All recovered non-human Columbia debris is stored in unused office space at the Vehicle Assembly Building, except for parts of the crew compartment, which are kept separate. =Crew cabin video= Video taken by the crew of part of reentry which ends four minutes before the disaster. Among the recovered items was a videotape recording made by the astronauts during the start of reentry. The 13-minute recording shows the flight crew astronauts conducting routine reentry procedures and joking with each other. None gives any indication of a problem. In the video, the flight- deck crew puts on their gloves and passes the video camera around to record plasma and flames visible outside the windows of the orbiter, a normal occurrence during reentry. At one point on the tape, Mission Control asked Clark to perform some small task. She replied that she was currently occupied but would get to it in a minute. \\"Don't worry about it,\\" she was told. \\"You have all the time in the world.\\" The recording, which on normal flights would have continued through landing, ends about four minutes before the shuttle began to disintegrate and 11 minutes before Mission Control lost the signal from the orbiter. Investigation =Initial investigation= Mock-up of a Space Shuttle leading edge made with an RCC-panel taken from . Simulation of known and possible conditions of the foam impact on 's final launch showed brittle fracture of RCC. NASA Space Shuttle Program Manager Ron Dittemore reported that \\"The first indication was loss of temperature sensors and hydraulic systems on the left wing. They were followed seconds and minutes later by several other problems, including loss of tire pressure indications on the left main gear and then indications of excessive structural heating\\". Analysis of 31seconds of telemetry data which had initially been filtered out because of data corruption within it showed the shuttle fighting to maintain its orientation, eventually using maximum thrust from its Reaction Control System jets. The investigation focused on the foam strike from the very beginning. Incidents of debris strikes from ice and foam causing damage during take-off were already well known, and had damaged orbiters, most noticeably during STS-45, STS-27, and STS-87. After the loss of Columbia, NASA incorrectly concluded that mistakes during installation were the likely cause of foam loss, and retrained employees at Michoud Assembly Facility in Louisiana to apply foam without defects. Tile damage had also been traced to ablating insulating material from the cryogenic fuel tank in the past. =Columbia Accident Investigation Board= Following protocols established after the loss of , an independent investigating board was created immediately after the accident. The Columbia Accident Investigation Board, or CAIB, was chaired by retired U.S. Navy Admiral Harold W. Gehman, Jr., and consisted of expert military and civilian analysts who investigated the accident in detail. Columbias flight data recorder was found near Hemphill, Texas, on March 19, 2003. Unlike commercial jet aircraft, the space shuttles did not have flight data recorders intended for after-crash analysis. Instead, the vehicle data were transmitted in real time to the ground via telemetry. Since Columbia was the first shuttle, it had a special flight data OEX (Orbiter EXperiments) recorder, designed to help engineers better understand vehicle performance during the first test flights. The recorder was left in Columbia after the initial Shuttle test-flights were completed, and it was still functioning on the crashed flight. It recorded many hundreds of parameters, and contained very extensive logs of structural and other data, which allowed the CAIB to reconstruct many of the events during the process leading to breakup. Investigators could often use the loss of signals from sensors on the wing to track how the damage progressed. This was correlated with forensic debris analysis conducted at Lehigh University and other tests to obtain a final conclusion about the probable course of events. Beginning on May 30, 2003, foam impact tests were performed by Southwest Research Institute. They used a compressed air gun to fire a foam block of similar size and mass to that which struck Columbia, at the same estimated speed. To represent the leading edge of Columbias left wing, RCC panels from NASA stock, along with the actual leading-edge panels from , which were fiberglass, were mounted to a simulating structural metal frame. At the beginning of testing, the likely impact site was estimated to be between RCC panel 6 and 9, inclusive. Over many days, dozens of the foam blocks were shot at the wing leading edge model at various angles. These produced only cracks or surface damage to the RCC panels. During June, further analysis of information from Columbias flight data recorder narrowed the probable impact site to one single panel: RCC wing panel 8. On July 7, in a final round of testing, a block fired at the side of an RCC panel 8 created a hole in that protective RCC panel. The tests demonstrated that a foam impact of the type Columbia sustained could seriously breach the thermal protection system on the wing leading edge. =Conclusions= On August 26, 2003, the CAIB issued its report on the accident. The report confirmed the immediate cause of the accident was a breach in the leading edge of the left wing, caused by insulating foam shed during launch. The report also delved deeply into the underlying organizational and cultural issues that led to the accident. The report was highly critical of NASA's decision-making and risk- assessment processes. It concluded the organizational structure and processes were sufficiently flawed that a compromise of safety was expected, no matter who was in the key decision-making positions. An example was the position of Shuttle Program Manager, where one individual was responsible for achieving safe, timely launches and acceptable costs, which are often conflicting goals. The CAIB report found that NASA had accepted deviations from design criteria as normal when they happened on several flights and did not lead to mission- compromising consequences. One of those was the conflict between a design specification stating that the thermal protection system was not designed to withstand significant impacts and the common occurrence of impact damage to it during flight. The board made recommendations for significant changes in processes and organizational culture. On December 30, 2008, NASA released a further report, titled Columbia Crew Survival Investigation Report, produced by a second commission, the Spacecraft Crew Survival Integrated Investigation Team (SCSIIT). NASA had commissioned this group, \\"to perform a comprehensive analysis of the accident, focusing on factors and events affecting crew survival, and to develop recommendations for improving crew survival for all future human space flight vehicles.\\" The report concluded that: \\"The Columbia depressurization event occurred so rapidly that the crew members were incapacitated within seconds, before they could configure the suit for full protection from loss of cabin pressure. Although circulatory systems functioned for a brief time, the effects of the depressurization were severe enough that the crew could not have regained consciousness. This event was lethal to the crew.\\" The report also concluded: * The crew did not have time to prepare themselves. Some crew members were not wearing their safety gloves, and one crew member was not wearing a helmet. New policies gave the crew more time to prepare for descent. * The crew's safety harnesses malfunctioned during the violent descent. The harnesses on the three remaining shuttles were upgraded after the accident. The key recommendations of the report included that future spacecraft crew survival systems should not rely on manual activation to protect the crew.Columbia Crew Survival Investigation Report . =Other contributing factors= Upgrades to the leading edge proposed in the early 1990s were not funded because NASA was working on the later-cancelled VentureStar single-stage-to-orbit shuttle replacement. Additionally, the original white paint on the fuel tanks was removed to save , exposing the rust-orange-colored foam; this was considered as a potential contributing factor, but was ultimately unlikely to have contributed to the foam shedding. =Possible emergency procedures= One question of special importance was whether NASA could have saved the astronauts had they known of the danger. This would have to involve either rescue or repair ‚Äì docking at the International Space Station for use as a haven while awaiting rescue (or to use the Soyuz to systematically ferry the crew to safety) would have been impossible due to the different orbital inclination of the vehicles. The CAIB determined that a rescue mission, though risky, might have been possible provided NASA management had taken action soon enough. Normally, a rescue mission is not possible, due to the time required to prepare a shuttle for launch, and the limited consumables (power, water, air) of an orbiting shuttle. Atlantis was well along in processing for a planned March 1 launch on STS-114, and Columbia carried an unusually large quantity of consumables due to an Extended Duration Orbiter package. The CAIB determined that this would have allowed Columbia to stay in orbit until flight day 30 (February 15). NASA investigators determined that Atlantis processing could have been expedited with no skipped safety checks for a February 10 launch. Hence, if nothing went wrong, there was a five-day overlap for a possible rescue. As mission control could deorbit an empty shuttle, but could not control the orbiter's reentry and landing, it is likely that it would have sent Columbia into the Pacific Ocean; NASA later developed the Remote Control Orbiter system to permit mission control to land a shuttle. NASA investigators determined that on-orbit repair by the shuttle astronauts was possible but overall considered \\"high risk\\", primarily due to the uncertain resiliency of the repair using available materials and the anticipated high risk of doing additional damage to the Orbiter. Columbia did not carry the Canadarm, or Remote Manipulator System, which would normally be used for camera inspection or transporting a spacewalking astronaut to the wing. Therefore, an unusual emergency extra- vehicular activity (EVA) would have been required. While there was no astronaut EVA training for maneuvering to the wing, astronauts are always prepared for a similarly difficult emergency EVA to close the external tank umbilical doors located on the orbiter underside, which is necessary for reentry in the event of failure. Similar methods could have reached the shuttle left wing for inspection or repair. For the repair, the CAIB determined that the astronauts would have to use tools and small pieces of titanium, or other metal, scavenged from the crew cabin. These metals would help protect the wing structure and would be held in place during reentry by a water-filled bag that had turned into ice in the cold of space. The ice and metal would help restore wing leading edge geometry, preventing a turbulent airflow over the wing and therefore keeping heating and burn-through levels low enough for the crew to survive reentry and bail out before landing. The CAIB could not determine whether a patched-up left wing would have survived even a modified reentry, and concluded that the rescue option would have had a considerably higher chance of bringing Columbias crew back alive. Memorials On February 2, 2003, and throughout March, April, and May 2003, large memorial Catholic Brazilian masses and Roman Catholic memorial concerts were held in Rio de Janeiro, Sao Paulo, and other cities in Brazil where Brazilian Catholic priest Marcelo Rossi and his concert partner Belo sang a Christian hymn \\"Noites Trai√ßoeiras\\" (Treacherous Nights) as tribute to the seven Columbia astronauts, as well as the other seven crew members who lost their lives in the Space Shuttle Challenger disaster in 1986. The concerts were televised to millions throughout Brazil and the world. Columbias window frames on display as part of the \\"Forever Remembered\\" installation at Kennedy Space Center Visitor Complex in 2018 On February 4, 2003, President George W. Bush and his wife Laura led a memorial service for the astronauts' families at the Lyndon B. Johnson Space Center. Two days later, Vice President Dick Cheney and his wife Lynne led a similar service at Washington National Cathedral. Patti LaBelle sang \\"Way Up There\\" as part of the service. A makeshift memorial at the main entrance to the Lyndon B. Johnson Space Center in Houston, Texas Columbia Memorial in Arlington National Cemetery Columbia memorial on Mars Exploration Rover Spirit Space Shuttle Columbia memorial ‚Äì Sabine County, Texas On March 26, the United States House of Representatives' Science Committee approved funds for the construction of a memorial at Arlington National Cemetery for the STS-107 crew. A similar memorial was built at the cemetery for the last crew of . On October 28, 2003, the names of the astronauts were added to the Space Mirror Memorial at the Kennedy Space Center Visitor Complex in Merritt Island, Florida, alongside the names of several astronauts and cosmonauts who have died in the line of duty. On April 1, 2003, the Opening Day of baseball season, the Houston Astros (named in honor of the U.S. space program) honored the Columbia crew by having seven simultaneous first pitches thrown by family and friends of the crew. For the National Anthem, 107 NASA personnel, including flight controllers and others involved in Columbias final mission, carried a U.S. flag onto the field. In addition, the Astros wore the mission patch on their sleeves and replaced all dugout advertising with the mission patch logo for the entire season. On February 1, 2004, the first anniversary of the Columbia disaster, Super Bowl XXXVIII held in Houston's Reliant Stadium began with a pregame tribute to the crew of the Columbia by singer Josh Groban performing \\"You Raise Me Up\\", with the crew of STS-114, the first post-Columbia Space Shuttle mission, in attendance. In 2004, Bush conferred posthumous Congressional Space Medals of Honor to all 14 crew members lost in the Challenger and Columbia accidents. NASA named several places in honor of Columbia and the crew. Seven asteroids discovered in July 2001 at the Mount Palomar observatory were officially given the names of the seven astronauts: 51823 Rickhusband, 51824 Mikeanderson, 51825 Davidbrown, 51826 Kalpanachawla, 51827 Laurelclark, 51828 Ilanramon, 51829 Williemccool. On Mars, the landing site of the rover Spirit was named Columbia Memorial Station, and included a memorial plaque to the Columbia crew mounted on the back of the high gain antenna. A complex of seven hills east of the Spirit landing site was dubbed the Columbia Hills; each of the seven hills was individually named for a member of the crew, and Husband Hill in particular was ascended and explored by the rover. In 2006, the IAU approved naming of a cluster of seven small craters in the Apollo basin on the far side of the Moon after the astronauts.Husband crater, Gazetteer of Planetary Nomenclature, International Astronomical Union Working Group for Planetary System Nomenclature Back on Earth, NASA's National Scientific Balloon Facility was renamed the Columbia Scientific Balloon Facility. Other tributes included the decision by Amarillo, Texas, to rename its airport Rick Husband Amarillo International Airport after the Amarillo native. Washington State Route 904 was renamed Lt. Michael P. Anderson Memorial Highway, as it runs through Cheney, Washington, the town where he graduated from high school. A newly constructed elementary school located on Fairchild Air Force Base near Spokane, Washington, was named Michael Anderson Elementary School. Anderson had attended fifth grade at Blair Elementary, the base's previous elementary school, while his father was stationed there. A mountain peak near Kit Carson Peak and Challenger Point in the Sangre de Cristo Range was renamed Columbia Point, and a dedication plaque was placed on the point in August 2003. Seven dormitories were named in honor of Columbia crew members at the Florida Institute of Technology, Creighton University, The University of Texas at Arlington, and the Columbia Elementary School in the Brevard County School District. The Huntsville City Schools in Huntsville, Alabama, a city strongly associated with NASA, named their most recent high school Columbia High School as a memorial to the crew. A Department of Defense school in Guam was renamed Commander William C. McCool Elementary School. The City of Palmdale, California, the birthplace of the entire shuttle fleet, changed the name of the thoroughfare Avenue M to Columbia Way. In Avondale, Arizona, the Avondale Elementary School where Michael Anderson's sister worked had sent a T-shirt with him into space. It was supposed to have an assembly when he returned from space. The school was later renamed Michael Anderson Elementary. The first dedicated meteorological satellite launched by the Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO) on September 2, 2002, named Metsat-1, was later renamed Kalpana-1 by Indian Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee in memory of India- born Kalpana Chawla. In October 2004, both houses of Congress passed a resolution authored by U.S. Representative Lucille Roybal-Allard and co- sponsored by the entire contingent of California representatives to Congress changing the name of Downey, California's Space Science Learning Center to the Columbia Memorial Space Science Learning Center. The facility is located at the former manufacturing site of the space shuttles, including Columbia and Challenger.Barragan, James (February 14, 2014) \\"Downey space museum is struggling to survive\\" Los Angeles Times The U.S. Air Force's Squadron Officer School at Maxwell Air Force Base, Alabama, renamed their auditorium in Husband's honor. He was a graduate of the program. The U.S. Test Pilot School at Edwards Air Force Base in California named its pilot lounge for Husband. NASA named a supercomputer \\"Columbia\\" in the crew's honor in 2004. It was located at the NASA Advanced Supercomputing Division at Ames Research Center on Moffett Federal Airfield near Mountain View, California. The first part of the system, built in 2003, known as \\"Kalpana\\" was dedicated to Chawla, who worked at Ames prior to joining the Space Shuttle program. A U.S. Navy compound at a major coalition military base in Afghanistan is named Camp McCool. In addition, the athletic field at McCool's alma mater, Coronado High School in Lubbock, Texas, was renamed the Willie McCool Track and Field. A proposed reservoir in Cherokee County in Eastern Texas is to be named Lake Columbia. Ilan Ramon High School was established in 2006 in Hod HaSharon, Israel, in tribute to the first Israeli astronaut. The school's symbol shows the planet Earth with an aircraft orbiting around it. The National Naval Medical Center dedicated Laurel Clark Memorial Auditorium on July 11, 2003. Gamma Phi Beta sorority, of which Clark was a member, created the Laurel Clark Foundation in her honor. A fountain in downtown Racine, Wisconsin, which Clark considered her hometown, was named for her.Fiori, Lindsay. \\"Laurel Clark Memorial Fountain features new additions\\" , Racine Journal Times, May 27, 2008. PS 58 in Staten Island, New York, was named Space Shuttle Columbia School in honor of the failed mission. The Challenger Columbia Stadium in League City, Texas is named in honor of the victims of both the Columbia disaster as well as the Challenger disaster in 1986. A tree for each astronaut was planted in NASA's Astronaut Memorial Grove at the Johnson Space Center in Houston, Texas, not far from the Saturn V building, along with trees for each astronaut from the Apollo 1 and Challenger disasters. Tours of the space center pause briefly near the grove for a moment of silence, and the trees can be seen from nearby NASA Road 1. Columbia Colles, a range of hills on Pluto discovered by the New Horizons spacecraft in July 2015, was named in honor of the victims of the disaster. A starship on Star Trek: Enterprise was named NX-02 Columbia in honor of the Columbia. A photo tribute commemorating the Columbia and its crew is displayed in the \\"Wings of Fame\\" section of the queue for Soarin' Around the World at Disney California Adventure park alongside many other famous air and space craft. The Columbia Memorial Space Center is a museum built in honor of the Columbia in Downey, California. At the 2003 Daytona 500, which happened 2 weeks after the disaster, all racecars bore Columbia decals in honor of those who were lost. In March 2003, the School Board of the Val Verde Unified School District in California named a new school in honor of the Space Shuttle Columbia and its seven crew members. Columbia Elementary school opened in August 2004, and is located in Perris, California. Effect on space programs Following the loss of Columbia, the space shuttle program was suspended. The further construction of the International Space Station (ISS) was also delayed, as the space shuttles were the only available delivery vehicle for station modules. The station was supplied using Russian uncrewed Progress ships, and crews were exchanged using Russian-crewed Soyuz spacecraft, and forced to operate on a skeleton crew of two. Less than a year after the accident, President Bush announced the Vision for Space Exploration, calling for the space shuttle fleet to complete the ISS, with retirement by 2010 following the completion of the ISS, to be replaced by a newly developed Crew Exploration Vehicle for travel to the Moon and Mars. NASA planned to return the space shuttle to service around September 2004; that date was pushed back to July 2005. On July 26, 2005, at 10:39 EST, Space Shuttle Discovery cleared the tower on the \\"Return to Flight\\" mission STS-114, marking the shuttle's return to space. Overall the STS-114 flight was highly successful, but a similar piece of foam from a different portion of the tank was shed, although the debris did not strike the Orbiter. Due to this, NASA once again grounded the shuttles until the remaining problem was understood and a solution implemented. After delaying their reentry by two days due to adverse weather conditions, Commander Eileen Collins and Pilot James M. Kelly returned Discovery safely to Earth on August 9, 2005. Later that same month, the external tank construction site at Michoud was damaged by Hurricane Katrina. At the time, there was concern that this would set back further shuttle flights by at least two months and possibly more. The actual cause of the foam loss on both Columbia and Discovery was not determined until December 2005, when x-ray photographs of another tank showed that thermal expansion and contraction during filling, not human error, caused cracks that led to foam loss. NASA's Hale formally apologized to the Michoud workers who had been blamed for the loss of Columbia for almost three years. The second \\"Return to Flight\\" mission, STS-121, was launched on July 4, 2006, at 14:37:55 (EDT), after two previous launch attempts were scrubbed because of lingering thunderstorms and high winds around the launch pad. The launch took place despite objections from its chief engineer and safety head. This mission increased the ISS crew to three. A crack in the foam insulation of the external tank gave cause for concern, but the Mission Management Team gave the go for launch.Chien, Philip (June 27, 2006) \\"NASA wants shuttle to fly despite safety misgivings.\\" The Washington Times Space Shuttle Discovery touched down successfully on July 17, 2006, at 09:14:43 (EDT) on Runway 15 at the Kennedy Space Center. On August 13, 2006, NASA announced that STS-121 had shed more foam than they had expected. While this did not delay the launch for the next mission‚ÄîSTS-115, originally set to lift off on August 27 ‚Äîthe weather and other technical glitches did, with a lightning strike, Hurricane Ernesto and a faulty fuel tank sensor combining to delay the launch until September 9. On September 19, landing was delayed an extra day to examine Atlantis after objects were found floating near the shuttle in the same orbit. When no damage was detected, Atlantis landed successfully on September 21. The Columbia Crew Survival Investigation Report released by NASA on December 30, 2008, made further recommendations to improve a crew's survival chances on future space vehicles, such as the then planned Orion spacecraft. These included improvements in crew restraints, finding ways to deal more effectively with catastrophic cabin depressurization, more \\"graceful degradation\\" of vehicles during a disaster so that crews will have a better chance at survival, and automated parachute systems. The United States ended its Space Shuttle program in 2011 in part due to the fallout from the Columbia disaster. No further crewed spacecraft were launched from American soil to the ISS until 2020 when SpaceX's Crew Dragon Demo-2 mission successfully carried a test crew of two NASA astronauts to the International Space Station. Sociocultural aftermath =Fears of terrorism= After the shuttle's breakup, there were some initial fears that terrorists might have been involved, but these concerns were shown to be baseless. Security surrounding the launch and landing of the space shuttle had been increased because the crew included the first Israeli astronaut. The Merritt Island launch facility, like all sensitive government areas, had increased security after the September 11 attacks. =Purple streak image= The San Francisco Chronicle reported that an amateur astronomer had taken a five-second exposure that appeared to show \\"a purplish line near the shuttle\\", resembling lightning, during reentry. The CAIB report concluded that the image was the result of \\"camera vibrations during a long-exposure\\". =2003 Armageddon film hoax= In response to the disaster, FX canceled its scheduled airing two nights later of the 1998 film Armageddon, in which the is depicted as being destroyed by asteroid fragments. In a hoax inspired by the destruction of Columbia, some images that were purported to be satellite photographs of the Shuttle's \\"explosion\\" turned out to be screen captures from the Space Shuttle destruction scene of Armageddon. =Music= The 2003 album Bananas by Deep Purple includes \\"Contact Lost\\", an instrumental piece written by guitarist Steve Morse in remembrance of the loss. Morse is donating his songwriting royalties to the families of the astronauts. Catherine Faber and Callie Hills (the folk group known as Echo's Children) included a memorial song titled \\"Columbia\\" on their 2004 album From the Hazel Tree. The 2005 album Ultimatum by The Long Winters contains the song \\"The Commander Thinks Aloud\\", which was songwriter/singer John Roderick's musing on the crew's perspective of the unexpected catastrophe. In addition, the January 30, 2015 episode of Hrishikesh Hirway's Song Exploder podcast presented an interview with John Roderick about the songwriting and recording process for \\"The Commander Thinks Aloud\\". The Hungarian composer Peter E√∂tv√∂s wrote a piece named Seven for solo violin and orchestra in 2006 in memory of the crew of Columbia. Seven was premiered in 2007 by violinist Akiko Suwanai, conducted by Pierre Boulez, and it was recorded in 2012 with violinist Patricia Kopatchinskaja and the composer conducting. The 2008 album Columbia: We Dare to Dream by Anne Cabrera was written as a tribute to Space Shuttle Columbia STS-107, the crew, support teams, recovery teams, and the crew's families. A copy of the album on compact disc was flown aboard mission STS-131 to the International Space Station by astronaut Clayton Anderson in April 2010. The Scottish Folk-Rock band Runrig included a song titled \\"Somewhere\\" on their album The Story (2016); the song was dedicated to Laurel Clark (who had become a fan of the band during her Navy service in Scotland), and includes a piece of her wake up song, followed by some radio chatter, at the end.

It is a type of publicity. The term was popularized by Jay Conrad Levinson's 1984 book Guerrilla Marketing. Guerrilla marketing uses multiple techniques and practices in order to establish direct contact with the customers.Bernard Cova & Marcel Saucet, \\"The Secret Lives of Unconventional Campaigns: Street Marketing on the Fringe\\", Journal of Marketing Communications, 2014;Jay Conrad Levinson, 1984 One of the goals of this interaction is to cause an emotional reaction in the clients, and the ultimate goal of marketing is to get people to remember products or brands in a different way than they are accustomed to. As traditional advertising media channelssuch as print, radio, television, and direct maillose popularity, marketers and advertisers have to find new strategies to get their commercial messages to the consumer. Guerrilla marketing focuses on taking the consumer by surprise to make a big impression about the product or brand.What is Guerrilla Marketing, 2015 This in turn creates buzz about the product being marketed. It is a way of advertising that increases consumers' engagement with the product or service, and is designed to create a memorable experience. By creating a memorable experience, it also increases the likelihood that a consumer, or someone who interacted with the campaign, will tell their friends about the product. Thus, via word of mouth, the product or service being advertised reaches more people than initially anticipated. Guerrilla marketing is relatively inexpensive, and focuses more on reach rather than frequency. For guerrilla campaigns to be successful, companies don't need to spend large amounts, they just need to have imagination, energy and time.Bourn, 2009 Therefore, it has the potential to be effective for small businesses, especially if they are competing against bigger companies. The message to consumers is often designed to be clear and concise. This type of marketing also works on the unconscious mind, as purchasing decisions are often made by the unconscious mind. To keep the product or service in the unconscious mind requires repetition, so if a buzz is created around a product, and it is shared amongst friends, it enables repetition.Bourn, 2009 Etymology and origin The term \\"guerrilla marketing\\" is traced to guerrilla warfare, which employs atypical tactics to achieve an objective. In 1984, the term guerrilla marketing was introduced by Leo Burnett's creative director Jay Conrad Levinson in his book Guerrilla Marketing. The term itself was from the inspiration of guerrilla warfare which was unconventional warfare using different techniques from usual and small tactic strategies used by armed civilians. It involves high imagination and energy to execute a guerrilla marketing campaign. This kind of marketing is purely focusing on taking the consumer by surprise, creating a greater impression and eventually leading to buzz through word-of-mouth or social media platforms. Guerrilla marketing is perfect for any small or medium size businesses to bring their product or services to its consumers without investing more money on advertisements. This has also been used by large companies to show the difference from its competitors and to make use of social media campaigns. Lately, individuals use unconventional methods of job hunting or to work more.Marcel Bernard Cova & Marcel Saucet, \\"The Secret Lives of Unconventional Campaigns: Street Marketing on the Fringe\\", Journal of Marketing Communications, 2014 As a result, the concept of street marketing was born. It has evolved from being only the application of activities on the streets, to be the development of innovative practices of promotion.Jay Conrad Levinson, 1984 For example, one method used by many enterprises to promote their products or services on the streets is the distribution of fliers. This activity does not focus on creativity, but on making publicity on the streets. However, with the passage of time, companies have developed more unconventional techniques to catch the attention of the clients. Types =Ambient marketing= Ambient communication is advertising presented on elements of the environment, including nearly every available physical surface. It is a compilation of intelligence, flexibility, and effective use of the atmosphere. These kinds of ads can be found anywhere and everywhere from hand dryers in public bathrooms and petrol pumps through to bus hand straps and golf-hole cups.Solomon, M., Marshall, G., Stuart, E. (2008). Marketing, Real People, Real Choices. Upper Saddle River, New Jersey, United States of America: Pearson Education. =Ambush marketing= Ambush marketing is a form of associative marketing, used by an organization to capitalize upon the awareness, attention, goodwill, and other benefits, generated by having an association with an event or property, without that organization having an official or direct connection to that event or property. It is typically seen at major events where rivals of official sponsors attempt to build an association with the event and increase awareness for their brands, sometimes covertly. For example, Nike during the 2012 London Olympics created 'find your Greatness' spots where they featured athletes from several locations called London (but without showing the real London or referring to the Olympic games) which was intended to build a strong association between London Olympics and Nike. =Stealth marketing= Stealth marketing is a deliberate act of entering, operating in, or exiting a market in a furtive, secretive or imperceptible manner, or an attempt to do so. =Viral/buzz marketing= Viral marketing describes any strategy that encourages individuals to pass on a marketing message to others, creating the potential for exponential growth in the message's exposure and influence. Like viruses, such strategies take advantage of rapid multiplication to explode the message to thousands, to millions. Off the Internet, viral marketing has been referred to as \\"word-of-mouth\\", \\"creating a buzz\\", \\"leveraging the media\\", \\"network marketing\\", But on the Internet, for better or worse, it's called \\"viral marketing\\". Similarly, buzz marketing uses high-profile media to encourage the public to discuss the brand or product. Buzz marketing works best when consumer's responses to a product or service and subsequent endorsements are genuine, without the company paying them. Buzz generated from buzz marketing campaigns is referred to as \\"amplified WOM\\" (word-of-mouth), and \\"organic WOM\\" is when buzz occurs naturally by the consumer. =Grassroots marketing= Grassroots campaigns aim to win customers over on an individual basis. A successful grassroots campaign is not about the dissemination of the marketing message in the hope that possible consumers are paying attention, but rather highlights a personal connection between the consumer and the brand, and builds a lasting relationship with the brand.Baker, M. & Hart, S. (2008). The Marketing Book. (6th ed.). Oxford, England: Butterworth-Heinemann. =Astroturfing= Astroturfing is among the most controversial guerrilla marketing strategies, and has a high risk factor for the company marketing the product or service.Jacobs, J. (2012). Faking it ‚Äì how to kill a business through astroturfing on social media. Professional Updates Management, 64(9), 567-570. Astroturfing derives from artificial ‚Äúturf‚Äù, often used in stadiums or tennis courts ‚Äì also known as fake grass. Hence, fake endorsements, testimonials and recommendations are all products of Astroturfing in the public relations sector. Astroturfing involves generating an artificial hype around a particular product or company through a review or discussion on online blogs or forums by an individual who is paid to convey a positive view. This can have a negative and detrimental effect on a company, should the consumer suspect that the review or opinion is not authentic, damaging the company's reputation or even worse, resulting in litigation. =Street marketing= Street marketing uses unconventional means of advertising or promoting products and brands in public areas. The main goal is to encourage consumers to remember and recall the brand or product marketed. As a division of guerrilla marketing, street marketing is specific to all marketing activities carried out in streets and public areas such as parks, streets, events etc. Street marketing also encompasses advertising outdoors, such as on shopping trolleys (shopping carts, in the US), public toilets, sides of cars or public transport, manhole covers, footpaths, rubbish bins, etc.Berman M. (c2007). Street-Smart Advertising: How to Win the Battle of the Buzz. Plymouth, United Kingdom: Rowman & Littlefield Publishers, Inc. Street marketing isn't confined to fixed advertisements. It is common practice for organisations to use brand ambassadors who distribute product samples or discount vouchers, and answer queries about the product while emphasizing the brand. The brand ambassadors may be accompanied by a kiosk which contains the product samples or demonstration materials, or they may be wearing a \\"walking billboard\\". The physical interaction with consumers has a greater influencing power than traditional passive advertising. Street marketing is understood as mobilizing not only the space of the streets but also the imagination of the street: that of street culture and street art. The Y-generation broadly consisting of young urbanites (15 ‚Äì 30 years old), is often put forth as the most susceptible target for the campaigns due to its associations with the culture of the street. According to Marcel Saucet and Bernard Cova,Bernard Cova & Marcel Saucet, \\"The Secret Lives of Unconventional Campaigns: Street Marketing on the Fringe\\", Journal of Marketing Communications, 2014 street marketing can be used as a general term encompassing six principal types of activities: * Distribution of flyers or products This activity is more traditional, and is the most common form of street marketing employed by brands. * Product animations This consists of personalizing a high-traffic space using brand imagery. The idea is to create a micro-universe in order to promote a new product or service. * Human animations The goal of such actions is to create a space in which the brand's message is communicated through human activity. * Road shows This form of mobile presentation is based on the development of means of transport: taxi, bike, Segway, etc. * Uncovered actions These activities involve the customization of street elements. * Event actions These activities take the form of spectacles, such as flash mobs or contests. The idea is to promote a product, service, or brand value through organization of a public event. Typical procedure First, enterprises identify the public places where the campaign can be developed such as beaches, cultural events, close to schools, sporting events and recreation areas for children.Marcel Saucet & Bernard Cova, 2014 Next, companies have to develop a plan to get close to different media and the target market. In order to attract attention, street marketing events not only involve unusual activities, but use technology as part of the events. The purpose is to increase the value of the campaigns and get potential consumers' attention. Besides, the plans that companies develop take into account that guerrilla or street marketing involves global communication and interaction not only with the customers or the media. They are also developed to identify opportunities and collect enough information about products, markets and competitors. For example, for business it is important that customers stay with them, instead of choosing the competitors‚Äô offers. They implement innovative strategies with which they will not lose position in the market, and they consider supplementation with other advertisement through other mediums, such as radio and television, when using street marketing.Jay Conrad Levinson, 1984;Marcel Saucet & Bernard Cova, 2014 There are various examples of strategies that are used in guerrilla marketing. One of them is to provide offers to increase sales. In many cases, businesses do not only supply their products or services to be recognized, but they also offer other things for free. Another instance is to present a fundraiser offer. The point of this strategy is to help other organizations, such as schools, by offering them money. Most companies implement this method not only to increase their sales, but to improve their reputation and image among the community. Finally, there is a strategy called \\"team selling\\" that consists of conforming groups of people, the majority of them young, who go knocking the doors of different houses in a neighborhood. They do this in order to help companies promoting and selling their products or services. When doing guerrilla marketing or street marketing, organizations also consider focusing on the psychological approach. For many companies, this implies if they are having success or not. Street marketing focuses on some psychological aspects to know customers' behavior and preferences. For example, certain psychological areas study how people's brains are divided: 45% of people are left-brained, 45% are right brained, and 10% are balanced. Left-brained persons tend to be logical, right-brained ones tend to be emotional, and the rest are a combination the two. Then, according to the product or service that enterprises provide, and also the kind of customer, businesses decides the way they are going to manage their street marketing campaigns. Besides, almost all the enterprises base their street marketing campaigns on repeating the messages they spread among their customers. Repetition is related to the unconscious part of the mind. This is the one in charge of making decisions. It lets people know what they are going to choose, as well as what they are going to buy. Businesses follow the principle that establishes that, the more people paying attention to the campaign, the more possibilities that campaign has for being remembered. When a company decides to do a guerrilla marketing campaign which could be anything out of viral, ambient, ambush, street or stealth, the focus for them is to meet the objectives. The main objectives for them are: * To create enough buzz to serve in word-of-mouth, helping the brand to establish well with its products. * To touch most of the five sensory identities of the customer/consumer enhancing personal experience with the brand and building good reputation. * To reach the target successfully by taking the brand to them in their daily routine. Through the experience and the ephemeral feelings shared between the company and the target, advertisers and agencies generate a feeling of intimacy that resonates beyond the encounter. This feeling of nearness becomes all the more lasting as the affected individuals relive this encounter on the internet through social media.Bernard Cova and Marcel Saucet, Unconventional Marketing: from Guerrilla to Consumer Made,\\" in Routledge Companion on The Future of Marketing, Routledge, September 2013. Strategy The guerrilla marketing promotion strategy was first identified by Jay Conrad Levinson in his book Guerrilla Marketing (1984).The book describes hundreds of \\"guerrilla marketing weapons\\" in use at the time. Guerrilla marketers need to be creative in devising unconventional methods of promotion to maintain the public's interest in a product or service. Levinson writes that when implementing guerrilla marketing tactics, smaller organizations and entrepreneurs are actually at an advantage. Ultimately, however, guerrilla marketers must \\"deliver the goods.\\" In The Guerrilla Marketing Handbook, the authors write: \\"...in order to sell a product or a service, a company must establish a relationship with the customer. It must build trust and support the customer's needs, and it must provide a product that delivers the promised benefits...\\"The Guerrilla Marketing Handbook; Levinson, Jay Conrad; Godin, Seth; Mariner Books; November 1994; ; accessed March 2014. Online guerrilla marketing The web is rife with examples of guerrilla marketing, to the extent that many of us don't notice its presence - until a particularly successful campaign arises. The desire for instant gratification of internet users provides an avenue for guerrilla marketing by allowing businesses to combine wait marketing with guerrilla tactics. Simple examples consist of using 'loading' pages or image alt texts to display an entertaining or informative message to users waiting to access the content they were trying to get to. As users dislike waiting with no occupation on the web, it is essential, and easy, to capture their attention this way. Other website methods include interesting web features such as engaging landing pages. Many online marketing strategies also use social media such as Facebook and LinkedIn to begin campaigns, share-able features and event host events. Other companies run competitions or discounts based on encouraging users to share or create content related to their product. Viral videos are an incredibly popular form of guerrilla marketing in which companies film entertaining or surprising videos that internet users are likely to share and enjoy, that subtly advertise their service or product. Some companies such as Google even create interactive elements like the themed Google logo games to spark interest and engagement. These dynamic guerrilla marketing tactics can become news globally and give businesses considerable publicity. Examples There are various organizations who have implemented the guerrilla and street marketing strategies. The majority of them are small companies, but there are also big companies that have involved in the guerrilla and street marketing environment.Bernard Cova and Marcel Saucet, Unconventional Marketing: from Guerrilla to Consumer Made,\\" in Routledge Companion on The Future of Marketing, Routledge, September 2013 Most of the examples of the strategies that both small and big enterprises have put into action include costumed persons, the distribution of tickets, people providing samples, among others. As stated before, one guerrilla marketing conventional method that is used by many businesses is to provide fliers. The goal is to create awareness on the customers about what the enterprise is doing. One example of this took place in Montpelier, Vermont, where the New England Culinary Institute (NECI) sent a group of students to a movie theatre to hand out 400 fliers. Those fliers had coupons in which NECI was inviting people to go to its monthly Theme Dinners. Another company, Boston's Kung-Fu Tai Chi Club, chose the option of disseminating fliers instead of placing its advertisements on the newspapers. The purpose of the fliers was to promote the company's self-defence classes for women. Other businesses apply the technique of sending disguised people to promote things on the streets. For example, match.com organized a street marketing activity in the ‚ÄúFeria del Libro‚Äù (‚ÄúBook Fair‚Äù) in Madrid. It consisted of a man dressed like a prince who was walking among the crowd looking for his ‚Äúreal love‚Äù. He had a glass slipper and even got to try the shoe on some people. A woman behind him was giving bookmarks to the people which contained messages such as ‚ÄúTimes have changed; the way to find love, too‚Äù or ‚ÄúYou have been reading love stories all your life; experience yours on Match.com‚Äù. Also, in Madrid and Barcelona, Nokia developed a campaign called ‚ÄúAvestruz‚Äù (‚ÄúOstrich‚Äù) to promote the 5500 and 5700 mobiles. In the campaign, a group of real-size ostrich puppets tried to interact with young people in order to let them know these mobiles provide a high-quality MP3 playback. The puppets were holding their own telephones and listening to the music. When a young person appeared, the puppet tried to catch his/her attention to show him/her the quality of the mobile. The reason why Nokia decided to use ostriches was that they are big animals, so people could easily look at them. There are enterprises that disseminate passes or tickets to different events. For example, Sony invests on joining promoters and tells them that they have to infiltrate in public meetings. What they have to do is to distribute free tickets to concerts and other musical events sponsored by the company . Another instance is the Spanish company Clickair (an extension of Iberia airlines), that developed a campaign in which a group of five people had to walk through Barcelona streets dressed as Euros. The group was supplying approximately 3,000 tickets to promote different Clickair destinations. The people who first sent a text message with the required information would get free tickets to go on a trip. In the end, the company received a total of 3,390 messages. Along with these examples, there are other street marketing techniques that are even more unusual. Lee Jeans, a French company dedicated to the selling of jeans, promoted the opening of their new store in rue des Rosiers in Paris. The method they applied consisted of distributing denims, as well as denim accessories, on the different streets of the neighborhood. Furthermore, in Italy, the members of the company Nintendo put into action a campaign in which they used post-it's to promote the Wii console. They pasted several post-it with the shapes of some characters from different video games. Those images were placed as if they were billboards on the streets. ‚ÄúWii not forget‚Äù, the name of the campaign, and a brief explanation of it, were the words written on the post-its. In some cases, some street marketing may incite the ire of local authorities; such was the case in Houston, Texas, when BMW's ad agency (Street Factory Media in Minneapolis)attached a replication, made from Styrofoam, of a Mini-Cooper to the side of a downtown building. For the cost of a small city-issued fine, the company received front page advertising on the Houston Chronicle. Sony Ericsson used an undercover campaign in 2002 when they hired 60 actors in ten major cities and had them accost strangers and ask them: \\"Would you mind taking my picture?\\" The actor then handed the target a brand new picture phone while talking about how cool the new device was. \\"And thus an act of civility was converted into a branding event.The Hidden (In Plain Sight) Persuaders; Walker, Rob; \\"The New York Times Magazine;\\" December 5, 2004; pg. 68 Guerrilla marketing is not just exclusive to small companies. For big companies it is a high risk, high reward strategy. When successful it can capture even more market share, but if it fails it can damage the company‚Äôs brand image. One successful guerrilla marketing campaign is the Coca-Cola ‚ÄòHappiness Machine‚Äù. In January 2010, Coca-Cola, with the help of Definition 6, filmed a reaction video of a Coke vending machine dispensing ‚Äòdoses‚Äô of happiness to unsuspecting students in St. John's University. A seemingly normal vending machine surprised students by dispensing items that were more than they bargained for. The students received goodies ranging from extra coke, pizza, flowers, to even a twelve-foot hero sub. ‚ÄúCoke‚Äôs goal to inspire consumers through small, surprise moments of happiness‚Äù said Paul Iannacchino Jr., Creative Director, Definition 6. With a budget of only $60,000, the video generated 500,000 views in the first week. It now has over 7 million views to date. The campaign was so popular that a 30-second edit of the footage was featured during American Idol's season finale. The Coca-Cola ‚ÄúHappiness Machine‚Äù also went on to receive the CLIO's prestigious Gold Interactive Award at the 51st annual awards dinner held in New York City. After the campaign's success, Coca-Cola decided to continue with the ‚ÄòHappiness‚Äô theme and has released similar videos since then. Strategic risk Because of the nature of guerrilla marketing, the message and objective must be clearly defined in order to avoid being misunderstood. Misinterpretation by the targeted audience of the message intended to be promoted is a risk. Word-of-mouth advertising does not always stay focused enough to present the intended message. The rumor-like spread of word-of-mouth marketing is uncontrollable once released, and can result in a misrepresentation of the message or confusion about a brand. Another risk involves wrongly timed (or wrongly placed) events, which may actually be perceived to be against the interests of the consumer. For instance, in an ill-conceived promotion which took place on January 31, 2007, several magnetic circuit boards‚Äîeach with an flashing LED cartoon figure‚Äîwere attached to metal surfaces in and around Boston, Massachusetts to promote the animated series, Aqua Teen Hunger Force. The circuit boards were mistakenly taken for explosive devices. Several subway stations; bridges; and a portion of Interstate 93 were closed as police examined, removed, and (in some cases) destroyed the devices.Boston Bomb Scare ; article; CNN News online; retrieved March 2014. Some guerrilla marketing may incite the ire of local authorities. Then risks are assessed and may still be considered worthwhile. Such was the case in Houston, Texas, when BMW Auto's ad agency, Street Factory Media, attached a replica of a Mini-Cooper (made of Styrofoam), to the side of a downtown building in January 2013. For the small cost of a city-issued fine, the company received front page advertising in the Houston Chronicle. Another problem presents itself if marketers fail to properly execute an undercover campaign. They run considerable risk of backlash. An example of this can be found in Sony Entertainment's on-line debacle with Zipatoni. The company attempted to promote Zipatoni through a stealth marketing campaign, which was quickly detected by the internet community, resulting in Sony immediately experiencing a backlash from video game enthusiasts. Street art is thus a subversive activity, hijacking public places and inventing rather paradoxical forms of expression that reformulate ways of communicating, all of which inform street marketing practices. Thus marketing in the street, given that it is inspired by the work of such artists, brings with it constraints and statutory risks for which agencies and advertisers are generally not prepared.Douglas West, John Ford, (2001), Advertising agency philosophies and employee risk taking, Journal of Advertising 30, no. 1: 77‚Äì91 The main problem is that, by definition, street mobilization campaigns require the use of public space, and that use must be authorized by government authorities to be legal. This is just as true for simple operations like distributing flyers as it is for mobilizing products or people and, of course, for a disguised campaign. The authorizations necessary to carry out such a campaign are often very difficult to obtain within the time allotted for bringing the plan to fruition. Numerous potential operations have failed to obtain authorization for safety reasons, and in certain urban areas it is even expressly forbidden to undertake a guerrilla marketing campaign. In such cases, many agencies and advertisers will simply go ahead with the operation, meaning that they choose to act without authorization. How is such a choice reached, and on what bases? How is it justified? What impact does this choice have on the performance and costs of the operation? What transformations does this choice bring to the agency‚Äìadvertiser relationship? These are the main questions posed in the development of street marketing operations today.  Inexpensive costs  In a declining economy, guerrilla marketing is an increasing solution to giving companies the comparative edge over others. During times where companies are downsizing and cutting costs, companies look to guerrilla marketing as a cheaper strategy than conventional marketing. Instead of investing money in the marketing process, guerrillas invest energy, time and creativity. If done successfully, companies will be able to reach conventional goals for profits and growth with a smaller marketing budget. One such example is the Blair Witch Project. A group of film students filmed an amateur horror movie. By setting up an internet campaign devoted to spreading rumors about the fictitious 'Blair Witch', it created a lot of interest for the film. With a budget of $50,000, the movie grossed $250 million worldwide. According to Jay Levinson, guerrilla marketing emphasizes strongly on customer follow-up rather than ignoring customers after their purchase. Focusing on customer follow-up is a cheaper strategy because the cost of selling to a new customer is six times higher than selling to an existing customer. During a tough economy, it is important to focus on building relationships rather than sales, and aiming at individuals instead of groups. This promotes repeat sales, referrals and increased size of purchase. The use of telephone as a follow-up tool is helpful in improving customer relationships. Email is also another inexpensive tool for maintaining relationships. Emails can be used to direct people to the company website. The site can be then used to provide information and to advance sales. Honesty is an important attribute when marketing to customers during tough times. When companies show that they are fully aware of the economic situation and why they have priced their products accordingly, this earns the customer's respect. Explaining the current situation and the risks and the steps the company is taking to the customers will give the customers assurance and also maintains their trust. One example is the Las Vegas tourism board. During the 2008 recession, Las Vegas was one of the cities hit the hardest. They released an ad campaign showing people they were fully aware of the recession, yet, in a dramatic way, showing 'that regular people are coming here and having a blast'. This piqued a lot of interest which led to an increase of tourism in Las Vegas during the recession.

Wesley was born in Epworth, Lincolnshire, the son of Anglican cleric and poet Samuel Wesley and his wife Susanna. He was a younger brother of Methodist founder John Wesley and Anglican cleric Samuel Wesley the Younger, and he became the father of musician Samuel Wesley and grandfather of musician Samuel Sebastian Wesley. Wesley was educated at Oxford where his brothers had also studied, and he formed the \\"Holy Club\\" among his fellow students in 1729. John Wesley later joined this group, as did George Whitefield. Charles followed his father and brother into the church in 1735, and he travelled with John to Georgia in America, returning a year later. In 1749, he married Sarah Gwynne, daughter of a Welsh gentleman who had been converted to Methodism by Howell Harris. She accompanied the brothers on their evangelistic journeys throughout Britain until Charles ceased to travel in 1765. Despite their closeness, Charles and John did not always agree on questions relating to their beliefs. In particular, Charles was strongly opposed to the idea of a breach with the Church of England into which they had been ordained. Biography Early portrait of Wesley =Early life= Charles Wesley was the eighteenth child of Susanna Wesley and Samuel Wesley. He was born in Epworth, Lincolnshire, England, where his father was rector. He was educated at Westminster School and Christ Church, Oxford, where he was ordained. At Oxford, Charles formed a prayer group among his fellow students in 1727; his elder brother, John, joined in 1729, soon becoming its leader and moulding it in line with his own convictions. They focused on studying the Bible and living a holy life. Other students mocked them, saying they were the \\"Holy Club\\", \\"Sacramentarians\\", and \\"the Methodists\\", being methodical and exceptionally detailed in their Bible study, opinions and disciplined lifestyle. George Whitefield joined the group. After graduating with a master's degree in classical languages and literature, Charles followed his father and brother into Anglican orders in 1735. =Voyage to America= On 14 October 1735, Charles and his brother John sailed on The Simmonds from Gravesend, Kent for Savannah in Georgia Colony in British America at the request of the governor, James Oglethorpe. Charles was appointed Secretary of Indian Affairs and while John remained in Savannah, Charles went as chaplain to the garrison and colony at nearby Fort Frederica, St. Simon's Island, arriving there Tuesday, 9 March 1736 according to his journal entry. Matters did not turn out well, and he was largely rejected by the settlers. In July 1736, Charles was commissioned to England as the bearer of dispatches to the trustees of the colony. On 16 August 1736, he sailed from Charleston, South Carolina, never to return to the Georgia colony. =Ministry= Plaque at Postman's Park, London, commemorating John and Charles Wesley Plaque in Westminster commemorating the site of Wesley's house Charles Wesley experienced a conversion on 21 May 1738‚ÄîJohn Wesley had a similar experience in Aldersgate Street just three days later. A City of London blue plaque at 13, Little Britain, near the church of St Botolph's-without-Alders, off St. Martin's Le Grand, marks the site of the former house of John Bray, reputed to be the scene of Charles' evangelical conversion on 21 May 1738. It reads, \\"Adjoining this site stood the house of John Bray. Scene of Charles Wesley's conversion by faith in Christ on May 21st 1738\\". Monument in St Mary le Bone Old Churchyard at the position of Wesley's original grave Wesley felt renewed strength to spread the Gospel to ordinary people and it was around then that he began to write the poetic hymns for which he would become known. It was not until 1739 that the brothers took to field preaching, under the influence of George Whitefield, whose open-air preaching was already reaching great numbers of Bristol colliers. After ceasing field preaching and frequent travel due to illness in 1765, Wesley settled and worked in the area around St Marylebone Parish Church. On his deathbed he sent for the church's rector, John Harley, and told him \\"Sir, whatever the world may say of me, I have lived, and I die, a member of the Church of England. I pray you to bury me in your churchyard.\\" Upon his death, his body was carried to the church by six clergymen of the Church of England. A memorial stone to him stands in the gardens in Marylebone High Street, close to his place of burial. One of his sons, Samuel, became the organist at the church. Marriage and children In April 1749, he married the much younger Sarah Gwynne (1726‚Äì1822), also known as Sally. She was the daughter of Marmaduke Gwynne, a wealthy Welsh magistrate who had been converted to Methodism by Howell Harris. They moved into a house in Bristol in September 1749. Sarah accompanied the brothers on their evangelistic journeys throughout Britain, until at least 1753. After 1756 Charles made no more journeys to distant parts of the country, mainly just moving between Bristol and London. In 1771, Charles obtained another house, in London, and moved into it that year with his elder son. By 1778 the whole family had transferred from Bristol to the London house, at 1 Chesterfield Street (now Wheatley Street), Marylebone, where they remained until Charles' death and on into the 19th century. The house in Bristol still stands and has been restored, however the London house was demolished in the mid 19th century. Only three of the couple's children survived infancy: Charles Wesley junior (1757‚Äì1834), Sarah Wesley (1759‚Äì1828), who like her mother was also known as Sally, and Samuel Wesley (1766‚Äì1837) Their other children, John, Martha Maria, Susannah, Selina and John James are all buried in Bristol, having died between 1753 and 1768. (See monument in garden on north side of junction of Lewis Mead and The Haymarket, Bristol.) Both Samuel and Charles junior were musical child prodigies and, like their father, became organists and composers. Charles junior spent most of his career as the personal organist of the Royal Family, and Samuel became one of the most accomplished musicians in the world and is often called \\"the English Mozart\\". Samuel Wesley's son, Samuel Sebastian Wesley, was one of the foremost British composers of the 19th century. Hymns Wesley's conversion had a clear impact on his doctrine, especially the doctrine of the Holy Spirit. The change in doctrine can be seen in his sermons after 1738, but is most notable in his hymns written after 1738. From Charles' published work \\"Hymns and Prayers to the Trinity\\" and in Hymn number 62 he writes \\"The Holy Ghost in part we know, For with us He resides, Our whole of good to Him we owe, Whom by His grace he guides, He doth our virtuous thoughts inspire, The evil he averts, And every seed of good desire, He planted in our hearts.\\" Charles communicates several doctrines: the personal indwelling of the Holy Spirit, the sanctifying work of the Holy Spirit, the depravity of mankind, and humanity's personal accountability to God. His hymns have had a significant influence not only on Methodism, but on modern theology as a whole. =Hymnody= Charles Wesley preaching, by William Gush. See engraving of the portrait. In the course of his career, Charles Wesley published the words of over 6,000 hymns, many of which are still popular. These include: *\\"Arise, My Soul, Arise\\" (Words) *\\"And Can It Be That I Should Gain?\\" (Words) *\\"Christ the Lord Is Risen Today\\" (Words) *\\"Christ, Whose Glory Fills the Skies\\" (Words) *\\"Come, O Thou Traveler Unknown\\" (Words) *\\"Come, Thou Long Expected Jesus\\" (Words) *\\"Depth of Mercy, Can it Be\\" (Words) *\\"Father, I Stretch My Hands to Thee\\" (Words) *\\"Hail the Day That Sees Him Rise\\" (Words) *\\"Hark!

Many of his hymns are translated into other languages, and form the foundation for Methodist hymnals, as well as the Swedish Metodist-Episkopal- Kyrkans Psalmbok printed in Stockholm in 1892.  Psalms  Wesley's hymns are notable as interpretations of Scripture. He also produced paraphrases of the Psalms, contributing to the long tradition of English metrical Psalmody. A notable feature of his Psalms is the introduction of Jesus into the Psalms, continuing a tradition of Christological readings of the Psalms evident in the translations of John Patrick and Isaac Watts. The introduction of Jesus into the Psalms was often the source of controversy, even within Wesley's own family. Charles' brother Samuel Wesley wrote a poem against such practice. Of particular importance is Wesley's manuscript Psalms, held in the archives of the Pitts Theology Library at Emory University. Death and burial At the age of 80, Charles Wesley died on 29 March 1788, in London, England. Since he considered himself a member of the Church of England, he had requested to be buried as such, and is buried in the St Marylebone Parish Church graveyard. Legacy Wesley is still remembered for his ministry while in St. Simon's Island, Georgia, by the South Georgia Conference of the United Methodist Church; in 1950, the conference opened a Christian retreat center on the island by the banks of the Frederica River, designating it Epworth by the Sea in honour of his and John's birthplace. He is commemorated in the Calendar of Saints of the Evangelical Lutheran Church in America on 2 March with his brother John. The Wesley brothers are also commemorated on 3 March in the Calendar of Saints of the Episcopal Church and on 24 May in the Anglican calendar. Charles is commemorated on 29 March in the Calendar of Commemorations by The Order of Saint Luke; John is commemorated on 2 March; their parents are also commemorated. As a result of his enduring hymnody, the Gospel Music Association recognised his musical contributions to the art of gospel music in 1995 by listing his name in the Gospel Music Hall of Fame. Wesley wrote two of the so-called Great Four Anglican Hymns: \\"Hark! The Herald Angels Sing\\" and \\"Lo! He Comes With Clouds Descending\\". =Tercentenary= 24 May 2007 was celebrated as the tercentenary of Wesley's birth, with many celebratory events held throughout England, even though Wesley was in fact born in December 1707. The date of 24 May is known to Methodists as \\"Aldersgate Day\\" and commemorates the spiritual awakening of first Charles and then John Wesley in 1738. In particular, in the village of Epworth, North Lincolnshire, at the Wesley Memorial Methodist Church, there was a flower festival, on 26 and 28 May, with flower arrangements representing some of Wesley's hymns, such as O for a Thousand Tongues to Sing, And Can It Be, and O For a Trumpet Voice. In November 2007, An Post, the Irish Post Office, issued a 78c stamp to commemorate the 300th anniversary of Wesley's birth. ;Stained glass depictions of Wesley File:Charles Wesley 2.JPGWesley at St. Matthew's Church, Bristol File:Church Musicians window, King's Heath, Birmingham.JPGBach, Wesley and Handel, at Cambridge Rd Methodist Church, Birmingham.

It was Webb who coined the term collective bargaining. She was among the founders of the London School of Economics and played a crucial role in forming the Fabian Society. Early life Beatrice Potter was born in Standish House in the village of Standish, Gloucestershire, the last but one of the nine daughters of businessman Richard Potter and Laurencina Heyworth, a Liverpool merchant's daughter. Her paternal grandfather was Liberal Party MP Richard Potter, co-founder of the Little Circle which was key in creating the Reform Act 1832. From an early age Beatrice was self- taught and cited as important influences the cooperative movement and the philosopher Herbert Spencer. After her mother's death in 1882 she acted as a hostess and companion for her father. In 1882, she began a relationship with twice-widowed Radical politician Joseph Chamberlain, by then a Cabinet minister in Gladstone's second government. He would not accept her need for independence as a woman and after four years of \\"storm and stress\\" their relationship failed.Diaries of Beatrice Webb (2000), New Year's Day, 1901, p. 244. Marriage in 1892 to Sidney Webb established a lifelong \\"partnership\\" of shared causes. At the beginning of 1901 Beatrice wrote that she and Sidney were \\"still on our honeymoon and every year makes our relationship more tender and complete\\". She and her husband were friends with the philosopher Bertrand Russell. \\"My Creed and My Craft\\" Beatrice Webb left unfinished a planned autobiography, under the general title My Creed and My Craft. At her death, aged 85, the only autobiographical work she had published was My Apprenticeship (1926). The posthumously issued Our Partnership (1948) covered the first two decades of her marriage to Sidney Webb between 1892 and 1911 and their collaboration on a variety of public issues. In the preface to the second work,Our Partnership by Beatrice Webb, 1948, Longmans, Green & Co: London, New York, p. vi. its editors refer to Webb's > desire to describe truthfully her lifelong pursuit of a living philosophy, > her changes of outlook and ideas, her growing distrust of benevolent > philanthropy as a means of redeeming 'poor suffering humanity' and her > leaving of the field of abstract economic theory for the then practically > unexplored paths of scientific social research. In 1926 when Webb had begun to prepare the second volume, Our Partnership, only to be repeatedly distracted by other more pressing commitments, the book's editors report her finding it difficult to express \\"her philosophy of life, her belief in the scientific method, but its purpose guided always by religious emotion.\\" Our Partnership by Beatrice Webb, 1948, Longmans, Green & Co: London, New York, p. vii. A pioneer in social research and policy- making One of Beatrice's older sisters, Catherine, became a well-known social worker. After Catherine married Leonard Courtney, Beatrice took over her work as a voluntary rent-collector in the model dwellings at Katharine Buildings, Wapping, operated by the East End Dwellings Company.The Diaries of Beatrice Webb (2000), p. 53. Beatrice and Sidney Webb working together in 1895 The young Beatrice also assisted her cousin by marriage Charles Booth in his pioneering survey of the Victorian slums of London, work which eventually became the massive 17-volume Life and Labour of the People of London (1902‚Äì1903). These experiences stimulated a critical attitude to current ideas of philanthropy. In 1890 Beatrice Potter was introduced to Sidney Webb, whose help she sought with her research. They married in 1892, and until her death 51 years later shared political and professional activities. When her father died in January 1892, leaving Potter an endowment of ¬£1,000 pounds a year, she had a private income for life with which to support herself and the research projects she pursued. The Webbs became active members of the Fabian Society. With the Fabians' support, Beatrice Webb co-authored books and pamphlets on socialism and the co-operative movement including The History of Trade Unionism (1894) and Industrial Democracy (1897). In 1895, the Fabians used part of an unexpected legacy of ¬£10,000 from Henry Hutchinson, a solicitor from Derby, to found the London School of Economics and Political Science.The Diaries of Beatrice Webb (2000), 21 September 1894, p. 186. Kitty Muggeridge and Ruth Adam, Beatrice Webb: A Life, 1858-1943, 1967, London: Secker & Warburg, pp. 151-156. After consulting Dr. Andrea Rabagliati for health problems, Webb became a vegetarian in 1902 and shortly thereafter began a vegetarian salon for socialists. By 1908, she was a vice-president of the National Food Reform Association. Webb was a lacto-vegetarian, she described herself as an \\"anti-flesh-fish-egg-alcohol-coffee-and-sugar eater\\".Seymour- Jones, Carole. (1992). Beatrice Webb: Woman of Conflict. Allison & Busby. p. 254. =Contributions to the theory of the co-operative movement= Beatrice Webb made a number of important contributions to the political and economic theory of the co-operative movement. In her 1891 book The Cooperative Movement in Great Britain, based on her experiences in Lancashire, she distinguished between \\"co-operative federalism\\" and \\"co-operative individualism\\". She identified herself as a co-operative federalist, a school of thought which advocates consumer co-operative societies. She argued that consumers' co- operatives should be set up as co-operative wholesale societies (by forming co-operatives in which all members are co-operatives, the best historical example being the English Co-operative Wholesale Society) and that these federal co-operatives should then acquire farms or factories. Webb dismissed the idea of worker co-operatives where the people who did the work and benefited from it had some control over how it was organised, arguing that ‚Äì at the time she was writing ‚Äì such ventures had proved largely unsuccessful, at least in ushering in her form of socialism led by volunteer committees of people like herself.Potter, Beatrice, The Co-operative Movement in Great Britain, London: Swan Sonnenschein & Co., 1891. Examples of successful worker cooperatives did of course exist, then as now. In some professions they were the norm. However, the Webbs' final book, The Truth About Soviet Russia (1942), celebrated central planning. It was Webb who coined the term \\"collective bargaining\\". =1909 Minority report to Royal Commission= For four years Beatrice Webb was a member of the Royal Commission on the Poor Laws and Relief of Distress 1905-09. The Conservative government of A. J. Balfour established the Commission, which issued its final report to the Liberal government of H. H. Asquith.Woman's Hour discussion on 1909 Minority Report, BBC Radio 4.Wallis,Ed (editor). From the Workhouse to Welfare Fabian Society and Webb Memorial Trust, 2009. Beatrice was lead author of the dissenting minority report. This sketched the outlines of a welfare state which would > secure a national minimum of civilised life ... open to all alike, of both > sexes and all classes, by which we meant sufficient nourishment and training > when young, a living wage when able-bodied, treatment when sick, and modest > but secure livelihood when disabled or aged. William Beveridge, future author of the 1942 Beveridge Report that introduced the welfare state in the United Kingdom, worked as a researcher for the Webbs on the Minority Report.Jose Harris, \\"The Webbs and Beveridge\\", in From Workhouse to Welfare (Fabian Society, 2009). He was later appointed director (1919‚Äì1937) of the London School of Economics. =Rivalries on the Left, 1901‚Äì1922= Beatrice Webb The influence of the Webbs on the Fabian Society and its policies were attacked by H.G. Wells. For a time he joined the Society but was critical of its cautious approach: \\"They permeate English society with their reputed Socialism about as much as a mouse may be said to permeate a cat\\".Quoted in Muggeridge and Adam, p. 168. For her part, Beatrice voiced disapproval of Wells' \\"sordid intrigue\\" with the daughter of a veteran Fabian Sydney Olivier. He responded by lampooning the couple in his 1911 novel The New Machiavelli as Altiora and Oscar Bailey, a pair of short-sighted, bourgeois manipulators. Other rivals from the left of the Fabian Society at that time were the Guild Socialists led by the historian and economist G.D.H. Cole. Cole and his wife Margaret would later run the Fabian Research Bureau. In 1913, the Webbs co-founded the New Statesman, a political weekly edited by Clifford Sharp with contributions from many philosophers, economists and politicians of the day, including George Bernard Shaw and John Maynard Keynes. The Webbs became members of the Labour Party in late 1914. At the end of World War I Beatrice collaborated with her husband Sidney in his writings and policy statements such as Labour and the New Social Order (1918). She also campaigned for his successful election in 1922 to the parliamentary seat of coastal Seaham, a mine-working community in County Durham.  Soviet Communism  In 1928, the Webbs moved to Liphook in Hampshire, where they lived until their deaths in the 1940s. Soon Sidney was a minister in the new Labour government. Observing the wider world, Beatrice wrote of \\"Russian communism and Italian Fascism\\" as \\"two sides of the worship of force and the practice of cruel intolerance\\" and she was disturbed that \\"this spirit is creeping into the USA and even ... into Great Britain.\\"Muggeridge and Adam,Beatrice Webb: A Life, 1967, p.225. The frustrations and disappointments of the next few years ‚Äî the election of a narrow Labour majority of MPs in May 1929, the Great Depression which began later that year, the agreement of fellow Fabian Ramsay MacDonald, after the October 1931 election, to form and head a National Government, thereby splitting the Labour Party ‚Äî partly explain why Beatrice and Sidney began to look on the USSR and its leader Stalin with different eyes. Beatrice and Sidney Webb during their trip to the Soviet Union in 1932 In 1932, Webb was elected a Fellow of the British Academy (FBA); she was the first woman elected to the fellowship. That year, Sidney and Beatrice, now in their 70s, spent two months from 21 May to late July in the Soviet Union. Their views about the Soviet economic experiment were published three years later in a massive volume, over 1,000 pages in length, entitled Soviet Communism: A New Civilisation? (1935). Most of the text was written by Sidney Webb and based on copious study of publications and statistics provided by the Soviet embassy in London. In 1933 he made a further \\"fact-finding\\" trip to the USSR before publication, accompanied by their niece Barbara Drake, a prominent trade unionist and member of the Fabian Society, and by John Cripps, the son of their nephew Stafford Cripps. Historians have criticised the Webbs for the naive supposition that the methods they had developed in analysing and formulating social policy in Britain could be applied to the Soviet Union. Their book promoted and encouraged an uncritical view of Stalin's conduct, during agrarian centralisation in the first five year plan (1928‚Äì1933), the creation of the gulag system, and the extensive purges of the 1930s.See, e.g., Conquest, Robert, The Great Terror (1968 and subsequent editions). Trotskyist historian Al Richardson later described their 1935 account of the USSR as \\"pure Soviet propaganda at its most mendacious\\".Al Richardson, \\"Introduction\\" to C. L. R. James, World Revolution 1917‚Äì1936: The Rise and Fall of the Communist International. Humanities Press, 1937 There also seemed to be a conscious element of deception. In the third edition of Soviet Communism: A New Civilisation (1941), for instance, the Webbs voiced the opinion that in 1937 \\"strenuous efforts had been made, both in the trade union organisation and in the Communist Party, to cut out the dead wood\\".Archie Brown, The Rise and Fall of Communism (2009), p. 122. This phrase was used to reassure a wider public about the grotesque accusations against former leading Bolsheviks. In her diaries Beatrice did not hide her disquiet, at the opening of the Moscow Trials in the summer of 1936,See diary entry - 28 August 1936, pp. 330-336 of archived typescripts. and after the conviction of Nikolai Bukharin in March 1938.Diary entry - 8 March 1938, pp. 36-37 of archived typescripts. Soviet Communism: A New Civilization? ‚Äî in later editions the question mark was dropped, as was any public doubt the Webbs might have about the nature of the USSR ‚Äî has since been roundly condemned. In the preface to an anthology of Left Book Club publications,Paul Laity, Left Book Club Anthology Weidenfeld and Nicolson, 2001 (p. xvii) for instance, British historian A. J. P. Taylor is quoted as calling Soviet Communism: A New Civilization \\"the most preposterous book ever written about Russia\\". In the early 1930s Malcolm Muggeridge, one of Beatrice's own family by marriage, and himself the son of a Fabian, told her in no uncertain terms of his horrified disapproval of the Soviet system. She was among those listed in the German-compiled \\"Black Book\\".Invasion, 1940: The Nazi Invasion Plan for Britain, Little Brown Book Group by Walter Schellenberg, page 259 Racism Ivan Maisky, the Soviet Union's Ambassador to the United Kingdom during much of the Second World War, was friendly with Webb. In a conversation with Webb on 10 October 1939, Maisky quoted her as stating: \\"Churchill is not a true Englishman, you know. He has Negro blood. You can tell even from his appearance.\\"The Maisky Diaries: Red Ambassador to the Court of St James‚Äôs, 1932-1943, edited by Gabriel Gorodetsky, Yale University Press. Extended family In 1929 Webb's husband, Sidney Webb, became Baron Passfield and a member of the House of Lords. Between 1929 and 1931 he served as Secretary of State for the Colonies and Secretary of State for the Dominions in Ramsay MacDonald's Labour government. Beatrice did not refer to herself as Lady Passfield or expect others to do so. Sidney and Beatrice Webb never had any children. In retirement Beatrice would reflect on the success of their other progeny.Beatrice Webb diary entry 14 September 1936 For instance, in 1895 they had founded the London School of Economics with Graham Wallas and George Bernard Shaw: > In old age it is one of the minor satisfactions of life to watch the success > of your children, literal children or symbolic. The London School of > Economics is undoubtedly our most famous one; but the New Statesman is also > creditable ‚Äì it is the most successful of the general weeklies, actually > making a profit on its 25,000 readers, and has absorbed two of its rivals, > The Nation and the Week-End Review. Meanwhile, the connections by marriage of their numerous nieces and nephews made Beatrice and Sidney part of the emerging new Labour establishment. Beatrice's nephew Sir Stafford Cripps, son of her sister Theresa, became a well-known Labour politician in the 1930s and 1940s. He served as British ambassador to Moscow during the Second World War and later as Chancellor of the Exchequer under Clement Attlee. (His daughter Peggy went on to marry Nana Joe Appiah, an African statesman and tribal chieftain who served as something of a founding father of the Republic of Ghana.) Margaret, yet another Potter sister, married the Liberal politician Henry Hobhouse, making Beatrice Webb an aunt of peace activist Stephen Henry Hobhouse and of Liberal politician Arthur Hobhouse.Hochschild, Adam, To end all wars : a story of loyalty and rebellion, 1914-1918, Boston: Houghton Mifflin Harcourt, 2011, p. 277, . A dissonant voice entered the family after Katherine Dobbs, the daughter of Beatrice's youngest sister Rosalind, married the journalist Malcolm Muggeridge. In the early 1930s the young couple moved to Moscow, full of enthusiasm for the new Soviet system. Muggeridge's experience of reporting from the Soviet Union for the Manchester Guardian, however, made him highly critical of the Webbs' optimistic views of the Soviet Union.See Malcolm Muggeridge, Chronicles of Wasted Time: Pt 1, The Green Stick, London: Fontana (pbk), 1981. Chapter 5, 'Who Whom?', pp. 285-299. Also his Winter in Moscow (1934). On 29 March 1933 Beatrice referred in her diary to \\"Malcolm's curiously hysterical denunciation of the USSR and all its works in a letter to me....\\" The Diaries of Beatrice Web (abridged, 2000), p. 514. The following day she noted that the Guardian had printed \\"another account of famine in Russia, which certainly bears out Malcolm's reports\\".The Diaries of Beatrice Webb (abridged, 2000), p. 514. Yet, wrote Muggeridge, Beatrice \\"went on wanting to see Kitty and me\\". On their last visit Beatrice showed her niece's husband a portrait of Lenin: \\"She had set the picture up as though it were a Velazquez, with special lighting coming from below\\".Malcolm Muggeridge, Chronicles of Wasted Time: Pt 1, The Green Stick, London: Fontana (pbk), 1981. Chapter 4, 'The Pursuit of Righteousness', p. 165. Death and legacy When Beatrice Webb died in 1943, she was cremated at Woking Crematorium. The casket containing her ashes was buried in the garden of their house in Passfield Corner, as she had requested. Lord Passfield's ashes were also buried there when he died four years later. Shortly afterwards, the nonagenarian George Bernard Shaw launched an ultimately successful petition to have the remains of both moved to Westminster Abbey. They now lie buried in the nave of the Abbey, close to the ashes of their Labour Party colleagues Clement Attlee and Ernest Bevin. Beatrice did not live to see the welfare state set up by the post-war Labour government. It was an enduring monument to her research and campaigning, before and after she married Sidney Webb. First outlined in the Minority report (Poor Law) of 1909, it would remain substantially intact until the 1980s. It is not certain that Beatrice Webb would have approved of the manner of its implementation and future management. As her niece Kitty commented:Kitty Muggeridge & Ruth Adams, Beatrice Webb: A life, 1858-1943, London: Secker & Warburg, 1967, p. 177. > ... although it was Beatrice herself who put the 20th-century zeitgeist into > its most concrete form, in the Welfare State, something in her remained > sturdily Victorian to the very end. \\"What has to be aimed at is not this or > that improvement in material circumstances or physical comfort but an > improvement in personal character,\\" she wrote. She believed that citizens > who were given benefits by the community ought to make an effort to improve > themselves, or at least submit themselves to those who would improve them.

She operated on the Suez to Bombay run in the last years before the Suez Canal was opened. This route gave a fast, steamship-operated route from Britain to India, connecting with similar steamships running through the Mediterranean to Alexandria, with an overland crossing to Suez. The alternative was to sail round the Cape of Good Hope, a distance at which steam ships were not, in the early 1860s, sufficiently economical to be commercially competitive with sail. As one of the first British steamships to use a compound engine, Carnatic achieved a much better fuel economy (at 2lbs of coal per indicated horsepower-hour) than most other contemporary steamers. P&O; had a number of compound-engined ships built in the first half of the 1860s: Poonah (1863), Golconda (1863) and Baronda (1864). In 1869, she ran aground on a coral reef in the Red Sea and broke apart the following morning, with the loss of 31 lives. Her wreck was rediscovered in 1984 and is now a popular scuba diving site. Ship history The ship was laid down in early 1862, and was originally to be named Mysore. She was launched as Carnatic on 12 June 1862, and completed on 25 April 1863. The composite construction hull (iron-framed and wooden-planked) was fitted with square-rigged sails and a 4-cylinder compound inverted steam engine by Humphrys & Tennant, providing to a single propeller. The compound engine was unusual at the time for a British vessel. Carnatic's boiler ran at only . Higher pressures were not allowed by the Board of Trade. The advantages of a compound engine were not fully realised at this low pressure - but the solution to the problem was to apply a large amount of superheat. The efficiency gained was a fuel usage of just over 2lbs of coal per indicated horsepower-hour. This is comparable to the achievement of the groundbreaking SS Agamemnon (1865) at 2.2lbs per indicated horsepower-hour, but at a boiler pressure of . =Grounding= On 12 September 1869, she ran aground on Sha\`b Abu Nuhas coral reef near Shadwan Island at the mouth of the Gulf of Suez in the Red Sea. Having assessed the ship to be safe and the pumps intact, Captain P. B. Jones denied passengers' repeated requests to abandon ship, and reassured them that the ship was safe and that the P&O; liner Sumatra was due to pass by and would rescue them. There was a general air of calm and normality on board until about 2 a.m. on the 14th, when the rising water engulfed the ship's boilers and the ship was left without power or light. At 11 a.m. the following morning, after 34 hours on the reef, Captain Jones had just given the order to abandon ship and the first four passengers had taken their seats in one of the lifeboats when Carnatic suddenly broke in half. Thirty-one people drowned. The survivors made it to barren island of Shadwan, where the next day the Sumatra rescued them.A contemporary print of the wreck of Carnatic Carnatic was carrying ¬£40,000 worth of gold (well in excess of ¬£1,000,000 in modern terms), so the wreck was the subject of a salvage operation two weeks later. All the gold was reported recovered, but persistent rumours of remaining treasure have added to the romance of the ship. Captain Jones was recalled to England to face an official Board of Inquiry, which labelled him \\"a skilful and experienced officer\\". However, the inquiry added that \\"it appears there was every condition as regards ship, weather and light to ensure a safe voyage and there was needed only proper care. This was not done, and hence the disaster.\\" Although Jones's Master's certificate was suspended for only nine months, he never returned to sea.

Burton performed on the band's first three studio albums: Kill 'Em All, Ride the Lightning and Master of Puppets. He also received a posthumous writing credit for the song \\"To Live Is to Die\\" from the band's fourth studio album, ...And Justice for All. On September 27, 1986 around 7:00 a.m. Burton died in a bus crash in Kronoberg County, a rural area of southern Sweden, as Metallica toured in support of the Master of Puppets album. He has been recognized as a very influential musician both during his career and after his death, placing ninth in a 2011 Rolling Stone magazine online reader poll recognizing the greatest bassists of all time. He was posthumously inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame as a member of Metallica on April 4, 2009.  Biography  = Early life = Clifford Lee Burton was born in Castro Valley, California, to Ray and Jan Burton. He had two elder siblings, Scott and Connie. Burton's interest in music began when his father introduced him to classical music and he began taking piano lessons. In his teenage years, Burton had an interest in rock, classical, country and eventually heavy metal. He began playing the bass at age 13, after the death of his brother. His parents quoted him as saying, \\"I'm going to be the best bassist for my brother.\\" He practiced up to six hours per day (even after he joined Metallica). Along with classical and jazz, Burton's other early influences varied from southern rock and country to the blues. Burton cited Geddy Lee, Geezer Butler, Stanley Clarke, Lemmy Kilmister and Phil Lynott as major influences on his style of bass playing. = Career = While still a student at Castro Valley High School, Burton formed his first band called EZ-Street. The band took its name from a Bay Area topless bar. Other members of EZ-Street included future Faith No More guitarist \\"Big\\" Jim Martin as well as Faith No More and Ozzy Osbourne drummer Mike Bordin. Burton and Martin continued their musical collaboration after becoming students at Chabot College in Hayward, California. Their second band, Agents of Misfortune, entered the Hayward Area Recreation Department's Battle of the Bands contest in 1981. Their audition was recorded on video and features some of the earliest footage of Burton's playing style. The video also shows Burton playing parts of what would soon be two Metallica songs: his signature bass solo, \\"(Anesthesia) - Pulling Teeth\\", and the chromatic intro to \\"For Whom the Bell Tolls\\". Burton joined his first major band, Trauma, in 1982. Burton recorded the track \\"Such a Shame\\" with the band on the second Metal Massacre compilation. In 1982, Trauma traveled to Los Angeles to perform at the Whisky a Go Go. Among those in attendance were James Hetfield and Lars Ulrich, both members of Metallica, which had formed the previous year. Upon hearing, as Hetfield described it, \\"this amazing shredding\\" (which later became \\"(Anesthesia) - Pulling Teeth\\"), the two went in search of what they thought was an amazing guitar player. When they learned that what they had heard was a bass solo by Burton, they decided to recruit him for their own band. They asked him to replace departed bassist Ron McGovney, and since Burton thought that Trauma was \\"starting to get a little commercial\\", he agreed. The idea of having to move to Los Angeles did not sit well with him, and said he would join only if the band would relocate from Los Angeles to his native San Francisco Bay Area. Metallica, eager to have Burton in the band, left their origin of Los Angeles to make a home in El Cerrito, a town located across the bay from San Francisco. Burton's first recording with Metallica was the Megaforce demo. A demo tape the band had made prior to Burton's joining, No Life 'til Leather, managed to come into the hands of Jon Zazula, owner of Megaforce Records. The band relocated to Old Bridge, New Jersey and quickly secured a recording contract with Zazula's label. Their debut album, Kill 'Em All, features Burton's famous solo piece, \\"(Anesthesia) - Pulling Teeth\\", which showcased his use of effects, such as a wah-wah pedal, not commonly used by bass guitarists. Metallica's debut album, Kill 'Em All, was originally intended to inherit the name of one of their earlier demo releases (predating Burton's participation), which was Metal Up Your Ass, but the record company did not like the title and insisted on changing it. After the band learned of the change, Burton said \\"We should just kill 'em all, man,\\" which gave the band members an idea for the new title. The album was released on July 25, 1983 through Megaforce Records. The band's second studio album, Ride the Lightning, showcased the band's increasing musical growth. Burton's songwriting abilities were growing, and he received credit on six of the album's eight songs.[ Allmusic Guide, Ride the Lightning review]. Retrieved April 26, 2007. Burton's playing style and use of effects is showcased on two tracks: the chromatic intro to \\"For Whom the Bell Tolls\\", and the \\"lead bass\\" on \\"The Call of Ktulu\\". The increase of musicianship on Ride the Lightning caught the attention of major record labels. Metallica was signed to Elektra Records, and began working on its third album, Master of Puppets, which is considered by most critics to be a landmark album in heavy metal. Among the tracks featured in the album are the instrumental \\"Orion\\" (which features a prominent lead bass section) and the title track, which was Burton's favorite Metallica song.Cliff Burton R.I.P.

The final song he performed was \\"Fight Fire With Fire\\".  Death  In Sweden, on the Damage Inc. tour in support of Master of Puppets, the band members complained that the sleeping cubicles on their tour bus were unsatisfactory and uncomfortable. To decide who received pick of the bunks, Kirk Hammett and Burton drew playing cards. On the evening of September 26, 1986, Burton won the game with an ace of spades, thereby getting the first choice of bunk. Burton turned to Hammett and said \\"I want your bunk\\", Hammett then responded \\"Fine, take my bunk, I'll sleep up front, it's probably better up there anyway.\\" Burton was sleeping shortly before 7:00 a.m. on September 27 when, according to the driver, the bus skidded off the road (the E4, north of Ljungby), and flipped onto the grass in Kronoberg County. Burton was thrown through the window of the bus, which fell on top of him, resulting in his death. Cliff Burton memorial stone October 15, 2018 Cliff Burton memorial stone October 15, 2018 The bus driver said that the crash was caused by the bus hitting a patch of black ice on the road, but James Hetfield later stated that he first believed the bus flipped because the driver was drunk. Hetfield also stated that he walked long distances down the road looking for black ice and found none. When local freelance photographer Lennart Wennberg (who attended the crash scene the following morning) was asked in a later interview about the likelihood that black ice caused the accident, he said it was \\"out of the question\\" because the road was dry and the temperature around , above the freezing point of . This was confirmed by police who ‚Äì like Hetfield ‚Äì also found no ice on the road. Ljungby detective Arne Pettersson was reported in a local newspaper to have said the tracks at the accident site were exactly like ones seen when drivers fall asleep at the wheel. However, the driver stated under oath that he had slept during the day and was fully rested; his testimony was confirmed by the driver of a second tour bus that was carrying the band's crew and equipment. The driver was determined not at fault for the accident and no charges were brought against him.  Legacy  Burton's body was cremated and the ashes were scattered at the Maxwell Ranch. At the ceremony, the song \\"Orion\\" was played. Shortly after Burton's death, Jason Newsted from Flotsam and Jetsam became Metallica's new bassist. Metallica wrote a tribute to Burton titled \\"To Live Is to Die\\" for ...And Justice for All. Burton also received a writing credit for the lyrics and bass parts that were taken from unused bass recordings done by Burton which were re-recorded by Jason Newsted. A non-Metallica tribute to Burton is the song \\"In My Darkest Hour\\" by thrash metal band Megadeth. According to Dave Mustaine, after hearing of Burton's death, he sat down and wrote the music for the song in one sitting. The lyrics, however, are unrelated to Burton's death. Mustaine was Metallica's lead guitarist in the early days and was a close friend of Burton at the time. On October 3, 2006, a memorial stone was unveiled in Sweden near the scene of the fatal crash. The lyrics \\"...cannot the Kingdom of Salvation take me home\\" from \\"To Live Is to Die\\" are written on Burton's memorial stone. Thrash metal band Anthrax dedicated its album Among the Living to him, as did Metal Church with The Dark. On April 4, 2009, Burton was posthumously inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame, with fellow Metallica bandmates James Hetfield, Lars Ulrich, and Kirk Hammett. Future bassists Jason Newsted and Robert Trujillo were inducted as well. During the ceremony, the induction was accepted by his father Ray Burton, who shared the stage with the band and said that Cliff's mother was Metallica's biggest fan. A biography, To Live Is to Die: The Life and Death of Metallica's Cliff Burton, written by Joel McIver, was published by Jawbone Press in June 2009. Hammett provided the book's foreword. In November 2016, Metallica released the album Hardwired... to Self- Destruct. The deluxe version of the album features a series of live recordings at Berkeley, California's legendary record store Rasputin Music in celebration of Record Store Day on April 16, 2016. The song \\"Fade to Black\\" was played with lead singer James Hetfield dedicating the song to Burton. During the song Hetfield yells, \\"Can you hear us Cliff?\\". In 2017, it was revealed that Burton's parents had been donating his posthumous royalty payments to a scholarship fund for music students at his alma mater Castro Valley High School. In 2018, the Alameda County, California, Board of Supervisors issued a proclamation declaring February 10, 2018 (what would have been Burton's 56th birthday) as \\"Cliff Burton Day\\" after a fan petition successfully passed. The S&M2; concert in 2019 featured San Francisco Symphony bassist Scott Pingel paying tribute to Burton by playing his signature bass solo, \\"Anesthesia (Pulling Teeth)\\", using an electric double bass with pedal effects.  Equipment  The first bass guitar he was publicly seen playing, in Agents of Misfortune, was a heavily modified Rickenbacker 4001 painted in a \\"Burgundyglo\\" color. After joining Metallica, Burton removed the stock pickups and had the neck humbucker from a Gibson EB-0 installed in the neck position, a Seymour Duncan stacked Jazz pickup in the bridge position and a Seymour Duncan stacked Stratocaster pickup fitted within the bridge cavern of the bass, replacing the existing foam string mute. At some point after recording Kill 'Em All, Burton retired this bass from public use due to malfunction, and instead used a variety of high-end bass guitars including a black Alembic Spoiler (which was later stolen) and an Aria Pro SB-1000 Black 'n' Gold. Burton used a large array of amplifiers and effects pedals as well. Cliff Burton Signature Bass In January 2013, the guitar manufacturer Aria revealed through Metallica's official website that it would be releasing a replica of Burton's bass, called the Aria Pro II Cliff Burton Signature Bass. The company had received permission from Burton's family and from Metallica to produce the instrument. The bass guitar was officially unveiled at Winter NAMM in Anaheim, California. On January 25, 2013, Burton's father Ray attended the press conference where he signed autographs and talked about Burton's life and the instrument.

Not himself a scientist, he has been called \\"the most skillful apologist of the virtuosi\\", or in other words the leading propagandist for the approach of the English natural philosophers of the later 17th century.Richard S. Westfall, Science and Religion in Seventeenth-Century England (1973), p. 18. In 1661 he predicted \\"To converse at the distance of the Indes by means of sympathetic conveyances may be as natural to future times as to us is a literary correspondence.\\"Joseph Glanvill, Scepsis Scientifica, or The Vanity of Dogmatizing, chap. XXI, 1661 Retrieved 2020-03-22. Joseph Glanvill, 1681 engraving by William Faithorne. Life He was raised in a strict Puritan household, and educated at Oxford University, where he graduated B.A. from Exeter College in 1655, M.A. from Lincoln College in 1658.Concise Dictionary of National Biography Glanvill was made vicar of Frome in 1662, and was a Fellow of the Royal Society in 1664. He was rector of the Abbey Church at Bath from 1666 to 1680, and prebendary of Worcester in 1678. Works and views He was a Latitudinarian thinker. Latitudinarians generally respected the Cambridge Platonists, and Glanvill was friendly with and much influenced by Henry More, a leader in that group where Glanvill was a follower. It was Glanvill's style to seek out a \\"middle way\\" on contemporary philosophical issues. His writings display a variety of beliefs that may appear contradictory. There is discussion of Glanvill's thought and method in Basil Willey's Seventeenth Century Background (1934). =Rationality and plain talking= He was the author of The Vanity of Dogmatizing (editions from 1661), which attacked scholasticism and religious persecution. It was a plea for religious toleration, the scientific method, and freedom of thought. It also contained a tale that became the material for Matthew Arnold's Victorian poem The Scholar Gipsy. Glanvill was at first a Cartesian, but shifted his ground a little, engaging with scepticism and proposing a modification in Scepsis Scientifica (1665), a revision and expansion of The Vanity of Dogmatizing. It started with an explicit \\"Address to the Royal Society\\"; the Society responded by electing him as Fellow. He continued in a role of spokesman for his type of limited sceptical approach, and the Society's production of useful knowledge.Richard H. Popkin (editor), The Pimlico History of Western Philosophy (1999), pp. 360‚Äì2. As part of his programme, he argued for a plain use of language, undistorted as to definitions and reliance on metaphor.Jonathan Sawday, The Body Emblazoned: Dissection and the Human Body in Renaissance Culture (1996), p. 235. He also advocated with Essay Concerning Preaching (1678) simple speech, rather than bluntness, in preaching, as Robert South did, with hits at nonconformist sermons; he was quite aware that the term \\"plain\\" takes a great deal of unpacking.N. H. Keeble, The Literary Culture of Nonconformity in Later Seventeenth-century England (1987), p. 244 and p. 246. In Essays on Several Important Subjects in Philosophy and Religion (1676) he wrote a significant essay The Agreement of Reason and Religion, aimed at least in part at nonconformism. Reason, in Glanvill's view, was incompatible with being a dissenter.Richard Ashcraft, Latitudinarianism and Toleration, p. 157 in Richard W. F. Kroll, Richard Ashcraft, Perez Zagorin (editors), Philosophy, Science, and Religion in England, 1640‚Äì1700 (1991). In Antifanatickal Religion and Free Philosophy, another essay from the volume, he attacked the whole tradition of imaginative illumination in religion, going back to William Perkins, as founded on the denigration of reason.Jeremy Schmidt, Melancholy and the Care of the Soul: Religion, Moral Philosophy and Madness in Early Modern England (2007), p. 89. This essay has the subtitle Continuation of the New Atlantis, and so connects with Francis Bacon's utopia. In an allegory, Glanvill placed the \\"Young Academicians\\", standing for the Cambridge Platonists, in the midst of intellectual troubles matching the religious upheavals seen in Britain. They coped by combining modern with ancient thought.Westfall, p. 116. Glanvill thought, however, that the world cannot be deduced from reason alone. Even the supernatural cannot be solved from first principles and must be investigated empirically. As a result, Glanvill attempted to investigate supposed supernatural incidents through interviews and examination of the scene of the events. =The supernatural= The Witch of Endor: from the frontispiece to Glanvill's Saducismus Triumphatus He is known also for Saducismus Triumphatus (1681), this enlargement of his Blow at Modern Sadducism (1668) was published after Glanvill's death by Henry More. The work decried scepticism about the existence and supernatural power of witchcraft and contained a collection of seventeenth-century folklore about witches, including one of the earliest descriptions of a witch bottle. Joseph made known the existence of witchcraft. It developed as a compendium (with multiple authorship) from Philosophical Considerations Touching the Being of Witches and Witchcraft (1666), addressed to Robert Hunt, a Justice of the Peace active from the 1650s against witches in Somerset (where Glanvill had his living at Frome); the 1668 version A Blow at Modern Sadducism promoted the view that the judicial procedures such as Hunt's court offered should be taken as adequate tests of evidence, because to argue otherwise was to undermine society at its legal roots.Stuart Clark, Thinking with Demons: The Idea of Witchcraft in Early Modern Europe (1999), p. 176. His biographer Ferris Greenslet attributed Glanvill's interest in the topic to a house party in February 1665 at Ragley Hall, home of Lady Anne Conway, where other guests were More, Francis van Helmont, and Valentine Greatrakes.Ferris Greenslet, Joseph Glanvill: A Study in English Thought and Letters of the Seventeenth Century (1900), p. 66. In the matter of the Drummer of Tedworth, a report of poltergeist-type activity from 1662‚Äì3, More and Glanvill had in fact already corresponded about it in 1663. Saducismus Triumphatus deeply influenced Cotton Mather's Wonders of the Invisible World (1693), written to justify the Salem witch trials in the following year. It was also taken as a target when Francis Hutchinson set down An Historical Essay Concerning Witchcraft (1718); both books made much of reports from Sweden, and included by Glanvill as editor, which had experienced a moral panic about witchcraft after 1668.E. William Monter, Scandinavian Witchcraft in Perspective, pp. 432‚Äì3, in Bengt Ankarloo and Guctav Henningsen, Early Modern Witchcraft: Centres and Peripheries (1990). Jonathan Israel writes: These and others (Richard Baxter, Meric Casaubon, George Sinclair) believed that the tide of scepticism on witchcraft, setting in strongly by about 1670, could be turned back by research and sifting of the evidence.Keith Thomas, Religion and the Decline of Magic (1973), p. 690 and p. 693. Like More, Glanvill believed that the existence of spirits was well documented in the Bible, and that the denial of spirits and demons was the first step towards atheism. Atheism led to rebellion and social chaos and therefore had to be overcome by science and the activities of the learned. Israel cites a letter from More to Glanvill, from 1678 and included in Saducismus Triumphatus, in which he says that followers of Thomas Hobbes and Baruch Spinoza use scepticism about \\"spirits and angels\\" to undermine belief in the Scripture mentioning them. Saducismus Triumphatus was also translated into German in 1701.Joseph Glanvill, Saducismus Triumphatus, Oder Vollkommener und klarer Bewei√ü Von Hexen und Gespenstern Oder Geister- Erscheinungen (Hamburg: Liebernickel, 1701). The German edition was used extensively by Peter Goldschmidt in his similar work Verworffener Hexen- und Zauberer-Advocat (1705). This work brought the Saducismus Triumphatus to the attention of Christian Thomasius, a philosopher, legal professor and sceptic in Halle. Over the next 21 years, Thomasius published translations of works by English sceptics: John Webster and Francis Hutchinson, as well as John Beaumont's An Historical, Physiological and Theological Treatise of Spirits, all of which were accompanied by vitriolic prefaces attacking Glanvill, Goldschmidt and their belief in witchcraft.Julie Davies (2016) \\"German receptions of the works of Joseph Glanvill: philosophical transmissions from England to Germany in the late seventeenth and early eighteenth century\\", Intellectual History Review, 26:1, 81-90, DOI:10.1080/17496977.2015.1032120 =Atheism, scepticism and Aristotle= His views did not prevent Glanvill himself being charged with atheism. This happened after he engaged in a controversy with Robert Crosse, over the continuing value of the work of Aristotle, the classical exponent of the middle way.Nicholas H. Steneck (1981), \\"The Ballad of Robert Crosse and Joseph Glanvill\\" and the Background to Plus Ultra, British Journal for the History of Science, 1981, vol. 14, no. 46, pp. 59‚Äì74. In defending himself and the Royal Society, in Plus ultra, he attacked current teaching of medicine (physick), and in return was attacked by Henry Stubbe, in The Plus Ultra reduced to a Non Plus (1670).Roger Kenneth French, Andrew Wear (editors), The Medical Revolution of the Seventeenth Century (1989), pp. 151‚Äì2. His views on Aristotle also led to an attack by Thomas White, the Catholic priest known as Blacklo. In A Praefatory Answer to Mr. Henry Stubbe (1671) he defined the \\"philosophy of the virtuosi\\" cleanly: the \\"plain objects of sense\\" to be respected, as the locus of as much certainty as was available; the \\"suspension of assent\\" absent adequate proof; and the claim for the approach as \\"equally an adversary to scepticism and credulity\\". To White he denied being a sceptic.Stephen Gaukroger, The Emergence of a Scientific Culture: Science and the Shaping of Modernity, 1210‚Äì1685 (2006), p. 224.Stuart Clark, Vanities of the Eye: Vision in Early Modern European Culture (2007), p. 352. A contemporary view is that his approach was a species of rational fideism.Richard Henry Popkin, The History of Scepticism: From Savonarola to Bayle (2003 edition), p. 213. His Philosophia Pia (1671) was explicitly about the connection between the \\"experimental philosophy\\" of the Royal Society and religion. It was a reply to a letter of Meric Casaubon, one of the Society's critics, to Peter du Moulin. He used it to cast doubt on the roots of enthusiasm, one of his main targets amongst the nonconformists.Michael Heyd, Be Sober and Reasonable: The Critique of Enthusiasm in the Seventeenth and Early Eighteenth Centuries (1995), note p. 156. It also dealt with criticisms of Richard Baxter, who was another accusing the Society of an atheist tendency.Jon Parkin, Science, Religion and Politics in Restoration England: Richard Cumberland's De Legibus Naturae (1999), pp. 137‚Äì8. In literature Edgar Allan Poe's short stories Ligeia and A Descent into the Maelstr√∂m contain epigraphs ascribed to Glanvill. Aleister Crowley's book Diary of a Drug Fiend opens with a direct quotation from Glanvill. Some sections of Shirley Jackson's short story collection The Lottery and Other Stories open with quotations from Glanvill's Sadducismus Triumphatus. References Further reading *Richard H.

It was built and leased to NASA by Joseph L. Smith & Associates, Inc.\\"Space\\" is our product. // Aviation Week & Space Technology, June 17, 1963, v. 78, no. 24, p. 127. It was renamed in honor of the late US president and Texas native, Lyndon B. Johnson, by an act of the United States Senate on February 19, 1973. It consists of a complex of 100 buildings constructed on in the Clear Lake Area of Houston, which acquired the official nickname \\"Space City\\" in 1967. The center is home to NASA's astronaut corps, and is responsible for training astronauts from both the US and its international partners. It houses the Christopher C. Kraft Jr. Mission Control Center, which has provided the flight control function for every NASA human spaceflight since Gemini 4 (including Apollo, Skylab, Apollo‚ÄìSoyuz, and Space Shuttle). It is popularly known by its radio call signs \\"Mission Control\\" and \\"Houston\\". The original Manned Spacecraft Center grew out of the Space Task Group (STG) headed by Robert Gilruth that was formed to coordinate the US crewed spaceflight program. The STG was based at the Langley Research Center in Hampton, Virginia, but reported organizationally to the Goddard Space Flight Center just outside Washington, D.C. To meet the growing needs of the US human spaceflight program, plans began in 1961 to expand its staff to its own organization, and move it to a new facility. This was constructed in 1962 and 1963 on land donated by the Humble Oil company through Rice University, and officially opened its doors in September 1963. Today, JSC is one of ten major NASA field centers. History Robert Gilruth, leader of the Space Task Group, became NASA's first director of the Manned Spacecraft Center in 1961. Johnson Space Center has its origins in NASA's Space Task Group (STG). Starting on November 5, 1958, Langley Research Center engineers under Robert Gilruth directed Project Mercury and follow-on crewed space programs. The STG originally reported to the Goddard Space Flight Center organization, with a total staff of 45, including 37 engineers, and eight secretaries and human \\"computers\\" (women who ran calculations on mechanical adding machines). In 1959, the center added 32 Canadian engineers put out of work by the cancellation of the Avro Canada CF-105 Arrow project. NASA's first administrator, T. Keith Glennan, realized that the growth of the US space program would cause the STG to outgrow the Langley and Goddard centers and require its own location. On January 1, 1961, he wrote a memo to his yet-unnamed successor (who turned out to be James E. Webb), recommending a new site be chosen. Later that year, when President John F. Kennedy set the goal to put a person on the Moon by the end of the decade, it became clear Gilruth would need a larger organization to lead the Apollo Program, with new test facilities and research laboratories. =Site selection= In 1961, Congress held hearings and passed a $1.7 billion 1962 NASA appropriations bill which included $60 million for the new crewed spaceflight laboratory. A set of requirements for the new site was drawn up and released to the Congress and general public. These included: access to water transport by large barges, a moderate climate, availability of all- weather commercial jet service, a well-established industrial complex with supporting technical facilities and labor, close proximity to a culturally attractive community in the vicinity of an institution of higher education, a strong electric utility and water supply, at least of land, and certain specified cost parameters. In August 1961, Webb asked Associate Director of the Ames Research Center John F. Parsons to head a site-selection team, which included Philip Miller, Wesley Hjornevik, and I. Edward Campagna, the construction engineer for the STG. The team initially came up with a list of 22 cities based on the climate and water criteria, then cut this to a short list of nine with nearby federal facilities: * Jacksonville, Florida (Green Cove Springs Naval Station) * Tampa, Florida (MacDill Air Force Base) * Baton Rouge, Louisiana * Shreveport, Louisiana (Barksdale Air Force Base) * Houston, Texas (San Jacinto Army Ordnance Depot) * Victoria, Texas (FAA Airport) * Corpus Christi, Texas (Naval Air Station) * San Diego, California (Camp Elliott) * San Francisco, California (Benicia Arsenal) Another 14 sites were then added, including two additional Houston sites chosen because of proximity to the University of Houston and Rice University. The team visited all 23 sites between August 21 and September 7, 1961. During these visits, Massachusetts Governor John A. Volpe and Senator Margaret Chase Smith headed a delegation which exerted particularly strong political pressure, prompting a personal inquiry to Webb from President Kennedy. Senators and Congressmen from sites in Missouri and California similarly lobbied the selection team. Proponents of sites in Boston, Massachusetts, Rhode Island, and Norfolk, Virginia, went so far as to make separate presentations to Webb and the headquarters staff, so Webb added these additional sites to the final review. Following its tour, the team identified MacDill Air Force Base in Tampa as its first choice, based on the fact the Air Force was planning to close down its Strategic Air Command operations there. The Houston Rice University site was second, and the Benicia Ordnance Depot in San Francisco was third. Before a decision could be made, however, the Air Force decided not to close MacDill, omitting it from consideration and moving the Rice University site to first place. Webb informed President Kennedy on September 14 of the decision made by him and deputy administrator Hugh Dryden in two separate memoranda, one reviewing the criteria and procedures, and the other stating: \\"Our decision is that this laboratory should be located in Houston, Texas, in close association with Rice University and the other educational institutions there and in that region.\\" The Executive Office and NASA made advance notifications of the award, and the public announcement of the location followed on September 19, 1961. According to Texas A&M; University historian Henry C. Dethloff, \\"Although the Houston site neatly fit the criteria required for the new center, Texas undoubtedly exerted an enormous political influence on such a decision. Lyndon B. Johnson was Vice President and head of the Space Council, Albert Thomas headed the House Appropriations Committee, Bob Casey and Olin E. Teague were members of the House Committee on Science and Astronautics, and Teague headed the Subcommittee on Manned Space Flight. Finally, Sam Rayburn was Speaker of the House of Representatives.\\" The land for the new facility was donated to Rice by the Humble Oil company, situated in an undeveloped area southeast of Houston adjacent to Clear Lake near Galveston Bay. At the time, the land was used to graze cattle. Immediately after Webb's announcement, Gilruth and his staff began planning the move from Langley to Houston, using what would grow to of leased office and laboratory space in 11 scattered sites. On November 1, the conversion of the Task Group to MSC became official. =Construction and early operations= Tracts of land in the vicinity of the Manned Spacecraft Center were either owned or being under exclusive control of Joseph L. Smith & Associates, Inc. NASA purchased an additional so the property would face a highway, and the total included another reserve drilling site. Construction of the center, designed by Charles Luckman, began in April 1962, and Gilruth's new organization was formed and moved to the temporary locations by September. That month, Kennedy gave a speech at Rice University on the US space program. The speech is famous for highlighting the Apollo program, but Kennedy also made reference to the new Center: The facility was officially opened for business in September 1963.\\"Lyndon B. Johnson Space Center\\". NASAFacts. JSC 04264 Rev D. Mission Control Center Mission Operations Control Room 2 at the conclusion of Apollo 11 in 1969 In 1961, as plans for Project Gemini began, it became increasingly clear that the Mercury Control Center located at the Cape Canaveral Air Force Station launch center would become inadequate to control missions with maneuverable spacecraft such as Gemini and Apollo. Christopher Kraft and three other flight controllers began studying what was needed for an improved control center, and directed a study contract awarded to Philco's Western Development Laboratory. Philco bid on and won the contract to build the electronic equipment for the new Mission Control Center, which would be located in Building 30 of MSC rather than Canaveral or the Goddard Space Flight Center in Maryland. Construction began in 1963. The new center had two Mission Operations Control Rooms, allowing training and preparation for a later mission to be carried out while a live mission is in progress. It was brought online for testing purposes during the uncrewed Gemini 2 flight in January 1965 and the first crewed Gemini flight, Gemini 3 in March 1965, though the Mercury Control Center still retained primary responsibility for control of these flights. It became fully operational for the flight of Gemini 4 the following June, and has been the primary flight control center for all subsequent US crewed space missions from Project Gemini forward. NASA named the center the Christopher C. Kraft Jr. Mission Control Center on April 14, 2011.NASA - NASA Names Mission Control for Legendary Flight Director Christopher Kraft. Nasa.gov (2011-04-14). Retrieved on 2013-09-06. =Apollo program= In addition to housing NASA's astronaut operations, JSC is also the site of the former Lunar Receiving Laboratory, where the first astronauts returning from the Moon were quarantined, and where the majority of lunar samples are stored. The center's Landing and Recovery Division operated MV Retriever in the Gulf of Mexico for Gemini and Apollo astronauts to practice water egress after splashdown. On February 19, 1973, after Johnson's death, President Richard Nixon signed into law a Senate resolution renaming the Manned Spacecraft Center in honor of Johnson, who as Senate Majority Leader had sponsored the 1958 legislation which created NASA. Dedication ceremonies under the new name were held on August 27 of that year. One of the artifacts displayed at Johnson Space Center is the Saturn V rocket. It is whole, except for the ring between the S-IC and S-II stages, and the fairing between the S-II and S-IVB stages, and made of actual surplus flight- ready articles. It also has real (though incomplete) Apollo command and service modules, intended to fly in the canceled Apollo 19 mission. In June 2019, the restored Apollo Mission Control Center was opened for tourists. =Space Shuttle program= Space Shuttle Columbia disaster In the wake of the January 28, 1986, Space Shuttle Challenger disaster, President Ronald Reagan and First Lady Nancy Reagan traveled to JSC on January 31 to speak at a memorial service honoring the astronauts. It was attended by 6,000 NASA employees and 4,000 guests, as well as by the families of the crew. During the ceremony, an Air Force band led the singing of \\"God Bless America\\" as NASA T-38 Talon supersonic jets flew directly over the scene in the traditional missing-man formation. All activities were broadcast live by the national television and radio networks. A similar memorial service was held at the Johnson Space Center on February 4, 2003, for the astronauts who perished in the Space Shuttle Columbia disaster three days before, which was attended by President George W. Bush and First Lady Laura Bush. Although that service was broadcast live by the national television and radio networks, it was geared mainly to NASA employees and the families of the astronauts. A second service for the nation was led by Vice-President Dick Cheney and his wife Lynne at Washington National Cathedral two days later. On September 13, 2008, Hurricane Ike hit Galveston as a category 2 hurricane and caused minor damage to the Mission Control Center and other buildings at JSC. The storm damaged the roofs of several hangars for the T-38 Talons at Ellington Field. Facilities The Johnson Space Center is home to Christopher C. Kraft Jr. Mission Control Center (MCC-H), the NASA control center that coordinates and monitors all human spaceflight for the United States. MCC-H directed all Space Shuttle missions, and currently directs American activities aboard the International Space Station. The Apollo Mission Control Center, a National Historic Landmark, is in Building 30. From the moment a crewed spacecraft clears its launch tower until it lands back on Earth, it is in the hands of Mission Control. The MCC houses several Flight Control Rooms, from which flight controllers coordinate and monitor the spaceflights. The rooms have many computer resources to monitor, command, and communicate with spacecraft. When a mission is underway, the rooms are staffed around the clock, usually in three shifts. JSC handles most of the planning and training of the US astronaut corps and houses training facilities such as the Sonny Carter Training Facility and the Neutral Buoyancy Laboratory, a critical component in training astronauts for spacewalks. The Neutral Buoyancy Laboratory provides a controlled neutral buoyancy environment‚Äîa very large pool containing about 6.2 million US gallons (23,000 m3) of water where astronauts train to practice extra-vehicular activity tasks while simulating zero-g conditions. The facility provides preflight training in becoming familiar with crew activities and with the dynamics of body motion under weightless conditions. Building 31-N houses the Lunar Sample Laboratory Facility, which stores, analyzes, and processes most of the samples returned from the Moon during the Apollo program. The center is also responsible for direction of operations at White Sands Test Facility in New Mexico, which served as a backup Space Shuttle landing site and would have been the coordinating facility for the Constellation program, which was planned to replace the Shuttle program after 2010, but was canceled in 2009. The visitor center has been the adjacent Space Center Houston since 1994; JSC Building 2 previously housed the visitor center. The Johnson Space Center Heliport is located on the campus. Personnel and training Apollo 11 astronauts Neil Armstrong (left) and Buzz Aldrin train in Building 9 on April 18, 1969 A shuttle astronaut training in the Neutral Buoyancy Laboratory About 3,200 civil servants, including 110 astronauts, are employed at Johnson Space Center. The bulk of the workforce consists of over 11,000 contractors. As of October 2014, Stinger Ghaffarian Technologies took over United Space Alliance's primary contract. As of May 2018, the center's 12th director is Mark S Geyer, the first being Robert Gilruth. NASA's astronaut training is conducted at the Johnson Space Center. Astronaut candidates receive training on spacecraft systems and in basic sciences including mathematics, guidance and navigation, oceanography, orbital dynamics, astronomy, and physics. Candidates are required to complete military water survival prior to beginning their flying instruction. Candidates are also required to become scuba-qualified for extravehicular training and are required to pass a swimming test. EVA training is conducted at the Sonny Carter Training Facility. Candidates are also trained to deal with emergencies associated with hyperbaric and hypobaric atmospheric pressures and are given exposure to the microgravity of space flight. Candidates maintain their flying proficiency by flying 15 hours per month in NASA's fleet of T-38 jets based at nearby Ellington Field. Research Johnson Space Center leads NASA's human spaceflight-related scientific and medical research programs. Technologies developed for spaceflight are now in use in many areas of medicine, energy, transportation, agriculture, communications, and electronics. The Astromaterials Research and Exploration Science (ARES) office performs the physical science research at the center. ARES directs and manages all functions and activities of the ARES scientists who perform basic research in earth, planetary, and space sciences. ARES scientists and engineers provide support to the human and robotic spaceflight programs. The responsibilities of ARES also include interaction with the Office of Safety and Mission Assurance and the Human Space Flight Programs. Johnson Space Center was granted a five- year, $120-million extension of its agreement with the National Space Biomedical Research Institute at Baylor College of Medicine to study the health risks related to long-duration space flight. The extension will allow a continuation of biomedical research in support of a long-term human presence in space started by the institute and NASA's Human Research Program through 2012. The Prebreathe Reduction Program is a research study program at the JSC that is currently being developed to improve the safety and efficiency of space walks from the International Space Station.

Through his writings and his lectures, he became known as one of the most influential representatives of liberal theology. Biography Pfleiderer was born at Stetten im Remstal (now a part of Kernen, Baden-W√ºrttemberg) in W√ºrttemberg. From 1857 to 1861 he studied at the University of T√ºbingen under Ferdinand Christian Baur, and afterwards in England and Scotland. He then entered the ministry, became tutor () at T√ºbingen, and for a short time held a pastorate at Heilbronn (1868). In 1870 he became chief pastor and superintendent at the University of Jena and soon afterwards professor ordinarius of theology, but in 1875 he was called to the chair of systematic theology at Berlin, having made his name by a series of articles on New Testament criticism and Johannine and Pauline theology, which appeared in Adolf Hilgenfeld's Zeitschrift f√ºr wissenschaftliche Theologie, and by his Der Paulinismus, published in 1873. Das Urchristentum, seine Schriften und Lehren, in geschichtlichen Zusammenhang beschrieben was published in 1878 and considerably enlarged for a second edition in 1902. In 1890 appeared The Development of Theology since Kant, and its Progress in Great Britain since 1825, which was written for publication in England. A more elaborate work was his Religionsphilosophie auf geschichtlichen Grundlage (1878). \\"The Influence of the Apostle Paul on the Development of Christianity\\" was the title of a course of Hibbert Lectures given in London in 1885. In 1894 he delivered the Gifford Lectures at Edinburgh, the subject being \\"The Philosophy and Development of Religion\\". His later publications included: * The Early Christian Conception of Christ (1905) * Die Entstehung des Christentums (1905) * Religion und Religionen (1906) * Die Entwicklung des Christentums (1907). He died at , near Berlin. In New Testament criticism, Pfleiderer belonged to the critical school, which grew out of the impulse given by F. C. Baur. However, like other modern German theologians, he showed a greater disposition to compromise. All his work shows a judicial tone of mind, and is remarkable for the charm of its style. Pfleiderer's younger brother Edmund Pfleiderer distinguished himself both in philosophy and theology.

The original name was Shetland Collie, but this caused controversy among the Rough Collie breeders of the time, so the breed's name was formally changed. This hard-working small dog is intelligent, vocal, excitable and willing to please. They are incredibly loyal to their owners to the point where they are often referred to as \\"shadows\\" due to their attachment to family. This breed was formally recognized by The Kennel Club (UK) in 1909. Like the Shetland pony, Shetland cattle and the Shetland sheep, the Shetland Sheepdog is a hardy but diminutive breed developed to thrive amidst the harsh and meagre conditions of its native islands. While the Sheltie still excels at herding, today it is often raised as a farm dog and/or family pet.\\"Shetland sheepdog.\\" The Columbia Encyclopedia. New York: Columbia University Press, 2008. Credo Reference. Web. 17 September 2012 The Sheltie's origins are obscure, but it is not a direct descendant of the Rough Collie, which it largely resembles. Rather, the Sheltie is a descendant of small specimens of the Scottish Collie and the King Charles Spaniel. They were originally a small mixed-breed dog, often only about in height at the shoulder, and it is thought that the original Shetland herding dogs were of the Spitz type, and were crossed with Collies from mainland Britain. In the early 20th century, James Loggie added a small Rough Collie to the breeding stock, and helped establish the breed that would become the modern Shetland Sheepdog. History left Unlike many miniature breeds that resemble their larger counterparts, this breed was not developed simply by selectively breeding the Rough Collie for smaller and smaller size. The original sheepdog of Shetland was a Spitz-type dog, probably similar to the modern Icelandic Sheepdog. This dog was crossed with mainland working collies brought to the islands, and then after being brought to England, it was further extensively crossed with the Rough Collie, and other breeds including some or all of the extinct Greenland Yakki, the King Charles Spaniel (not the Cavalier), the Pomeranian, and possibly the Border Collie. The original Spitz- type working sheepdog of Shetland is now extinct, having been replaced for herding there by the Border Collie. Shelties were used for herding until commercial livestock farming required larger breeds. When the breed was originally introduced breeders called them Shetland Collies, which upset Rough Collie breeders, so the name was changed to Shetland Sheepdog. During the early 20th century (up until the 1940s), additional crosses were made to Rough Collies to help retain the desired Rough Collie type ‚Äì in fact, the first AKC Sheltie champion's dam was a purebred rough Collie. The year 1909 marked the initial recognition of the Sheltie by the English Kennel Club, with the first registered Sheltie being a female called Badenock Rose. The first Sheltie to be registered by the American Kennel Club was \\"Lord Scott\\" in 1911. Description A sable Shetland Sheepdog The general appearance of the Sheltie is that of a miniature Rough Collie. They are a small, double coated, working dog, agile and sturdy. Blue merle Shelties may have blue eyes or one brown and one blue eye, but all others have dark-colored eyes. Their expression should be that of alertness with a gentle and sometimes reserved nature. They are often very good with children. They carry their tail down low, only lifted when alert and never carried over the back. They are an intensely loyal breed, sometimes reserved with strangers but should not be shy or showing timidness as per the AKC breed standard. =Coat and colors= A blue merle Shetland Sheepdog A bi-blue Shetland Sheepdog with blue eyes, caused by the merle factor. Shelties have a double coat, which means that they have two layers of fur that make up their coat. The long, rough guard hairs lie on top of a thick, soft undercoat. The guard hairs are water-repellent, while the undercoat provides relief from both high and low temperatures. The English Kennel Club describes three different colors: \\"tricolor, blue merle, and sable (ranging from golden through mahogany), marked with varying amounts of white and/or tan.\\" Essentially, however, a blue merle dog is a genetically black dog, either black, white, and tan (tricolor). In the show ring, blue merles may have blue eyes; all other colors must have brown eyes. Basic coat colors *Sable ‚Äì Sable is dominant over other colors. May be pure for sable (two sable genes) or may be tri-factored or bi-factored (carrying one sable gene and one tricolor or bicolor gene). \\"Tri-factored\\" sable and \\"shaded\\" sable are not interchangeable terms. A shaded dog (one with a lot of black overlay on a sable coat) may or may not be tri-factored or bi-factored. *Tricolor ‚Äì black, white, and tan. Tricolor is dominant over bi-black, and may carry the factor for bicolor. *Bi-black ‚Äì black and white. Bi-black is recessive. A bi-black Sheltie carries two bi-black genes; thus any dog with a bi-black parent is always bi-factored whatever its own coat color is. 'Modified' coat colors Any of the above colors may also have a color modification gene. The color modification genes are merling and white factoring. Merling dilutes the base color (sable, tricolor, or bi-black) causing a black dog's coat to show a mix of black, white, and grey hairs, often with black patches. * Blue merle‚Äîblue, white and tan. A tricolor with the merling gene. May have blue eyes. * Bi-blue‚Äîblue and white. A bi-black with the merling gene. May have blue eyes. * Sable merle‚Äîfaded or mottled sable and white. Often born with a mottled coat of darker brown over lighter brown, they usually present as a faded or lighter sable or can appear as a washed-out blue-merle. Sable merles are shown in the breed ring as sables; therefore, blue eyes are a major fault in AKC. Blue eyes are not faulted in sable merles in UKC. White factoring affects the amount of white on the dog. It is hard to tell, without actually breeding, whether a dog is white-factored or not, though dogs with white going up the stifle (the front of the hind leg) are usually assumed to be white-factored. Breeding two white-factored dogs can result in color-headed whites ‚Äî Shelties with colored heads (sable, tricolor, bi-black, or blue or sable merle) and white bodies. For show dogs, dogs more than 50 percent white are heavily penalized and thus are not shown in the breed ring; they are normal in every other way. Double merles, a product of breeding two merle Shelties together, have a very high incidence of deafness or blindness. There have been reports of a brindle Sheltie but many Sheltie enthusiasts agree that a cross sometime in the ancestry of that specific Sheltie could have produced a brindle. Unacceptable colors in the show ring are a rustiness in a blue or black coat. Colors may not be faded, no conspicuous white spots, and the color cannot be over 50 percent white.left =Height and weight= Shelties normally weigh around . In general, males are taller and heavier than females. Accepted height ranges may differ depending on country and standard used. In the US and Canada, breed standards state that males and females can be between , all other standards (Australia, New Zealand and UK) specify males: , females: except FCI which specifies females: at the shoulder (withers), however, some shelties can be found outside of these ranges but are not considered truly representative of the breed. Variation can be found within litters, and height (in the range of ) is above the breed standard in some lines. Mull =Ears= To conform to the breed standards, the Shelties' ears should bend slightly or \\"tip\\", this contributes to the \\"proper Sheltie expression\\". The ear is to have the top third to a quarter of the ear tipped. If a dog's ears are not bent (referred to as prick ears) some owners brace them into the correct position for several weeks to several months. Wide-set (too much distance between) ears are also not a desired trait, nor are ears which tip too low down (referred to as 'hound' ears). =Grooming= Shelties have a double coat, and often shed a lot of the time, no matter the season. The topcoat consists of long, straight, water-repellent hair, which provides protection from cold and the elements. The undercoat is short, furry and very dense and helps to keep the dog warm. Mats can be commonly found behind the ears, under the elbow on each front leg, and in the fluffy fur on the hind legs (the \\"skirts\\"), as well as around the collar (if worn). The coat is usually shed twice a year, often in spring and autumn. Females will also shed right before or right after giving birth. Male shelties technically shed less than females but fur still comes off constantly. Shaving these dogs is very bad for their skin and some do not regrow any significant amount of hair after being shaved, a condition known as alopecia. Spaying or neutering can alter coat texture, making it softer, more prone to matting and even more profuse. Shelties shed in clumps which can be pulled or brushed out of the main coat, rather than individual hair. This makes them much easier to groom and clean up after than many smooth-haired dogs, which leave loose fur in their space. Temperament Apart from their size difference, Shelties and Rough Collies look very much alike. Shelties have a high level of intelligence. According to Dr Stanley Coren, an expert on animal intelligence, the Shetland sheepdog is one of the brightest dogs, ranking 6th out of 138 breeds tested. His research found that an average Sheltie could understand a new command in fewer than five repetitions and would obey a command the first time it was given 95% of the time or better. Health left For the most part, Shelties are athletic and healthy. Like the Rough Collie, there is a tendency toward inherited malformation and disease of the eyes. Each individual puppy should have his/her eyes examined by a qualified veterinary ophthalmologist. Some lines may be susceptible to hypothyroidism, epilepsy, hip dysplasia, or skin allergies. Shetland Sheepdogs have four times the risk of other dogs of developing transitional cell carcinoma, a cancer of the bladder.Clinical Medicine of the Dog and Cat, 2nd ed., ed. Michael Schaer, p. 528. Dermatomyositis may occur at the age of 4 to 6 months, and is frequently misdiagnosed by general practice veterinarians as sarcoptic or demodectic mange. The disease manifests itself as alopecia on the top of the head, supra- and suborbital area and forearms as well as the tip of the tail. If the disease progresses to its more damaging form, it could affect the autonomic nervous system and the dog may have to be euthanised. This disease is genetically transmitted and recessive, with breeders having no clear methodology for screening except clear bloodline records. Deep tissue biopsies are required to definitively diagnose dermatomyositis. Lay assessment of end- stage dermatomyositis is observed difficulty or inability to swallow, even water. Von Willebrand disease is an inherited bleeding disorder. In Shelties, affected dogs as a general rule are not viable and do not live long. The Sheltie carries type III of von Willebrands, which is the most severe of the three levels. There are DNA tests that were developed to find von Willebrands in Shelties. It can be done at any age, and it will give three results: affected, carrier or non-affected. Although small breed dogs do not usually suffer unduly from hip dysplasia, it has been identified in Shelties. Hip dysplasia occurs when the head of the femur and the acetabulum do not fit together correctly, frequently causing pain or lameness. Hip dysplasia is thought to be genetic. Many breeders will have their dogs' hips x-rayed and certified by the Orthopedic Foundation for Animals. =Eyes= The two basic forms of inherited eye diseases/defects in Shelties are Collie eye anomaly (CEA) and progressive retinal atrophy (PRA). Collie eye anomaly: An autosomal recessive inherited trait which results in incomplete closure of the embryonic fissure; seen almost exclusively in Collies, Border Collies and Shetland Sheepdogs.\\"Collie.\\" Saunders Comprehensive Veterinary Dictionary. Philadelphia: Elsevier Health Sciences, 2007. Credo Reference. Web. 17 September 2012. CEA can be detected in young puppies by a veterinary ophthalmologist. The disease involves the retina. It is always bilateral although the severity may be disparate (unequal) between eyes. Other accompanying defects (ophthalmic anomalies) may wrongly indicate a more severe manifestation of CEA. CEA is present at birth and although it cannot be cured, it doesn't progress. Signs of CEA in shelties are small, or deepset eyes. That is, the severity of the disease at birth will not change throughout the dog's life. CEA is scored similar to the way hips are. CEA is genetic, inheritance is autosomal recessive, this means that even a dog that shows no phenotypic signs of the condition may be a carrier. Breeders should actively try to breed this disease out by only breeding with dogs that have \\"clear\\" eyes or very low scoring eyes. A CEA score considered too high to breed with may still be low enough not to affect the dog's life. These dogs live happy and healthy lives as pets but should be not used for breeding. The recent development of a DNA test for CEA makes control of this disease much more likely as more breeders take advantage of the test. PRA can be detected at any time but usually does not show up until the dog is around two years old. Breeding dogs should be tested for genotype for this condition before breeding and only animals found \\"clear\\" should be used for breeding. PRA can occur in most breeds of dog including mix breeds. In most breeds it is also an autosomal recessive condition, however it has been found in other breeds to be autosomal dominant and sex-linked in others. As the name suggests, it is a progressive disease which will eventually result in total blindness. Like CEA, an affected dog should not be bred with but these dogs can live happily as pets. Currently there is no treatment for either disease, but as both diseases (CEA and PRA) are hereditary it is possible to eliminate them using selective breeding. This mostly white Sheltie has several conformational faults, such as pricked ears, too much white colouration (due to it being a double merle), microphthalmia, and pink spots in the nose. This dog would not be considered breeding stock. =Breeding= As with all dogs, Shelties should be screened for inheritable genetic diseases before breeding. Both male and female should be tested for thyroid problems, Von Willebrands disease and brucellosis, as well as have hip x-rays and eyes cleared by the relevant national authorities. Breeding colours are also a problem for many beginner breeders. Certain colour combinations can produce unwanted or potentially harmful results, such as mating blue merle to blue merle, which can produce what is called a \\"double merle\\", more likely to suffer from deafness or blindness. Mating a sable and white to a blue merle can produce a sable merle, which is undesirable for the show ring. A tri- colour to a pure-for-sable (a sable and white which can produce only other sable and whites), will produce only sable and whites, but they will be tri- factored sable and whites (which means they have the tri-gene.) There are many more examples of breeding for colour, so a good breeder will research colour genetics prior to breeding. There are many different genes contributing to the different colours of the Sheltie, including the bi gene, the merling gene, the sable gene, and the tricolour gene. =MDR1 gene mutation= According to the College of Veterinary Medicine at Washington State University, the Shetland Sheepdog, and many other herding breeds, have a risk of being born with a MDR1 Gene Mutation, with about 15 percent of individuals affected. Cross-breeds are also affected. Dogs carrying Mdr1-1 share a common ancestor that experienced remarkable evolutionary success, having contributed genetically to at least nine distinct breeds of dog. Due to this genetic mutation, affected dogs may exhibit sensitivity or adverse reactions to many drugs, including acepromazine, butorphanol, doxorubicin, erythromycin, ivermectin, loperamide, milbemycin, moxidectin, rifampin, selamectin, vinblastine, and vincristine. Working life As the name suggests, Shelties can and have been used as sheepdogs and still participate in sheepdog trials to this day. Herding dogs conduct livestock from one place to another by causing fear-flocking and flight behaviour.Serpell, James, ed. The Domestic Dog: its evolution, behaviour and interactions with people. New York: Cambridge University Press, 1995. Print. The instinct to herd is primarily a product of breeding. No amount of training can substitute this trait. Shelties can also be great therapy dogs for those who need comfort during hard times such as natural disasters or severe illness. This breed is rarely aggressive and tends to do well with children and being handled by them. =Activities= In their size group, the breed dominates dog agility, obedience, showmanship, flyball, tracking, and herding. Herding instincts and trainability can be measured at noncompetitive herding tests. Shelties exhibiting basic herding instincts can be trained to compete in herding trials.

It was also the first mass-produced bomber whose performance was superior to that of the Army's pursuit aircraft of the time.Eden and Moeng 2002, p. 931. The B-10 served as the airframe for the B-12, B-13, B-14, A-15 and O-45 designations using Pratt & Whitney engines instead of Wright Cyclones. A total of 348 of all versions were built. The largest users were the US, with 166, and the Netherlands, with 121. Design and development Martin B-10, 25th Bombardment Squadron, Panama Canal Zone Martin B-10 during exercises over Oahu, Hawaii, 1941 Martin B-10B airplane The B-10 began a revolution in bomber design. Its all-metal monoplane airframe, along with its features of closed cockpits, rotating gun turrets (almost simultaneously with the 1933 British Boulton & Paul Overstrand biplane bomber's own enclosed nose-turret), retractable landing gear, internal bomb bay, and full engine cowlings, would become the standard for bomber designs worldwide for decades. It made all existing bombers completely obsolete. Martin received the 1932 Collier Trophy for designing the XB-10.Collier Trophy Is Presented to Martin, 1 June 1933. The B-10 began as the Martin Model 123, a private venture by the Glenn L. Martin Company of Baltimore, Maryland. It had a crew of four: pilot, copilot, nose gunner and fuselage gunner. As in previous bombers, the four crew compartments were open, but it had a number of design innovations as well.\\"Flying Fish‚ÄìOur Army's Newest Plane Hits Terrific Speeds (photo of Model 123, US Army designation XB-907, in flight).\\" Popular Science, October 1932. Retrieved: 22 December 2010.\\"M-list.\\" Aerofiles. Retrieved: 22 December 2010. These innovations included a deep belly for an internal bomb bay and retractable main landing gear. Its 600 hp (447 kW) Wright SR-1820-E Cyclone engines provided sufficient power. The Model 123 first flew on 16 February 1932 and was delivered for testing to the U.S. Army on 20 March as the XB-907. After testing it was sent back to Martin for redesigning and was rebuilt as the XB-10. The XB-10 delivered to the Army had major differences from the original aircraft. Where the Model 123 had Townend rings, the XB-10 had full NACA cowlings to decrease drag. It also sported a pair of 675 hp (503 kW) Wright R-1820-19 engines, and an increase in the wingspan, along with an enclosed nose turret. When the XB-10 flew during trials in June, it recorded a speed of 197 mph (317 km/h) at 6,000 ft (1,830 m). This was an impressive performance for 1932. Following the success of the XB-10, a number of changes were made, including reduction to a three-man crew, addition of canopies for all crew positions, and an upgrade to 675 hp (503 kW) engines. The Army ordered 48 of these on 17 January 1933. The first 14 aircraft were designated YB-10 and delivered to Wright Field, starting in November 1933, and used in the Army Air Corps Mail Operation. The production model of the XB-10, the YB-10 was very similar to its prototype. Operational history Martin B-10B during exercises Martin B-12 at March Field, California, 1935 In 1935, the Army ordered an additional 103 aircraft designated B-10B. These had only minor changes from the YB-10. Shipments began in July 1935. B-10Bs served with the 2d Bomb Group at Langley Field, the 9th Bomb Group at Mitchel Field, the 19th Bomb Group at March Field, the 6th Composite Group in the Panama Canal Zone, and the 4th Composite Group in the Philippines. In addition to conventional duties in the bomber role, some modified YB-10s and B-12As were operated for a time on large twin floats for coastal patrol.Eden and Moeng 2002, p. 932.Swanborough and Bowers 1964, p. 331. In February 1936, the U.S. Army Air Corps used 13 49th Bomb Squadron B-10Bs to drop supplies to the residents of Virginia's Tangier Island and Maryland's Smith Island; with ships unable to reach the islands due to heavy ice in the Chesapeake Bay, the islanders faced starvation after a severe winter storm. The B-10B supply flights followed earlier supply flights to the islands by the Goodyear Blimp Enterprise on 2 February 1936 and by the squadron's Keystone B-6A bombers on 9 and 10 February 1936.Bentley, Stewart W., Jr., PhD., \\"The Touch of Greatness: Colonel William C.

With an advanced performance, the Martin company fully expected that export orders for the B-10 would flood in. The U.S. Army owned the rights to the Model 139 design. Once the Army's orders had been filled in 1936, Martin received permission to export Model 139s, and delivered versions to several air forces. For example, six Model 139Ws were sold to Siam in April 1937, powered by Wright R-1820-G3 Cyclone engines; 20 Model 139Ws were sold to Turkey in September 1937, powered by R-1820-G2 engines. On 19 May 1938, during the Sino-Japanese War, two Chinese Nationalist Air Force B-10s successfully flew to Japan. However, rather than dropping bombs, the aircraft dropped propaganda leaflets.Dunn, Richard L. \\"Illusive Target: Bombing Japan from China.\\" warbirdforum.com, 2006.

Arnold described it as the airpower wonder of its day. It was half again as fast as any biplane bomber, and faster than any contemporary fighter. The B-10 began a revolution in bomber design; it made all existing bombers completely obsolete. Rapid advances in bomber design in the late 1930s meant that the B-10 was eclipsed by the time the United States entered World War II. The Model 139s in combat in China and South East Asia suffered the same disadvantages as the other early war medium bombers, i.e. not enough armour and guns, while it could not outrun the latest fighters. An abortive effort to modernize the design, the Martin Model 146, was entered into a USAAC long-distance bomber design competition 1934‚Äì1935. The bomber came in a strong second place and was only bested by the Boeing B-17 design in range and endurance. It, however, had a higher ceiling of 28,500 ft and was only 2 mph slower and carried 313 lb less in bombs than the Boeing at over half the cost.

His translations of Shakespeare turned the English dramatist's works into German classics. Schlegel was also the professor of Sanskrit in Continental Europe and produced a translation of the Bhagavad Gita. Life Domenico Quaglio, 1832 Schlegel was born in Hanover, where his father, Johann Adolf Schlegel, was a Lutheran pastor. He was educated at the Hanover gymnasium and at the University of G√∂ttingen. Initially studying theology, he received a thorough philological training under Heyne and became an admirer and friend of B√ºrger, with whom he was engaged in an ardent study of Dante, Petrarch and Shakespeare. Schlegel met with Caroline B√∂hmer and Wilhelm von Humboldt. In 1790 his brother Friedrich came to G√∂ttingen. Both were influenced by Johann Gottfried Herder, Immanuel Kant, Tiberius Hemsterhuis, Johann Winckelmann and Karl Theodor von Dalberg. From 1791 to 1795, Schlegel was tutor to the children of Mogge Muilman, a Dutch banker, who lived at the prestigious Herengracht in Amsterdam.The Life of August Wilhelm Schlegel, Cosmopolitan of Art and Poetry by Roger Paulin, p. 59 In 1796, soon after his return to Germany, Schlegel settled in Jena, following an invitation from Schiller. That year he married Caroline, the widow of the physician B√∂hmer. She assisted Schlegel in some of his literary productions, and the publication of her correspondence in 1871 established for her a posthumous reputation as a German letter writer. She separated from Schlegel in 1801 and became the wife of the philosopher Schelling soon after. In Jena, Schlegel made critical contributions to Schiller's Horen and that author's Musen-Almanach, and wrote around 300 articles for the Jenaer Allgemeine Litteratur-Zeitung. He also did translations from Dante and Shakespeare. This work established his literary reputation and gained for him in 1798 an extraordinary professorship at the University of Jena. His house became the intellectual headquarters of the \\"romanticists\\", and was visited at various times between 1796 and 1801 by Fichte, whose Foundations of the Science of Knowledge was studied intensively, by his brother Friedrich, who moved in with his wife Dorothea, by Schelling, by Tieck, by Novalis and others. Schlegel c. 1800 In 1797 August and Friedrich broke with Friedrich Schiller. With his brother, Schlegel founded the Athenaeum (1798‚Äì1800), the organ of the Romantic school, in which he dissected disapprovingly the immensely popular works of the sentimental novelist August Lafontaine.Dirk Sangmeister, Der Lieblingsdichter der Nation..., article in German newspaper Die Zeit no. 31, 1999. He also published a volume of poems and carried on a controversy with Kotzebue. At this time the two brothers were remarkable for the vigour and freshness of their ideas and commanded respect as the leaders of the new Romantic criticism. A volume of their joint essays appeared in 1801 under the title Charakteristiken und Kritiken. His play Ion, performed in Weimar in January 1802, was supported by Goethe, but became a failure. In 1801 Schlegel went to Berlin, where he delivered lectures on art and literature; and in the following year he published Ion, a tragedy in Euripidean style, which gave rise to a suggestive discussion on the principles of dramatic poetry. This was followed by Spanisches Theater (2 vols, 1803/1809), in which he presented admirable translations of five of Calder√≥n's plays. In another volume, Blumenstr√§usse italienischer, spanischer und portugiesischer Poesie (1804), he gave translations of Spanish, Portuguese and Italian lyrics. He also translated works by Dante and Cam√µes. Early in 1804, he made the acquaintance of Madame de Sta√´l in Berlin, who hired him as a tutor for her children. After divorcing his wife Caroline, Schlegel travelled with Madame de Sta√´l to Switzerland, Italy and France, acting as an adviser in her literary work.She owed to him many of the ideas which she embodied in her work, De l'Allemagne, published in 1813. In 1807 he attracted much attention in France by an essay in the French, Comparaison entre la Ph√®dre de Racine et celle d'Euripide, in which he attacked French classicism from the standpoint of the Romantic school. His famous lectures on dramatic art and literature (√úber dramatische Kunst und Literatur, 1809‚Äì1811), which have been translated into most European languages, were delivered at Vienna in 1808. He was accompanied by De Sta√´l and her children. In 1810 Schlegel was ordered to leave the Swiss Confederation as an enemy of the French literature.L.M. Child (1836) The biography of Madame de Stael, p. 48 In 1812, he travelled with De Sta√´l, her fianc√© Albert de Rocca and her children to Moscow, St. Petersburg and Stockholm and acted as secretary of Jean Baptiste Jules Bernadotte, through whose influence the right of his family to noble rank was revived. After this, he joined again the household of Mme. de Sta√´l until her death in 1817, for like Mathieu de Montmorency he was one of her intimates until the end of her life. Schlegel was made a professor of literature at the University of Bonn in 1818, and during the remainder of his life occupied himself chiefly with oriental studies. He founded a special printing office for Sanskrit. As an orientalist, he was unable to adapt himself to the new methods opened up by Bopp. He corresponded with Wilhelm von Humboldt, a linguist. After the death of Madame de Sta√´l, Schlegel married (1818) a daughter of Heinrich Paulus, but this union was dissolved in 1821. Schlegel continued to lecture on art and literature, publishing in 1827 On the Theory and History of the Plastic Arts, and in 1828 two volumes of critical writings (Kritische Schriften). In 1823‚Äì30 he published the journal Indische Bibliothek. In 1823 edited the Bhagavad Gita, with a Latin translation, and in 1829, the Ramayana. This was followed by his 1832 work Reflections on the Study of the Asiatic Languages. Schlegel's translation of Shakespeare, begun in Jena, was ultimately completed, under the superintendence of Ludwig Tieck, by Tieck's daughter Dorothea and Wolf Heinrich Graf von Baudissin. This rendering is considered one of the best poetical translations in German, or indeed in any language. In 1826, Felix Mendelssohn, at the age of 17, was inspired by August Wilhelm's translation of Shakespeare's A Midsummer Night's Dream to write a homonymous concert overture. Schlegel's brother Friedrich's wife was an aunt of Mendelssohn.Portland Chamber Orchestra In 1835, Schlegel became head of the committee organising a monument in memory of Ludwig van Beethoven in Bonn, the composer's birthplace. Schlegel died in Bonn in 1845, three months before its official unveiling.

She was one of the so-called ', a group of five academically active women during the 18th and 19th centuries, daughters of academics at G√∂ttingen University, alongside Meta Forkel-Liebeskind, Therese Huber, Philippine Engelhard, and Dorothea Schl√∂zer. Biography Schelling was born at G√∂ttingen in 1763, the daughter of orientalist Johann David Michaelis who taught at the progressive University of G√∂ttingen. She was educated by private tutors and by her father. In 1784 she married a district medical officer, Johann B√∂hmer, and the couple moved to Clausthal in the Harz. After his death in 1788 she tried to live financially independently. Together with their only surviving daughter she moved to G√∂ttingen, then Marburg, and in 1792 she settled in Mainz. In Mainz, Schelling joined the intellectual circle around Georg Forster, who had married her childhood friend Therese Huber. Forster was an explorer, journalist, and revolutionary. When Mainz was occupied by the French during the French Revolutionary Wars, she moved into Forster's house. Mainz was declared a republic, aligned with France (see Republic of Mainz). But when Prussian troops recaptured Mainz (22 July 1793), Schelling was imprisoned for her political opinions. Schelling was pregnant and asked friends and family for help. She was released and August Schlegel arranged for her to give birth under an assumed name in Lucka near Leipzig. Schelling and August Schlegel married in 1796 and she moved to Jena, where he had received a professorship. Their house became a meeting place for the young literary and intellectual elite later associated with German Romanticism. His brother Friedrich Schlegel and Friedrich's wife Dorothea Veit moved in. They were at the centre of Jena Romanticism. Schelling was involved in the literary projects of her husband and his brother. She is credited with contributing to many of the 300 reviews her husband published in the Jena Allgemeine Literaturzeitung between 1796 and 1799. In 1803 she divorced Schlegel and married the young philosopher Friedrich Wilhelm Joseph Schelling. Her new husband was at the center of Romantic natural philosophy. The couple moved to W√ºrzburg, but were maligned by gossip. In 1806 the couple moved to Munich, where her husband received a professorship and was honoured for his work. Between 1805 and 1807 Schelling published several reviews in her own name and assisted her husband in his reviews, which shaped Romantic literature and literary taste. She also engaged in extensive correspondence with numerous Romantics. Having suffered poor health for some time, she died of dysentery in 1809. References References * This work in turn cites: **G.

His most noted ballad, Lenore, found an audience beyond readers of the German language in an English and Russian adaptation and a French translation. Biography He was born in Molmerswende (now a part of Mansfeld), Principality of Halberstadt, where his father was the Lutheran pastor. He showed an early predilection for solitary and gloomy places and the making of verses, for which he had no other model than hymnals. At the age of twelve, B√ºrger was practically adopted by his maternal grandfather, Bauer, at Aschersleben, who sent him to the P√§dagogium at Halle. He learned Latin with difficulty. In 1764 he passed to the University of Halle, as a student of theology, which, however, he soon abandoned for the study of jurisprudence. There he fell under the influence of Christian Adolph Klotz (1738‚Äì1771), who directed B√ºrger's attention to literature and encouraged his natural disposition to a wild and unregulated life. In consequence of his dissipated habits, he was in 1767 recalled by his grandfather, but on promising to reform was in 1768 allowed to enter the University of G√∂ttingen as a law student. As he continued his wild career, however, his grandfather withdrew his support and he was left to his own devices. Meanwhile, he had made fair progress with his legal studies, and had the good fortune to form a close friendship with a number of young men of literary tastes. He studied the ancient classics and the best works in French, Italian, Spanish and English, particularly Shakespeare, and the old English and Scottish ballads. Thomas Percy's Reliques of Ancient English Poetry was his constant companion. In the G√∂ttingen Musenalmanach, edited by Heinrich Christian Boie and Friedrich Wilhelm Gotter, B√ºrger's first poems were published, and by 1771 he had already become widely known as a poet. In 1772, through Boie's influence, B√ºrger obtained the post of Amtmann or district magistrate at Altengleichen near G√∂ttingen. His grandfather was now reconciled to him, paid his debts and established him in his new sphere of activity. Auguste Leonhart, sister of B√ºrger's wife, and the ‚ÄúMolly‚Äù of his poetry. Dorette B√ºrger, after a pastel drawing by her sister Auguste in 1781. Meanwhile, he kept in touch with his G√∂ttingen friends, and when the G√∂ttinger Bund or \\"Hain\\" (\\"G√∂ttinger Hainbund\\") was formed, B√ºrger, though not himself a member, kept in close touch with it. In 1773, the ballad LenoreLenore, by G√∂ttfried August B√ºrger, (Translated by Dante Gabriel Rossetti) was published in the Musenalmanach. This poem, which in dramatic force and in its vivid realization of the weird and supernatural remains without a rival, made his name a household word in G√∂ttingen. Lenore was paraphrased by Walter Scott under the title William and Helen and Goethe did the same under the title Bride of Corinth.German Classics, by William Cleaver Wilkinson Published 1900 by Funk & Wagnalls Company in New York, London, p. 151ffWilliam and Helen by Sir Walter ScottThe Vampire Female: \\"The Bride of Corinth\\" (1797) by: Johann Wolfgang von Goethe In 1774 he married Dorette Leonhart, the daughter of a Hanoverian official; but his passion for his wife's younger sister Auguste (the \\"Molly\\" of his poems and elegies) rendered the union unhappy and unsettled his life. In 1778 B√ºrger became editor of the Musenalmanach, a position he retained until his death. In the same year published the first collection of his poems. In 1780 he took a farm at Appenrode, but in three years lost so much money that he had to abandon the venture. Pecuniary troubles oppressed him, and being accused of neglecting his official duties, and feeling his honour attacked, he gave up his official position and removed in 1784 to G√∂ttingen, where he established himself as Privatdozent. Lenardo und Blandine, after B√ºrger's poem, by Wilhelm Volkhart Shortly before his removal there his wife died (July 30, 1784), and on June 29 in the next year he married his sister-in-law \\"Molly.\\" Her death in childbirth on January 9, 1786 affected him deeply. He appeared to lose at once all courage and all bodily and mental vigour. He still continued to teach in G√∂ttingen; at the jubilee of the foundation of the university in 1787 he was made an honorary doctor of philosophy, and in 1789 was appointed extraordinary professor in that faculty, though without a stipend. He was obliged to gain his living by poorly rewarded translations for booksellers. In 1790, he married a third time, his wife being a certain Elise Hahn, who, enchanted with his poems, had offered him her heart and hand. Only a few weeks of married life with his \\"Schwabenm√§dchen\\" sufficed to prove his mistake, and after two and a half years he divorced her. Deeply wounded by Schiller's criticism, in the 14th and 15th part of the Allgemeine Literaturzeitung of 1791, of the second edition of his poems, disappointed, wrecked in fortune and health, B√ºrger eked out a precarious existence as a teacher in G√∂ttingen until, ill with tuberculosis, he died there on June 8, 1794. The government of Hanover afforded him some assistance shortly before his death. B√ºrger's talent for popular poetry was very considerable, and his ballads are among the finest in the German language. Besides Lenore, Das Lied vom braven Manne, Die Kuh, Der Kaiser und der Abt and Der wilde J√§ger are famous. Among his purely lyrical poems, but few have earned a lasting reputation; but mention may be made of Das Bl√ºmchen Wunderhold, Lied an den lieben Mond, and a few love songs. His sonnets, particularly the elegies, are of great beauty. B√ºrger revived the sonnet form in German, and his experiments in it were praised as models by Schiller, despite his severe criticism of some of B√ºrger's more popular poems. Editions Editions of B√ºrger's S√§mtliche Schriften appeared at G√∂ttingen, 1817 (incomplete); 1829‚Äî1833 (8 vols.), and 1835 (one vol.); also a selection by Eduard Grisebach (5th ed, 1894). The Gedichte have been published in innumerable editions, the best being that by August Sauer (2 vols., 1884). Briefe von und an B√ºrger were edited by Adolf Strodtmann in 4 vols. (1874). B√ºrger was introduced to English readers in William and Helen (1775), Walter Scott's version of Lenore. The elder Dumas translated Lenore into French. B√ºrger is known for German translations of Baron Munchausen‚Äôs narrative of his marvellous travels and campaigns in Russia by Rudolf Erich Raspe (1786, after the release of the 4th English edition; 2nd expanded ed. 1788, after the release of the 5th expanded English edition). In his introduction to the 1788 German edition, B√ºrger admitted to adapting and elaborating the original English-language works, and, despite his clear notice that he was doing a translation, for some time B√ºrger was believed to be the author of the tales. Raspe had originally concealed his authorship.

Flight experience  McCool completed flight training and was designated a Naval Aviator in August 1986. He was assigned to Tactical Electronic Warfare Squadron 129 (VAQ-129) at NAS Whidbey Island, Washington, for initial EA-6B Prowler training. His first operational tour was with Tactical Electronic Warfare Squadron 133 (VAQ-133), where he made two deployments aboard the aircraft carrier to the Mediterranean Sea, and received designation as a wing-qualified Landing Signal Officer (LSO). In November 1989, he was selected for the U.S. Naval Postgraduate School/Test Pilot School (TPS) Cooperative Education Program. After graduating from TPS in June 1992, he worked as a TA-4J and EA-6B test pilot in Flight Systems Department of Strike Aircraft Test Directorate at NAS Patuxent River, Maryland. He was responsible for the management and conduct of a wide variety of projects, ranging from airframe fatigue life studies to numerous avionics upgrades. His primary efforts, however, were dedicated to flight test of the Advanced Capability (ADVCAP) EA-6B. Following his Patuxent River tour, McCool returned to Whidbey Island, and was assigned to Tactical Electronic Warfare Squadron 132 (VAQ-132) aboard the carrier . He served as Administrative and Operations Officer with the squadron through their work-up cycle, receiving notice of his NASA selection while embarked on Enterprise for her final pre-deployment at sea period. McCool accumulated over 2,800 hours flight experience in 24 aircraft and over 400 carrier arrestments.  NASA experience  Selected by NASA in April 1996, McCool reported to the Johnson Space Center in August 1996. He completed two years of training and evaluation, and was qualified for flight assignment as a pilot. Initially assigned to the Computer Support Branch, McCool also served as technical assistant to the director of flight crew operations, and worked Shuttle cockpit upgrade issues for the Astronaut Office. = Spaceflight experience = McCool was pilot of Space Shuttle mission STS-107, January 16 to February 1, 2003, logging 15 days, 22 hours and 20 minutes in space.

The layers of the atmosphere are drawn to scale, whereas objects within them, such as the International Space Station, are not. Outer space, or simply space, is the expanse that exists beyond Earth and between celestial bodies. Outer space is not completely empty‚Äîit is a hard vacuum containing a low density of particles, predominantly a plasma of hydrogen and helium, as well as electromagnetic radiation, magnetic fields, neutrinos, dust, and cosmic rays. The baseline temperature of outer space, as set by the background radiation from the Big Bang, is . The plasma between galaxies accounts for about half of the baryonic (ordinary) matter in the universe; it has a number density of less than one hydrogen atom per cubic metre and a temperature of millions of kelvins. Local concentrations of matter have condensed into stars and galaxies. Studies indicate that 90% of the mass in most galaxies is in an unknown form, called dark matter, which interacts with other matter through gravitational but not electromagnetic forces. Observations suggest that the majority of the mass-energy in the observable universe is dark energy, a type of vacuum energy that is poorly understood. Intergalactic space takes up most of the volume of the universe, but even galaxies and star systems consist almost entirely of empty space. Outer space does not begin at a definite altitude above the Earth's surface. The K√°rm√°n line, an altitude of above sea level, is conventionally used as the start of outer space in space treaties and for aerospace records keeping. The framework for international space law was established by the Outer Space Treaty, which entered into force on 10 October 1967. This treaty precludes any claims of national sovereignty and permits all states to freely explore outer space. Despite the drafting of UN resolutions for the peaceful uses of outer space, anti-satellite weapons have been tested in Earth orbit. Humans began the physical exploration of space during the 20th century with the advent of high- altitude balloon flights. This was followed by crewed rocket flights and, then, crewed Earth orbit, first achieved by Yuri Gagarin of the Soviet Union in 1961. Due to the high cost of getting into space, human spaceflight has been limited to low Earth orbit and the Moon. On the other hand, uncrewed spacecraft have reached all of the known planets in the Solar System. Outer space represents a challenging environment for human exploration because of the hazards of vacuum and radiation. Microgravity also has a negative effect on human physiology that causes both muscle atrophy and bone loss. In addition to these health and environmental issues, the economic cost of putting objects, including humans, into space is very high.  Formation and state  This is an artist's concept of the metric expansion of space, where a volume of the Universe is represented at each time interval by the circular sections. At left is depicted the rapid inflation from the initial state, followed thereafter by steadier expansion to the present day, shown at right. According to the Big Bang theory, the very early Universe was an extremely hot and dense state about 13.8 billion years ago which rapidly expanded. About 380,000 years later the Universe had cooled sufficiently to allow protons and electrons to combine and form hydrogen‚Äîthe so-called recombination epoch. When this happened, matter and energy became decoupled, allowing photons to travel freely through the continually expanding space. Matter that remained following the initial expansion has since undergone gravitational collapse to create stars, galaxies and other astronomical objects, leaving behind a deep vacuum that forms what is now called outer space. As light has a finite velocity, this theory also constrains the size of the directly observable universe. This leaves open the question as to whether the Universe is finite or infinite. The present day shape of the universe has been determined from measurements of the cosmic microwave background using satellites like the Wilkinson Microwave Anisotropy Probe. These observations indicate that the spatial geometry of the observable universe is \\"flat\\", meaning that photons on parallel paths at one point remain parallel as they travel through space to the limit of the observable universe, except for local gravity. The flat Universe, combined with the measured mass density of the Universe and the accelerating expansion of the Universe, indicates that space has a non-zero vacuum energy, which is called dark energy. Estimates put the average energy density of the present day Universe at the equivalent of 5.9 protons per cubic meter, including dark energy, dark matter, and baryonic matter (ordinary matter composed of atoms). The atoms account for only 4.6% of the total energy density, or a density of one proton per four cubic meters. The density of the Universe is clearly not uniform; it ranges from relatively high density in galaxies‚Äîincluding very high density in structures within galaxies, such as planets, stars, and black holes‚Äîto conditions in vast voids that have much lower density, at least in terms of visible matter. Unlike matter and dark matter, dark energy seems not to be concentrated in galaxies: although dark energy may account for a majority of the mass-energy in the Universe, dark energy's influence is 5 orders of magnitude smaller than the influence of gravity from matter and dark matter within the Milky Way.  Environment  Part of the alt=A black background with luminous shapes of various sizes scattered randomly about. They typically have white, red or blue hues. Outer space is the closest known approximation to a perfect vacuum. It has effectively no friction, allowing stars, planets, and moons to move freely along their ideal orbits, following the initial formation stage. The deep vacuum of intergalactic space is not devoid of matter, as it contains a few hydrogen atoms per cubic meter. By comparison, the air humans breathe contains about 1025 molecules per cubic meter. The low density of matter in outer space means that electromagnetic radiation can travel great distances without being scattered: the mean free path of a photon in intergalactic space is about 1023 km, or 10 billion light years. In spite of this, extinction, which is the absorption and scattering of photons by dust and gas, is an important factor in galactic and intergalactic astronomy. Stars, planets, and moons retain their atmospheres by gravitational attraction. Atmospheres have no clearly delineated upper boundary: the density of atmospheric gas gradually decreases with distance from the object until it becomes indistinguishable from outer space. The Earth's atmospheric pressure drops to about Pa at of altitude, compared to 100,000 Pa for the International Union of Pure and Applied Chemistry (IUPAC) definition of standard pressure. Above this altitude, isotropic gas pressure rapidly becomes insignificant when compared to radiation pressure from the Sun and the dynamic pressure of the solar wind. The thermosphere in this range has large gradients of pressure, temperature and composition, and varies greatly due to space weather. The temperature of outer space is measured in terms of the kinetic activity of the gas, as it is on Earth. The radiation of outer space has a different temperature than the kinetic temperature of the gas, meaning that the gas and radiation are not in thermodynamic equilibrium. All of the observable universe is filled with photons that were created during the Big Bang, which is known as the cosmic microwave background radiation (CMB). (There is quite likely a correspondingly large number of neutrinos called the cosmic neutrino background.) The current black body temperature of the background radiation is about . The gas temperatures in outer space can vary widely. For example, the temperature in the Boomerang Nebula is 1 K, while the solar corona reaches temperatures over 1.2‚Äì2.6 million K. Magnetic fields have been detected in the space around just about every class of celestial object. Star formation in spiral galaxies can generate small-scale dynamos, creating turbulent magnetic field strengths of around 5‚Äì10 ŒºG. The Davis‚ÄìGreenstein effect causes elongated dust grains to align themselves with a galaxy's magnetic field, resulting in weak optical polarization. This has been used to show ordered magnetic fields exist in several nearby galaxies. Magneto-hydrodynamic processes in active elliptical galaxies produce their characteristic jets and radio lobes. Non-thermal radio sources have been detected even among the most distant, high-z sources, indicating the presence of magnetic fields. Outside a protective atmosphere and magnetic field, there are few obstacles to the passage through space of energetic subatomic particles known as cosmic rays. These particles have energies ranging from about 106 eV up to an extreme 1020 eV of ultra-high-energy cosmic rays. The peak flux of cosmic rays occurs at energies of about 109 eV, with approximately 87% protons, 12% helium nuclei and 1% heavier nuclei. In the high energy range, the flux of electrons is only about 1% of that of protons. Cosmic rays can damage electronic components and pose a health threat to space travelers. According to astronauts, like Don Pettit, space has a burned/metallic odor that clings to their suits and equipment, similar to the scent of an arc welding torch.  Effect on biology and human bodies  Because of the hazards of a vacuum, astronauts must wear a pressurized alt=The lower half shows a blue planet with patchy white clouds. The upper half has a man in a white spacesuit and maneuvering unit against a black background. Despite the harsh environment, several life forms have been found that can withstand extreme space conditions for extended periods. Species of lichen carried on the ESA BIOPAN facility survived exposure for ten days in 2007. Seeds of Arabidopsis thaliana and Nicotiana tabacum germinated after being exposed to space for 1.5 years. A strain of bacillus subtilis has survived 559 days when exposed to low-Earth orbit or a simulated martian environment. The lithopanspermia hypothesis suggests that rocks ejected into outer space from life-harboring planets may successfully transport life forms to another habitable world. A conjecture is that just such a scenario occurred early in the history of the Solar System, with potentially microorganism- bearing rocks being exchanged between Venus, Earth, and Mars. Even at relatively low altitudes in the Earth's atmosphere, conditions are hostile to the human body. The altitude where atmospheric pressure matches the vapor pressure of water at the temperature of the human body is called the Armstrong line, named after American physician Harry G. Armstrong. It is located at an altitude of around . At or above the Armstrong line, fluids in the throat and lungs boil away. More specifically, exposed bodily liquids such as saliva, tears, and liquids in the lungs boil away. Hence, at this altitude, human survival requires a pressure suit, or a pressurized capsule. Out in space, sudden exposure of an unprotected human to very low pressure, such as during a rapid decompression, can cause pulmonary barotrauma‚Äîa rupture of the lungs, due to the large pressure differential between inside and outside the chest. Even if the subject's airway is fully open, the flow of air through the windpipe may be too slow to prevent the rupture. Rapid decompression can rupture eardrums and sinuses, bruising and blood seep can occur in soft tissues, and shock can cause an increase in oxygen consumption that leads to hypoxia. As a consequence of rapid decompression, oxygen dissolved in the blood empties into the lungs to try to equalize the partial pressure gradient. Once the deoxygenated blood arrives at the brain, humans lose consciousness after a few seconds and die of hypoxia within minutes. Blood and other body fluids boil when the pressure drops below 6.3 kPa, and this condition is called ebullism. The steam may bloat the body to twice its normal size and slow circulation, but tissues are elastic and porous enough to prevent rupture. Ebullism is slowed by the pressure containment of blood vessels, so some blood remains liquid. Swelling and ebullism can be reduced by containment in a pressure suit. The Crew Altitude Protection Suit (CAPS), a fitted elastic garment designed in the 1960s for astronauts, prevents ebullism at pressures as low as 2 kPa. Supplemental oxygen is needed at to provide enough oxygen for breathing and to prevent water loss, while above pressure suits are essential to prevent ebullism. Most space suits use around 30‚Äì39 kPa of pure oxygen, about the same as on the Earth's surface. This pressure is high enough to prevent ebullism, but evaporation of nitrogen dissolved in the blood could still cause decompression sickness and gas embolisms if not managed. Humans evolved for life in Earth gravity, and exposure to weightlessness has been shown to have deleterious effects on human health. Initially, more than 50% of astronauts experience space motion sickness. This can cause nausea and vomiting, vertigo, headaches, lethargy, and overall malaise. The duration of space sickness varies, but it typically lasts for 1‚Äì3 days, after which the body adjusts to the new environment. Longer-term exposure to weightlessness results in muscle atrophy and deterioration of the skeleton, or spaceflight osteopenia. These effects can be minimized through a regimen of exercise. Other effects include fluid redistribution, slowing of the cardiovascular system, decreased production of red blood cells, balance disorders, and a weakening of the immune system. Lesser symptoms include loss of body mass, nasal congestion, sleep disturbance, and puffiness of the face. During long- duration space travel, radiation can pose an acute health hazard. Exposure to high-energy, ionizing cosmic rays can result in fatigue, nausea, vomiting, as well as damage to the immune system and changes to the white blood cell count. Over longer durations, symptoms include an increased risk of cancer, plus damage to the eyes, nervous system, lungs and the gastrointestinal tract. On a round-trip Mars mission lasting three years, a large fraction of the cells in an astronaut's body would be traversed and potentially damaged by high energy nuclei. The energy of such particles is significantly diminished by the shielding provided by the walls of a spacecraft and can be further diminished by water containers and other barriers.The impact of the cosmic rays upon the shielding produces additional radiation that can affect the crew. Further research is needed to assess the radiation hazards and determine suitable countermeasures.  Regions  Space is a partial vacuum: its different regions are defined by the various atmospheres and \\"winds\\" that dominate within them, and extend to the point at which those winds give way to those beyond. Geospace extends from Earth's atmosphere to the outer reaches of Earth's magnetic field, whereupon it gives way to the solar wind of interplanetary space. Interplanetary space extends to the heliopause, whereupon the solar wind gives way to the winds of the interstellar medium. Interstellar space then continues to the edges of the galaxy, where it fades into the intergalactic void. = Geospace = Aurora australis observed from the Space Shuttle Discovery, on STS-39, May 1991 (orbital altitude: 260 km)alt=The lower half is the blue-white planet in low illumination. Nebulous red streamers climb upward from the limb of the disk toward the black sky. The Space Shuttle is visible along the left edge. Geospace is the region of outer space near Earth, including the upper atmosphere and magnetosphere. The Van Allen radiation belts lie within the geospace. The outer boundary of geospace is the magnetopause, which forms an interface between the Earth's magnetosphere and the solar wind. The inner boundary is the ionosphere. The variable space-weather conditions of geospace are affected by the behavior of the Sun and the solar wind; the subject of geospace is interlinked with heliophysics‚Äîthe study of the Sun and its impact on the planets of the Solar System. The day-side magnetopause is compressed by solar-wind pressure‚Äîthe subsolar distance from the center of the Earth is typically 10 Earth radii. On the night side, the solar wind stretches the magnetosphere to form a magnetotail that sometimes extends out to more than 100‚Äì200 Earth radii. For roughly four days of each month, the lunar surface is shielded from the solar wind as the Moon passes through the magnetotail. Geospace is populated by electrically charged particles at very low densities, the motions of which are controlled by the Earth's magnetic field. These plasmas form a medium from which storm-like disturbances powered by the solar wind can drive electrical currents into the Earth's upper atmosphere. Geomagnetic storms can disturb two regions of geospace, the radiation belts and the ionosphere. These storms increase fluxes of energetic electrons that can permanently damage satellite electronics, interfering with shortwave radio communication and GPS location and timing. Magnetic storms can also be a hazard to astronauts, even in low Earth orbit. They also create aurorae seen at high latitudes in an oval surrounding the geomagnetic poles. Although it meets the definition of outer space, the atmospheric density within the first few hundred kilometers above the K√°rm√°n line is still sufficient to produce significant drag on satellites. This region contains material left over from previous crewed and uncrewed launches that are a potential hazard to spacecraft. Some of this debris re- enters Earth's atmosphere periodically. Cislunar space Lunar Gateway, one of the proposed space stations for crewed cislunar travel in the 2020s Earth's gravity keeps the Moon in orbit at an average distance of . The region outside Earth's atmosphere and extending out to just beyond the Moon's orbit, including the Lagrange points, is sometimes referred to as cislunar space. The region of space where Earth's gravity remains dominant against gravitational perturbations from the Sun is called the Hill sphere. This extends well out into translunar space to a distance of roughly 1% of the mean distance from Earth to the Sun, or . Deep space has different definitions as to where it starts. It has been defined by the United States government and others as any region beyond cislunar space. The International Telecommunication Union responsible for radio communication (including satellites) defines the beginning of deep space at about 5 times that distance (). = Interplanetary space = The sparse plasma (blue) and dust (white) in the tail of alt=At lower left, a white coma stands out against a black background. Nebulous material streams away to the top and left, slowly fading with distance. Interplanetary space is defined by the solar wind, a continuous stream of charged particles emanating from the Sun that creates a very tenuous atmosphere (the heliosphere) for billions of kilometers into space. This wind has a particle density of 5‚Äì10 protons/cm3 and is moving at a velocity of . Interplanetary space extends out to the heliopause where the influence of the galactic environment starts to dominate over the magnetic field and particle flux from the Sun. The distance and strength of the heliopause varies depending on the activity level of the solar wind. The heliopause in turn deflects away low-energy galactic cosmic rays, with this modulation effect peaking during solar maximum. The volume of interplanetary space is a nearly total vacuum, with a mean free path of about one astronomical unit at the orbital distance of the Earth. This space is not completely empty, and is sparsely filled with cosmic rays, which include ionized atomic nuclei and various subatomic particles. There is also gas, plasma and dust, small meteors, and several dozen types of organic molecules discovered to date by microwave spectroscopy. A cloud of interplanetary dust is visible at night as a faint band called the zodiacal light. Interplanetary space contains the magnetic field generated by the Sun. There are also magnetospheres generated by planets such as Jupiter, Saturn, Mercury and the Earth that have their own magnetic fields. These are shaped by the influence of the solar wind into the approximation of a teardrop shape, with the long tail extending outward behind the planet. These magnetic fields can trap particles from the solar wind and other sources, creating belts of charged particles such as the Van Allen radiation belts. Planets without magnetic fields, such as Mars, have their atmospheres gradually eroded by the solar wind. = Interstellar space = alt=Patchy orange and blue nebulosity against a black background, with a curved orange arc wrapping around a star at the center. Interstellar space is the physical space within a galaxy beyond the influence each star has upon the encompassed plasma. The contents of interstellar space are called the interstellar medium. Approximately 70% of the mass of the interstellar medium consists of lone hydrogen atoms; most of the remainder consists of helium atoms. This is enriched with trace amounts of heavier atoms formed through stellar nucleosynthesis. These atoms are ejected into the interstellar medium by stellar winds or when evolved stars begin to shed their outer envelopes such as during the formation of a planetary nebula. The cataclysmic explosion of a supernova generates an expanding shock wave consisting of ejected materials that further enrich the medium. The density of matter in the interstellar medium can vary considerably: the average is around 106 particles per m3, but cold molecular clouds can hold 108‚Äì1012 per m3. A number of molecules exist in interstellar space, as can tiny 0.1 Œºm dust particles. The tally of molecules discovered through radio astronomy is steadily increasing at the rate of about four new species per year. Large regions of higher density matter known as molecular clouds allow chemical reactions to occur, including the formation of organic polyatomic species. Much of this chemistry is driven by collisions. Energetic cosmic rays penetrate the cold, dense clouds and ionize hydrogen and helium, resulting, for example, in the trihydrogen cation. An ionized helium atom can then split relatively abundant carbon monoxide to produce ionized carbon, which in turn can lead to organic chemical reactions. The local interstellar medium is a region of space within 100 parsecs (pc) of the Sun, which is of interest both for its proximity and for its interaction with the Solar System. This volume nearly coincides with a region of space known as the Local Bubble, which is characterized by a lack of dense, cold clouds. It forms a cavity in the Orion Arm of the Milky Way galaxy, with dense molecular clouds lying along the borders, such as those in the constellations of Ophiuchus and Taurus. (The actual distance to the border of this cavity varies from 60 to 250 pc or more.) This volume contains about 104‚Äì105 stars and the local interstellar gas counterbalances the astrospheres that surround these stars, with the volume of each sphere varying depending on the local density of the interstellar medium. The Local Bubble contains dozens of warm interstellar clouds with temperatures of up to 7,000 K and radii of 0.5‚Äì5 pc. When stars are moving at sufficiently high peculiar velocities, their astrospheres can generate bow shocks as they collide with the interstellar medium. For decades it was assumed that the Sun had a bow shock. In 2012, data from Interstellar Boundary Explorer (IBEX) and NASA's Voyager probes showed that the Sun's bow shock does not exist. Instead, these authors argue that a subsonic bow wave defines the transition from the solar wind flow to the interstellar medium. A bow shock is the third boundary of an astrosphere after the termination shock and the astropause (called the heliopause in the Solar System). = Intergalactic space = A star-forming region in the Large Magellanic Cloud, perhaps the closest Galaxy to Earth's Milky Way Intergalactic space is the physical space between galaxies. Studies of the large scale distribution of galaxies show that the Universe has a foam-like structure, with groups and clusters of galaxies lying along filaments that occupy about a tenth of the total space. The remainder forms huge voids that are mostly empty of galaxies. Typically, a void spans a distance of (10‚Äì40) h‚àí1 Mpc, where h is the Hubble constant in units of . Surrounding and stretching between galaxies, there is a rarefied plasma that is organized in a galactic filamentary structure. This material is called the intergalactic medium (IGM). The density of the IGM is 5‚Äì200 times the average density of the Universe. It consists mostly of ionized hydrogen; i.e. a plasma consisting of equal numbers of electrons and protons. As gas falls into the intergalactic medium from the voids, it heats up to temperatures of 105 K to 107 K, which is high enough so that collisions between atoms have enough energy to cause the bound electrons to escape from the hydrogen nuclei; this is why the IGM is ionized. At these temperatures, it is called the warm‚Äìhot intergalactic medium (WHIM). (Although the plasma is very hot by terrestrial standards, 105 K is often called \\"warm\\" in astrophysics.) Computer simulations and observations indicate that up to half of the atomic matter in the Universe might exist in this warm‚Äìhot, rarefied state. When gas falls from the filamentary structures of the WHIM into the galaxy clusters at the intersections of the cosmic filaments, it can heat up even more, reaching temperatures of 108 K and above in the so-called intracluster medium (ICM).  Earth orbit  A spacecraft enters orbit when its centripetal acceleration due to gravity is less than or equal to the centrifugal acceleration due to the horizontal component of its velocity. For a low Earth orbit, this velocity is about ; by contrast, the fastest piloted airplane speed ever achieved (excluding speeds achieved by deorbiting spacecraft) was in 1967 by the North American X-15. To achieve an orbit, a spacecraft must travel faster than a sub-orbital spaceflight. The energy required to reach Earth orbital velocity at an altitude of is about 36 MJ/kg, which is six times the energy needed merely to climb to the corresponding altitude. Spacecraft with a perigee below about are subject to drag from the Earth's atmosphere, which decreases the orbital altitude. The rate of orbital decay depends on the satellite's cross- sectional area and mass, as well as variations in the air density of the upper atmosphere. Below about , decay becomes more rapid with lifetimes measured in days. Once a satellite descends to , it has only hours before it vaporizes in the atmosphere. The escape velocity required to pull free of Earth's gravitational field altogether and move into interplanetary space is about .  Boundary  alt=A white rocketship with oddly-shaped wings at rest on a runway. There is no clear boundary between Earth's atmosphere and space, as the density of the atmosphere gradually decreases as the altitude increases. There are several standard boundary designations, namely: * The F√©d√©ration A√©ronautique Internationale has established the K√°rm√°n line at an altitude of as a working definition for the boundary between aeronautics and astronautics. This is used because at an altitude of about , as Theodore von K√°rm√°n calculated, a vehicle would have to travel faster than orbital velocity to derive sufficient aerodynamic lift from the atmosphere to support itself. * The United States designates people who travel above an altitude of as astronauts. * NASA's Space Shuttle used 400,000 feet (, ) as its re-entry altitude (termed the Entry Interface), which roughly marks the boundary where atmospheric drag becomes noticeable, thus beginning the process of switching from steering with thrusters to maneuvering with aerodynamic control surfaces. In 2009, scientists reported detailed measurements with a Supra-Thermal Ion Imager (an instrument that measures the direction and speed of ions), which allowed them to establish a boundary at above Earth. The boundary represents the midpoint of a gradual transition over tens of kilometers from the relatively gentle winds of the Earth's atmosphere to the more violent flows of charged particles in space, which can reach speeds well over .

Underneath, a column of smoke is partly concealing a navy ship. The Outer Space Treaty provides the basic framework for international space law. It covers the legal use of outer space by nation states, and includes in its definition of outer space the Moon and other celestial bodies. The treaty states that outer space is free for all nation states to explore and is not subject to claims of national sovereignty. It also prohibits the deployment of nuclear weapons in outer space. The treaty was passed by the United Nations General Assembly in 1963 and signed in 1967 by the USSR, the United States of America and the United Kingdom. As of 2017, 105 state parties have either ratified or acceded to the treaty. An additional 25 states signed the treaty, without ratifying it. Since 1958, outer space has been the subject of multiple United Nations resolutions. Of these, more than 50 have been concerning the international co-operation in the peaceful uses of outer space and preventing an arms race in space. Four additional space law treaties have been negotiated and drafted by the UN's Committee on the Peaceful Uses of Outer Space. Still, there remains no legal prohibition against deploying conventional weapons in space, and anti-satellite weapons have been successfully tested by the US, USSR, China, and in 2019, India. The 1979 Moon Treaty turned the jurisdiction of all heavenly bodies (including the orbits around such bodies) over to the international community. The treaty has not been ratified by any nation that currently practices human spaceflight. In 1976, eight equatorial states (Ecuador, Colombia, Brazil, Congo, Zaire, Uganda, Kenya, and Indonesia) met in Bogot√°, Colombia. With their \\"Declaration of the First Meeting of Equatorial Countries\\", or \\"the Bogot√° Declaration\\", they claimed control of the segment of the geosynchronous orbital path corresponding to each country. These claims are not internationally accepted.  Discovery, exploration and applications  = Discovery = In 350 BCE, Greek philosopher Aristotle suggested that nature abhors a vacuum, a principle that became known as the horror vacui. This concept built upon a 5th-century BCE ontological argument by the Greek philosopher Parmenides, who denied the possible existence of a void in space. Based on this idea that a vacuum could not exist, in the West it was widely held for many centuries that space could not be empty. As late as the 17th century, the French philosopher Ren√© Descartes argued that the entirety of space must be filled. In ancient China, the 2nd-century astronomer Zhang Heng became convinced that space must be infinite, extending well beyond the mechanism that supported the Sun and the stars. The surviving books of the Hs√ºan Yeh school said that the heavens were boundless, \\"empty and void of substance\\". Likewise, the \\"sun, moon, and the company of stars float in the empty space, moving or standing still\\". The Italian scientist Galileo Galilei knew that air had mass and so was subject to gravity. In 1640, he demonstrated that an established force resisted the formation of a vacuum. It would remain for his pupil Evangelista Torricelli to create an apparatus that would produce a partial vacuum in 1643. This experiment resulted in the first mercury barometer and created a scientific sensation in Europe. The French mathematician Blaise Pascal reasoned that if the column of mercury was supported by air, then the column ought to be shorter at higher altitude where the air pressure is lower. In 1648, his brother-in-law, Florin P√©rier, repeated the experiment on the Puy de D√¥me mountain in central France and found that the column was shorter by three inches. This decrease in pressure was further demonstrated by carrying a half-full balloon up a mountain and watching it gradually expand, then contract upon descent. The original alt=A glass display case holds a mechanical device with a lever arm, plus two metal hemispheres attached to draw ropes In 1650, German scientist Otto von Guericke constructed the first vacuum pump: a device that would further refute the principle of horror vacui. He correctly noted that the atmosphere of the Earth surrounds the planet like a shell, with the density gradually declining with altitude. He concluded that there must be a vacuum between the Earth and the Moon. Back in the 15th century, German theologian Nicolaus Cusanus speculated that the Universe lacked a center and a circumference. He believed that the Universe, while not infinite, could not be held as finite as it lacked any bounds within which it could be contained. These ideas led to speculations as to the infinite dimension of space by the Italian philosopher Giordano Bruno in the 16th century. He extended the Copernican heliocentric cosmology to the concept of an infinite Universe filled with a substance he called aether, which did not resist the motion of heavenly bodies. English philosopher William Gilbert arrived at a similar conclusion, arguing that the stars are visible to us only because they are surrounded by a thin aether or a void. This concept of an aether originated with ancient Greek philosophers, including Aristotle, who conceived of it as the medium through which the heavenly bodies move. The concept of a Universe filled with a luminiferous aether retained support among some scientists until the early 20th century. This form of aether was viewed as the medium through which light could propagate. In 1887, the Michelson‚ÄìMorley experiment tried to detect the Earth's motion through this medium by looking for changes in the speed of light depending on the direction of the planet's motion. The null result indicated something was wrong with the concept. The idea of the luminiferous aether was then abandoned. It was replaced by Albert Einstein's theory of special relativity, which holds that the speed of light in a vacuum is a fixed constant, independent of the observer's motion or frame of reference. The first professional astronomer to support the concept of an infinite Universe was the Englishman Thomas Digges in 1576. But the scale of the Universe remained unknown until the first successful measurement of the distance to a nearby star in 1838 by the German astronomer Friedrich Bessel. He showed that the star system 61 Cygni had a parallax of just 0.31 arcseconds (compared to the modern value of 0.287‚Ä≥). This corresponds to a distance of over 10 light years. In 1917, Heber Curtis noted that novae in spiral nebulae were, on average, 10 magnitudes fainter than galactic novae, suggesting that the former are 100 times further away. The distance to the Andromeda Galaxy was determined in 1923 by American astronomer Edwin Hubble by measuring the brightness of cepheid variables in that galaxy, a new technique discovered by Henrietta Leavitt. This established that the Andromeda galaxy, and by extension all galaxies, lay well outside the Milky Way. The modern concept of outer space is based on the \\"Big Bang\\" cosmology, first proposed in 1931 by the Belgian physicist Georges Lema√Ætre. This theory holds that the universe originated from a very dense form that has since undergone continuous expansion. The earliest known estimate of the temperature of outer space was by the Swiss physicist Charles √â. Guillaume in 1896. Using the estimated radiation of the background stars, he concluded that space must be heated to a temperature of 5‚Äì6 K. British physicist Arthur Eddington made a similar calculation to derive a temperature of 3.18 K in 1926. German physicist Erich Regener used the total measured energy of cosmic rays to estimate an intergalactic temperature of 2.8 K in 1933. American physicists Ralph Alpher and Robert Herman predicted 5 K for the temperature of space in 1948, based on the gradual decrease in background energy following the then-new Big Bang theory. The modern measurement of the cosmic microwave background is about 2.7K. The term outward space was used in 1842 by the English poet Lady Emmeline Stuart-Wortley in her poem \\"The Maiden of Moscow\\". The expression outer space was used as an astronomical term by Alexander von Humboldt in 1845. It was later popularized in the writings of H. G. Wells in 1901. The shorter term space is older, first used to mean the region beyond Earth's sky in John Milton's Paradise Lost in 1667. = Exploration and application = The first image taken by a human of the whole Earth, probably photographed by William Anders of Apollo 8. TIMETAG 003:42:55. South is up; South America is in the middle. For most of human history, space was explored by observations made from the Earth's surface‚Äîinitially with the unaided eye and then with the telescope. Before reliable rocket technology, the closest that humans had come to reaching outer space was through balloon flights. In 1935, the U.S. Explorer II crewed balloon flight reached an altitude of . This was greatly exceeded in 1942 when the third launch of the German A-4 rocket climbed to an altitude of about . In 1957, the uncrewed satellite Sputnik 1 was launched by a Russian R-7 rocket, achieving Earth orbit at an altitude of . This was followed by the first human spaceflight in 1961, when Yuri Gagarin was sent into orbit on Vostok 1. The first humans to escape low-Earth orbit were Frank Borman, Jim Lovell and William Anders in 1968 on board the U.S. Apollo 8, which achieved lunar orbit and reached a maximum distance of from the Earth. The first spacecraft to reach escape velocity was the Soviet Luna 1, which performed a fly-by of the Moon in 1959. In 1961, Venera 1 became the first planetary probe. It revealed the presence of the solar wind and performed the first fly-by of Venus, although contact was lost before reaching Venus. The first successful planetary mission was the 1962 fly-by of Venus by Mariner 2. The first fly-by of Mars was by Mariner 4 in 1964. Since that time, uncrewed spacecraft have successfully examined each of the Solar System's planets, as well their moons and many minor planets and comets. They remain a fundamental tool for the exploration of outer space, as well as for observation of the Earth. In August 2012, Voyager 1 became the first man-made object to leave the Solar System and enter interstellar space. The absence of air makes outer space an ideal location for astronomy at all wavelengths of the electromagnetic spectrum. This is evidenced by the spectacular pictures sent back by the Hubble Space Telescope, allowing light from more than 13 billion years ago‚Äîalmost to the time of the Big Bang‚Äîto be observed. Not every location in space is ideal for a telescope. The interplanetary zodiacal dust emits a diffuse near-infrared radiation that can mask the emission of faint sources such as extrasolar planets. Moving an infrared telescope out past the dust increases its effectiveness. Likewise, a site like the Daedalus crater on the far side of the Moon could shield a radio telescope from the radio frequency interference that hampers Earth-based observations. Uncrewed spacecraft in Earth orbit are an essential technology of modern civilization. They allow direct monitoring of weather conditions, relay long-range communications like television, provide a means of precise navigation, and allow remote sensing of the Earth. The latter role serves a wide variety of purposes, including tracking soil moisture for agriculture, prediction of water outflow from seasonal snow packs, detection of diseases in plants and trees, and surveillance of military activities. The deep vacuum of space could make it an attractive environment for certain industrial processes, such as those requiring ultraclean surfaces. Like asteroid mining, space manufacturing would require a large financial investment with little prospect of immediate return. An important factor in the total expense is the high cost of placing mass into Earth orbit: $‚Äì$ per kg, according to a 2006 estimate (allowing for inflation since then). The cost of access to space has declined since 2013. Partially reusable rockets such as the Falcon 9 have lowered access to space below 3500 dollars per kilogram. With these new rockets the cost to send materials into space remains prohibitively high for many industries. Proposed concepts for addressing this issue include, fully reusable launch systems, non-rocket spacelaunch, momentum exchange tethers, and space elevators. Interstellar travel for a human crew remains at present only a theoretical possibility. The distances to the nearest stars mean it would require new technological developments and the ability to safely sustain crews for journeys lasting several decades. For example, the Daedalus Project study, which proposed a spacecraft powered by the fusion of deuterium and helium-3, would require 36 years to reach the \\"nearby\\" Alpha Centauri system. Other proposed interstellar propulsion systems include light sails, ramjets, and beam-powered propulsion. More advanced propulsion systems could use antimatter as a fuel, potentially reaching relativistic velocities.

Born into the Tata family of India, he was the son of noted businessman Ratanji Dadabhoy Tata and his wife Suzanne Bri√®re. His mother was the first woman in India to drive a car and, in 1929, he became the first licensed pilot in India. He is also best known for being the founder of several industries under the Tata Group, including Tata Consultancy Services, Tata Motors, Titan Industries, Tata Salt, Voltas and Air India. In 1983, he was awarded the French Legion of Honour and in 1955 and 1992, he received two of India's highest civilian awards the Padma Vibhushan and the Bharat Ratna. These honours were bestowed on him for his contributions to Indian industry.A report in Vohuman.org Early life J. R. D. Tata was born as Jehangir on 29 July 1904 into a Parsi family. He was the second child of businessman Ratanji Dadabhoy Tata and his French wife, Suzanne \\"Sooni\\" Bri√®re. His father was the first cousin of Jamsetji Tata, a pioneer industrialist in India. He had one elder sister Sylla, a younger sister Rodabeh and two younger brothers Darab and Jamshed (called Jimmy) Tata. His sister, Sylla, was married to Dinshaw Maneckji Petit, the third baronet of Petits. His sister's sister-in-law, Rattanbai Petit, was the wife of Muhammad Ali Jinnah, who later became the founder of Pakistan in August 1947. Jinnah and Rattanbai's daughter Dina Jinnah, was married to Neville Wadia, a notable businessman. As his mother was French, he spent much of his childhood in France and as a result, French was his first language. He attended the Janson De Sailly School in Paris. One of the teachers at that school used to call him L'Egyptien. Tata also served for one year in a Spahis regiment during the Second World War. After he left the service the whole regiment perished on an expedition in Morocco. He attended the Cathedral and John Connon School, Bombay. Tata was educated in London, Japan, France and India. When his father joined the Tata company he moved the whole family to London. During this time, J. R. D's mother died at an early age of 43 while his father was in India and his family was in France. After his mother's death, Ratanji Dadabhoy Tata decided to move his family to India and sent J. R. D to England for higher studies in October 1923. He was enrolled in a Grammar school, and was interested in studying Engineering at Cambridge. Just as the Grammar course was ending and he was hoping to enter Cambridge, a law was passed in France to draft into the army, for two years, all French boys at the age of 20. As a citizen of France J. R. D had to enlist in the army for at least 1 year. In between the Grammar school and his time in the army, he spent a brief spell at home in Bombay. After joining the French Army he was posted into the regiment called Spahis (The Sepoys). Upon discovering Tata could not only read and write French and English,R.M. Lala : Beyond the last Blue Mountains, Life of J. R. D. Tata but could type as well; the squadron Colonel had him assigned as a secretary in his office. Tata was once again transferred to the more luxurious office of a colonel. After a 12-month period of conscription in the French Army he wanted to proceed to Cambridge for further education, but his father decided to bring him back to India and he joined the Tata Company. In 1929, Tata renounced his French citizenship and became an Indian citizen, and started working at Tata. In 1930 Tata married Thelma Vicaji, the niece of Jack Vicaji, a colourful lawyer whom he hired to defend him on a charge of driving his Bugatti too fast along Bombay's main promenade, Marine Drive. Previously he had been engaged to Dinbai Mehta, the future mother of The Economist editor Shapur Kharegat. Career When Tata was in tour, he was inspired by his friend's father, pioneer Louis Bl√©riot, the first Man to fly across the English Channel, and took to flying. On 10 February 1929, Tata obtained the first pilot license issued in India. He later came to be known as the father of Indian civil aviation. He founded India's first commercial airline, Tata Airlines in 1932, which became Air India in 1946, now India's national airline. He and Nevill Vintcent worked together in building Tata Airlines. They were also good friends. In 1929, J. R. D became one of the first Indians to be granted a commercial pilot's license. In 1932 Tata Aviation Service, the forerunner to Tata Airline and Air India, took to the skies. The first flight in the history of Indian aviation lifted off from Drigh Road in Karachi with J. R. D at the controls of a Puss Moth. J. R. D nourished and nurtured his airline baby through to 1953, when the government of Jawaharlal Nehru nationalised Air India. It was a decision J. R. D had fought against tooth and nail. He joined Tata Sons as an unpaid apprentice in 1925. In 1938, at the age of 34, Tata was elected Chairman of Tata Sons making him the head of the largest industrial group in India. He took over as Chairman of Tata Sons from his second cousin Nowroji Saklatwala. For decades, he directed the huge Tata Group of companies, with major interests in steel, engineering, power, chemicals and hospitality. He was famous for succeeding in business while maintaining high ethical standards ‚Äì refusing to bribe politicians or use the black market. Under his chairmanship, the assets of the Tata Group grew from US$100 million to over US$5 billion. He started with 14 enterprises under his leadership and half a century later on 26 July 1988, when he left, Tata Sons was a conglomerate of 95 enterprises which they either started or in which they had controlling interest. He was the trustee of the Sir Dorabji Tata Trust from its inception in 1932 for over half a century. Under his guidance, this Trust established Asia's first cancer hospital, the Tata Memorial Centre for Cancer, Research and Treatment, in Bombay in 1941. He also founded the Tata Institute of Social Sciences (TISS, 1936), the Tata Institute of Fundamental Research (TIFR, 1945), and the National Center for Performing Arts. In 1945, he founded Tata Motors. In 1948, Tata launched Air India International as India's first international airline. In 1953, the Indian Government appointed Tata as Chairman of Air India and a director on the Board of Indian Airlines ‚Äì a position he retained for 25 years. For his crowning achievements in aviation, he was bestowed with the title of Honorary Air Commodore of India. Tata cared greatly for his workers. In 1956, he initiated a programme of closer 'employee association with management' to give workers a stronger voice in the affairs of the company. He firmly believed in employee welfare and espoused the principles of an eight-hour working day, free medical aid, workers' provident scheme, and workmen's accident compensation schemes, which were later, adopted as statutory requirements in India. He was also a founding member of the first Governing Body of NCAER, the National Council of Applied Economic Research in New Delhi, India's first independent economic policy institute established in 1956. In 1968, he founded Tata Consultancy Services as Tata Computer Centre. In 1979, Tata Steel instituted a new practice: a worker being deemed to be \\"at work\\" from the moment he leaves home for work until he returns home from work. This made the company financially liable to the worker for any mishap on the way to and from work. In 1987, he founded Titan Industries. Jamshedpur was also selected as a UN Global Compact City because of the quality of life, conditions of sanitation, roads and welfare that were offered by Tata Steel. =Support of emergency powers in 1975= Tata was also controversially supportive of the declaration of emergency powers by Prime Minister, Indira Gandhi, in 1975. He is quoted to have told a reporter of the New York Times, \\"things had gone too far. You can't imagine what we've been through here‚Äîstrikes, boycotts, demonstrations. Why, there were days I couldn't walk out of my office into the street. The parliamentary system is not suited to our needs.\\" Awards and honours Tata on a 1994 stamp of India Tata received a number of awards. He was conferred the honorary rank of group captain by the Indian Air Force in 1948, was promoted to the Air Commodore rank (equivalent to Brigadier in army) on 4 October 1966, and was further promoted on 1 April 1974 to the Air Vice Marshal rank. Several international awards for aviation were given to him ‚Äì the Tony Jannus Award in March 1979, the Gold Air Medal of the Federation Aeronautique International in 1985, the Edward Warner Award of the International Civil Aviation Organisation, Canada in 1986 and the Daniel Guggenheim Medal in 1988. He received the Padma Vibhushan in 1955. The French Legion of Honour was bestowed on him in 1983. In 1992, because of his selfless humanitarian endeavours, Tata was awarded India's highest civilian honour, the Bharat Ratna. In the same year, Tata was also bestowed with the United Nations Population Award for his crusading endeavours towards initiating and successfully implementing the family planning movement in India, much before it became an official government policy. In his memory, the Government of Maharashtra named its first double-decker bridge the Bharatratna JRD Tata Overbridge at Nasik Phata, Pimpri Chinchwad.  Death and Legacy  Tata died in Geneva, Switzerland on 29 November 1993 at the age of 89 of a kidney infection. He said a few days before his passing: \\"Comme c'est doux de mourir\\" (\\"How gentle it is to die\\"). Upon his death, the Indian Parliament was adjourned in his memory ‚Äì an honour not usually given to persons who are not members of parliament. He was buried at the P√®re Lachaise Cemetery in Paris. In 2012, Tata was ranked the sixth \\"Greatest Indian\\" in an Outlook magazine poll, \\"conducted in conjunction with CNN-IBN and History18 Channels with BBC.\\"Sengupta, Uttan; \\"The measure of a Man\\"; Outlook India, 20 Aug 2012.

Military career Brown joined the U.S. Navy after his internship at the Medical University of South Carolina. Upon completion of flight surgeon training in 1984, he reported to the Navy Branch Hospital in Adak, Alaska, as Director of Medical Services. He was then assigned to Carrier Air Wing Fifteen which deployed aboard the aircraft carrier in the Western Pacific. In 1988, he became the only flight surgeon in a ten-year period to be chosen for pilot training. He was ultimately designated a Naval Aviator in 1990 at NAS Chase Field in Beeville, Texas, ranking number one in his class. Brown was then sent for training and carrier qualification in the A-6E Intruder. In 1991, he reported to the Naval Strike Warfare Center at NAS Fallon, Nevada, where he served as a Strike Leader Attack Training Syllabus Instructor and a Contingency Cell Planning Officer. Additionally, he was qualified in the F/A-18 Hornet and deployed from Japan in 1992 aboard flying the A-6E with VA-115. In 1995, he reported to the U.S. Naval Test Pilot School at NAS Patuxent River, Maryland as their flight surgeon where he also flew the T-38 Talon. Brown logged over 2,700 flight hours with 1,700 in high performance military aircraft. He was qualified as first pilot in NASA T-38 aircraft. He held a Federal Communications Commission (FCC) issued Technician Class amateur radio license with the call sign KC5ZTC. NASA career Funeral of David M. Brown at Arlington National Cemetery (March 12, 2003) Selected by NASA in April 1996, Brown reported to the Johnson Space Center in August 1996. He completed two years of training and evaluation, and was qualified for flight assignment as a mission specialist. He was initially assigned to support payload development for the International Space Station, followed by the astronaut support team responsible for orbiter cockpit setup, crew strap-in, and landing recovery. On April 21, 2001, Brown appeared on ESPN as an expert on g-force loading on the human body that led to the cancellation of the Firestone Firehawk 600 CART race. Brown flew aboard Space Shuttle Columbia on STS-107, logging 15 days, 22 hours, and 20 minutes in space from January 16 to February 1, 2003. The flight was a dedicated science and research mission. Working 24 hours a day, in two alternating shifts, the crew successfully conducted approximately 80 experiments. The mission ended abruptly on February 1, 2003, when Columbia's crew perished during entry, 16 minutes before the scheduled landing. Personal life As the lone unmarried member of the STS-107 crew, Brown had previously been romantically involved with NASA engineer Ann Micklos. The two ended their relationship shortly before the mission, but remained close friends until his death. The crew of STS-107 had also formed a very close friendship in their training, that Brown had been preparing a videotape to commemorate once they returned from their mission. Brown is buried in Arlington National Cemetery. Tributes The David M.

Early and personal life Clark was born in Ames, Iowa, but considered Racine, Wisconsin to be her home town. Clark was a member of the Gamma Phi Beta sorority at the University of Wisconsin - Madison. She held a Federal Communications Commission (FCC) issued Technician Class amateur radio license with the call sign KC5ZSU. She is survived by her husband, fellow NASA flight surgeon Dr. Jonathan Clark (who was part of an official NASA panel that prepared the final 400-page report about the Space Shuttle Columbia disaster), and son, Iain, who was born in 1996.Lost Astronaut's Husband Not Giving Up On Space - Milwaukee News Story - WISN Milwaukee Education *1979: Graduated from William Horlick High School, Racine, Wisconsin *1983: Received bachelor of science degree in Zoology from the University of Wisconsin‚ÄìMadison *1987: Received doctorate in Medicine from the University of Wisconsin‚ÄìMadison Organizations Clark was a member of the Aerospace Medical Association and the Society of U.S. Naval Flight Surgeons. She was also a member of the Olympia Brown Unitarian Universalist Church in Racine, Wisconsin. Military career During medical school, Clark did active duty training with the Diving Medicine Department at the United States Navy Experimental Diving Unit in March 1987. After completing medical school, she underwent postgraduate medical education in pediatrics from 1987 to 1988 at the National Naval Medical Center. The following year she completed Navy undersea medical officer training at the Naval Undersea Medical Institute in Groton, Connecticut, and diving medical officer training at the Naval Diving and Salvage Training Center in Panama City, Florida. Clark was designated a Radiation Health Officer and Undersea Medical Officer. She was then assigned as the Submarine Squadron 14 Medical Department Head in Holy Loch, Scotland. During that assignment, she dove with Navy divers and Naval Special Warfare Unit Two SEALs, and performed many medical evacuations from US submarines. After two years of operational experience she was designated as a Naval Submarine Medical Officer and Diving Medical Officer. Clark underwent six months of aeromedical training at the Naval Aerospace Medical Institute at NAS Pensacola in Pensacola, Florida, and was designated as a Naval Flight Surgeon. She was stationed at MCAS Yuma, Arizona, and assigned as Flight Surgeon Marine Attack Squadron 211 (VMA-211), a Marine Corps AV-8B Harrier squadron. She made several deployments, including one overseas to the Western Pacific, practiced medicine in austere environments, and flew on multiple aircraft. Her squadron won the Marine Attack Squadron of the Year award for its successful deployment. She was then assigned as the Group Flight Surgeon for Marine Aircraft Group 13 (MAG-13). Before her selection as an astronaut candidate she served as a Flight Surgeon for Training Squadron 86 (VT-86), the Naval Flight Officer advanced training squadron for tactical jets at NAS Pensacola. Clark was Board Certified by the National Board of Medical Examiners and held a Wisconsin Medical License. Her military qualifications included Radiation Health Officer, Undersea Medical Officer, Diving Medical Officer, Submarine Medical Officer, and Naval Flight Surgeon. She was a Basic Life Support Instructor, Advanced Cardiac Life Support Provider, Advanced Trauma Life Support Provider, and Hyperbaric Chamber Advisor. NASA career Selected by NASA in April 1996, Clark reported to the Johnson Space Center in Houston, Texas in August 1996. After completing two years of training and evaluation, she was qualified for flight assignment as a mission specialist. From July 1997 to August 2000 Clark worked in the Astronaut Office Payloads/Habitability Branch.

Working 24 hours a day, in two alternating shifts, the crew successfully conducted approximately 80 experiments. Clark's bioscience experiments included gardening in space, as she discussed only days before her death in an interview with Milwaukee media near her Wisconsin hometown. The STS-107 mission ended abruptly on February 1, 2003, when Columbia disintegrated and her crew perished during re-entry, 16 minutes before scheduled landing. Clark also recorded inside the cockpit during Columbias descent into the Earth's atmosphere on a small digital camera. Clark's final message to her friends and family was through an email sent from Columbia.Letter Home from Space January 31, 2003. In the released text of the email, Clark called the planet magnificent, and explained that while she spends much of the time working back in Spacehab and away from the sights of Earth, \\"whenever I do get to look out, it is glorious.\\" She found that taking photos of the Earth was challenging, \\"Keeping my fingers crossed that they're in sharp focus.\\" Clark also shared some of the intriguing effects of micro gravity on human physiology, such as constant challenge to stay adequately hydrated due to an \\"almost non-existent\\" sense of thirst.

He was a member of the G√∂ttingen School of History. Life and work Michaelis was born in Halle an der Saale and was trained for academic life under his father's eye. At Halle he was influenced, especially in philosophy, by Siegmund J. Baumgarten (1706‚Äì1757), the link between the old Pietism and J. S. Semler, while he cultivated his strong taste for history under Chancellor Ludwig. In 1739‚Äì1740 he qualified as university lecturer. One of his dissertations was a defence of the antiquity and divine authority of the vowel points in Hebrew. His scholarship still moved along the old traditional lines, and he was also much exercised by certain religious scruples, with some seeing a conflict between his independent mind and that of submission to authority - encouraged by the Lutheranism in which he had been trained ‚Äî which affected his reasoning. A visit to England in 1741‚Äì1742 lifted him out of the narrow groove of his earlier education. In passing through the Netherlands he made the acquaintance of Albert Schultens, whose influence on his philological views became allpowerful a few years later. At Halle Michaelis felt himself out of place, and in 1745 he gladly accepted an invitation to G√∂ttingen as Privatdozent. In 1746 he became professor extraordinarius, in 1750 ordinarius, and in G√∂ttingen he remained till his death there in 1791. One of his works was a translation of four parts of Samuel Richardson's Clarissa; and translations of some of the then current English paraphrases on biblical books showed his sympathy with a school which attracted him by its freer air. His Oriental studies were reshaped by reading Schultens; for the Halle school, with all its learning, had no conception of the principles on which a fruitful connection between Biblical and Oriental learning could be established. His linguistic work indeed was always hampered by the lack of manuscript material, which is felt in his philological writings, e.g., in his valuable Supplementa to the Hebrew lexicons (1784‚Äì1792). He could not become such an Arabist as J. J. Reiske; and, though for many years the most famous teacher of Semitic languages in Europe, neither his grammatical nor his critical work has left a permanent mark, with the exception perhaps of his text-critical studies on the Peshitta. His tastes were all for history, antiquities, and especially geography and natural science. He had in fact started his university course as a medicinae cultor, and in his autobiography he half regrets that he did not choose the medical profession. In geography he found a field hardly touched since Samuel Bochart, in whose footsteps he followed in the Spicilegium geographiae hebraeorum exterae post Bochartum (1769‚Äì1780). Michaelis inspired the famous Danish Arabia Expedition (1761‚Äì67), conducted by Carsten Niebuhr and Peter Forssk√•l. In spite of his doctrinal writings‚Äîwhich at the time made no little noise, so that his Compendium of Dogmatic (1760) was confiscated in Sweden, and the Knighthood of the Polar Star was afterwards given him in reparation‚Äîit was the natural side of the Bible that really attracted him, and no man did more to introduce the method of studying Hebrew antiquity as an integral part of ancient Eastern life. Johann David Michaelis (1717-91) The personal character of Michaelis can be read between the lines of his autobiography with the aid of the other materials collected by J. M. Hassencamp (J. D. Michaelis Lebensbeschreibung, etc., 1793). The same volume contains a full list of his works. Besides those already mentioned it is sufficient to refer to his Introduction to the New Testament (the first edition, 1750, preceded the full development of his powers, and is a very different book from the later editions), his reprint of Robert Lowth's Praelectiones with important additions (1758‚Äì1762), his German translation of the Bible with notes (1773‚Äì1792), his Orientalische und exegetische Bibliothek (1775‚Äì1785) and Neue O. und E. Bib. (1786‚Äì1791), his Mosaisches Recht (1770‚Äì1771) (quite influenced by Montesquieu's L'esprit des lois of 1748) and his edition of Edmund Castell's Lexicon syriacum (1787‚Äì1788). His Litterarischer Briefwechsel (1794‚Äì1796) contains much that is interesting for the history of learning in his time. He was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society in 1789. Family * Michaelis great uncle Johann Heinrich Michaelis (1668‚Äì1738) was the chief director of A.H. Francke's Collegium orientale theologicum, a practical school of Biblical and Oriental philology then quite unique, and the author of an annotated Hebrew Bible and various exegetical works of reputation, especially the Adnotationes uberiores in hagiographos (1720). * In his chief publications J. H. Michaelis had as fellow-worker his sister's son Christian Benedikt Michaelis (1680‚Äì1764), the father of Johann David, who was likewise influential as professor at the University of Halle, and a sound scholar, especially in Syriac. * Michaelis' daughter Caroline played an important role in early German Romanticism as the wife of critic August Wilhelm von Schlegel and later of philosopher Friedrich Wilhelm Joseph Schelling.

He disdained parochial work and decided to accept the Hebrew chair at Franeker in 1713. He held this position until 1729, when he was transferred to Leiden as rector of the collegium theologicum, or seminary for poor students. From 1732 until his death (at Leiden) he was professor of Oriental languages at Leiden. Schultens was the chief teacher of the Arabic language in the whole of the Europe during his lifetime. In some sense, he revived Arabic studies. He differed from J. J. Reiske and Silvestre de Sacy in regarding Arabic as a handmaid to Hebrew. Reiske considered Schultens' treatment of Arabic to be of little value, also maintaining that Arabic studies should not be taught as part of theology, but as a subject matter in its own right, as was mathematics, physics, geography and medicine.History of Linguistics 2002: Selected Papers from the Ninth International... edited by Eduardo R.

Exos completed acquisition of Armadillo assets in early 2015, and intended to begin launches of the Suborbital Active Rocket with Guidance (SARGE) in 2016 from Spaceport America in New Mexico. SARGE will be an enhanced Armadillo STIG-B. The first flight of SARGE took place in 2018 from Spaceport America. In September 2017, John Carmack retweeted a post about SpaceX rocket bloopers, along with his post \\"I showed all of our crashes at the beginning of Armadillo Aerospace, but everyone thought it was a terrible idea and talked me out of it.\\" In the comment section, one person asked if there's chance of comeback for Armadillo Aerospace. He subsequently replied that there is the chance that he might \\"want to try at some point\\" with his own scheme, giving a sign that Armadillo Aerospace could someday return from hibernation mode. Research and development principles 2006 X-Prize Cup. The company placed a strong emphasis on a rapid build and test cycle. Armadillo Aerospace designed and built more than 12 vehicles which used about 50 engine designs for over 100 rocket flights. Each design had several features in common. One was the use of modern computer technologies and electronics to simplify rocket control and reduce development costs. Another was the use of liquid propellants and VTVL to facilitate short launch-to- launch times. Prize competitions =X-Prize competition= The company was a competitor for the Ansari X-Prize. Armadillo's X-Prize vehicle was unorthodox among modern rockets in that instead of using stabilization fins, which complicate the design and increase drag, Armadillo used an aerodynamically unstable design, where the computer controlled jet vanes based on feedback from fibre optic gyroscopes. Armadillo stated a preference for simplicity and reliability over performance, which was evident in its choice of hydrogen peroxide (50% concentration in water) and methanol as a mixed monopropellant for the vehicle. A monopropellant-based engine requires only a single tank, as well as greatly simplified plumbing and other hardware. =Wirefly X-Prize Cup 2006= Pixel attempting level 1. White tanks are insulated and contain liquid oxygen, grey tanks contain ethanol Armadillo 2006 mission patch Armadillo Aerospace competed in the 2006 X PRIZE Cup. Armadillo Aerospace was the only competitor in the Lunar Lander Challenge. The company took two similar vehicles, Pixel and Texel, to the event. The vehicles narrowly failed to win the Level 1 prize, after making three dramatic attempts totalling over 5 minutes in the air,Armadillo Aerospace - News Archive finally crashing out on the final attempt. Persistent landing problems were the main cause of failure, with the undercarriage breaking several times, and landing slightly off the pad on one occasion due to guidance difficulties. These flights were a highlight of the Wirefly X-prize cup. Quad vehicle The quad vehicle design is pressure-fed in blow down mode from an initial pressure of 320 psi for level 1 (400 psi level 2). The roll thrusters are cross-fed by gas drawn from ullage space of the opposite tank. The vehicle is able to transfer propellant through connecting pipes between opposite tanks by controlling ullage pressures with the thrusters; this helps it balance, minimizing gas use. The main engine has two-axis thrust vectoring. The vehicle is fully computer controlled; with guidance from GPS and fiber optic gyroscopes. =Wirefly X-Prize Cup 2007= Armadillo Aerospace competed in the 2007 Lunar Lander Challenge event in the Wirefly X-Prize Cup 2007. Testing During testing one of the two Quad vehicles (named Texel) crashed on a tethered flight after a guidance problem caused the vehicle to rapidly gain altitude until 3 separate flight termination procedures were activated at approximately 20‚Äì30 feet. The vehicle fell, and the impact broke open one of the alcohol tanks and a large fireball engulfed the vehicle.Texel crash video The vehicle was irreparably damaged, and only its sister Pixel could compete in the upcoming event. The plan was to have the first module (of the next generation modular design) compete at level 1, and have Pixel compete at level 2 challenge. Armadillo Aerospace - News Archive Competition In the level 1 events, Armadillo's craft MOD (actually, module #1) logged several attempts, including several successful first leg flights, but was unable to complete the return trip during any attempt. On its first attempt, a clogged igniter orifice prevented ignition. On the second attempt, the first leg flight was perfect; increased guidance and control capabilities allowed the module to, in Carmack's words, 'burn the X-mark off the target pad'. The return leg was delayed slightly, because the igniter had clogged again. When the second leg was attempted, a 'hard start' cracked the graphite combustion chamber. As the vehicle was still flying, Carmack flew the crippled vehicle through the course as quickly as possible and hovered 2‚Äì3 meters above the landing pad. With only a few seconds remaining in the required flight time, the damaged combustion chamber cracked again, which caused the vehicle to tilt enough to trigger a computer abort. The vehicle performed an auto-land, but the tilt caused the module to tip over on landing after only 82 seconds in the air. The second attempt began with another perfect first leg, but the return was marred by another hard start. Seeing that the engine was badly damaged (although flying), the team commanded an abort. The module landed back on the pad after only a few seconds. On the final attempt, MOD suffered a violent \\"hard start\\", resulting in engine explosion. The violence of the explosion embedded a piece of the graphite chamber in the ground 64 meters from the launch pad, and ended their attempts in 2007 for the prize. =Lunar Lander Challenge 2008= \\"Mod\\" vehicle taking off at LLC 2008 The 2008 Lunar Lander Challenge took place October 24‚Äì25 at the Las Cruces International Airport in New Mexico. Armadillo Aerospace competed for the third year but for the first time had competition, from the TrueZer0 team. Both received waivers from the FAA to fly experimental rockets. TrueZero attempted level 1, achieved hover, then lost roll control and was aborted and crashed. Armadillo had an unsuccessful first attempt at level 1, and landed early due to inadequate thrust. On their second attempt they completed the first leg, but the second leg was cut short by the FAA closing the flight window. The second leg was held in the afternoon, and they were able to take the Level 1 top prize of $350,000. Armadillo's attempt at the level 2 prize on October 25 was aborted due to their vehicle toppling over after the engine casing burned through due to a fuel-line problem. =Lunar Lander Challenge 2009= Armadillo attempted the Level 2 prize on September 12, 2009. Armadillo successfully flew both legs with their Mod vehicle, each flight lasting over 180 seconds, landing safely. However their landing accuracy was not sufficient to win the first prize, instead they won the second prize while Masten Space Systems' Xoie lander won the Level 2 first prize. Rocket Racing League In 2008, the Rocket Racing League announced that Armadillo Aerospace engines would be used in a second generation of X-Racer aircraft.Rocket Racing , August 2008 , the Rocket Racing League was utilizing a highly modified Velocity XL FG airframe and an Armadillo Aerospace 2,500 pound thrust liquid oxygen (LOX) and ethanol rocket engine in both the Mark-II X-Racer and Mark-III X-Racer demonstration vehicles. Rocket Racing League Announces Milestone Development in X-Racer , press release, 2010-03-10, accessed May 3, 2010. The Rocket Racing league never got out of its early development mode, and no racing season was ever held. Vehicles =Super Mod= The Super Mod reusable launch vehicle is a vertical-takeoff, vertical-landing (VTVL) uncrewed rocket which was developed by Armadillo in 2010‚Äì2011. It was submitted to NASA as a potential suborbital vehicle for use as a suborbital reusable launch vehicle (sRLV) under NASA's Flight Opportunities Program. It added aerodynamic fairings, partially extendable landing legs with lower aerodynamic drag, and systems improvements to the basic Mod vehicle structure and systems.

The second flight, which took place in 2012, reached 50 miles (82 kilometers), but the recovery chute did not work as planned. The third flight took place in January 2013 and the vehicle experienced a hard landing following a parachute failure-to-deploy, though the launch was good.STIG B-III mission, January 5, 2013 . Armadillo Aerospace. Staff and funding Widget, Armadillo Aerospace's mascot Armadillo was headed, and largely funded, by John Carmack, a developer of video games including the Doom and Quake series. During its early days, all of its employees (including Carmack) had other, full-time jobs and contributed their efforts twice weekly to Armadillo on a voluntary basis. Armadillo had a relatively small budget and was not supported by aerospace companies or agencies like NASA, ESA, or Boeing. Armadillo Aerospace publicly declared itself fully self-funded. In February 2006, Carmack stated that the program to date had cost slightly over $2 million. Even by the standards of X-Prize candidates, this is a low budget. Scaled Composites is estimated to have spent $25 million on its SpaceShipOne development program. On August 8, 2006, Armadillo Aerospace announced that it had reached a sponsorship deal with NVIDIA. While details were sparse, John Carmack said, \\"There is a chance at this point that I may have written the last personal cheque I need to for Armadillo.\\"Armadillo Aerospace - News Archive In April 2008, Carmack offered an updated figure of \\"total cost to date, about $3.5 million\\". He estimated that another $2 million would be needed to achieve a crewed flight to 100 km using Armadillo's modular design in a \\"six-pack\\" configuration.Armadillo Aerospace - News Archive By 2010, Armadillo had 7 full-time employees, and was profitable on ongoing operations (though Carmack was continuing to invest in development efforts).Armadillo Aerospace - News Archive August 10, 2010 The company mascot was an armadillo named Widget. =2013 \\"Hibernation mode\\" and sale of assets= In August 2013, Carmack indicated that following the crash of the STIG-B rocket earlier that year, he had wound down the company operations and had put the company in \\"hibernation mode.\\" Armadillo had stopped accepting (profitable) contract R&D; work two years prior, in order to focus on development of a suborbital reusable rocket. During those two years, Armadillo operated at an approximately US$1 million per year burn rate funded personally by Carmack. Several reasons were offered for this outcome, including a failure to adopt a multi-test-vehicle build strategy, making the loss of a single rocket more significant than it would have otherwise been. , Carmack was \\"actively looking for outside investors to restart work on the company‚Äôs rockets\\". In 2015 the assets of Armadillo Aerospace were sold to EXOS Aerospace Systems & Technologies, Inc. Future research Carmack stated in his monthly reports and in forum posts that he expected his path to an orbital vehicle to include modular rockets similar to OTRAG technology.

He was a pioneer in the fields of Arabic and Byzantine philology as well as Islamic numismatics. Biography Reiske was born at Z√∂rbig, in the Electorate of Saxony. From the orphanage in Halle he passed in 1733 to the University of Leipzig, and there spent five years. He tried to find his own way in middle Greek literature, to which German schools then gave little attention; but, as he had not mastered the grammar, he soon found this a sore task and took up Arabic. He was poor, having almost nothing beyond his allowance, which for the five years was only two hundred thalers. But everything of which he could cheat his appetite was spent on Arabic books, and when he had read all that was then printed he thirsted for manuscripts, and in March 1738 started on foot for Hamburg, joyous though totally unprovided, on his way to Leiden and the treasures of the Warnerianum. At Hamburg, he got some money and letters of recommendation from the Hebraist Friedrich August Wolf, and took ship to Amsterdam. There d'Orville, to whom he had an introduction, proposed to retain him as his amanuensis at a salary of six hundred guilders. Reiske refused, though he thought the offer very generous; he did not want money, he wanted manuscripts. When he reached Leiden (June 6, 1738), he found that the lectures were over for the term and that the manuscripts were not open to him. But d'Orville and Albert Schultens helped him to private teaching and reading for the press, by which he was able to live. He heard the lectures of A. Schultens, and practised himself in Arabic with his son J.J. Schultens. Through Schultens too he got at Arabic manuscripts, and was even allowed sub rosa to take them home with him. Ultimately he seems to have got free access to the collection, which he catalogued‚Äîthe work of almost a whole summer, for which the curators rewarded him with nine guilders. Reiske's first years in Leiden were not unhappy, until he got into serious trouble by introducing emendations of his own into the second edition of Burmann's Petronius, which he had to see through the press. His patrons withdrew from him, and his chance of perhaps becoming professor was gone; d'Orville indeed soon came round, for he could not do without Reiske, who did work of which his patron, after dressing it up in his own style, took the credit. But A. Schultens was never the same as before to him; Reiske indeed was too independent, and hurt him by his open criticisms of his master's way of making Arabic mainly a handmaid of Hebrew. Reiske himself, however, admitted that Schultens always behaved honourably to him. In 1742, by Schultens' advice Reiske took up medicine as a study by which he might hope to live if he could not do so by philology. In 1746, he graduated as M.D., the fees being remitted at Schultens' intercession. It was Schultens too who conquered the difficulties opposed to his graduation at the last moment by the faculty of theology on the ground that some of his theses had a materialistic ring. On June 10, 1746, he left the Netherlands and settled in Leipzig, where he hoped to get medical practice. But his shy, proud nature was not fitted to gain patients, and the Leipzig doctors would not recommend one who was not a Leipzig graduate. In 1747, an Arabic dedication to the electoral prince of Saxony got him the title of professor, but neither the faculty of arts nor that of medicine was willing to admit him among them, and he never delivered a course of lectures. He had still to go on doing literary task-work, but his labour was much worse paid in Leipzig than in Leiden. Still he could have lived and sent his old mother, as his custom was, a yearly present of a piece of leather to be sold in retail if he had been a better manager. But, careless for the morrow, he was always printing at his own cost great books which found no buyers. In his autobiography \\"Lebensbeschreibung\\" he depicted his academical colleagues as hostile; and suspected Ernesti, under a show of friendship, secretly hindered his promotion. On the other hand, his unsparing reviews made bad blood with the pillars of the university. In 1755 to 1756 he turned his attention to Oriental coins. The custodian at the Royal Coin Cabinet in Dresden, Richter, invited him to study the coins with Arabic inscriptions. Richter asked him to explain the texts on the coins. His resulting \\"letters on Arabic coinage (Briefe √ºber das arabische M√ºnzwesen)\\" were posthumously published by Johann Gottfried Eichhorn. He did it very eagerly with the hope to find a suitable bread job in Dresden. However, the Seven Years' War ended all hopes to find anything in Oriental studies. His \\"letters on Arabic coinage\\" were the first serious attempt to compare the historical information gathered from the Islamic coins - bearing up to 150 words ‚Äì with the information from chronicles, to achieve new insights in medieval Islamic history. Among the Orientalists at his time he was now known as someone knowledgeable on Islamic coins. He was later approached by Carsten Niebuhr to identify the coins which he brought with him from his travels. But Reiske never came back seriously to this topic. At length in 1758 the magistrates of Leipzig rescued him from his misery by giving him the rectorate of St. Nicolai, and, though he still made no way with the leading men of the university and suffered from the hostility of men like Ruhnken and J.D. Michaelis, he was compensated for this by the esteem of Frederick the Great, of Lessing, Niebuhr, and many foreign scholars. The last decade of his life was made cheerful by his marriage with Ernestine M√ºller, who shared all his interests and learned Greek to help him with collations. In proof of his gratitude, her portrait stands beside his in the first volume of the Oratores Graeci. Reiske died in Leipzig on 14 August 1774, and his manuscript remains passed, through Lessing's mediation, to the Danish historian P.F. Suhm, and are now in the Royal Library, Copenhagen. Achievements Reiske excelled as a scholar of Arabic literature. Interested in the history and the realia of the literature, he cared less for the verse of the poets than for the historical notices to be found in their scholia - the much praised poetry of Hariri seemed to him a grammatical pedant. The scholia on Jarir provided information on the prevalence of Buddhist doctrine and asceticism in Iraq under the Omayyads. In the Adnotationes historicae to his Abulfeda (Abulf. Annales Moslemici, 5 vols., Copenhagen, 1789‚Äì91), he collected a veritable treasure of sound and original research; he knew the Byzantine writers as thoroughly as the Arabic authors, and was alike at home in modern works of travel in all languages and in ancient and medieval authorities. He was interested too in numismatics. To comprehensive knowledge and very wide reading he added a sound historical judgment. He was not, like Schultens, deceived by the pretended antiquity of the Yemenite Qasidas. Errors no doubt he made, as in the attempt to ascertain the date of the breach of the dam of Ma'rib. Although Abulfeda as a late epitomator afforded no starting point for methodical study of the sources, Reiske's edition with his version and notes laid the foundation for research into Arab history, and a historical criticism of Oriental numismatics with his letters on Arabic coinage (in J. G. Eichhorn's Repertorium, vols. ix.-xi.). The foundation of Arabic philology, however, was laid not by him but by Silvestre de Sacy. Reiske's linguistic knowledge was great, but he used it only to understand his authors; he had no feeling for form, for language as language, or for metre. In Leipzig Reiske worked mainly at Greek, while he continued to draw on his Arabic stores accumulated in Leiden. His merit as an Arabist was sooner recognized than the value of his Greek work. Reiske the Greek scholar has been rightly valued only in recent years, and it is now recognized that he was the first German since Sylburg who had a living knowledge of the Greek tongue. His reputation does not rest on his numerous editions, often hasty or even made to booksellers' orders, but in his remarks, especially his conjectures. He himself designates the Animadversiones in scriptores Graecos as flos ingenii sui, and in truth these thin booklets outweigh his big editions. Closely following the author's thought he removes obstacles whenever he meets them, but he is so steeped in the language and thinks so truly like a Greek that the difficulties he feels often seem to us to lie in mere points of style. His criticism is empirical and unmethodical, based on immense and careful reading, and applied only when he feels a difficulty; and he is most successful when he has a large mass of tolerably homogeneous literature to lean on, whilst on isolated points he is often at a loss. His corrections are often hasty and false, but a surprisingly large proportion of them have since received confirmation from manuscripts, and, though his merits as a Grecian lie mainly in his conjectures, his realism is felt in this sphere also; his German translations especially show more freedom and practical insight, more feeling for actual life, than is common with the scholars of that age.

He was the father of the Danish-German statesman and historian Barthold Georg Niebuhr, who published an account of his father's life in 1817. Early life and education Carsten Niebuhr in the attire of a distinguished Arab in Yemen, gift from al-Mahdi 'Abbas, Imam of Yemen Niebuhr was born in L√ºdingworth (now a part of Cuxhaven, Lower Saxony) in what was then Bremen-Verden. His father Barthold Niebuhr (1704-1749) was a successful farmer and owned his own property. Carsten and his sister were educated at home by a local school teacher, then he attended the Latin School in Otterndorf, near Cuxhaven. Originally Niebuhr had intended to become a surveyor, but in 1757 he went to the Georgia Augusta University of G√∂ttingen, at this time Germany's most progressive institution of higher education. Niebuhr was probably a strong student because in 1760 Johann David Michaelis (1717-1791) recommended him as a participant in the Royal Danish Arabia Expedition (1761-1767), mounted by Frederick V of Denmark (1722-1766). For a year and a half before the expedition Niebuhr studied mathematics, cartography and navigational astronomy under Tobias Mayer (1723-1762), one of the premier astronomers of the 18th century, and the author of the Lunar Distance Method for determining longitude. Niebuhr's observations during the Arabia Expedition proved the accuracy and the practicality of this method for use by mariners at sea. Expeditions The expedition sailed in January 1761 via Marseilles and Malta to Istanbul and Alexandria. Then the members of the expedition visited Cairo and Sinai, before traversing the Red Sea via Jiddah to Yemen, which was their main destination. In Mocha, on 25 May 1763, the expedition's philologist, Frederik Christian von Haven, died, and on 11 July 1763, on the way to Sana Ωa, the capital of Yemen, its naturalist Peter Forssk√•l also died. In Sana Ωa the remaining members of the expedition had an audience with the Imam of Yemen al-Mahdi Abbas (1719-1775), but suffered from the climate and returned to Mocha. Niebuhr seems to have preserved his own life and restored his health by adopting native dress and eating native food. From Mocha the expedition continued to Bombay, the expedition's artist Georg Wilhelm Baurenfeind died on the 29th of August and the expedition's servant Lars Berggren on the following day; both were buried at sea. The surgeon Christian C. Kramer (1732-1763) also died, soon after landing in Bombay. Niebuhr was the only surviving member. He stayed in Bombay for fourteen months and then returned home by way of Muscat, Bushire, Shiraz and Persepolis. His copies of the cuneiform inscriptions at Persepolis proved to be a key turning-point in the decipherment of cuneiform, and the birth of Assyriology. ; see also the fold-out plate (Tabelle XXXI) after p. 152. From p. 150: \\"Ich will auf der Tabelle XXXI, noch eine, oder vielmehr vier Inschriften H, I, K, L beyf√ºgen, die ich etwa in der Mitte an der Hauptmauer nach S√ºden, alle neben einander, angetroffen habe. Der Stein worauf sie stehen, ist 26 Fu√ü lang, und 6 Fu√ü hoch, und dieser ist ganz damit bedeckt. Man kann also daraus die Gr√∂√üe der Buchstaben beurtheilen. Auch hier sind drey verschiedene Alphabete.\\" (I want to include in Plate XXXI another, or rather four inscriptions H, I, K, L, which I found approximately in the middle of the main wall to the south [in the ruined palace at Persepolis], all side by side. The stone on which they appear, is 26 feet long and 6 feet high, and it's completely covered with them. One can thus judge therefrom the size of the letters. Also here, [there] are three different alphabets.) His transcriptions were especially useful to Grotefend, who made the first correct decirpherments of Old Persian cuneiform: File:Niebuhr inscription 1.jpgNiebuhr inscription 1. Now known to mean \\"Darius the Great King, King of Kings, King of countries, son of Hystaspes, an Achaemenian, who built this Palace\\". File:Niebuhr inscription 2.jpgNiebuhr inscription 2. Now known to mean \\"Xerxes the Great King, King of Kings, son of Darius the King, an Achaemenian\\". He also visited the ruins of Babylon (making many important sketches), Baghdad, Mosul and Aleppo. He seems also to have visited the Behistun Inscription in around 1764. After a visit to Cyprus he made a tour through Palestine, crossed the Taurus Mountains to Bursa, reached Constantinople in February 1767 and finally arrived in Copenhagen in the following November. Map of Yemen, prepared by Niebuhr Niebuhr's production during the expedition is indeed impressive. It includes small-scale maps and charts of Yemen, the Red Sea, the Persian Gulf and Oman, and other larger scale maps covering the Nile Delta, the Gulf of Suez and the regions surrounding various port cities he visited, including Mocha and Surat. He completed 28 town plans of significant historical value because of their uniqueness for that period. In summary, Niebuhr's maps, charts and plans constitute the greatest single addition to the cartography of the region that was produced through field research and published in the 18th century.Baack, Lawrence J. Undying curiosity. Carsten Niebuhr and the Royal Danish Expedition to Arabia (1761-1767). Stuttgart, 2014 Family and later career In 1773 Niebuhr married Christiane Sophia Blumenberg, the daughter of the crown physician, and for some years he held a post in the Danish military service, which enabled him to remain in Copenhagen. In 1776 he was elected a foreign member of the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences. In 1778 he accepted a position in the civil service of Danish Holstein, and went to reside at Meldorf (Ditmarschen). In 1806 he was promoted to Etatsrat, and in 1809 was made a Knight of the Order of the Dannebrog, one of Denmark-Norway's most valued honours for service. Writing and research Niebuhr's first book, Beschreibung von Arabien, was published in Copenhagen in 1772, the Danish government providing subsidies for the engraving and printing of its numerous illustrations. This was followed in 1774 and 1778 by the first two volumes of Niebuhr's Reisebeschreibung nach Arabien und andern umliegender L√§ndern. These works (particularly the one published in 1778), and most specifically the accurate copies of the cuneiform inscriptions found at Persepolis, were to prove to be extremely important to the decipherment of cuneiform writing. Before Niebuhr's publication, cuneiform inscriptions were often thought to be merely decorations and embellishments, and no accurate decipherments or translations had been made up to that point. Niebuhr demonstrated that the three trilingual inscriptions found at Persepolis were in fact three distinct forms of cuneiform writing (which he termed Class I, Class II, and Class III) to be read from left to right. His accurate copies of the trilingual inscriptions gave Orientalists the key to finally crack the cuneiform code, leading to the discovery of Old Persian, Akkadian, and Sumerian.Kramer,Samuel Noah. The Sumerians: Their History, Culture and Character. University of Chicago Press, 1963 The third volume of the Reisebeschreibung, also based on materials from the expedition, was not published till 1837, long after Niebuhr's death, under the editorship of his daughter and his assistant, Johan Nicolaus Gloyer. Niebuhr also contributed papers on the interior of Africa, the political and military condition of the Ottoman Empire, and other subjects to a German periodical, the Deutsches Museum. In addition, he edited and published the work of his friend Peter Forssk√•l, the naturalist on the Arabian expedition, under the titles Descriptiones animalium, Flora Aegyptiaco-Arabica and Icones rerum naturalium (Copenhagen, 1775 and 1776). French and Dutch translations of Niebuhr's narratives were published during his lifetime, and a condensed English translation of his own three volumes, prepared by Robert Heron, was published in Edinburgh in 1792, under the title \\"Travels through Arabia\\". A facsimile edition of this translation, as by \\"M. Niebuhr\\", was published in two volumes by the Libraire du Liban, Beirut (undated). The government funds covered only a fraction of the printing costs for Niebuhr's first book, and probably a similar or smaller proportion of the costs for the other two volumes. To ensure that the volumes were published, Niebuhr had to pay over 80% of the costs himself. In all, Niebuhr devoted ten years of his life, the years 1768-1778, to the publication of six volumes of findings from the expedition. He had virtually no help from the academics who had conceived and shaped the expedition in G√∂ttingen and Copenhagen. It was only Niebuhr's determination to publish the findings of the expedition that ensured that the Danish Arabia Expedition would produce results that would benefit the world of scholarship.Baack, Lawrence J. Undying curiosity. Carsten Niebuhr and the Royal Danish Expedition to Arabia (1761-1767). Stuttgart, 2014 Death and legacy Niebuhr died in Meldorf in 1815. Johann Wolfgang von Goethe (1749-1832) highly prized Niebuhr's works. In 1811 he wrote to Niebuhr's son, Barthold Georg Niebuhr, that \\"You carry a name which I have learned to honour since my youth.\\" Carsten Niebuhrs Gade, a street in the port area of Copenhagen, is named for him.

It commanded Army Ground Forces (AGF), United States Army Air Forces (USAAF), and Army Service Forces (ASF) operations north of Italy and the Mediterranean coast. It was bordered to the south by the North African Theater of Operations, United States Army (NATOUSA), which later became the Mediterranean Theater of Operations, United States Army (MTOUSA). The term theater of operations was defined in the US Army field manuals as the land and sea areas to be invaded or defended, including areas necessary for administrative activities incident to the military operations. In accordance with the experience of World War I, it was usually conceived of as a large land mass over which continuous operations would take place and was divided into two chief areas-the combat zone, or the area of active fighting, and the Communications Zone, or area required for administration of the theater. As the armies advanced, both these zones and the areas into which they were divided would shift forward to new geographic areas of control. History British‚ÄìAmerican military staffs agreed during their meetings in Washington in January‚ÄìMarch 1941 (the ABC-1 Conversations) to exchange military missions to facilitate planning for the eventuality of American entry in the war.Ray S. Cline, Washington Command Post: The Operations Division, Appendix B: U.S. Army Commanders in Major Theater Commands, December 1941 ‚Äì September 1945, via HyperWar, accessed March 2012 Major General James E. Chaney, an Army Air Corps officer, arrived in the United Kingdom on 18 May 1941, and on the following day, Headquarters, Special Observer Group (SPOBS), was established in London.James E. Chaney 1908 SPOBS also had the role of studying British use of Lend Lease supplies. His formal title was the Special Army Observer in the United Kingdom and head of SPOBS. After the United States entered the war, SPOBS was succeeded by United States Army Forces in the British Isles (USAFBI), actually SPOBS under a new name. At the time of the ARCADIA Conference, December 1941 ‚Äì January 1942, the decision was made to place the MAGNET forces (U.S. Forces for Northern Ireland) under the command of Maj. Gen. E.L. Daley, and make him in turn responsible to General Chaney, designated as CG, USAFBI. On 5 May 1942, Maj. Gen. John C. H. Lee became Commanding General, Services of Supply, U.S. Army Forces British Isles, and later deputy theater commander, ETOUSA. On 8 June 1942, the United States Department of War officially established ETOUSA in its place. Its mission was to conduct planning for the eventual retaking of Europe and to exercise administrative and operational control over U.S. forces. The 133rd Infantry Regiment of the 34th Infantry Division was the first United States Army unit sent to Europe in World War II. The first battalion arrived in Belfast in late January 1942, followed by the rest of the regiment in February. These units were designated as U.S. Army Northern Ireland Forces, later incorporated within the European Theater of Operations. The 133rd and 168th Infantry Regiments trained in the peat bogs, and performed border guard patrols between British Northern Ireland and the neutral Irish Free State. The remaining unit of the division, the 135th Infantry Regiment, arrived in May 1942. Typical organization of a theater of operations, 1940. From February 1944 the operational command was the Supreme Headquarters Allied Expeditionary Force (SHAEF) which as an Allied command also had operational control of British and all other allied land forces and tactical airforces in the European theatre. Until SHAEF was operational ETOUSA liaised closely with the British in the planning and organising of Operation Overlord. U.S. General Dwight D. Eisenhower had multiple command appointments; he replaced Chaney in late June 1942, but in November he also commanded the Allied forces in Operation Torch through AFHQ. Operation Torch‚Äîthe invasion of French North Africa‚Äîinvolving the 9th, 3rd Infantry and the 2nd Armored Divisions, initiated on 8 November 1942, was the first ground combat operations for the United States in World War II.American \\"observers\\" had participated in the Dieppe Raid in August 1942 Eisenhower then relinquished command of ETOUSA to Lt. Gen. Frank M. Andrews in February 1943, who was killed in an air crash in May. He was replaced by Lt. Gen. Jacob L. Devers, former Chief of the Armored Force. In December 1943 it was announced that Eisenhower would be Supreme Allied Commander in Europe. In January 1944 he resumed command of ETOUSA and the following month was officially designated as the Supreme Commander of the Allied Expeditionary Forces. (Note that Supreme Headquarters of the Allied Expeditionary Forces (SHAEF) was the headquarters of the Commander of the Allied Expeditionary Forces, whereas the AFHQ was the headquarters of only the Allied forces.) He served in a dual role until the end of hostilities in Europe in May 1945. From February 1944, SHAEF was the operational command and ETOUSA administrative command. Some units were transferred between operational commands and administrative commands at different times. For example, the American 6th Army Group, which was set up under the Mediterranean Theater of Operations to oversee Operation Dragoon, the invasion of Southern France between Toulon and Cannes, was passed to SHAEF (and into ETO) a month after the invasion which took place on 15 August 1944. By the end of 1944, Eisenhower, through SHAEF, commanded three powerful Allied army groups. In the north British 21st Army Group commanded by Field Marshal Bernard Montgomery (\\"Monty\\"), in the middle the American 12th Army Group commanded by General Omar N. Bradley, and in the South the American 6th Army Group commanded by Devers. The British 21st Army Group and French elements of the 6th Army Group were not part of ETOUSA, but by that stage of the war most of the operational forces under the command of SHAEF were American. The ETOUSA planning staff in London was usually referred to by its Army Post Office number, \\"APO 887\\". After the war in Europe ended on May 8, 1945, ETOUSA became briefly U.S. Armed Forces Europe, then U.S. Forces, European Theater (USFET), and then, eventually, United States Army Europe. Albert Coady Wedemeyer was chief author of the Victory Program, published three months before the U.S. entered the war in 1941, which advocated the defeat of the German armies on the European continent. When the U.S. entered the war after the Japanese bombed Pearl Harbor on 7 December 1941 and the U.S. was at war with both Japan and Germany, a \\"Europe first\\" a modified version of his plan was adopted by U.S. President Franklin D. Roosevelt and British Prime Minister Winston Churchill. Under the German first policy, the plan was expanded to include the blueprint for the Normandy landings. Successor organizations ETOUSA became United States Forces European Theater (USFET) from 1 July 1945 to 15 March 1947; and then European Command (EUCOM) 15 March 1947 to 1 August 1952. On August 1, 1952 the United States European Command (USEUCOM) was established with General Matthew Ridgway in command. Ridgway served concurrently as the [Supreme Allied Commander for Europe for NATO. USEUCOM absorbed all functions and elements of EUCOM and additionally assumed control of all US Air Force and US Navy forces in Europe.

Federal districts often include capital districts, and they exist in various federations worldwide. United States The seat of the U.S. federal government in Washington is located in a federal district called the District of Columbia. Other federally administered areas that are within one of the 50 states, but not under its jurisdiction, are called federal enclaves. Additionally, the U.S. federal court system divides each state, the District of Columbia, and Puerto Rico into one or more federal judicial districts. A United States district court and a bankruptcy court are located in each. There are also regional federal judicial circuits, each consisting of a group of states (except for the District of Columbia Circuit, which consists of the federal district, and the Federal Circuit, whose jurisdiction is based on specific subject matter instead of geography); Puerto Rico and the United States territorial courts are also assigned to circuits. Each circuit has a United States court of appeals. Latin America The term , meaning Federal District in both Portuguese and Spanish, is used to refer to: * Federal District (Brazil), where the Brazilian capital Bras√≠lia is located. * Capital District (Venezuela), where the Venezuelan capital Caracas is located. * former Federal District (Argentina), was converted into the Autonomous City of Buenos Aires in 1994. * former Federal District (Mexico), was converted into Mexico City in January 2016. Africa The Federal Capital Territory is a federal territory in central Nigeria. Abuja, the capital city of Nigeria, is located in this territory. The Federal Capital Territory was formed in 1976 from parts of the states of Nasarawa, Niger and Kogi. It is within in the Middle Belt region of the country. It is administered by the Federal Capital Territory Administration, headed by a minister appointed by the President. South and Southeast Asia In Malaysia, the term Federal Territory () is used for the three territories governed directly by the federal government: Kuala Lumpur (national capital), Putrajaya (federal government administrative centre) and Labuan (international offshore financial centre). In India, the term Union Territory is used for the nine territories governed directly by the central government with its own Chief minister and Lieutenant Governor: Andaman and Nicobar Islands, Chandigarh, Dadra and Nagar Haveli, Daman and Diu, Delhi, Jammu and Kashmir, Ladakh, Lakshadweep and Puducherry. Of these, Delhi and Puducherry possess partial statehood with their own elected chief ministers. In Pakistan, the term Federal Territory is used for the five zones and 12 union councils of Islamabad governed directly by the state government as Islamabad Capital Territory. Australia The Australian Capital Territory is an enclave within the state of New South Wales. It contains Canberra, the capital of Australia. Russia Russia has three cities of federal significance, established by the Constitution ‚Äî Moscow, Saint Petersburg and Sevastopol ( part of Ukraine, occupied by Russia). Each city is treated as a separate federal subject and has its own legislative body. Russia has federal districts, but these form an additional administrative layer between the federation government and the federal subjects rather than being a distinct type of jurisdiction.

Early life and education Ernest Wiseman, born in Bramley (a district of Leeds) to Harry and Connie Wiseman (n√©e Wright) who married in St Thomas Stanningley, was the eldest of five children, and changed his surname (as did his future partner) to go into show business. He attended Thorpe Infant and Junior School, and then East Ardsley Boys' School, but entered the entertainment industry in 1933, appearing as an actor and singer in music hall. His father, Harry, a railway lamp man, was also a semi-professional singer, and they appeared together under the name \\"Bert Carson and his Little Wonder\\". He started making solo appearances‚Äîsinging, dancing, and telling jokes‚Äîin 1936, and in the autumn of 1938 he came to the attention of Bryan Michie, a leading juvenile talent spotter, who recommended him to the impresario Jack Hylton. Working with Hylton, Wise made his television debut on the BBC TV Jack Hylton show on 15 March 1939. Performing career In 1940, the year he met Eric Morecambe, then known as Eric Bartholomew, he appeared with British comedian Arthur Askey in his Band Waggon radio show, billed as Britain's Mickey Rooney. Gradually, Wise and Morecambe formed a close friendship, and, in 1941, they began their comedy double act, which was to last until Morecambe's death in 1984. They made their debut together as \\"Bartholomew and Wise\\" on Thursday 28 August 1941, at the Liverpool Empire. A change of name followed in the autumn: after agreeing that the combination of their respective places of birth‚ÄîMorecambe and Leeds‚Äîwould make the act sound too much like a cheap day return, they settled on \\"Morecambe and Wise\\". Both continued to work in theatre comedy during the Second World War until 1943, when Morecambe went down a coal mine at Accrington (as a Bevin Boy) and Wise served in the Merchant Navy. They reunited after the war and made their name in radio, transferring to television in April 1954‚Äîalthough their first TV series, Running Wild, was unsuccessful. In 1961, they gained their own series on ATV, which was a success and raised their profile. They transferred to the BBC in 1968. Over a period of more than twenty years, Morecambe and Wise had regular series with both ITV and BBC. In 1976, they were both appointed OBEs. Wise was commonly regarded as the straight man of the partnership, although his role gradually and subtly changed over the years. When Eddie Braben took over as their chief writer, he enriched Wise's persona by making him pompous and naive. Wise's character changed from being a conventional straight man into a pretentious and self-satisfied buffoon. Braben also made Wise a would-be writer; their BBC shows in the 1970s would always climax with an extended sketch, introduced by Wise as \\"a play what I wrote.\\" It was in such a 'play' that Glenda Jackson, at the height of her career, was made to speak the line \\"All men are fools, and what makes them so is having beauty like what I have got.\\" Later years After Morecambe's death from a third heart attack on 28 May 1984, Ernie Wise spent some of his time at Boca Raton, Florida, where he had a holiday home. In the UK, he lived in Thorpe Avenue, Peterborough for many years next door to singer Edmund Hockridge, before moving to a luxury home on the banks of the River Thames in Maidenhead, Berkshire. On 1 January 1985 he made what at the time was said to have been the first public mobile phone call in the UK, from St Katharine Docks, East London, to Vodafone's Headquarters in Newbury, Berkshire. In 2015, it was reported that the actual first call was made a few hours earlier by Michael Harrison to his father Sir Ernest Harrison, chairman of Vodafone. Wise appeared regularly as a panellist on the ITV revival of the popular panel show What's My Line? He was a guest several times on Countdown, had a gardening column in the News of the World newspaper and also appeared in several West End plays. He gave talks on cruises about his life and career. In 1989, he made a guest appearance in Rainbow Series 17, Episode 1276. He wrote his autobiography, Still on My Way to Hollywood, in 1990. He also was the subject on This Is Your Life, which was transmitted on Boxing Day that year. His 1992 Christmas single was a recommended retail release in Music Week. Wise was also an active and long-time participant in the Keep Britain Tidy campaign. On 14 May 1994, the BBC aired the first of three episodes of a mini- series called Bring Me Sunshine, as a tribute to Eric Morecambe. It was hosted by Ben Elton, who is a huge fan of Morecambe and Wise, and who cites the duo as a big influence on his career. Those interviewed were John Thaw, Roy Castle, who was to die later that year, Diana Rigg, Hale and Pace and Fry and Laurie. Wise was not asked to participate, as the BBC said that they did not want \\"too many talking heads\\". He was, however, recovering from a minor stroke which he had suffered in December 1993. Wise suffered a second minor stroke in August 1995, and as a result, announced his retirement from show business on 27 November 1995, his 70th birthday. In August 1998, Wise was asked by the BBC to take part in Bring Me Sunshine: The Heart and Soul of Eric Morecambe, which was shown on 23 December that year. He had agreed to do so, but then his health had begun to deteriorate further. Earlier that month, Wise suffered two heart attacks within a week while on holiday, and had to undergo a triple heart bypass in Fort Lauderdale, Florida, on 22 January 1999. In March 1999, he was flown back to RAF Northolt, in London, by air ambulance and taken directly to the Nuffield Hospital at Wexham, Buckinghamshire. Death Ernie Wise died from heart failure and a chest infection at the Nuffield Hospital, Wexham, near Slough, on the morning of 21 March 1999. His funeral was on 30 March at Slough crematorium. The eulogy was read by Michael Grade. Marion Montgomery, Rolf Harris, Angela Rippon and Frank Bough were among those who attended, along with the family of Eric Morecambe.

While there is no generally agreed upon definition of personality, most theories focus on motivation and psychological interactions with one's environment. Trait-based personality theories, such as those defined by Raymond Cattell, define personality as the traits that predict a person's behavior. On the other hand, more behaviorally-based approaches define personality through learning and habits. Nevertheless, most theories view personality as relatively stable. The study of the psychology of personality, called personality psychology, attempts to explain the tendencies that underlie differences in behavior. Many approaches have been taken on to study personality, including biological, cognitive, learning and trait-based theories, as well as psychodynamic, and humanistic approaches. Personality psychology is divided among the first theorists, with a few influential theories being posited by Sigmund Freud, Alfred Adler, Gordon Allport, Hans Eysenck, Abraham Maslow, and Carl Rogers. Measuring Personality can be determined through a variety of tests. Due to the fact that personality is a complex idea, the dimensions of personality and scales of personality tests vary and often are poorly defined. Two main tools to measure personality are objective tests and projective measures. Examples of such tests are the: Big Five Inventory (BFI), Minnesota Multiphasic Personality Inventory (MMPI-2), Rorschach Inkblot test, Neurotic Personality Questionnaire KON-2006, or Eysenck's Personality Questionnaire (EPQ-R). All of these tests are beneficial because they have both reliability and validity, two factors that make a test accurate. \\"Each item should be influenced to a degree by the underlying trait construct, giving rise to a pattern of positive intercorrelations so long as all items are oriented (worded) in the same direction.\\" A recent, but not well-known, measuring tool that psychologists use is the 16PF. It measures personality based on Cattell's 16 factor theory of personality. Psychologists also use it as a clinical measuring tool to diagnose psychiatric disorders and help with prognosis and therapy planning. Personality is often broken into factors or dimensions, statistically extracted from large questionnaires through Factor analysis. When brought back to two dimensions, often the dimensions of introvert-extrovert and neuroticism (emotionally unstable- stable) are used as first proposed by Eysenck in the 1960s. =Five-factor inventory= The big five personality traitsMany factor analyses found what is called the Big Five, which are openness to experience, conscientiousness, extraversion, agreeableness, and neuroticism (or emotional stability). These components are generally stable over time, and about half of the variance appears to be attributable to a person's genetics rather than the effects of one's environment. The advantage of the Big five is that it expands across different elemental factors in personality, allowing psychologists to have the most accurate information they can garner. The Big Five Inventory is the most used measuring tool. Some research has investigated whether the relationship between happiness and extraversion seen in adults can also be seen in children. The implications of these findings can help identify children that are more likely to experience episodes of depression and develop types of treatment that such children are likely to respond to. In both children and adults, research shows that genetics, as opposed to environmental factors, exert a greater influence on happiness levels. Personality is not stable over the course of a lifetime, but it changes much more quickly during childhood, so personality constructs in children are referred to as temperament. Temperament is regarded as the precursor to personality. Whereas McCrae and Costa's Big Five model assesses personality traits in adults, the EAS (emotionality, activity, and sociability) model is used to assess temperament in children. This model measures levels of emotionality, activity, sociability, and shyness in children. The personality theorists consider temperament EAS model similar to the Big Five model in adults; however, this might be due to a conflation of concepts of personality and temperament as described above. Findings show that high degrees of sociability and low degrees of shyness are equivalent to adult extraversion, and correlate with higher levels of life satisfaction in children. Another interesting finding has been the link found between acting extraverted and positive affect. Extraverted behaviors include acting talkative, assertive, adventurous, and outgoing. For the purposes of this study, positive affect is defined as experiences of happy and enjoyable emotions. This study investigated the effects of acting in a way that is counter to a person's dispositional nature. In other words, the study focused on the benefits and drawbacks of introverts (people who are shy, socially inhibited and non-aggressive) acting extraverted, and of extraverts acting introverted. After acting extraverted, introverts' experience of positive affect increased whereas extraverts seemed to experience lower levels of positive affect and suffered from the phenomenon of ego depletion. Ego depletion, or cognitive fatigue, is the use of one's energy to overtly act in a way that is contrary to one's inner disposition. When people act in a contrary fashion, they divert most, if not all, (cognitive) energy toward regulating this foreign style of behavior and attitudes. Because all available energy is being used to maintain this contrary behavior, the result is an inability to use any energy to make important or difficult decisions, plan for the future, control or regulate emotions, or perform effectively on other cognitive tasks. One question that has been posed is why extraverts tend to be happier than introverts. The two types of explanations attempt to account for this difference are instrumental theories and temperamental theories. The instrumental theory suggests that extraverts end up making choices that place them in more positive situations and they also react more strongly than introverts to positive situations. The temperamental theory suggests that extraverts have a disposition that generally leads them to experience a higher degree of positive affect. In their study of extraversion, Lucas and Baird found no statistically significant support for the instrumental theory but did, however, find that extraverts generally experience a higher level of positive affect. Research has been done to uncover some of the mediators that are responsible for the correlation between extraversion and happiness. Self-esteem and self-efficacy are two such mediators. Self-efficacy is one's belief about abilities to perform up to personal standards, the ability to produce desired results, and the feeling of having some ability to make important life decisions. Self- efficacy has been found to be related to the personality traits of extraversion and subjective well-being. Self-efficacy, however, only partially mediates the relationship between extraversion (and neuroticism) and subjective happiness. This implies that there are most likely other factors that mediate the relationship between subjective happiness and personality traits. Self-esteem may be another similar factor. Individuals with a greater degree of confidence about themselves and their abilities seem to have both higher degrees of subjective well-being and higher levels of extraversion. Other research has examined the phenomenon of mood maintenance as another possible mediator. Mood maintenance is the ability to maintain one's average level of happiness in the face of an ambiguous situation ‚Äì meaning a situation that has the potential to engender either positive or negative emotions in different individuals. It has been found to be a stronger force in extraverts. This means that the happiness levels of extraverted individuals are less susceptible to the influence of external events. This finding implies that extraverts' positive moods last longer than those of introverts. Developmental biological model Modern conceptions of personality, such as the Temperament and Character Inventory have suggested four basic temperaments that are thought to reflect basic and automatic responses to danger and reward that rely on associative learning. The four temperaments, harm avoidance, reward dependence, novelty seeking and persistence are somewhat analogous to ancient conceptions of melancholic, sanguine, choleric, phlegmatic personality types, although the temperaments reflect dimensions rather than distance categories. While factor based approaches to personality have yielded models that account for significant variance, the developmental biological model has been argued to better reflect underlying biological processes. Distinct genetic, neurochemical and neuroanatomical correlates responsible for each temperamental trait have been observed, unlike with five factor models. The harm avoidance trait has been associated with increased reactivity in insular and amygdala salience networks, as well as reduced 5-HT2 receptor binding peripherally, and reduced GABA concentrations. Novelty seeking has been associated with reduced activity in insular salience networks increased striatal connectivity. Novelty seeking correlates with dopamine synthesis capacity in the striatum, and reduced auto receptor availability in the midbrain. Reward dependence has been linked with the oxytocin system, with increased concentration of plasma oxytocin being observed, as well as increased volume in oxytocin related regions of the hypothalamus. Persistence has been associated with increased striatal-mPFC connectivity, increased activation of ventral striatal-orbitofrontal-anterior cingulate circuits, as well as increased salivary amylase levels indicative of increased noradrenergic tone.  Environmental influences  It has been shown that personality traits are more malleable by environmental influences than researchers originally believed. Personality differences predict the occurrence of life experiences. One study that has shown how the home environment, specifically the types of parents a person has, can affect and shape their personality. Mary Ainsworth's Strange Situation experiment showcased how babies reacted to having their mother leave them alone in a room with a stranger. The different styles of attachment, labelled by Ainsworth, were Secure, Ambivalent, avoidant, and disorganized. Children who were securely attached tend to be more trusting, sociable, and are confident in their day-to-day life. Children who were disorganized were reported to have higher levels of anxiety, anger, and risk-taking behavior. Judith Rich Harris's group socialization theory postulates that an individual's peer groups, rather than parental figures, are the primary influence of personality and behavior in adulthood. Intra- and intergroup processes, not dyadic relationships such as parent-child relationships, are responsible for the transmission of culture and for environmental modification of children's personality characteristics. Thus, this theory points at the peer group representing the environmental influence on a child's personality rather than the parental style or home environment. Tessuya Kawamoto's Personality Change from Life Experiences: Moderation Effect of Attachment Security talked about laboratory tests. The study mainly focused on the effects of life experiences on change in personality on and life experiences. The assessments suggested that \\"the accumulation of small daily experiences may work for the personality development of university students and that environmental influences may vary by individual susceptibility to experiences, like attachment security\\". Cross-cultural studies There has been some recent debate over the subject of studying personality in a different culture. Some people think that personality comes entirely from culture and therefore there can be no meaningful study in cross-culture study. On the other hand, many believe that some elements are shared by all cultures and an effort is being made to demonstrate the cross-cultural applicability of \\"the Big Five\\". Cross-cultural assessment depends on the universality of personality traits, which is whether there are common traits among humans regardless of culture or other factors. If there is a common foundation of personality, then it can be studied on the basis of human traits rather than within certain cultures. This can be measured by comparing whether assessment tools are measuring similar constructs across countries or cultures. Two approaches to researching personality are looking at emic and etic traits. Emic traits are constructs unique to each culture, which are determined by local customs, thoughts, beliefs, and characteristics. Etic traits are considered universal constructs, which establish traits that are evident across cultures that represent a biological bases of human personality.McCrae, R.R., & Allik, I.U. (2002). The five-factor model of personality across cultures. Springer Science & Business Media. If personality traits are unique to individual culture, then different traits should be apparent in different cultures. However, the idea that personality traits are universal across cultures is supported by establishing the Five Factor Model of personality across multiple translations of the NEO- PI-R, which is one of the most widely used personality measures. When administering the NEO-PI-R to 7,134 people across six languages, the results show a similar pattern of the same five underlying constructs that are found in the American factor structure. Similar results were found using the Big Five Inventory (BFI), as it was administered in 56 nations across 28 languages. The five factors continued to be supported both conceptually and statistically across major regions of the world, suggesting that these underlying factors are common across cultures. There are some differences across culture but they may be a consequence of using a lexical approach to study personality structures, as language has limitations in translation and different cultures have unique words to describe emotion or situations. For example, the term \\"feeling blue\\" is used to describe sadness in more Westernized cultures, but does not translate to other languages. Differences across cultures could be due to real cultural differences, but they could also be consequences of poor translations, biased sampling, or differences in response styles across cultures. Examining personality questionnaires developed within a culture can also be useful evidence for the universality of traits across cultures, as the same underlying factors can still be found. Results from several European and Asian studies have found overlapping dimensions with the Five Factor Model as well as additional culture-unique dimensions. Finding similar factors across cultures provides support for the universality of personality trait structure, but more research is necessary to gain stronger support. Historical development of concept The modern sense of individual personality is a result of the shifts in culture originating in the Renaissance, an essential element in modernity. In contrast, the Medieval European's sense of self was linked to a network of social roles: \\"the household, the kinship network, the guild, the corporation ‚Äì these were the building blocks of personhood\\". Stephen Greenblatt observes, in recounting the recovery (1417) and career of Lucretius' poem De rerum natura: \\"at the core of the poem lay key principles of a modern understanding of the world.\\" \\"Dependent on the family, the individual alone was nothing,\\" Jacques G√©lis observes. \\"The characteristic mark of the modern man has two parts: one internal, the other external; one dealing with his environment, the other with his attitudes, values, and feelings.\\" Rather than being linked to a network of social roles, the modern man is largely influenced by the environmental factors such as: \\"urbanization, education, mass communication, industrialization, and politicization.\\" Temperament and philosophy William James (1842‚Äì1910) William James (1842‚Äì1910) argued that temperament explains a great deal of the controversies in the history of philosophy by arguing that it is a very influential premise in the arguments of philosophers. Despite seeking only impersonal reasons for their conclusions, James argued, the temperament of philosophers influenced their philosophy. Temperament thus conceived is tantamount to a bias. Such bias, James explained, was a consequence of the trust philosophers place in their own temperament. James thought the significance of his observation lay on the premise that in philosophy an objective measure of success is whether a philosophy is peculiar to its philosopher or not, and whether a philosopher is dissatisfied with any other way of seeing things or not. = Mental make-up = James argued that temperament may be the basis of several divisions in academia, but focused on philosophy in his 1907 lectures on Pragmatism. In fact, James' lecture of 1907 fashioned a sort of trait theory of the empiricist and rationalist camps of philosophy. As in most modern trait theories, the traits of each camp are described by James as distinct and opposite, and may be possessed in different proportions on a continuum, and thus characterize the personality of philosophers of each camp. The \\"mental make-up\\" (i.e. personality) of rationalist philosophers is described as \\"tender-minded\\" and \\"going by \\"principles,\\" and that of empiricist philosophers is described as \\"tough- minded\\" and \\"going by \\"facts.\\" James distinguishes each not only in terms of the philosophical claims they made in 1907, but by arguing that such claims are made primarily on the basis of temperament. Furthermore, such categorization was only incidental to James' purpose of explaining his pragmatist philosophy, and is not exhaustive. =Empiricists and rationalists= John Locke (1632‚Äì1704) According to James, the temperament of rationalist philosophers differed fundamentally from the temperament of empiricist philosophers of his day. The tendency of rationalist philosophers toward refinement and superficiality never satisfied an empiricist temper of mind. Rationalism leads to the creation of closed systems, and such optimism is considered shallow by the fact-loving mind, for whom perfection is far off. Rationalism is regarded as pretension, and a temperament most inclined to abstraction. The temperament of rationalists, according to James, led to sticking with logic. Empiricists, on the other hand, stick with the external senses rather than logic. British empiricist John Locke's (1632‚Äì1704) explanation of personal identity provides an example of what James referred to. Locke explains the identity of a person, i.e. personality, on the basis of a precise definition of identity, by which the meaning of identity differs according to what it is being applied to. The identity of a person, is quite distinct from the identity of a man, woman, or substance according to Locke. Locke concludes that consciousness is personality because it \\"always accompanies thinking, it is that which makes every one to be what he calls self,\\" and remains constant in different places at different times. Thus his explanation of personal identity is in terms of experience as James indeed maintained is the case for most empiricists. Benedictus Spinoza (1632‚Äì1677) Rationalists conceived of the identity of persons differently than empiricists such as Locke who distinguished identity of substance, person, and life. According to Locke, Rene Descartes (1596‚Äì1650) agreed only insofar as he did not argue that one immaterial spirit is the basis of the person \\"for fear of making brutes thinking things too.\\" According to James, Locke tolerated arguments that a soul was behind the consciousness of any person. However, Locke's successor David Hume (1711‚Äì1776), and empirical psychologists after him denied the soul except for being a term to describe the cohesion of inner lives. However, some research suggests Hume excluded personal identity from his opus An Inquiry Concerning Human Understanding because he thought his argument was sufficient but not compelling. Descartes himself distinguished active and passive faculties of mind, each contributing to thinking and consciousness in different ways. The passive faculty, Descartes argued, simply receives, whereas the active faculty produces and forms ideas, but does not presuppose thought, and thus cannot be within the thinking thing. The active faculty mustn't be within self because ideas are produced without any awareness of them, and are sometimes produced against one's will. Rationalist philosopher Benedictus Spinoza (1632‚Äì1677) argued that ideas are the first element constituting the human mind, but existed only for actually existing things. In other words, ideas of non-existent things are without meaning for Spinoza, because an idea of a non-existent thing cannot exist. Further, Spinoza's rationalism argued that the mind does not know itself, except insofar as it perceives the \\"ideas of the modifications of body,\\" in describing its external perceptions, or perceptions from without. On the contrary, from within, Spinoza argued, perceptions connect various ideas clearly and distinctly. The mind is not the free cause of its actions for Spinoza. Spinoza equates the will with the understanding, and explains the common distinction of these things as being two different things as error which results from the individual's misunderstanding of the nature of thinking. Biology The biological basis of personality is the theory that anatomical structures located in the brain contribute to personality traits. This stems from neuropsychology, which studies how the structure of the brain relates to various psychological processes and behaviors. For instance, in human beings, the frontal lobes are responsible for foresight and anticipation, and the occipital lobes are responsible for processing visual information. In addition, certain physiological functions such as hormone secretion also affect personality. For example, the hormone testosterone is important for sociability, affectivity, aggressiveness, and sexuality. Additionally, studies show that the expression of a personality trait depends on the volume of the brain cortex it is associated with. There is also a confusion among some psychologists who conflate personality with temperament. Temperament traits that are based on weak neurochemical imbalances within neurotransmitter systems are much more stable, consistent in behavior and show up in early childhood; they can't be changed easily but can be compensated for in behavior. In contrast to that, personality traits and features are the product of the socio-cultural development of humans and can be learned and/or changed.  Personology  Personology confers a multidimensional, complex, and comprehensive approach to personality. According to Henry A. Murray, personology is From a holistic perspective, personology studies personality as a whole, as a system, but in the same time through all its components, levels and spheres.Murray, H.A. (1938). Explorations in Personality. New York: Oxford University Press.Strack, S. (2005). Handbook of Personology and Psychopathology. Wiley One of the theories that falls under this approach is the psychodynamic theory. This theory, created by Sigmund Freud, says that three mental structures determine our personality. These structures are the id, ego, and superego. The id is responsible for impulses, the superego for the idealized self and our moral code, and the ego for rational thought. Basically, it is the ego's job to satisfy the impulses of the id but also stay within the moral code of the superego. The ego uses defense mechanisms to protect one's mind from the conflictual ideas of the id and superego. These defense mechanisms work at the unconscious level and help a person deal with threatening events. These defense styles vary in adaptive value. So, a defense style that doesn't provide the appropriate change to the person so that they can deal with the threatening event usually suggests the repeated use of immature defenses, such as denial.

Footnotes References     sl:Vojna za Tihi ocean ","title":"Asiatic-Pacific Theater"},{"id":"177650","text":"Hans J√ºrgen Eysenck (; 4 March 1916 ‚Äì 4 September 1997) was a German-born British psychologist who spent his professional career in Great Britain. He is best remembered for his work on intelligence and personality, although he worked on other issues within psychology.Boyle, G.J., & Ortet, G. (1997). Hans Jurgen Eysenck: Obituario. Ansiedad y Estr√©s (Anxiety and Stress), 3, i-ii.Boyle, G.J. (2000). Obituaries: Raymond B. Cattell and Hans J. Eysenck. Multivariate Experimental Clinical Research, 12, i-vi. At the time of his death, Eysenck was the living psychologist most frequently cited in the peer- reviewed scientific journal literature. A 2019 study found him to be the third most controversial of 55 intelligence researchers. Eysenck's research purported to show that certain personality types had an elevated risk of cancer and heart disease. Scholars have identified errors and suspected data manipulation in Eysenck's work, and large replications have failed to confirm the relationships that he purported to find. An enquiry on behalf of King's College London found the papers by Eysenck to be \\"incompatible with modern clinical science\\". In 2019, 26 of his papers (all coauthored with Ronald Grossarth-Maticek) were considered \\"unsafe\\" by an enquiry on behalf of King's College London. 14 of his papers were retracted in 2020, and journals issued 64 statements of concern about publications by him. Rod Buchanan, a biographer of Eysenck, has argued that 87 publications by Eysenck should be retracted. Life With his wife Sybil Eysenck was born in Berlin, Germany. His mother was Silesian-born film star Helga Molander, and his father, Eduard Anton Eysenck, was an actor and nightclub entertainer who was once voted \\"handsomest man on the Baltic coast\\".Eysenck, H. J., Rebel with a Cause (an Autobiography), London: W. H. Allen & Co., 1990 (pp. 8‚Äì11). His mother was Lutheran and father Catholic. Eysenck was brought up by his maternal grandmother. (His grandmother was a fervent Lutheran, but after she died in a concentration camp, Eysenck ascertained that she had come from a Jewish family.) An initial move to England in the 1930s became permanent because of his opposition to the Nazi party. \\"My hatred of Hitler and the Nazis, and all they stood for, was so overwhelming that no argument could counter it.\\" (p. 40) Because of his German citizenship, he was initially unable to gain employment, and was almost interned during the war. He received his PhD in 1940 from University College London (UCL) working in the Department of Psychology under the supervision of Professor Sir Cyril Burt, with whom he had a tumultuous professional relationship throughout his working life. Eysenck was Professor of Psychology at the Institute of Psychiatry, King's College London, from 1955 to 1983. He was a major contributor to the modern scientific theory of personality and a brilliant teacher who helped find treatment for mental illnesses.Behaviour Therapy and the Neurosis, edited by Hans Eysenck, London: Pergamon Press, 1960.Eysenck, Hans J., Experiments in Behaviour Therapy, London: Pergamon Press, 1964. Eysenck also created and developed a distinctive dimensional model of personality structure based on empirical factor-analytic research, attempting to anchor these factors in biogenetic variation. In 1981, Eysenck became a founding member of the World Cultural Council. He was the founding editor of the international journal Personality and Individual Differences, and wrote about 80 books and more than 1,600 journal articles. His son Michael Eysenck is also a psychology professor. Hans Eysenck died of a brain tumour in a London hospice in 1997. He was an atheist.Michael Martin (2007). The Cambridge Companion to Atheism. Cambridge University Press. p. 310. . \\"Among celebrity atheists with much biographical data, we find leading psychologists and psychoanalysts. We could provide a long list, including...Hans J√ºrgen Eysenck...\\" Views and their reception  Examples of publications in which Eysenck's views roused controversy include (chronologically): * A paper in the 1950s concluding that available data \\"fail to support the hypothesis that psychotherapy facilitates recovery from neurotic disorder\\". * A chapter in Uses and Abuses of Psychology (1953) entitled \\"What is wrong with psychoanalysis\\". * The Psychology of Politics (1954) * Race, Intelligence and Education (1971) (in the US: The IQ Argument). * Sex, Violence and the Media (1978). * Astrology ‚Äî Science or Superstition? (1982). * Decline and Fall of the Freudian Empire (1985). * Smoking, Personality and Stress (1991). Eysenck's attitude was summarised in his autobiography Rebel with a Cause: \\"I always felt that a scientist owes the world only one thing, and that is the truth as he sees it. If the truth contradicts deeply held beliefs, that is too bad. Tact and diplomacy are fine in international relations, in politics, perhaps even in business; in science only one thing matters, and that is the facts.\\" He was one of the signers of the Humanist Manifesto. =The Psychology of Politics= In this book, Eysenck suggests that political behavior may be analysed in terms of two independent dimensions: the traditional left-right distinction, and how 'tenderminded' or 'toughminded' a person is. Eysenck suggests that the latter is a result of a person's introversion or extraversion respectively. Colleagues critiqued the research that formed the basis of this book, on a number of grounds, including the following: * Eysenck claims that his findings can be applied to the British middle class as a whole, but the people in his sample were far younger and better educated than the British middle class as a whole. * Supporters of different parties were recruited in different ways: Communists were recruited through party branches, fascists in an unspecified manner, and supporters of other parties by giving copies of the questionnaire to his students and telling them to apply it to friends and acquaintances. * Scores were obtained by applying the same weight to groups of different sizes. For example, the responses of 250 middle-class supporters of the Liberal Party were given the same weight as those of 27 working-class Liberals. * Scores were rounded without explanation, in directions that supported Eysenck's theories.Altemeyer, Bob. Right Wing Authoritarianism (Manitoba: University of Manitoba Press, 1981) 80‚Äì91, . =Genetics and intelligence= Eysenck advocated a strong influence from genetics and race on IQ differences. Eysenck supported Arthur Jensen's questioning of whether variation in IQ between racial groups was entirely environmental.Eysenck, H. (1971). Race, Intelligence and Education. London: Maurice Temple Smith. In opposition to this position, Eysenck was punched in the face by a protester during a talk at the London School of Economics.Roger Pearson, Race, Intelligence and Bias in Academe, 2nd edition, Scott-Townsend (1997), , pp. 34‚Äì38. Eysenck also received bomb threats and threats to kill his young children.Scientist or showman? ‚Äì Archive ‚Äì Mail & Guardian Online Eysenck claimed that the media had given people the misleading impression that his views were outside the mainstream scientific consensus. Eysenck cited The IQ Controversy, the Media and Public Policy as showing that there was majority support for all of the main contentions he had put forward, and further claimed that there was no real debate about the matter among relevant scientists.Eysenck, Hans J., Rebel with a Cause (an Autobiography), London: W. H. Allen & Co., 1990, pp. 289‚Äì291.BBC television series Face To Face ‚Ä¢ Hans Eysenck ‚Äì broadcast 16 October 1990. Regarding this controversy, in 1988 S. A. Barnett described Eysenck as a \\"prolific popularizer\\" and he exemplified Eysenck's writings on this topic with two passages from his early 1970s books: Barnett quotes additional criticism of Race, Intelligence and Education from Sandra Scarr- Salapatek, who wrote in 1976 that Eysenck's book was \\"generally inflammatory\\" and that there \\"is something in this book to insult almost everyone except WASPs and Jews.\\" Scarr was equally critical of Eysenck's hypotheses, one of which was the supposition that slavery on plantations had selected African Americans as a less intelligent sub-sample of Africans. Scarr also criticised another statement of Eysenck on the alleged significantly lower IQs of Italian, Spanish, Portuguese and Greek immigrants in the US relative to the populations in their country of origin. \\"Although Eysenck is careful to say that these are not established facts (because no IQ tests were given to the immigrants or nonimmigrants in question?\\" Scarr writes that the careful reader would conclude that \\"Eysenck admits that scientific evidence to date does not permit a clear choice of the genetic-differences interpretation of black inferiority on intelligence tests,\\" whereas a \\"quick reading of the book, however, is sure to leave the reader believing that scientific evidence today strongly supports the conclusion that US blacks are genetically inferior to whites in IQ.\\" Some of Eysenck's later work was funded by the Pioneer Fund, an organization which promoted scientific racism.William H. Tucker, The Funding of Scientific Racism: Wickliffe Draper and the Pioneer Fund. University of Illinois Press, 2002. =Cancer-prone Personality= He also received funding for consultation research via the New York legal firm Jacob & Medinger, which was acting on behalf of the tobacco industry. Note that in a talk given in 1994 he mentions that he reached out to Reynolds for funding to continue research. Asked what he felt about tobacco industry lawyers being involved in selecting scientists for research projects, he said that research should be judged on its quality, not on who paid for it, adding that he had not personally profited from the funds.Example document here \\"Memorandum Regarding Professor Eysenck's Research Progress\\". According to the UK newspaper The Independent, Eysenck received more than ¬£800k in this way.Peter pringle, \\"Eysenck took pounds 800,000 tobacco funds\\", The Independent, 31 October 1996. Eysenck conducted many studies making claims about the role of personality in cigarette smoking and disease,Eysenck, H. J. et al. (1960). Smoking and personality. British Medical Journal, 1(5184), 1456-1460.Eysenck, H. J. (1964). Personality and cigarette smoking. Life Sciences, 3(7), 77-792. doi:10.1016/0024-3205(64)90033-5Eysenck, H. J. (1988). The respective importance of personality, cigarette smoking and interaction effects for the genesis of cancer and coronary heart disease. Personality and Individual Differences, 9(2), 453-464. doi:10.1016/0191-8869(88)90123-7 but he also said \\"I have no doubt, smoking is not a healthy habit.Roderick D. Buchanan: Playing with Fire: The Controversial Career of Hans J. Eysenck page 376. His article \\"Cancer, personality and stress: Prediction and prevention\\" very clearly defines Cancer-prone (Type C) personality. The science behind this claim has now come under public scrutiny in the 2019 King's College London enquiry (see below). =Genetics of personality= In 1951, Eysenck's first empirical study into the genetics of personality was published. It was an investigation carried out with his student and associate Donald Prell, from 1948 to 1951, in which identical (monozygotic) and fraternal (dizygotic) twins, ages 11 and 12, were tested for neuroticism. It is described in detail in an article published in the Journal of Mental Science. Eysenck and Prell concluded: \\"The factor of neuroticism is not a statistical artifact, but constitutes a biological unit which is inherited as a whole....neurotic predisposition is to a large extent hereditarily determined.\\"The Journal of Mental Health, July 1951, Vol. XCVII, \\"The Inheritance of Neuroticism: An Experimental Study\\", H. J. Eysenck and D. B. Prell, p. 402. = Model of personality= The two personality dimensions extraversion and neuroticism were described in his 1947 book Dimensions of Personality. It is common practice in personality psychology to refer to the dimensions by the first letters, E and N. E and N provided a two-dimensional space to describe individual differences in behaviour. Eysenck noted how these two dimensions were similar to the four personality types first proposed by the Greek physician Galen. * High N and high E = Choleric type * High N and low E = Melancholic type * Low N and high E = Sanguine type * Low N and low E = Phlegmatic type The third dimension, psychoticism, was added to the model in the late 1970s, based upon collaborations between Eysenck and his wife, Sybil B. G. Eysenck.H. J. Eysenck and S. B. G. Eysenck (1976). Psychoticism as a Dimension of Personality. London: Hodder & Stoughton. Eysenck's model attempted to provide detailed theory of the causes of personality.Eysenck, H. J. (1967). The Biological Basis of Personality. Springfield, IL: Thomas. For example, Eysenck proposed that extraversion was caused by variability in cortical arousal: \\"introverts are characterized by higher levels of activity than extraverts and so are chronically more cortically aroused than extraverts\\".(Eysenck & Eysenck, 1985) Similarly, Eysenck proposed that location within the neuroticism dimension was determined by individual differences in the limbic system.Thomas, Kerry. (2007). The individual differences approach to personality. In Mapping Psychology (p. 315). The Open University. While it seems counterintuitive to suppose that introverts are more aroused than extraverts, the putative effect this has on behaviour is such that the introvert seeks lower levels of stimulation. Conversely, the extravert seeks to heighten his or her arousal to a more favourable level (as predicted by the Yerkes-Dodson Law) by increased activity, social engagement and other stimulation-seeking behaviours. Comparison with other theories Jeffrey Alan Gray, a former student of Eysenck's, developed a comprehensive alternative theoretical interpretation (called Gray's biopsychological theory of personality) of the biological and psychological data studied by Eysenck ‚Äì leaning more heavily on animal and learning models. Currently, the most widely used model of personality is the Big Five model.Boyle, G. J. (2008). Critique of Five-Factor Model (FFM). In G. J. Boyle et al. (Eds.), The SAGE Handbook of Personality Theory and Assessment: Vol. 1 - Personality Theories and Models. Los Angeles, CA: Sage Publishers. The purported traits in the Big Five model are as follows: #Conscientiousness #Agreeableness #Neuroticism #Openness to experience #Extraversion Extraversion and neuroticism in the Big Five are very similar to Eysenck's traits of the same name. However, what he calls the trait of psychoticism corresponds to two traits in the Big Five model: conscientiousness and agreeableness (Goldberg & Rosalack 1994). Eysenck's personality system did not address openness to experience. He argued that his approach was a better description of personality.Eysenck, H. J. (1992). Four ways five factors are not basic. Personality and Individual Differences, 13(6), 667-673. =Psychometric scales = Eysenck's theory of personality is closely linked with the psychometric scales that he and his co-workers constructed.Furnham, A., Eysenck, S. B. G., & Saklofske, D. H. (2008). The Eysenck personality measures: Fifty years of scale development. In G.J. Boyle, G. Matthews, & D.H. Saklofske. (Eds.), The SAGE Handbook of Personality Theory and Assessment: Vol. 2 ‚Äì Personality Measurement and Testing (pp. 199-218). Los Angeles, CA: Sage Publishers. These included the Maudsley Personality Inventory (MPI), the Eysenck Personality Inventory (EPI), the Eysenck Personality Questionnaire (EPQ),Eysenck, H. J., & Eysenck, S. B. G. (1975). Manual of the Eysenck Personality Qyestionnaire (Junior and Adult). London: Hodder & Stoughton. as well as the revised version (EPQ-R) and its corresponding short-form (EPQ-R-S). The Eysenck Personality Profiler (EPP) breaks down different facets of each trait considered in the model.Eysenck, H. J., & Wilson, G. D. (1991). The Eysenck Personality Profiler. London: Corporate Assessment Network. There has been some debate about whether these facets should include impulsivity as a facet of extraversion as Eysenck declared in his early work, or of psychoticism, as he declared in his later work. = Publication in far right-wing press = Eysenck was accused of being a supporter of political causes on the extreme right. Connecting arguments were that Eysenck had articles published in the German newspaper National-Zeitung,Christina Schori-Liang. Europe for the Europeans: The Foreign and Security Policy of the Populist Radical Right. Ashgate 2007. p.160. which called him a contributor, and in Nation und Europa, and that he wrote the preface to a book by a far-right French writer named Pierre Krebs, Das unverg√§ngliche Erbe, that was published by Krebs' Thule Seminar. Linguist interpreted the preface to Krebs' book as having \\"railed against the equality of people, presenting it as an untenable ideological doctrine.\\" In the National Zeitung Eysenck reproached Sigmund Freud for alleged trickiness and lack of frankness.Siegfried J√§ger. \\"Der Singer-Diskurs sowie einige Bemerkungen zu seiner Funktion f√ºr die St√§rkung rassistischer und rechtsextremer Diskurse in der Bundesrepublik Deutschland \\". First appeared in Siegfried J√§ger and (1991). Von Menschen und Schweinen. Der Singer-Diskurs und seine Funktion f√ºr den Neo-Rassismus. Duisburg: Diss-Texte Nr. 13. p. 7-30. . Quotation: \\"Eysenck stellt sich zudem r√ºckhaltlos hinter rechtsextreme Theorie-Zirkel wie z.B. das Kasseler Thule-Seminar. Zu dem von dessen Leiter herausgegebenen Buch mit dem Titel \\"Das unverg√§ngliche Erbe\\" verfa√üte er das Vorwort, in dem er gegen die Gleichheit der Menschen wettert, indem er sie als \\"unhaltbare ideologische Doktrin\\" abtut. (in Krebs 1981, S. 12)\\" Other incidents that fuelled Eysenck's critics like Michael Billig and Steven Rose include the appearance of Eysenck's books on the UK National Front's list of recommended readings and an interview with Eysenck published by National Front's Beacon (1977) and later republished in the US neo-fascist Steppingstones; a similar interview had been published a year before by Neue Anthropologie, described by Eysenck's biographer Roderick Buchanan as a \\"sister publication to Mankind Quarterly, having similar contributors and sometimes sharing the same articles.\\" Eysenck also wrote an introduction for Roger Pearson's Race, Intelligence and Bias in Academe. In this introduction to Pearson's book, Eysenck retorts that his critics are \\"the scattered troops\\" of the New Left, who have adopted the \\"psychology of the fascists\\". Eysenck's book The Inequality of Man, translated in French as L'Inegalite de l'homme, was published by GRECE's publishing house, √âditions Corpernic. In 1974, Eysenck became a member of the academic advisory council of Mankind Quarterly, joining those associated with the journal in attempting to reinvent it as a more mainstream academic vehicle. referring to Billig asserts that in the same year Eysenck also became a member of the comit√© de patronage of GRECE's '.Michael Billig, (1979) Psychology, Racism, and Fascism, on-line edition Remarking on Eysenck's alleged right-wing connections, Buchanan writes: \\"For those looking to thoroughly demonize Eysenck, his links with far right groups revealed his true political sympathies.\\" According to Buchanan, these harsh critics interpreted Eysenck's writings as \\"overtly racist\\". Furthermore, Buchanan writes that Eysenck's fiercest critics were convinced that Eysenck was \\"willfully misrepresenting a dark political agenda\\". Buchanan argued that \\"There appeared to be no hidden agenda to Hans Eysenck. He was too self- absorbed, too preoccupied with his own aspirations as a great scientist to harbor specific political aims.\\" As Buchanan commented: According to Buchanan, Eysenck believed that the quality of his research would \\"help temper social wrongs and excesses\\". Eysenck's defence was that he did not shy away from publishing or being interviewed in controversial publications, and that he did not necessarily share their editorial viewpoint. As examples, Buchanan mentions contributions by Eysenck to pornographic magazines Mayfair and Penthouse. Eysenck described his views in the introduction to Race, Education and Intelligence: =Later work= In 1994, he was one of 52 signatories on \\"Mainstream Science on Intelligence\\",Gottfredson, Linda (13 December 1994). Mainstream Science on Intelligence. Wall Street Journal, p.

Eysenck included the entire editorial in his 1998 book Intelligence: A New Look. Eysenck believed that empirical evidence supported parapsychology and astrology.Eysenck, H. J.

He attracted criticism from skeptics for endorsing the paranormal. Henry Gordon for example stated that Eysenck's viewpoint was \\"incredibly naive\\" because many of the parapsychology experiments he cited as evidence contained serious problems and were never replicated.Gordon, Henry. (1988). Extrasensory Deception: ESP, Psychics, Shirley MacLaine, Ghosts, UFO. Prometheus Books. pp. 139-140. Magician and skeptic James Randi noted that Eysenck had supported fraudulent psychics as genuine and had not mentioned their sleight of hand. According to Randi, he had given \\"a totally-one sided view of the subject.\\"Nias, David K. B; Dean, Geoffrey A. (1986). \\"Astrology and Parapsychology\\". pp. 361-375. In Hans Eysenck: Consensus And Controversy. Routledge. 2019 King's College London enquiry  Diagram of the Eysenck and Grossarth-Maticek perspective on personality and cancer as characterized by critics, a characterization disputed by Grossarth-Maticek. Eysenck's work has undergone reevaluation since his death. In 2019 the psychiatrist Anthony PelosiDr. Anthony Pelosi initiated a controversy following some critical publications. In 2019, 26 of his papers (all coauthored with Ronald Grossarth-Maticek) were \\"considered unsafe\\" by an enquiry on behalf of King's College London. It concluded that these publications describing experimental or observational studies were unsafe. It decided that the editors of the 11 journals in which these studies appeared should be informed of their decision. Anthony Pelosi, who conducted an earlier investigation into Eysenck, described the work in which Eysenck was involved as leading to \\"one of the worst scientific scandals of all time\\", with \\"what must be the most astonishing series of findings ever published in the peer- reviewed scientific literature\\" and \\"effect sizes that have never otherwise been encountered in biomedical research.\\" Pelosi cited 23 \\"serious criticisms\\" of Eysenck's work that had been published independently by multiple authors between 1991 and 1997, noting that these had never been investigated \\"by any appropriate authority\\" at that time. The reportedly fraudulent papers covered the links between personality and cancer. Critics claim that Grossarth and Eysenck claimed the existence of a \\"cancer prone personality\\" were supposed to have a risk of dying of cancer 121 times greater than controls, when exposed to the carcinogen physical factor tobacco smoking. Bosely (2019): The \\"heart disease-prone personality\\" exposed to physical risk factors is asserted to have 27 times the risk of dying of heart disease as controls. Pelosi concluded \\"I honestly believe, having read it so carefully and tried to find alternative interpretations, that this is fraudulent work.\\" The publications under discussion were criticized, among other things, for the reason that Eysenck's research work was partly financed by the tobacco industry and he therefore may have had an interest to show an association between personality and cancer (instead of an association of smoking and cancer). Statement of Eysenck in 1990: ‚ÄúNote that I have never stated that cigarette smoking is not causally related to cancer and coronary heart disease; to deny such a relationship would be irresponsible and counter to the evidence. I have merely stated that the available evidence is insufficient to prove a causal relationship, and this I believe to be true.‚Äù In his statement at the time, Eysenck failed to take into account the highly addictive effect of nicotine, which was only later clearly proven by neurophysiological studies.Aho v.

Available at: Truth Tobacco Industry documents: Sworn statement of HANS JURGEN EYSENCK, Ph.D., Sc.D., December 10, 1990, page 10 ‚Äì 11 and following. Grossarth emphasized that the development of disease is often multicausal, whereby the factors reinforce each other in their effect, and he explicitly speaks of behavioral characteristics that may change due to psychological intervention. Grossarth emphasises their changeability through cognitive behavioral therapy in his intervention studies. Noting that Eysenck died many years ago and cannot defend himself, Grossarth-Maticek wrote a rebuttal and announced legal actions. Following the King's College London enquiry the International Journal of Sport Psychology retracted a paper that was coauthored by Eysenck in 1990. Later, 13 additional papers were retracted.

These methods vary by the sources from which information is obtained, how that information is sampled, and the types of instruments that are used in data collection. Methods also vary by whether they collect qualitative data, quantitative data or both. Qualitative psychological research is where the research findings are not arrived at by statistical or other quantitative procedures. Quantitative psychological research is where the research findings result from mathematical modeling and statistical estimation or statistical inference. Since qualitative information can be handled as such statistically, the distinction relates to method, rather than the topic studied. There are three main types of psychological research: * Correlational research * Descriptive research * Experimental research The following are common research designs and data collection methods: * Archival research * Case study ‚Äì Although case studies are often included in 'research methods' pages, they are actually not a single research method. Case study methodology involves using a body of different research methods (e.g. interview, observation, self-report questionnaire). Researchers interpret what the data together mean for the area of study. So, case studies are a methodology, not a method. * Computer simulation (modeling) * Content analysis * Event sampling methodology, also referred to as experience sampling methodology (ESM), diary study, or ecological momentary assessment (EMA) * Experiment, often with separate treatment and control groups (see scientific control and design of experiments). See Experimental psychology for many details. * Field experiment * Interview, can be structured or unstructured. * Meta-analysis * Neuroimaging and other psychophysiological methods * Observational study, can be naturalistic (see natural experiment), participant or controlled. * Program evaluation * Quasi-experiment * Self- report inventory * Survey, often with a random sample (see survey sampling) * Twin study Research designs vary according to the period(s) of time over which data are collected: * Retrospective cohort study: Subjects are chosen, then data are collected on their past experiences. * Prospective cohort study: Subjects are recruited prior to the proposed independent effects being administered or occurring. * Cross-sectional study, in which a population are sampled on all proposed measures at one point in time. * Longitudinal study: Subjects are studied at multiple time points: May address the cohort effect and indicate causal directions of effects.

Probably built in honour of Prince Arthur Arthur Tudor (19/20 September 1486 ‚Äì 2 April 1502) was Prince of Wales, Earl of Chester and Duke of Cornwall. As the eldest son and heir apparent of Henry VII of England, Arthur was viewed by contemporaries as the great hope of the newly established House of Tudor. His mother, Elizabeth of York, was the daughter of Edward IV, and his birth cemented the union between the House of Tudor and the House of York. Plans for Arthur's marriage began before his third birthday; he was installed as Prince of Wales two years later. At the age of eleven, he was formally betrothed to Catherine of Aragon, a daughter of the powerful Catholic Monarchs in Spain, in an effort to forge an Anglo-Spanish alliance against France. Arthur was well educated and, contrary to some modern belief, was in good health for the majority of his life. Soon after his marriage to Catherine in 1501, the couple took up residence at Ludlow Castle in Shropshire, where Arthur died six months later of an unknown ailment. Catherine later firmly stated that the marriage had not been consummated. One year after Arthur's death, Henry VII renewed his efforts of sealing a marital alliance with Spain by arranging for Catherine to marry Arthur's younger brother Henry, Prince of Wales. Arthur's untimely death paved the way for Henry to ascend to the throne in 1509 as King Henry VIII. Whether Arthur and Catherine consummated their six-month marriage was much later (and in a completely different political context) exploited by Henry VIII and his court. This strategy was employed in order to cast doubt upon the validity of Catherine's union with Henry VIII, eventually leading to the separation between the Church of England and the Roman Catholic Church.  Infancy  The family of Henry VII, depicted on an illuminated page. Henry VII became King of England upon defeating Richard III at the Battle of Bosworth Field in 1485. In an effort to strengthen the Tudor claim to the throne, Henry had royal genealogists trace his lineage back to the ancient British rulers and decided on naming his firstborn son after the legendary King Arthur. On this occasion, Camelot was identified as present-day Winchester, and his wife, Elizabeth of York, was sent to Saint Swithun's Priory (today Winchester Cathedral Priory) in order to give birth there. Born at Saint Swithun's Priory on the night of 19/20 September 1486 at about 1 am, Arthur was Henry and Elizabeth's eldest child. Arthur's birth was anticipated by French and Italian humanists eager for the start of a \\"Virgilian golden age\\". Sir Francis Bacon wrote that although the Prince was born one month premature, he was \\"strong and able\\". Young Arthur was viewed as \\"a living symbol\\" of not only the union between the House of Tudor and the House of York, to which his mother belonged as the daughter of Edward IV, but also of the end of the Wars of the Roses. In the opinion of contemporaries, Arthur was the great hope of the newly established House of Tudor. Arthur became Duke of Cornwall at birth. Four days after his birth, he was baptised at Winchester Cathedral by the Bishop of Worcester, John Alcock, which was immediately followed by his confirmation. John de Vere, 13th Earl of Oxford, Thomas Stanley, 1st Earl of Derby, William FitzAlan, 16th Earl of Arundel, Queen Elizabeth Woodville and Cecily of York served as godparents; the latter two, his grandmother and aunt, respectively, carried the prince during the ceremony. Initially, Arthur's nursery in Farnham was headed by Elizabeth Darcy, who had served as chief nurse for Edward IV's children, including Arthur's own mother. After Arthur was created Prince of Wales in 1490, he was awarded a household structure at the behest of his father. Over the next thirteen years, Henry VII and Elizabeth would have six more children, of whom only three‚ÄîMargaret, Henry and Mary‚Äîwould reach adulthood. Arthur was especially close to his sister Margaret (b. 1489) and his brother Henry (b. 1491), with whom he shared a nursery. On 29 November 1489, after being made a Knight of the Bath, Arthur was appointed Prince of Wales and Earl of Chester, and was invested as such at the Palace of Westminster on 27 February 1490. As part of his investiture ceremony, he progressed down the River Thames in the royal barge and was met at Chelsea by the Lord Mayor of London, John Mathewe, and at Lambeth by Spanish ambassadors. On 8 May 1491, he was made a Knight of the Garter at Saint George's Chapel at Windsor Palace. It was around this time that Arthur began his formal education under John Rede, a former headmaster of Winchester College. His education was subsequently taken over by Bernard Andr√©, a blind poet, and then by Thomas Linacre, formerly Henry VII's physician. Arthur's education covered grammar, poetry, rhetoric and ethics and focused on history. Arthur was a very skilled pupil and Andr√© wrote that the Prince of Wales had either memorised or read a selection of Homer, Virgil, Ovid, Terence, a good deal of Cicero and a wide span of historical works, including those of Thucydides, Caesar, Livy and Tacitus. Arthur was also a \\"superb archer\\", and had learned to dance \\"right pleasant and honourably\\" by 1501.  Childhood  The popular belief that Arthur was sickly during his lifetime stems from a misunderstanding of a 1502 letter, but there are no reports of Arthur being ill during his lifetime. Arthur grew up to be unusually tall for his age, and was considered handsome by the Spanish court: he had reddish hair, small eyes, a high-bridged nose, resembling his brother Henry, who was said to be \\"extremely handsome\\" by contemporaries. As described by historians Steven Gunn and Linda Monckton, Arthur had an \\"amiable and gentle\\" personality and was, overall, a \\"delicate lad\\". In May 1490 Arthur was created warden of all the marches towards Scotland and the Earl of Surrey was appointed as the Prince's deputy. From 1491, Arthur was named on peace commissions. In October 1492, when his father travelled to France, he was named Keeper of England and King's Lieutenant. Following the example of Edward IV, Henry VII set up the Council of Wales and the Marches for Arthur in Wales, in order to enforce royal authority there. Although the council had already been set up in 1490, it was headed by Jasper Tudor, Duke of Bedford. Arthur was first dispatched to Wales in 1501, at the age of fifteen. In March 1493, Arthur was granted the power to appoint justices of oyer and terminer and inquire into franchises, thus strengthening the council's authority. In November of that year, the Prince also received an extensive land grant in Wales, including the County of March. Arthur was served by sons of English, Irish and Welsh nobility, such as Gerald FitzGerald, 9th Earl of Kildare, who had been brought to the English court as a consequence of the involvement of his father, Gerald FitzGerald, 8th Earl of Kildare, in the crowning of pretender Lambert Simnel in Ireland during Henry VII's reign. Other servants were Anthony Willoughby, a son of Robert Willoughby, 1st Baron Willoughby de Broke, Robert Radcliffe, the heir of the 9th Baron FitzWalter and Maurice St John, a favourite nephew of Arthur's grandmother Lady Margaret Beaufort. He was brought up with Gruffydd ap Rhys ap Thomas, the son of powerful Welsh nobleman Rhys ap Thomas, Gruffydd grew quite close to Arthur and was buried in Worcester Cathedral upon his death in 1521, alongside the Prince's tomb.  Marriage  A Flemish tapestry depicting Arthur and Catherine's court. Henry VII planned to marry Arthur to a daughter of the Catholic Monarchs, Isabella I of Castile and Ferdinand II of Aragon, in order to forge an Anglo-Spanish alliance against France. It was suggested that the choice of marrying Arthur to Ferdinand and Isabella's youngest daughter, Catherine (b. 1485), would be appropriate. The Treaty of Medina del Campo (27 March 1489) provided that Arthur and Catherine would be married as soon as they reached canonical age; it also settled Catherine's dowry at 200,000 crowns (the equivalent of ¬£5 million in 2007). Since Arthur, not yet 14, was below the age of consent, a papal dispensation (i.e., waiver) allowing the marriage was issued in February 1497, and the pair were betrothed by proxy on 25 August 1497. Two years later, a marriage by proxy took place at Arthur's Tickenhill Manor in Bewdley, near Worcester; Arthur said to Roderigo de Puebla, who had acted as proxy for Catherine, that \\"he much rejoiced to contract the marriage because of his deep and sincere love for the Princess\\". In a letter from October 1499, Arthur, referring to Catherine as \\"my dearest spouse\\", had written: > \\"I cannot tell you what an earnest desire I feel to see your Highness, and > how vexatious to me is this procrastination about your coming. Let [it] be > hastened, [that] the love conceived between us and the wished-for joys may > reap their proper fruit.\\" The young couple exchanged letters in Latin until 20 September 1501, when Arthur, having attained the age of 15, was deemed old enough to be married. Catherine landed in England about two weeks later, on 2 October 1501, at Plymouth. The next month, on 4 November 1501, the couple met for the first time at Dogmersfield in Hampshire. Arthur wrote to Catherine's parents that he would be \\"a true and loving husband\\"; the couple soon discovered that they had mastered different pronunciations of Latin and so were unable to easily communicate. Five days later, on 9 November 1501, Catherine arrived in London. On 14 November 1501, the marriage ceremony finally took place at Saint Paul's Cathedral; both Arthur and Catherine wore white satin. The ceremony was conducted by Henry Deane, Archbishop of Canterbury, who was assisted by William Warham, Bishop of London. Following the ceremony, Arthur and Catherine left the Cathedral and headed for Baynard's Castle, where they were entertained by \\"the best voiced children of the King's chapel, who sang right sweetly with quaint harmony\\". What followed was a bedding ceremony laid down by Arthur's grandmother Lady Margaret Beaufort: the bed was sprinkled with holy water, after which Catherine was led away from the wedding feast by her ladies-in-waiting. She was undressed, veiled and \\"reverently\\" laid in bed, while Arthur, \\"in his shirt, with a gown cast about him,\\" was escorted by his gentlemen into the bedchamber as viols and tabors played. The Bishop of London blessed the bed, and prayed for the marriage to be fruitful, after which the couple were left alone. This is the only public bedding of a royal couple recorded in Britain in the 16th century.  Death  Prince Arthur, depicted on a stained glass window at Great Malvern. After residing at Tickenhill Manor for a month, Arthur and Catherine headed for the Welsh Marches, where they established their household at Ludlow Castle. Arthur had been growing weaker since his wedding, and although Catherine was reluctant to follow him, she was ordered by Henry VII to join her husband. Arthur found it easy to govern Wales, as the border had become quiet after many centuries of warfare. In March 1502, Arthur and Catherine were afflicted by an unknown illness, \\"a malign vapour which proceeded from the air.\\" While Catherine recovered, Arthur died on 2 April 1502 at Ludlow, six months short of his sixteenth birthday. News of Arthur's death reached Henry VII's court late on 4 April. The King was awoken from his sleep by his confessor, who quoted Job by asking Henry \\"If we receive good things at the hands of God, why may we not endure evil things?\\" He then told the king that \\"[his] dearest son hath departed to God,\\" and Henry burst into tears. \\"Grief-stricken and emotional,\\" he then had his wife brought into his chambers, so that they might \\"take the painful news together\\"; Elizabeth reminded Henry that God had helped him become king and \\"had ever preserved him,\\" adding that they had been left with \\"yet a fair Prince and two fair princesses and that God is where he was, and [they were] both young enough.\\" Soon after leaving Henry's bedchamber, Elizabeth collapsed and began to cry, while the ladies sent for the King, who hurriedly came and \\"relieved her.\\" On 8 April, a general procession took place for the salvation of Arthur's soul. That night, a dirge was sung in St Paul's Cathedral and every parish church in London. On 23 April, Arthur's body, which had previously been embalmed, sprinkled with holy water and sheltered with a canopy, was carried out of Ludlow Castle and into the Parish Church of Ludlow by various noblemen and gentlemen. On 25 April, Arthur's body was taken to Worcester Cathedral via the River Severn, in a \\"special wagon upholstered in black and drawn by six horses, also caparisoned in black.\\" As was customary, Catherine did not attend the funeral. The Earl of Surrey acted as chief mourner. At the end of the ceremony, Sir William Uvedale, Sir Richard Croft and Arthur's household ushers broke their staves of office and threw them into the Prince's grave. During the funeral, Arthur's own arms were shown alongside those of Cadwaladr ap Gruffydd and Brutus of Troy. Two years later, a chantry was erected over Arthur's grave.  Legacy  Shortly after Arthur's death, the idea of betrothing the widowed Catherine to the new heir apparent, Henry, had arisen; Henry VII and Isabella I were keen on moving forward with the betrothal and the pope granted a dispensation towards that end. Henry VIII ascended the throne on 22 April 1509 and married Arthur's widow on 11 June. They had six children; three of their sons died before reaching three months of age, a daughter was stillborn, and another lived for only a week. The couple's surviving child was Mary I (b. 1516). In 1526, Henry started to pursue the affections of Anne Boleyn. At the same time, he became troubled by what became known as the King's \\"great matter\\", that is, finding an appropriate solution for his lack of male descendants. It soon became the King's wish to dissolve his marriage and marry Anne, who was more likely to bear children. Henry believed that his marriage was cursed and found confirmation in the Bible, in . Although in the morning following his wedding, Arthur had claimed that he was thirsty \\"for I have been in the midst of Spain last night\\" and that \\"having a wife is a good pastime\\", these claims are generally dismissed by modern historians as mere boasts of a boy who did not want others to know of his failure. Until the day she died, Catherine maintained that she had married Henry while still a virgin. After Henry's constant support of the claim that Catherine's first marriage had been consummated, an annulment was issued on 23 May 1533, while the King had already married Anne on 25 January. Anne was beheaded for high treason in 1536, after which Henry proceeded to marry four more times. At the time of his death in 1547, Henry only had three living children; the only son, Edward VI, succeeded but died six years later. His successors were Henry's daughters by Catherine and Anne, Mary I and Elizabeth I. Upon Elizabeth's death in 1603, the House of Tudor came to an end. In 2002, following the initiative of canon Ian MacKenzie, Arthur's funeral was reenacted with a requiem mass at Worcester Cathedral, on occasion of the quincentenary of his death. Despite his role in English history, Arthur has remained largely forgotten since his death. The only known portrait of Arthur was rediscovered by English art dealer Philip Mould. The stain-glass image of Arthur Tudor praying is in St Laurence's Church in Ludlow Shropshire where he died at the castle in 1502.  Popular culture  Arthur has been featured in several historical fiction novels, such as The King's Pleasure, by Norah Lofts, Three Sisters, Three Queens by Philippa Gregory and Katherine, The Virgin Widow, by Jean Plaidy. In The Constant Princess, by Philippa Gregory, Catherine promises Arthur to marry his brother, thus fulfilling not only her own destiny of becoming Queen of England, but also the couple's plans for the future of the kingdom. The Alteration, by Kingsley Amis, is an alternate history novel centred on the \\"War of the English Succession\\", during which Henry VIII attempts to usurp the throne of his nephew, Stephen II, Arthur and Catherine's son. The historical drama The Six Wives of Henry VIII was broadcast in 1970, with Martin Ratcliffe as \\"Prince Arthur\\". In 1972, BBC2 aired a historical miniseries titled The Shadow of the Tower, with \\"Lord Arthur, Prince of Wales\\" played by Jason Kemp. He is portrayed by Angus Imrie in 2019 period drama The Spanish Princess.

He'd eventually start a music publishing company with Robbins. He established \\"Butrum Enterprises Publishing Company\\" and owned Look Records. He produced many early country music documentaries including \\"Music City USA\\". Butrum would tour again, from 1977 to 1984, with the reformed Drifting Cowboys. Later in life, Butrum became active in the \\"Reunion of Professional Entertainers,\\" and distributed vintage country music videos through Nashville retail stores and his website. Hillous Butrum died in his Nashville home about two weeks after the death of his wife Phyllis (Frost) Butrum. His funeral was held in Goodlettsville, Tennessee and was attended by notable music industry figures including Hal Bynum, Merle Kilgore, Bobby Tomberlin, Robbie Wittkowski, Tim Jones, and Don Helms. He was interred in the Underwood Cemetery in his hometown of Lafayette. The day before Butrum's death, he agreed to an exclusive interview with Country Music Source magazine detailing his long and inspiring music career. The interview was scheduled for April 29, 2002. In lieu of the interview, Country Music Source printed a memoriam for Butrum.

It consists of three equal horizontal tribands of red, white, and blue stripes, with the arms of Missouri in the center. Designed by Mary Elizabeth Oliver, the red and white stripes, as is traditional, represent valor and purity, respectively. The blue represents three things: the permanency, vigilance, and justice of the state. The three colors also highlight the French influence on the state in its early years. The Missouri flag was established on March 22, 1913, when governor Elliot Woolfolk Major signed the State flag act making it official.  History  The design of the State flag has been modified officially once since 1861. The current version is the longest-used and has been in use for more than years. = First flag = Missouri did not have an official flag until Major-General Sterling Price, commander of the Missouri State Guard, ordered on June 5, 1861: > Each regiment will adopt the State flag, made of blue merino, 6 by 5 feet, > with the Missouri coat-of-arms in gold gilt on each side. = Flag Act of 1913 = The Missouri state flag was designed and stitched in Cape Girardeau, Missouri, by Marie Elizabeth Oliver, the wife of former State Senator R. B. Oliver. She began her flag project in 1908 as part of her volunteer activities with the Daughters of the American Revolution (DAR) when she was appointed chairperson of the DAR committee to research and design Missouri's flag. Oliver researched state flags extensively. She wrote each state's secretary of state for information about how their state's flags had been designed and officially adopted. Her original design incorporated Missouri's coat of arms and was rendered as a painted paper flag by her friend Mary Kochitzky. The flag was brought to the Missouri State Capitol in 1908 and bills to adopt the flag as the official flag of Missouri were introduced by Senator Arthur L. Oliver, her nephew, in 1909 and 1911. Both bills failed to pass in the House. A competing flag design, by Dr. G.H. Holcomb and referred to as the \\"Holcomb flag\\", was opposed due to its resemblance to the Flag of the United States and its lack of Missouri symbolism. Oliver's original paper flag was destroyed when the Missouri State Capitol burned in 1911. With Mrs. S.D. MacFarland, Oliver sewed a second flag out of silk. Her design was adopted on March 22, 1913, when governor Elliot Woolfolk Major signed the Oliver Flag Bill. The flag design remains unchanged to this day. The silk flag was kept by Marie Oliver until 1961 when her son Allen gave it to the state of Missouri. The flag was displayed until it began to deteriorate and was put into storage. In 1988, Secretary of State Roy D. Blunt issued a challenge to elementary students to raise money to restore the flag. The campaign was successful and the restored flag has been displayed in the James C. Kirkpatrick State Information Center in Jefferson City ever since. The Oliver- Leming House, also known as the Home of the Missouri State Flag, was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1980.  Design  The flag is a tricolor consisting of three horizontal stripes of red, white and blue which resembles the flag of the Netherlands. These represent valor, purity, vigilance, and justice. The colors also reflect the state's historic status as part of French Louisiana. In the center white stripe is the seal of Missouri, circled by a blue band containing 24 stars, symbolizing Missouri's admission as the 24th U.S. state. The flag also includes the state seal which says ‚ÄúSalus Populi Suprema Lex Esto‚Äù which translates into ‚ÄúThe health (welfare, good, salvation, felicity) of the people should be the supreme law‚Äù. The flag is described in Section 010.020 of Missouri's Revised Statutes. There are no known examples of mass-produced Missouri state flags in compliance with the RSMo due to the 7:12 proportions. In 2001, the North American Vexillological Association surveyed its members on the designs of the 72 U.S. state, U.S. territorial and Canadian provincial flags. The Missouri flag ranked in the bottom 25, 48th out of the 72.

The reserve currency can be used in international transactions, international investments and all aspects of the global economy. It is often considered a hard currency or safe-haven currency. The United Kingdom's pound sterling was the primary reserve currency of much of the world in the 19th century and first half of the 20th century. However, by the end of the 20th century, the United States dollar was considered the world's dominant reserve currency.[1 in the International Sphere\\"], The Federal Reserve System: Purposes & Functions, a publication of the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, 9th Edition, June 2005 The world's need for dollars has allowed the United States government as well as Americans to borrow at lower costs, giving the United States an advantage in excess of $100 billion per year. History Reserve currencies have come and gone. International currencies in the past have included the Greek drachma, coined in the fifth century B.C., the Roman denari, the Byzantine solidus and Arab dinar of the middle-ages, the Venetian ducato and the Florentine florin of the Renaissance, the 17th century Dutch guilder and the French franc. Under the gold standard, the predominant global financial system from 1870 to 1914, paper notes were convertible into preset, fixed quantities of gold. The Dutch guilder emerged as a de facto world currency in the 18th century due to unprecedented domination of trade by the Dutch East India Company. However, the development of the modern concept of a reserve currency took place in the mid 19th century, with the introduction of national central banks and treasuries and an increasingly integrated global economy. By the 1860s, most industrialised countries had followed the lead of the United Kingdom and put their currency on to the gold standard. At that point the UK was the primary exporter of manufactured goods and services and over 60% of world trade was invoiced in pound sterling. British banks were also expanding overseas; London was the world centre for insurance and commodity markets and British capital was the leading source of foreign investment around the world; sterling soon became the standard currency used for international commercial transactions.\\"A history of sterling\\" by Kit Dawnay, The Telegraph, 8 October 2001 John Maynard Keynes (right) and Harry Dexter White helped to draft the provisions of the post-war financial system. Here, they meet at the inaugural meeting of the International Monetary Fund, 1946. Attempts were made in the interwar period to restore the gold standard. The British Gold Standard Act reintroduced the gold bullion standard in 1925,Text of the Gold Standard Bill speech by Winston Churchill, House of Commons, 4 May 1925 followed by many other countries. This led to relative stability, followed by deflation, but because the onset of the Great Depression and other factors, global trade greatly declined and the gold standard fell. Speculative attacks on the pound forced Britain entirely off the gold standard in 1931.Text of speech by Chancellor of the Exchequer Philip Snowden to the House of Commons, 21 September 1931 After World War II, the international financial system was governed by a formal agreement, the Bretton Woods System. Under this system the United States dollar was placed deliberately as the anchor of the system, with the US government guaranteeing other central banks that they could sell their US dollar reserves at a fixed rate for gold.An Historical Perspective on the Reserve Currency Status of the U.S. Dollar treasury.gov In the late 1960s and early 1970s, the system suffered setbacks ostensibly due to problems pointed out by the Triffin dilemma‚Äîthe conflict of economic interests that arises between short-term domestic objectives and long-term international objectives when a national currency also serves as a world reserve currency. Global currency reserves The IMF regularly publishes the aggregated Currency Composition of Foreign Exchange Reserves (COFER). The reserves of the individual reporting countries and institutions are confidential. Thus the following table is a limited view about the global currency reserves that only deals with allocated reserves: Theory Economists debate whether a single reserve currency will always dominate the global economy. Many have recently argued that one currency will almost always dominate due to network externalities (sometimes called \\"the network effect\\"), especially in the field of invoicing trade and denominating foreign debt securities, meaning that there are strong incentives to conform to the choice that dominates the marketplace. The argument is that, in the absence of sufficiently large shocks, a currency that dominates the marketplace will not lose much ground to challengers. However, some economists, such as Barry Eichengreen, argue that this is not as true when it comes to the denomination of official reserves because the network externalities are not strong. As long as the currency's market is sufficiently liquid, the benefits of reserve diversification are strong, as it insures against large capital losses. The implication is that the world may well soon begin to move away from a financial system dominated uniquely by the US dollar. In the first half of the 20th century multiple currencies did share the status as primary reserve currencies. Although the British Sterling was the largest currency, both the French franc and the German mark shared large portions of the market until the First World War, after which the mark was replaced by the dollar. Since the Second World War, the dollar has dominated official reserves, but this is likely a reflection of the unusual domination of the American economy during this period, as well as official discouragement of reserve status from the potential rivals, Germany and Japan. The top reserve currency is generally selected by the banking community for the strength and stability of the economy in which it is used. Thus, as a currency becomes less stable, or its economy becomes less dominant, bankers may over time abandon it for a currency issued by a larger or more stable economy. This can take a relatively long time, as recognition is important in determining a reserve currency. For example, it took many years after the United States overtook the United Kingdom as the world's largest economy before the dollar overtook the pound sterling as the dominant global reserve currency.\\"The Retirement of Sterling as a Reserve Currency after 1945: Lessons for the US Dollar?\\", Catherine R. Schenk, Canadian Network for Economic History conference, October 2009. In 1944, when the US dollar was chosen as the world reference currency at Bretton Woods, it was only the second currency in global reserves. The G8 also frequently issues public statements as to exchange rates. In the past due to the Plaza Accord, its predecessor bodies could directly manipulate rates to reverse large trade deficits. Major reserve currencies Distribution of global reserve currencies =United States dollar= The United States dollar is the most widely held currency in the allocated reserves, representing about 61% of international foreign currency reserves, which makes it somewhat easier for the United States to run higher trade deficits with greatly postponed economic impact or even postponing a currency crisis. Central bank US dollar reserves, however, are small compared to private holdings of such debt. In the event that non-United States holders of dollar-denominated assets decided to shift holdings to assets denominated in other currencies, there could be serious consequences for the US economy. Changes of this kind are rare, and typically change takes place gradually over time, and markets involved adjust accordingly. However, the US dollar remains the preferred reserve currency because of its stability along with assets such as United States Treasury security that have both scale and liquidity. The US dollar's dominant position in global reserves is challenged occasionally, because of the growing share of unallocated reserves, and because of the doubt regarding dollar stability in the long term.Dollar 'losing grip as world's reserve currency' iol.co.zaIMF discusses plan to replace dollar as reserve currency money.cnn.comCentral Banks Dump Treasuries As Dollar's Reserve Currency Status fadesWhy the Dollar's Reign Is Near an End\\"U.N. sees risk of crisis of confidence in dollar\\", Reuters, 25 May 2011 However, in the aftermath of the financial crisis, the dollar's share in the world's foreign- exchange trades rose slightly from 85% in 2010 to 87% in 2013.\\"The Dollar and Its Rivals\\" by Jeffrey Frankel, Project Syndicate, 21 November 2013 The dollar's role as the undisputed reserve currency of the world allows the United States to impose unilateral sanctions against actions performed between other countries, for example the American fine against BNP Paribas for violations of U.S. sanctions that were not laws of France or the other countries involved in the transactions. In 2014 Beijing, New Delhi and Moscow signed a 150 billion yuan central bank liquidity swap line agreement to get around American sanctions on their behaviors. =Euro= The euro is currently the second most commonly held reserve currency, representing about 21% of international foreign currency reserves. After World War II and the rebuilding of the German economy, the German Deutsche Mark gained the status of the second most important reserve currency after the US dollar. When the euro was introduced on 1 January 1999, replacing the Mark, French franc and ten other European currencies, it inherited the status of a major reserve currency from the Mark. Since then, its contribution to official reserves has risen continually as banks seek to diversify their reserves, and trade in the eurozone continues to expand. Former U.S. Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan said in September 2007 that the euro could replace the U.S. dollar as the world's primary reserve currency. It was \\"absolutely conceivable that the euro will replace the US dollar as reserve currency, or will be traded as an equally important reserve currency.\\"\\"Euro could replace dollar as top currency-Greenspan\\", Reuters, 7 September 2007 Econometric analysis by Jeffrey Frankel and Menzie Chinn in 2006 suggested that the euro could replace the U.S. dollar as the major reserve currency by 2020 if either the remaining EU members, including the UK and Denmark, adopted the euro by 2020, or the recent depreciation trend of the dollar persisted into the future. In recent years, the euro's share of the worldwide currency reserve basket has continued to increase‚Äîalbeit at a slower rate than before the beginning of the worldwide credit crunch related recession and Eurozone crisis, which harmed the euro and slowed its adoption. Since 2009, the reserve currency use of the euro has continued to drop, down to 23.9 percent in 2013. Other reserve currencies =Dutch guilder= The Dutch guilder was the de facto reserve currency in Europe in 17th and 18th centuries.The euro as a reserve currency lodz.pl =Pound sterling= The United Kingdom's pound sterling was the primary reserve currency of much of the world in the 19th century and first half of the 20th century. The emergence of the United States as an economic superpower, and the establishment of the U.S. Federal Reserve System in 1913, and U.S. economic dominance from the second half of the 20th century onward due to the UK almost bankrupting itself fighting World War One and World War Two leading to occasional economic weakness during the second half of the 20th century, resulting in sterling losing its status as the world's most important reserve currency: in the 1950s 55% of global reserves were still held in sterling; but the share was 10% lower within 20 years. , the pound sterling represented the fourth largest proportion (by USD equivalent value) of foreign currency reserves. =Japanese yen= Japan's yen is part of the International Monetary Fund's (IMF) special drawing rights (SDR) valuation. The SDR currency value is determined daily by the IMF, based on the exchange rates of the currencies making up the basket, as quoted at noon at the London market. The valuation basket is reviewed and adjusted every five years.\\"SDR Valuation\\", International Monetary Fund website: \\"The currency value of the SDR is determined by summing the values in U.S. dollars, based on market exchange rates, of a basket of major currencies (the U.S. dollar, Euro, Japanese yen, and pound sterling).

The daily trading market turnover of the franc, however, ranked fifth, or about 3.4%, among all currencies in a 2007 survey by the Bank for International Settlements. =Canadian dollar= A number of central banks (and commercial banks) keep Canadian dollars as a reserve currency. In the economy of the Americas, the Canadian dollar plays a similar role to that played by the Australian dollar (AUD) in the Asia-Pacific region. The Canadian dollar (as a regional reserve currency for banking) has been an important part of the British, French and Dutch Caribbean states' economies and finance systems since the 1950s.\\"The Canadian Dollar as a Reserve Currency\\" by Lukasz Pomorski, Francisco Rivadeneyra and Eric Wolfe, Funds Management and Banking Department, The Bank of Canada Review, Spring 2014 The Canadian dollar is also held by many central banks in Central America and South America. It is held in Latin America because of remittances and international trade in the region. Because Canada's primary foreign-trade relationship is with the United States, Canadian consumers, economists, and many businesses primarily define and value the Canadian dollar in terms of the United States dollar. Thus, by observing how the Canadian dollar floats in terms of the US dollar, foreign-exchange economists can indirectly observe internal behaviours and patterns in the US economy that could not be seen by direct observation. Also, because it is considered a petrodollar, the Canadian dollar has only fully evolved into a global reserve currency since the 1970s, when it was floated against all other world currencies. The Canadian dollar, since 2013, is ranked 5th among foreign currency reserves in the world. =Chinese yuan= Chinese yuan officially became a world reserve currency on 1 October 2016. It represents 10.92% of the IMF's special drawing rights currency basket. The Chinese yuan is the third reserve currency after the US dollar and Euro within the basket of currencies in the SDR which is a fraction of the total reserve currencies in reserves today. Calls for an alternative reserve currency A report released by the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development in 2010, called for abandoning the U.S. dollar as the single major reserve currency. The report states that the new reserve system should not be based on a single currency or even multiple national currencies but instead permit the emission of international liquidity to create a more stable global financial system. Countries such as Russia and the People's Republic of China, central banks, and economic analysts and groups, such as the Gulf Cooperation Council, have expressed a desire to see an independent new currency replace the dollar as the reserve currency. On 10 July 2009, Russian President Medvedev proposed a new 'World currency' at the G8 meeting in London as an alternative reserve currency to replace the dollar. At the beginning of the 21st century, gold and crude oil were still priced in dollars, which helps export inflation and has brought complaints about OPEC's policies of managing oil quotas to maintain dollar price stability.Burleigh, Marc. \\"OPEC leaves oil quotas unchanged, seeing economic 'risks'.\\" AFP, 11 December 2010. =Special drawing rights= Some have proposed the use of the International Monetary Fund's (IMF) special drawing rights (SDRs) as a reserve. China has proposed using SDRs, calculated daily from a basket of U.S. dollar, euro, Japanese yen and British pounds, for international payments. On 3 September 2009, the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development (UNCTAD) issued a report calling for a new reserve currency based on the SDR, managed by a new global reserve bank. The IMF released a report in February 2011, stating that using SDRs \\"could help stabilize the global financial system.\\"\\"IMF calls for dollar alternative\\" by Ben Rooney, CNN Money, 10 February 2011  Further reading  * Ethan Ilzetzki, Carmen M Reinhart, Kenneth S Rogoff. 2019. \\"Exchange Arrangements Entering the 21st Century: Which Anchor Will Hold?\\" The Quarterly Journal of Economics. *  See also  *Commodity currency *Exorbitant privilege *Floating currency *Foreign exchange reserves *Cryptocurrency *Fiat currency *Hard currency *Krugerrand *Seigniorage *Special drawing rights *Triffin dilemma *World currency References Currency Foreign exchange reserves Monetary hegemony fr:R√©serves de change ","title":"Reserve currency"},{"id":"177668","text":"below) In mathematics, a Voronoi diagram is a partition of a plane into regions close to each of a given set of objects. In the simplest case, these objects are just finitely many points in the plane (called seeds, sites, or generators). For each seed there is a corresponding region consisting of all points of the plane closer to that seed than to any other. These regions are called Voronoi cells. The Voronoi diagram of a set of points is dual to its Delaunay triangulation. The Voronoi diagram is named after Georgy Voronoy, and is also called a Voronoi tessellation, a Voronoi decomposition, a Voronoi partition, or a Dirichlet tessellation (after Peter Gustav Lejeune Dirichlet). Voronoi cells are also known as Thiessen polygons. Voronoi diagrams have practical and theoretical applications in many fields, mainly in science and technology, but also in visual art. The simplest case In the simplest case, shown in the first picture, we are given a finite set of points {p1, ..., pn} in the Euclidean plane. In this case each site pk is simply a point, and its corresponding Voronoi cell Rk consists of every point in the Euclidean plane whose distance to pk is less than or equal to its distance to any other pk. Each such cell is obtained from the intersection of half-spaces, and hence it is a (convex) polyhedron. The line segments of the Voronoi diagram are all the points in the plane that are equidistant to the two nearest sites. The Voronoi vertices (nodes) are the points equidistant to three (or more) sites. Formal definition Let X be a metric space with distance function d. Let K be a set of indices and let (P_k)_{k \\\\in K} be a tuple (ordered collection) of nonempty subsets (the sites) in the space X. The Voronoi cell, or Voronoi region, R_k, associated with the site P_k is the set of all points in X whose distance to P_k is not greater than their distance to the other sites P_j, where j is any index different from k. In other words, if d(x,\\\\, A) = \\\\inf\\\\\\\\{d(x,\\\\, a) \\\\mid a \\\\in A\\\\\\\\} denotes the distance between the point x and the subset A, then R_k = \\\\\\\\{x \\\\in X \\\\mid d(x, P_k) \\\\leq d(x, P_j)\\\\; \\\\text{for all}\\\\; j eq k\\\\\\\\} The Voronoi diagram is simply the tuple of cells (R_k)_{k \\\\in K} . In principle, some of the sites can intersect and even coincide (an application is described below for sites representing shops), but usually they are assumed to be disjoint. In addition, infinitely many sites are allowed in the definition (this setting has applications in geometry of numbers and crystallography), but again, in many cases only finitely many sites are considered. In the particular case where the space is a finite-dimensional Euclidean space, each site is a point, there are finitely many points and all of them are different, then the Voronoi cells are convex polytopes and they can be represented in a combinatorial way using their vertices, sides, two- dimensional faces, etc. Sometimes the induced combinatorial structure is referred to as the Voronoi diagram. In general however, the Voronoi cells may not be convex or even connected. In the usual Euclidean space, we can rewrite the formal definition in usual terms. Each Voronoi polygon R_k is associated with a generator point P_k. Let X be the set of all points in the Euclidean space. Let P_1 be a point that generates its Voronoi region R_1, P_2 that generates R_2, and P_3 that generates R_3, and so on. Then, as expressed by Tran et al, \\"all locations in the Voronoi polygon are closer to the generator point of that polygon than any other generator point in the Voronoi diagram in Euclidean plane\\". Illustration As a simple illustration, consider a group of shops in a city. Suppose we want to estimate the number of customers of a given shop. With all else being equal (price, products, quality of service, etc.), it is reasonable to assume that customers choose their preferred shop simply by distance considerations: they will go to the shop located nearest to them. In this case the Voronoi cell \\\\scriptstyle R_k of a given shop \\\\scriptstyle P_k can be used for giving a rough estimate on the number of potential customers going to this shop (which is modeled by a point in our city). For most cities, the distance between points can be measured using the familiar Euclidean distance: :\\\\ell_2 = d\\\\left[\\\\left(a_1, a_2\\\\right), \\\\left(b_1, b_2\\\\right)\\\\right] = \\\\sqrt{\\\\left(a_1 - b_1\\\\right)^2 + \\\\left(a_2 - b_2\\\\right)^2} or the Manhattan distance: :d\\\\left[\\\\left(a_1, a_2\\\\right), \\\\left(b_1, b_2\\\\right)\\\\right] = \\\\lefta_1 - b_1\\\\right + \\\\lefta_2 - b_2\\\\right. The corresponding Voronoi diagrams look different for different distance metrics. Properties * The dual graph for a Voronoi diagram (in the case of a Euclidean space with point sites) corresponds to the Delaunay triangulation for the same set of points. * The closest pair of points corresponds to two adjacent cells in the Voronoi diagram. * Assume the setting is the Euclidean plane and a group of different points is given. Then two points are adjacent on the convex hull if and only if their Voronoi cells share an infinitely long side. * If the space is a normed space and the distance to each site is attained (e.g., when a site is a compact set or a closed ball), then each Voronoi cell can be represented as a union of line segments emanating from the sites.. As shown there, this property does not necessarily hold when the distance is not attained. * Under relatively general conditions (the space is a possibly infinite-dimensional uniformly convex space, there can be infinitely many sites of a general form, etc.) Voronoi cells enjoy a certain stability property: a small change in the shapes of the sites, e.g., a change caused by some translation or distortion, yields a small change in the shape of the Voronoi cells. This is the geometric stability of Voronoi diagrams.. As shown there, this property does not hold in general, even if the space is two-dimensional (but non-uniformly convex, and, in particular, non-Euclidean) and the sites are points. History and research Informal use of Voronoi diagrams can be traced back to Descartes in 1644. Peter Gustav Lejeune Dirichlet used two-dimensional and three-dimensional Voronoi diagrams in his study of quadratic forms in 1850. British physician John Snow used a Voronoi diagram in 1854 to illustrate how the majority of people who died in the Broad Street cholera outbreak lived closer to the infected Broad Street pump than to any other water pump. Voronoi diagrams are named after Georgy Feodosievych Voronoy who defined and studied the general n-dimensional case in 1908. and . Voronoi diagrams that are used in geophysics and meteorology to analyse spatially distributed data (such as rainfall measurements) are called Thiessen polygons after American meteorologist Alfred H. Thiessen. Other equivalent names for this concept (or particular important cases of it): Voronoi polyhedra, Voronoi polygons, domain(s) of influence, Voronoi decomposition, Voronoi tessellation(s), Dirichlet tessellation(s). Examples convex polyhedra.) Voronoi tessellations of regular lattices of points in two or three dimensions give rise to many familiar tessellations. * A 2D lattice gives an irregular honeycomb tessellation, with equal hexagons with point symmetry; in the case of a regular triangular lattice it is regular; in the case of a rectangular lattice the hexagons reduce to rectangles in rows and columns; a square lattice gives the regular tessellation of squares; note that the rectangles and the squares can also be generated by other lattices (for example the lattice defined by the vectors (1,0) and (1/2,1/2) gives squares). See here for a dynamic visual example. * A simple cubic lattice gives the cubic honeycomb. * A hexagonal close-packed lattice gives a tessellation of space with trapezo-rhombic dodecahedra. * A face-centred cubic lattice gives a tessellation of space with rhombic dodecahedra. * A body-centred cubic lattice gives a tessellation of space with truncated octahedra. * Parallel planes with regular triangular lattices aligned with each other's centers give the hexagonal prismatic honeycomb. * Certain body-centered tetragonal lattices give a tessellation of space with rhombo-hexagonal dodecahedra. For the set of points (x, y) with x in a discrete set X and y in a discrete set Y, we get rectangular tiles with the points not necessarily at their centers. Higher-order Voronoi diagrams Although a normal Voronoi cell is defined as the set of points closest to a single point in S, an nth-order Voronoi cell is defined as the set of points having a particular set of n points in S as its n nearest neighbors. Higher- order Voronoi diagrams also subdivide space. Higher-order Voronoi diagrams can be generated recursively. To generate the nth-order Voronoi diagram from set S, start with the (n ‚àí 1)th-order diagram and replace each cell generated by X = {x1, x2, ..., xn‚àí1} with a Voronoi diagram generated on the set S ‚àí X. =Farthest-point Voronoi diagram= For a set of n points the (n ‚àí 1)th-order Voronoi diagram is called a farthest-point Voronoi diagram. For a given set of points S = {p1, p2, ..., pn} the farthest-point Voronoi diagram divides the plane into cells in which the same point of P is the farthest point. A point of P has a cell in the farthest-point Voronoi diagram if and only if it is a vertex of the convex hull of P. Let H = {h1, h2, ..., hk} be the convex hull of P; then the farthest-point Voronoi diagram is a subdivision of the plane into k cells, one for each point in H, with the property that a point q lies in the cell corresponding to a site hi if and only if d(q, hi) > d(q, pj) for each pj ‚àà S with hi ‚â† pj, where d(p, q) is the Euclidean distance between two points p and q. 7.4 Farthest-Point Voronoi Diagrams. Includes a description of the algorithm., contains a simple algorithm to compute the farthest-point Voronoi diagram. The boundaries of the cells in the farthest-point Voronoi diagram have the structure of a topological tree, with infinite rays as its leaves. Every finite tree is isomorphic to the tree formed in this way from a farthest-point Voronoi diagram. Generalizations and variations As implied by the definition, Voronoi cells can be defined for metrics other than Euclidean, such as the Mahalanobis distance or Manhattan distance. However, in these cases the boundaries of the Voronoi cells may be more complicated than in the Euclidean case, since the equidistant locus for two points may fail to be subspace of codimension 1, even in the two-dimensional case. Approximate Voronoi diagram of a set of points. Notice the blended colors in the fuzzy boundary of the Voronoi cells. A weighted Voronoi diagram is the one in which the function of a pair of points to define a Voronoi cell is a distance function modified by multiplicative or additive weights assigned to generator points. In contrast to the case of Voronoi cells defined using a distance which is a metric, in this case some of the Voronoi cells may be empty. A power diagram is a type of Voronoi diagram defined from a set of circles using the power distance; it can also be thought of as a weighted Voronoi diagram in which a weight defined from the radius of each circle is added to the squared distance from the circle's center.. The Voronoi diagram of n points in d-dimensional space requires \\\\textstyle O\\\\left(n^{\\\\left\\\\lceil d/2 \\\\right\\\\rceil}\\\\right) storage space. Therefore, Voronoi diagrams are often not feasible for d > 2\\\\. An alternative is to use approximate Voronoi diagrams, where the Voronoi cells have a fuzzy boundary, which can be approximated. Voronoi diagrams are also related to other geometric structures such as the medial axis (which has found applications in image segmentation, optical character recognition, and other computational applications), straight skeleton, and zone diagrams. Besides points, such diagrams use lines and polygons as seeds. By augmenting the diagram with line segments that connect to nearest points on the seeds, a planar subdivision of the environment is obtained.. This structure can be used as a navigation mesh for path-finding through large spaces. The navigation mesh has been generalized to support 3D multi-layered environments, such as an airport or a multi-storey building.. Applications = Humanities = *In classical archaeology respectively art history the symmetry of statue heads is analysed to determine the type of statue a severed head may have belonged to like in the case of the famous Sabouroff head using a high-resolution Polygon mesh. = Natural sciences = A Voronoi tessellation emerges by radial growth from seeds outward. *In biology, Voronoi diagrams are used to model a number of different biological structures, including cells and bone microarchitecture. Indeed, Voronoi tessellations work as a geometrical tool to understand the physical constraints that drive the organization of biological tissues. *In hydrology, Voronoi diagrams are used to calculate the rainfall of an area, based on a series of point measurements. In this usage, they are generally referred to as Thiessen polygons. *In ecology, Voronoi diagrams are used to study the growth patterns of forests and forest canopies, and may also be helpful in developing predictive models for forest fires. *In computational chemistry, Voronoi cells defined by the positions of the nuclei in a molecule are used to compute atomic charges. This is done using the Voronoi deformation density method. *In astrophysics, Voronoi diagrams are used to generate adaptative smoothing zones on images, adding signal fluxes on each one. The main objective of these procedures is to maintain a relatively constant signal-to-noise ratio on all the images. *In computational fluid dynamics, the Voronoi tessellation of a set of points can be used to define the computational domains used in finite volume methods, e.g. as in the moving-mesh cosmology code AREPO. *In computational physics, Voronoi diagrams are used to calculate profiles of an object with Shadowgraph and proton radiography in High energy density physics. = Health = *In medical diagnosis, models of muscle tissue, based on Voronoi diagrams, can be used to detect neuromuscular diseases. John Snow's original diagram *In epidemiology, Voronoi diagrams can be used to correlate sources of infections in epidemics. One of the early applications of Voronoi diagrams was implemented by John Snow to study the 1854 Broad Street cholera outbreak in Soho, England. He showed the correlation between residential areas on the map of Central London whose residents had been using a specific water pump, and the areas with most deaths due to the outbreak. = Engineering = *In polymer physics, Voronoi diagrams can be used to represent free volumes of polymers. *In materials science, polycrystalline microstructures in metallic alloys are commonly represented using Voronoi tessellations. In island growth, the Voronoi diagram is used to estimate the growth rate of individual islands . In solid-state physics, the Wigner-Seitz cell is the Voronoi tessellation of a solid, and the Brillouin zone is the Voronoi tessellation of reciprocal (wavenumber) space of crystals which have the symmetry of a space group. *In aviation, Voronoi diagrams are superimposed on oceanic plotting charts to identify the nearest airfield for in-flight diversion (see ETOPS), as an aircraft progresses through its flight plan. *In architecture, Voronoi patterns were the basis for the winning entry for the redevelopment of The Arts Centre Gold Coast. *In urban planning, Voronoi diagrams can be used to evaluate the Freight Loading Zone system. *In mining, Voronoi polygons are used to estimate the reserves of valuable materials, minerals, or other resources. Exploratory drillholes are used as the set of points in the Voronoi polygons. *In surface metrology, Voronoi tessellation can be used for surface roughness modeling. = Geometry = *A point location data structure can be built on top of the Voronoi diagram in order to answer nearest neighbor queries, where one wants to find the object that is closest to a given query point. Nearest neighbor queries have numerous applications. For example, one might want to find the nearest hospital or the most similar object in a database. A large application is vector quantization, commonly used in data compression. *In geometry, Voronoi diagrams can be used to find the largest empty circle amid a set of points, and in an enclosing polygon; e.g. to build a new supermarket as far as possible from all the existing ones, lying in a certain city. *Voronoi diagrams together with farthest-point Voronoi diagrams are used for efficient algorithms to compute the roundness of a set of points. The Voronoi approach is also put to good use in the evaluation of circularity/roundness while assessing the dataset from a coordinate-measuring machine. *Modern computational geometry has provided efficient algorithms for constructing Voronoi diagrams and has allowed them to be used in mesh generation, point location, cluster analysis, machining plans, and many other computational tasks. = Informatics = *In networking, Voronoi diagrams can be used in derivations of the capacity of a wireless network. *In computer graphics, Voronoi diagrams are used to calculate 3D shattering / fracturing geometry patterns. It is also used to procedurally generate organic or lava- looking textures. * In autonomous robot navigation, Voronoi diagrams are used to find clear routes. If the points are obstacles, then the edges of the graph will be the routes furthest from obstacles (and theoretically any collisions). *In machine learning, Voronoi diagrams are used to do 1-NN classifications. *In user interface development, Voronoi patterns can be used to compute the best hover state for a given point. = Civics and planning = * In Melbourne, government school students are always eligible to attend the nearest primary school or high school to where they live, as measured by a straight-line distance. The map of school zones is therefore a Voronoi diagram. = Bakery = * Ukrainian Pastry chef Dinara Kasko uses the mathematical principles of the Voronoi diagram to create silicone molds made with a 3D printer to shape her original cakes. Algorithms Several efficient algorithms are known for constructing Voronoi diagrams, either directly (as the diagram itself) or indirectly by starting with a Delaunay triangulation and then obtaining its dual. Direct algorithms include Fortune's algorithm, an O(n log(n)) algorithm for generating a Voronoi diagram from a set of points in a plane. Bowyer‚ÄìWatson algorithm, an O(n log(n)) to O(n2) algorithm for generating a Delaunay triangulation in any number of dimensions, can be used in an indirect algorithm for the Voronoi diagram. Lloyd's algorithm and its generalization via the Linde‚ÄìBuzo‚ÄìGray algorithm (aka k-means clustering), use the construction of Voronoi diagrams as a subroutine. These methods alternate between steps in which one constructs the Voronoi diagram for a set of seed points, and steps in which the seed points are moved to new locations that are more central within their cells. These methods can be used in spaces of arbitrary dimension to iteratively converge towards a specialized form of the Voronoi diagram, called a Centroidal Voronoi tessellation, where the sites have been moved to points that are also the geometric centers of their cells. Software tools Voronoi diagrams require a computational step before showing the results. An efficient tool therefore would process the computation in real-time to show a direct result to the user. Many commercial and free applications exist. A particularly practical type of tools are the web-based ones. Web-based tools are easier to access and reference. Also, SVG being a natively supported format by the web, allows at the same time an efficient (GPU accelerated) rendering and is a standard format supported by multiple CAD tools (e.g. Autodesk Fusion360). * Voronator is a free (Ad based) tool acting on 3D object meshes to apply Voronoi on their surface. Although the tool acts on 3d, the voronoi processing is based on its 2d surface. * rhill voronoi is an open source JavaScript library for 2d voronoi generation. * stg voronoi is a github project with simple web application yet offering interactive viewing of voronoi cells when moving the mouse. It also provides an SVG export. * websvg voronoi is a responsive webapp for voronoi editing and exporting in SVG. It also allows to export and import the seeds coordinates. It is 2d based and it differs from the previously mentioned tools by providing a cells retraction operation, which is not based on scale, rather on edges translation. An edge can be removed if it is consumed by its neighboring edges. * A.Beutel voronoi is using WebGL and is providing in addition to static viewing, an animated motion of the voronoi cells. =Future of Software tools= Although voronoi is a very old concept, the currently available tools do lack multiple mathematical functions that could add values to these programs. Examples could be usage of a different cost distance than Euclidean, and mainly 3d voronoi algorithms.

His sharp and often unscrupulous business practices made him one of the wealthiest men of the late nineteenth century. A highly controversial and unpopular figure during his life, Gould is widely regarded as one of the great villains of his era, with few defenders then or now. Early life and education Gould was born in Roxbury, New York, to Mary More (1798‚Äì1841) and John Burr Gould (1792‚Äì1866). His maternal grandfather Alexander T. More was a businessman, and his great-grandfather John More was a Scottish immigrant who founded the town of Moresville, New York. Gould studied at the Hobart Academy in Hobart, New York, paying his way by bookkeeping. History of Hobart High School As a young boy, he decided that he wanted nothing to do with farming, his father's profession, so his father dropped him off at a nearby school with 50 cents and a sack of clothes.H. W. Brands \\"Masters of Enterprise\\" Early career Jay Gould (right) in 1855 Gould's school principal was credited with getting him a job as a bookkeeper for a blacksmith.GOULD'S EVENTFUL LIFE, https://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1892/12/03/104101825.pdf A year later, the blacksmith offered him half interest in the blacksmith shop, which he sold to his father during the early part of 1854. Gould devoted himself to private study, emphasizing surveying and mathematics. In 1854, he surveyed and created maps of the Ulster County, New York, area. In 1856, he published History of Delaware County, and Border Wars of New York, which he had spent several years writing. Keystone Marker for Gouldsboro, Pennsylvania, named after Gould In 1856, Gould entered a partnership with Zadock Pratt to create a tanning business in Pennsylvania in an area that was later named Gouldsboro. He eventually bought out Pratt, who retired. In 1856, Gould entered a partnership with Charles Mortimer Leupp, a son-in-law of Gideon Lee and one of the leading leather merchants in the United States. The partnership was successful, until the Panic of 1857. Leupp lost all his money in that financial crisis, but Gould took advantage of the depreciation in property value and bought up former partnership properties. The Gouldsboro Tannery became a disputed property after Leupp's death. Leupp's brother-in-law David W. Lee was also a partner in Leupp and Gould, and he took armed control of the tannery. He believed that Gould had cheated the Leupp and Lee families in the collapse of the business. Gould eventually took physical possession, but he was later forced to sell his shares in the company to Lee's brother.\\"David Williamson Lee's Career\\", New York Times, January 21, 1886. Railroad investing In 1859, Gould began speculative investing by buying stock in small railways. His father-in-law Daniel S. Miller introduced him to the railroad industry by suggesting that Gould help him save his investment in the Rutland and Washington Railroad in the Panic of 1857. Gould purchased stock for 10 cents on the dollar, which left him in control of the company. He engaged in more speculation on railroad stocks in New York City throughout the Civil War, and he was appointed manager of the Rensselaer and Saratoga Railroad in 1863. The Erie Railroad encountered financial troubles in the 1850s, despite receiving loans from financiers Cornelius Vanderbilt and Daniel Drew. It entered receivership in 1859 and was reorganized as the Erie Railway. Gould, Drew, and James Fisk engaged in stock manipulations known as the Erie War, and Drew, Fisk, and Vanderbilt lost control of the Erie in the summer of 1868, while Gould became its president.Schafer, Mike (2000). More Classic American Railroads. MBI Publishing Company. p. 47. . Retrieved September 22, 2016. It was during the same period that Gould and Fisk became involved with Tammany Hall, the Democratic Party political machine that largely ran New York City at the time. They made its boss, William M. Tweed, a director of the Erie Railroad, and Tweed arranged favorable legislation. Tweed and Gould became the subjects of political cartoons by Thomas Nast in 1869. Gould was the chief bondsman in October 1871 when Tweed was held on $1 million bail. Tweed was eventually convicted of corruption and died in jail. Black Friday In August 1869, Gould and Fisk began to buy gold in an attempt to corner the market, hoping that the increase in the price of gold would increase the price of wheat and motivate western farmers to sell. This, in turn, would cause a great amount of shipping eastward, increasing freight business for the Erie Railroad. During this time, Gould used contacts with President Ulysses S. Grant's brother-in-law Abel Corbin to influence the president and his Secretary General Horace Porter. These speculations culminated in the panic of Black Friday on September 24, 1869, when the premium over face value fell on a gold Double Eagle from 62 percent to 35 percent. Gould made a small profit from this operation by hedging against his own attempted corner as it was about to collapse, but he lost it in subsequent lawsuits. The gold corner established Gould's reputation in the press as an all-powerful figure who could drive the market up and down at will. Lord Gordon-Gordon Lord Gordon-Gordon In 1873, Gould attempted to take control of the Erie Railroad by recruiting foreign investments from Lord Gordon-Gordon, supposedly a cousin of the wealthy Campbell clan who was buying land for immigrants. He bribed Gordon-Gordon with a million dollars in stock, but Gordon-Gordon was an impostor and cashed the stock immediately. Gould sued him, and the case went to trial in March 1873. In court, Gordon-Gordon gave the names of the Europeans whom he claimed to represent, and he was granted bail while the references were checked. He immediately fled to Canada, where he convinced authorities that the charges were false. Having failed to convince Canadian authorities to hand over Gordon-Gordon, Gould attempted to kidnap Gordon- Gordon with the help of his associates and future members of Congress Loren Fletcher, John Gilfillan, and Eugene McLanahan Wilson. The group captured him successfully, but they were stopped and arrested by the North-West Mounted Police before they could return to the US. Canadian authorities put them in prison and refused them bail, and this led to an international incident between the United States and Canada. Governor Horace Austin of Minnesota demanded their return when he learned that they had been denied bail, and he put the local militia on full readiness, and thousands of Minnesotans volunteered for an invasion of Canada. After negotiations, the Canadian authorities released them on bail. Gordon-Gordon was eventually ordered to be deported but committed suicide before the order could be carried out. =Western railroads= Cartoon depicting Wall Street as \\"Jay Gould's Private Bowling Alley\\" Lyndhurst which he purchased in 1880 After being forced out of the Erie Railroad, Gould started to build up a system of railroads in the midwest and west. He took control of the Union Pacific in 1873 when its stock was depressed by the Panic of 1873, and he built a viable railroad that depended on shipments from farmers and ranchers. He immersed himself in every operational and financial detail of the Union Pacific system, building an encyclopedic knowledge and acting decisively to shape its destiny. Biographer Maury Klein states that \\"he revised its financial structure, waged its competitive struggles, captained its political battles, revamped its administration, formulated its rate policies, and promoted the development of resources along its lines.\\"Maury Klein, Jay Gould, (1966) p 147Maury Klein, \\"In Search of Jay Gould.\\" Business History Review 52#2 (1978): 166-199. By 1879, Gould gained control of three more important western railroads, including the Missouri Pacific Railroad. He controlled 10,000 miles (16,000 km) of railway, about one-ninth of the rail in the United States at that time, and he had controlling interest in 15 percent of the country's railway tracks by 1882. The railroads were making profits and set their own rates, and his wealth increased dramatically. He withdrew from management of the Union Pacific in 1883 amid political controversy over its debts to the federal government, but he realized a large profit for himself. He obtained a controlling interest in the Western Union telegraph company and in the elevated railways in New York City after 1881. In 1889, he organized the Terminal Railroad Association of St. Louis which acquired a bottleneck in east‚Äìwest railroad traffic at St. Louis, but the government brought an antitrust suit to eliminate the bottleneck control after Gould died.United States v.

The word Deitsch corresponds with the High German word Deutsch (in standard German), meaning \\"German\\", and is how the first settlers would have described themselves in the principal dialect spoken: Palatine German. Most of these settlers emigrated in the 17th and 18th centuries to America and spoke unique dialects within the German language family, but it is through their cross-dialogue interaction and what was retained by subsequent generations that a hybrid dialect emerged, known as Pennsylvania German or Pennsylvania Dutch, which has resonance to this day. The Pennsylvania Dutch maintained numerous religious affiliations, with the greatest number being Lutheran or German Reformed, but also with many Anabaptists, including Mennonites, Amish, and Brethren. The Anabaptist religions promoted a simple life-style, and their adherents were known as Plain people or Plain Dutch. This was in contrast to the Fancy Dutch, who tended to assimilate more easily into the American mainstream. Other religions were also represented by the late 1700s, in smaller numbers. Etymology The word \\"Dutch\\" in \\"Pennsylvania Dutch\\" comes from the Pennsylvania German endonym Deitsch, which means \\"Pennsylvania Dutch / German\\" or \\"German\\".Hughes Oliphant Old: The Reading and Preaching of the Scriptures in the Worship of the Christian Church, Volume 6: The Modern Age.

Beck et al., Zur Geschichte der Gleichung \\"germanisch-deutsch\\" (2004), 199-228 The continued use of \\"Pennsylvania Dutch\\" was strengthened by the Pennsylvania Dutch in the 19th century as a way of distinguishing themselves from later (post 1830) waves of German immigrants to the United States, with the Pennsylvania Dutch referring to themselves as Deitsche and to Germans as Deitschlenner (\\"Germany-ers\\", compare Deutschland-er) whom they saw as a related but distinct group.Mark L. Louden: Pennsylvania Dutch: The Story of an American Language. JHU Press, 2006, p.3-4 After the Second World War, use of Pennsylvania German virtually died out in favor of English, except among the more insular and tradition-bound Anabaptists, such as the Old Order Amish and Old Order Mennonites. A number of German cultural practices continue to this day, and German Americans remain the largest ancestry group claimed in Pennsylvania by people in the census. Geography The Pennsylvania Dutch live primarily in Southeastern and in Pennsylvania Dutch Country, a large area that includes South Central Pennsylvania, in the area stretching in an arc from Bethlehem and Allentown through Reading, Lebanon, and Lancaster to York and Chambersburg. Some Pennsylvania Dutch live in the historically Pennsylvania Dutch-speaking areas of Maryland, North Carolina, and Virginia's Shenandoah Valley. Immigrants from the Palatinate of the Rhine Many Pennsylvania Dutch were descendants of refugees who had left religious persecution in the Netherlands and the Palatinate of the German Rhine. For example, some Amish and Mennonites came to the Palatinate and surrounding areas from the German-speaking part of Switzerland, where, as Anabaptists, they were persecuted, and so their stay in the Palatinate was of limited duration.Newman, George F., Newman, Dieter E. (2003). The Aebi-Eby Families of Switzerland, Germany, Austria, and North America, 1550‚Äì1850. Pennsylvania: NMN Enterprises. Most of the Pennsylvania Dutch have roots going much further back in the Palatinate. During the War of the Grand Alliance (1689‚Äì97), French troops pillaged the Palatinate, forcing many Germans to flee. The war began in 1688 as Louis XIV laid claim to the Electorate of the Palatinate. French forces devastated all major cities of the region, including Cologne. By 1697 the war came to a close with the Treaty of Ryswick, now Rijswijk in the Netherlands, and the Palatinate remained free of French control. However, by 1702, the War of the Spanish Succession began, lasting until 1713. French expansionism forced many Palatines to flee as refugees.Roeber 1988 Immigration to the United States Diagram indicating Pennsylvania Dutch (Pennsylvania German) settlement in the United States Pictures from Old- Germantown. Shown here is the first log cabin of Pastorius about 1683, Pastorius' later house about 1715, print shop and house of Saurs about 1735, and the market square about 1820. The devastation of the Thirty Years' War (1618‚Äì1648) and the wars between the German principalities and France caused some of the immigration of Germans to America from the Rhine area. Members of this group founded the borough of Germantown, in northwest Philadelphia County, Pennsylvania, in 1683. They settled on land sold to them by William Penn. Germantown included not only Mennonites but also Quakers. This group of Mennonites was organized by Francis Daniel Pastorius, an agent for a land purchasing company based in Frankfurt am Main. None of the Frankfurt Company ever came to Pennsylvania except Pastorius himself, but 13 Krefeld German (South Guelderish-speaking) Mennonite families arrived on October 6, 1683, in Philadelphia. They were joined by eight more Dutch-speaking families from Hamburg-Altona in 1700 and five German-speaking families from the Palatinate in 1707. In 1723, some 33 Palatine families, dissatisfied under Governor Hunter's rule, migrated from Schoharie, New York, along the Susquehanna River to Tulpehocken, Berks County, Pennsylvania, where other Palatines had settled. They became farmers and used intensive German farming techniques that proved highly productive.Farley Grubb, \\"German Immigration to Pennsylvania, 1709 to 1820\\", Journal of Interdisciplinary History Vol. 20, No. 3 (Winter, 1990), pp. 417-436 in JSTOR Another wave of settlers from Germany, which would eventually coalesce to form a large part of the Pennsylvania Dutch, arrived between 1727 and 1775; some 65,000 Germans landed in Philadelphia in that era and others landed at other ports. Another wave from Germany arrived 1749-1754. Not all were Mennonites; some were Brethren or Quakers, for example. The majority originated in what is today southwestern Germany, i.e., Rhineland-Palatinate and Baden-W√ºrttemberg; other prominent groups were Alsatians, Dutch, French Huguenots (French Protestants), Moravians from Bohemia and Moravia and Germans from Switzerland. The Pennsylvania Dutch composed nearly half of the population of Pennsylvania and, except for the nonviolent Anabaptists, generally supported the Patriot cause in the American Revolution.John B. Stoudt \\"The German Press in Pennsylvania and the American Revolution\\". Pennsylvania Magazine of History and Biography 59 (1938): 74-90 online Henry Miller, an immigrant from Germany of Swiss ancestry, published an early German translation of the Declaration of Independence (1776) in his newspaper Philadelphische Staatsbote. Miller often wrote about Swiss history and myth, such as the William Tell legend, to provide a context for patriot support in the conflict with Britain.A. G.. Roeber, \\"Henry Miller's Staatsbote: A Revolutionary Journalist's Use of the Swiss Past\\", Yearbook of German-American Studies, 1990, Vol. 25, pp 57-76 Frederick Muhlenberg (1750‚Äì1801), a Lutheran pastor, became a major patriot and politician, rising to be elected as Speaker of the U.S. House of Representatives. Migration to Canada An early group, mainly from the Roxborough-Germantown area of Pennsylvania, emigrated to then colonial Nova Scotia in 1766 and founded the Township of Monckton, site of present day Moncton, New Brunswick. The extensive Steeves clan descends from this group.Bowser, Les (2016). The Settlers of Monckton Township, Omemee ON: 250th Publications. After the American Revolution, John Graves Simcoe, Lieutenant Governor of Upper Canada, invited Americans, including Mennonites and German Baptist Brethren, to settle in British North American territory and offered tracts of land to immigrant groups. This resulted in communities of Pennsylvania Dutch speakers' emigrating to Canada, many to the area called the German Company Tract, a subset of land within the Haldimand Tract, in the Township of Waterloo, which later became Waterloo County, Ontario. Some still live in the area around Markham, Ontario and particularly in the northern areas of the current Waterloo Region. Some members of the two communities formed the Markham-Waterloo Mennonite Conference. Today, the Pennsylvania Dutch language is mostly spoken by Old Order Mennonites. From 1800 to the 1830s, some Pennsylvania Dutch Mennonites in Upstate New York and Pennsylvania moved north to Canada, primarily to the area that would become Cambridge, Ontario, Kitchener, Ontario/Waterloo, Ontario and St. Jacobs, Ontario/Elmira, Ontario/Listowel, Ontario in Waterloo County, Ontario. Settlement started in 1800 by Joseph Schoerg and Samuel Betzner, Jr. (brothers-in-law), Mennonites, from Franklin County, Pennsylvania. Other settlers followed mostly from Pennsylvania typically by Conestoga wagons. Many of the pioneers arriving from Pennsylvania after November 1803 bought land in a 60,000 acre section established by a group of Mennonites from Lancaster County Pennsylvania, called the German Company Lands. Many of the Mennonite Germans from Pennsylvania arrived in Waterloo County in Conestoga wagons. Fewer of the Pennsylvania Dutch settled in what would later become the Greater Toronto Area in areas that would later be the towns of Altona, Ontario, Pickering, Ontario and especially Markham Village, Ontario and Stouffville, Ontario. Peter Reesor and brother-in-law Abraham Stouffer were higher profile settlers in Markham and Stouffville. William Berczy, a German entrepreneur and artist, had settled in upstate New York and in May 1794, he was able to obtain 64,000 acres in Markham Township, near the current city of Toronto, Ontario. Berczy arrived with approximately 190 German families from Pennsylvania and settled here. Others later moved to other locations in the general area, including a hamlet they founded, German Mills, Ontario, named for its grist mill; that community is now called Thornhill, Ontario), in the township that is now part of York Region. Religion The immigrants of the 1600s and 1700s who were known as the Pennsylvania Dutch included Mennonites, Swiss Brethren (also called Mennonites by the locals) and Amish but also Anabaptist-Pietists such as German Baptist Brethren and those who belonged to German Lutheran or German Reformed Church congregations. Other settlers of that era were of the Moravian Church while a few were Seventh Day Baptists. Calvinist Palatines and several other religions to a lesser extent were also represented. Over 60% of the immigrants who arrived in Pennsylvania from Germany or Switzerland in the 1700s and 1800s were Lutherans and they maintained good relations with those of the German Reformed Church. The two groups founded Franklin College (now Franklin & Marshall College) in 1787. Henry Muhlenberg (1711‚Äì1787) founded the Lutheran Church in America. He organized the Ministerium of Pennsylvania in 1748, set out the standard organizational format for new churches and helped shape Lutheran liturgy.Leonard R. Riforgiato, Missionary of moderation: Henry Melchior Muhlenberg and the Lutheran Church in America (1980) Muhlenberg was sent by the Lutheran bishops in Germany, and he always insisted on strict conformity to Lutheran dogma. Muhlenberg's view of church unity was in direct opposition to Nicolaus Ludwig Zinzendorf's Moravian approach, with its goal of uniting various Pennsylvania German religious groups under a less rigid \\"Congregation of God in the Spirit\\". The differences between the two approaches led to permanent impasse between Lutherans and Moravians, especially after a December 1742 meeting in Philadelphia.Samuel R. Zeiser, \\"Moravians and Lutherans: Getting beyond the Zinzendorf-Muhlenberg Impasse\\", Transactions of the Moravian Historical Society, 1994, Vol. 28, pp. 15‚Äì29 The Moravians settled Bethlehem and nearby areas and established schools for Native Americans.

Devised to ‚Äúimpress people with the skill of pilots and the sturdiness of planes,‚Äù it became popular in the United States during the Roaring Twenties. Barnstormers were pilots who flew throughout the country selling airplane rides and performing stunts; Charles Lindbergh first began flying in this capacity. Barnstorming was the first major form of civil aviation in the history of aviation. History =Background= An advertising poster for the early flying exhibition team, the Moisant International Aviators The Wright brothers and Glenn Curtiss had early flying exhibition teams, with solo flyers like Lincoln Beachey and Didier Masson also popular before World War I, but barnstorming did not become a formal phenomenon until the 1920s. The first barnstormer, taught to fly by Curtiss in 1909, was one Charles Foster Willard, who is also credited as the first to be shot down in an airplane when an annoyed farmer broke his propellor firing a squirrel gun. During World War I, the United States manufactured a significant number of Curtiss JN-4 ‚ÄúJenny‚Äù biplanes to train its military aviators and almost every U.S. airman learned to fly using the plane. After the war the U.S. federal government sold off the surplus material, including the Jennys, for a fraction of its initial value (they had cost the government $5,000 but were being sold for as low as $200). This allowed many servicemen who already knew how to fly the JN-4s to purchase their own planes. The similar-looking Standard J-1 biplane was also available. At the same time, numerous aircraft manufacturing companies sprang up, most failing after building only a handful of planes. Many of these were reliable and even advanced designs which suffered from the failure of the aviation market to expand as expected, and a number of these found their way into the only active markets‚Äîmail carrying, barnstorming, and smuggling. Sometimes a plane and its owner would drift between the three activities as opportunity presented. Combined with the lack of Federal Aviation Regulations at the time, these factors allowed barnstorming to flourish. =Growth and heyday= Barnstorming was performed not only by former military men, but also by women, minorities, and women minorities (e.g., Bessie Coleman). For example, on July 18, 1915, Katherine Stinson became the first woman in the world to perform a loop. Bessie Coleman, an African-American woman, ‚Äúnot only thrilled audiences with her skills as a barnstormer, but she also became a role model for women and African Americans. Her very presence in the air threatened prevailing contemporary stereotypes. She also fought segregation when she could by using her influence as a celebrity.‚Äù ‚ÄúMore than any single event, Lindbergh's historic 1927 flight made Americans aware of the potential of commercial aviation, and there followed a boom in aviation activity during 1928 and 1929.‚Äù In fact, Charles Lindbergh engaged in barnstorming in his early years; Errold Bahl hired him as an assistant, and as a promotional stunt, Lindbergh ‚Äúvolunteered to climb out onto the wing and wave to the crowds below,‚Äù which came to be known as ‚Äúwing-walking.‚Äù =Regulation and decline= The sensational journalism and economic prosperity that marked the Jazz Age in the United States allowed barnstormers to publicize aviation and eventually contributed to bringing about regulation and control. In 1925, the U.S. government began regulating aviation, when it passed the Contract Air Mail Act, which allowed the U.S. Post Office to hire private airlines to deliver mail with payments made based on the weight of the mail. The following year, President Calvin Coolidge signed the Air Commerce Act, which shifted the management of air routes to a new branch in the Department of Commerce, which was also responsible for ‚Äúlicensing of planes and pilots, establishing safety regulations, and general promotion.‚Äù Barnstorming ‚Äúseemed to be founded on bravado, with ‚Äòone-upmanship‚Äô a major incentive.‚Äù By 1927, competition among barnstormers resulted in their performing increasingly dangerous tricks, and a rash of highly publicized accidents led to new safety regulations, which led to the demise of barnstorming. Spurred by a perceived need to protect the public and in response to political pressure by local pilots upset at barnstormers stealing their customers, the federal government enacted laws to regulate a fledgling civil aviation sector. Breitling Wingwalkers The laws included safety standards and specifications that were virtually impossible for barnstormers to meet, and restrictions on how low in altitude certain tricks could be performed (making it harder for spectators to see what was happening). The military also stopped selling Jennys in the late 1920s. This made it too difficult for barnstormers to make a living. Clyde Pangborn, who was pilot of the two-man aviation team who were the first to cross the Pacific Ocean nonstop in 1931, ended his barnstorming career in 1931. Some pilots, however, continued to wander the country giving rides as late as fall 1941.  Performances =Planning= ‚ÄúBarnstorming season‚Äù ran from early spring until after the harvest and county fairs in the fall. Most barnstorming shows started with a pilot, or team of pilots flying over a small rural town to attract local attention. They would then land at a local farm (hence the term ‚Äúbarnstorming‚Äù) and negotiate for the use of a field as a temporary runway from which to stage an air show and offer airplane rides. After obtaining a base of operation, the pilot or group of aviators would ‚Äúbuzz‚Äù the village and drop flyers. In some towns the arrival of a barnstormer or an aerial troupe would lead to a town-wide shutdown as people attended the show. =Stunts= Barnstormers performed a variety of stunts, with some specializing as stunt pilots or aerialists. Stunt pilots performed a variety of aerobatic maneuvers, including spins, dives, loop-the-loops and barrel rolls. Meanwhile, aerialists performed feats of wing walking, stunt parachuting, midair plane transfers, or even playing tennis, target shooting, and dancing on the plane's wings. Other stunts included nose dives and flying through barns, which sometimes led to pilots crashing their planes. =Business= Barnstormers offered plane rides for a small fee. Charles Lindbergh, for example, charged five dollars for a 15-minute ride in his plane. However exciting and glamorous, it was not an easy way to make a steady living. To make ends meet, the barnstormers‚Äîincluding Charles Lindbergh‚Äîhad to moonlight as flying instructors, handymen, and sometimes even as gas station attendants. Barnstormers often traded plane rides for room and board, both for commercial lodging and in private homes. =Flying circuses= Although barnstormers often worked in solitude or in very small teams, some also put together large ‚Äúflying circuses‚Äù with several planes and stunt people. These acts employed promoters to book shows in towns ahead of time. They were the largest and most organized of all of the barnstorming acts. Some of the most famous were ‚ÄúThe Five Blackbirds‚Äù (an African American flying group), ‚ÄúThe Flying Aces Air Circus,‚Äù ‚ÄúThe 13 Black Cats,‚Äù ‚ÄúMabel Cody‚Äôs Flying Circus,‚Äù ‚ÄúInman Brothers Flying Circus,‚Äù and the ‚ÄúGates Flying Circus,‚Äù to which Clyde Pangborn belonged until 1928. Significance At an individual level, barnstorming ‚Äúprovided an exciting and challenging way to make a living, as well as an outlet for their creativity and showmanship‚Äù for many pilots and stunt fliers. For example, it allowed Charles Lindbergh to make a marginal living, and he always spoke fondly of the ‚Äúold flying days‚Äù and the freedom of movement. It was during a barnstorming tour in Minnesota and Wisconsin in 1923 that led to his ‚Äúdecision to pursue further formal instruction with the U.S. Army Air Service.‚Äù Cadet Squadron 23 at the United States Air Force Academy is known as the ‚ÄúBarnstormers.‚Äù Notable barnstormers * Jimmy Angel * Pancho Barnes * Lincoln Beachey * Lillian Boyer * Carter Buton * Alan Cobham * Bessie Coleman * Doug Davis * Carl Ben Eielson * Roland Garros * Tex Johnston * Hubert Julian * William Carpenter Lambert * Charles Lindbergh * Didier Masson * John Moisant * Clyde Pangborn * Louis Paulhan * Adolphe Pegoud * Wiley Post * Harriet Quimby * Abraham Whalomie Raygorodsky * Ren√© Simon * Dean Smith * Roscoe Turner * Ernst Udet In popular culture =Books= * William Faulkner's 1935 novel Pylon tells the story of a group of barnstormers * Nevil Shute's 1951 novel Round the Bend gives a detailed account of the activities of Alan Cobham's National Aviation Day.

French reconnaissance balloon L'Intr√©pide of 1796, the oldest existing flying device, in the Heeresgeschichtliches Museum, Vienna. Leonardo da Vinci's ornithopter design Aviation timeline The history of aviation extends for more than two thousand years, from the earliest forms of aviation such as kites and attempts at tower jumping to supersonic and hypersonic flight by powered, heavier-than-air jets. Kite flying in China dates back to several hundred years BC and slowly spread around the world. It is thought to be the earliest example of man-made flight. Leonardo da Vinci's 15th-century dream of flight found expression in several rational but unscientific designs, though he did not attempt to construct any of them. The discovery of hydrogen gas in the 18th century led to the invention of the hydrogen balloon, at almost exactly the same time that the Montgolfier brothers rediscovered the hot-air balloon and began manned flights. Various theories in mechanics by physicists during the same period of time, notably fluid dynamics and Newton's laws of motion, led to the foundation of modern aerodynamics, most notably by Sir George Cayley. Balloons, both free-flying and tethered, began to be used for military purposes from the end of the 18th century, with the French government establishing Balloon Companies during the Revolution.Hallion (2003) Experiments with gliders provided the groundwork for heavier-than-air craft, and by the early-20th century, advances in engine technology and aerodynamics made controlled, powered flight possible for the first time. The modern aeroplane with its characteristic tail was established by 1909 and from then on the history of the aeroplane became tied to the development of more and more powerful engines. The first great ships of the air were the rigid dirigible balloons pioneered by Ferdinand von Zeppelin, which soon became synonymous with airships and dominated long-distance flight until the 1930s, when large flying boats became popular. After World War II, the flying boats were in their turn replaced by land planes, and the new and immensely powerful jet engine revolutionised both air travel and military aviation. In the latter part of the 20th century, the advent of digital electronics produced great advances in flight instrumentation and \\"fly-by-wire\\" systems. The 21st century saw the large-scale use of pilotless drones for military, civilian and leisure use. With digital controls, inherently unstable aircraft such as flying wings became possible. Etymology The term aviation, noun of action from stem of Latin avis \\"bird\\" with suffix -ation meaning action or progress, was coined in 1863 by French pioneer Guillaume Joseph Gabriel de La Landelle (1812‚Äì1886) in \\"Aviation ou Navigation a√©rienne sans ballons\\". Primitive beginnings =Tower jumping= Daedalus working on Icarus' wings. Since antiquity, there have been stories of men strapping birdlike wings, stiffened cloaks or other devices to themselves and attempting to fly, typically by jumping off a tower. The Greek legend of Daedalus and Icarus is one of the earliest known; others originated from ancient AsiaBook of Han, Biography of Wang Mang, ÊàñË®ÄËÉΩÈ£ûÔºå‰∏ÄÊó•ÂçÉÈáåÔºåÂèØÁ™•ÂåàÂ•¥„ÄÇËéΩËæÑËØï‰πãÔºåÂèñÂ§ßÈ∏üÁøÆ‰∏∫‰∏§ÁøºÔºåÂ§¥‰∏éË∫´ÁöÜËëóÊØõÔºåÈÄöÂºïÁéØÁ∫ΩÔºåÈ£ûÊï∞ÁôæÊ≠•Â†ï and the European Middle Age. During this early period, the issues of lift, stability and control were not understood, and most attempts ended in serious injury or death. The Andalusian scientist Abbas ibn Firnas (810‚Äì887 AD) is claimed to have made a jump in C√≥rdoba, Spain, covering his body with vulture feathers and attaching two wings to his arms. Muhammad I of C√≥rdoba's 9th-century court poet Mu'min ibn Said and 17th-century Algerian historian Ahmed Mohammed al-Maqqari, based on sources no longer extant, recount that Firnas flew some distance before landing with some injuries, attributed to his lacking a tail (as birds use to land).Lynn Townsend White, Jr. (Spring, 1961). \\"Eilmer of Malmesbury, an Eleventh Century Aviator: A Case Study of Technological Innovation, Its Context and Tradition\\", Technology and Culture 2 (2), pp. 97‚Äì111 [101] According to John Harding, Ibn Firnas' glider was the first attempt at heavier-than-air flight in aviation history.The Aviation History: New Aircraft I - Color by Relly Victoria Petrescu, Florian Ion Petrescu, Page 7, Writing in the 12th century, William of Malmesbury stated that the 11th-century Benedictine monk Eilmer of Malmesbury attached wings to his hands and feet and flew a short distance, but broke both legs while landing, also having neglected to make himself a tail. Many others made well-documented jumps in the following centuries. As late as 1811, Albrecht Berblinger constructed an ornithopter and jumped into the Danube at Ulm. =Kites= Woodcut print of a kite from John Bate's 1635 book The Mysteryes of Nature and Art. The kite may have been the first form of man-made aircraft. It was invented in China possibly as far back as the 5th century BC by Mozi (Mo Di) and Lu Ban (Gongshu Ban). Later designs often emulated flying insects, birds, and other beasts, both real and mythical. Some were fitted with strings and whistles to make musical sounds while flying. Ancient and medieval Chinese sources describe kites being used to measure distances, test the wind, lift men, signal, and communicate and send messages. Kites spread from China around the world. After its introduction into India, the kite further evolved into the fighter kite, where an abrasive line is used to cut down other kites. Man-carrying kites Man-carrying kites are believed to have been used extensively in ancient China, for both civil and military purposes and sometimes enforced as a punishment. An early recorded flight was that of the prisoner Yuan Huangtou, a Chinese prince, in the 6th century AD.Hallion (2003) page 9. Stories of man- carrying kites also occur in Japan, following the introduction of the kite from China around the seventh century AD. It is said that at one time there was a Japanese law against man-carrying kites.Pelham, D.; The Penguin book of kites, Penguin (1976) = Rotor wings = The use of a rotor for vertical flight has existed since 400 BC in the form of the bamboo-copter, an ancient Chinese toy. The similar \\"moulinet √† noix\\" (rotor on a nut) appeared in Europe in the 14th century AD. =Hot air balloons= A sky lantern. From ancient times the Chinese have understood that hot air rises and have applied the principle to a type of small hot air balloon called a sky lantern. A sky lantern consists of a paper balloon under or just inside which a small lamp is placed. Sky lanterns are traditionally launched for pleasure and during festivals. According to Joseph Needham, such lanterns were known in China from the 3rd century BC. Their military use is attributed to the general Zhuge Liang (180‚Äì234 AD, honorific title Kongming), who is said to have used them to scare the enemy troops. There is evidence that the Chinese also \\"solved the problem of aerial navigation\\" using balloons, hundreds of years before the 18th century. = Renaissance = One of Leonardo's sketches Eventually, after Ibn Firnas's construction, some investigators began to discover and define some of the basics of rational aircraft design. Most notable of these was Leonardo da Vinci, although his work remained unknown until 1797, and so had no influence on developments over the next three hundred years. While his designs are rational, they are not scientific, and particularly underestimate the amount of power that would be needed. Leonardo studied bird and bat flight, claiming the superiority of the latter owing to its unperforated wing. He analyzed these and anticipating many principles of aerodynamics. He understood that \\"An object offers as much resistance to the air as the air does to the object.\\" Isaac Newton would not publish his third law of motion until 1687. From the last years of the 15th century until 1505, Leonardo wrote about and sketched many designs for flying machines and mechanisms, including ornithopters, fixed-wing gliders, rotorcraft (perhaps inspired by whirligig toys), parachutes (in the form of a wooden-framed pyramidal tent) and a wind speed gauge. His early designs were man-powered and included ornithopters and rotorcraft; however he came to realise the impracticality of this and later turned to controlled gliding flight, also sketching some designs powered by a spring. According to one commonly repeated, albeit certainly fictional story, in 1505 Leonardo or one of his pupils attempted to fly from the summit of Monte Ceceri. Lighter than air =Beginnings of modern theories= In 1670, Francesco Lana de Terzi published a work that suggested lighter than air flight would be possible by using copper foil spheres that, containing a vacuum, would be lighter than the displaced air to lift an airship. While theoretically sound, his design was not feasible: the pressure of the surrounding air would crush the spheres. The idea of using a vacuum to produce lift is now known as vacuum airship but remains unfeasible with any current materials. In 1709, Bartolomeu de Gusm√£o presented a petition to King John V of Portugal, begging for support for his invention of an airship, in which he expressed the greatest confidence. The public test of the machine, which was set for 24 June 1709, did not take place. According to contemporary reports, however, Gusm√£o appears to have made several less ambitious experiments with this machine, descending from eminences. It is certain that Gusm√£o was working on this principle at the public exhibition he gave before the Court on 8 August 1709, in the hall of the Casa da √çndia in Lisbon, when he propelled a ball to the roof by combustion. = Balloons = 1783 was a watershed year for ballooning and aviation. Between 4 June and 1 December, five aviation firsts were achieved in France: * On 4 June, the Montgolfier brothers demonstrated their unmanned hot air balloon at Annonay, France. * On 27 August, Jacques Charles and the Robert brothers (Les Freres Robert) launched the world's first unmanned hydrogen-filled balloon, from the Champ de Mars, Paris. * On 19 October, the Montgolfiers launched the first manned flight, a tethered balloon with humans on board, at the Folie Titon in Paris. The aviators were the scientist Jean-Fran√ßois Pil√¢tre de Rozier, the manufacture manager Jean- Baptiste R√©veillon, and Giroud de Villette. * On 21 November, the Montgolfiers launched the first free flight with human passengers. King Louis XVI had originally decreed that condemned criminals would be the first pilots, but Jean-Fran√ßois Pil√¢tre de Rozier, along with the Marquis Fran√ßois d'Arlandes, successfully petitioned for the honor. They drifted in a balloon-powered by a wood fire. * On 1 December, Jacques Charles and the Nicolas-Louis Robert launched their manned hydrogen balloon from the Jardin des Tuileries in Paris, as a crowd of 400,000 witnessed. They ascended to a height of about [15] and landed at sunset in Nesles-la-Vall√©e after a flight of 2 hours and 5 minutes, covering 36 km. After Robert alighted Charles decided to ascend alone. This time he ascended rapidly to an altitude of about , where he saw the sun again, suffered extreme pain in his ears, and never flew again. Ballooning became a major \\"rage\\" in Europe in the late 18th century, providing the first detailed understanding of the relationship between altitude and the atmosphere. Non- steerable balloons were employed during the American Civil War by the Union Army Balloon Corps. The young Ferdinand von Zeppelin first flew as a balloon passenger with the Union Army of the Potomac in 1863. In the early 1900s, ballooning was a popular sport in Britain. These privately owned balloons usually used coal gas as the lifting gas. This has half the lifting power of hydrogen so the balloons had to be larger, however, coal gas was far more readily available and the local gas works sometimes provided a special lightweight formula for ballooning events.Walker (1971) Volume I, Page 195. = Airships = Santos-Dumont's \\"Number 6\\" rounding the Eiffel Tower in the process of winning the Deutsch de la Meurthe Prize, October 1901. Airships were originally called \\"dirigible balloons\\" and are still sometimes called dirigibles today. Work on developing a steerable (or dirigible) balloon continued sporadically throughout the 19th century. The first powered, controlled, sustained lighter-than-air flight is believed to have taken place in 1852 when Henri Giffard flew in France, with a steam engine driven craft. Another advance was made in 1884, when the first fully controllable free- flight was made in a French Army electric-powered airship, La France, by Charles Renard and Arthur Krebs. The long, airship covered in 23 minutes with the aid of an 8¬Ω horsepower electric motor. However, these aircraft were generally short-lived and extremely frail. Routine, controlled flights would not occur until the advent of the internal combustion engine (see below.) The first aircraft to make routine controlled flights were non-rigid airships (sometimes called \\"blimps\\".) The most successful early pioneering pilot of this type of aircraft was the Brazilian Alberto Santos-Dumont who effectively combined a balloon with an internal combustion engine. On 19 October 1901, he flew his airship Number 6 over Paris from the Parc de Saint Cloud around the Eiffel Tower and back in under 30 minutes to win the Deutsch de la Meurthe prize. Santos-Dumont went on to design and build several aircraft. The subsequent controversy surrounding his and others' competing claims with regard to aircraft overshadowed his great contribution to the development of airships. At the same time that non-rigid airships were starting to have some success, the first successful rigid airships were also being developed. These would be far more capable than fixed-wing aircraft in terms of pure cargo carrying capacity for decades. Rigid airship design and advancement was pioneered by the German count Ferdinand von Zeppelin. Construction of the first Zeppelin airship began in 1899 in a floating assembly hall on Lake Constance in the Bay of Manzell, Friedrichshafen. This was intended to ease the starting procedure, as the hall could easily be aligned with the wind. The prototype airship LZ 1 (LZ for \\"Luftschiff Zeppelin\\") had a length of was driven by two Daimler engines and balanced by moving a weight between its two nacelles. Its first flight, on 2 July 1900, lasted for only 18 minutes, as LZ 1 was forced to land on the lake after the winding mechanism for the balancing weight had broken. Upon repair, the technology proved its potential in subsequent flights, bettering the 6 m/s speed attained by the French airship La France by 3 m/s, but could not yet convince possible investors. It would be several years before the Count was able to raise enough funds for another try. Although airships were used in both World War I and II, and continue on a limited basis to this day, their development has been largely overshadowed by heavier-than-air craft. Heavier than air =17th and 18th centuries= Italian inventor Tito Livio Burattini, invited by the Polish King W≈Çadys≈Çaw IV to his court in Warsaw, built a model aircraft with four fixed glider wings in 1647. Described as \\"four pairs of wings attached to an elaborate 'dragon'\\", it was said to have successfully lifted a cat in 1648 but not Burattini himself. He promised that \\"only the most minor injuries\\" would result from landing the craft.Qtd. in His \\"Dragon Volant\\" is considered \\"the most elaborate and sophisticated aeroplane to be built before the 19th Century\\".[\\"Burattini's Flying Dragon\\", FLIGHT International, 9 May 1963  ] The first published paper on aviation was \\"Sketch of a Machine for Flying in the Air\\" by Emanuel Swedenborg published in 1716. This flying machine consisted of a light frame covered with strong canvas and provided with two large oars or wings moving on a horizontal axis, arranged so that the upstroke met with no resistance while the downstroke provided lifting power. Swedenborg knew that the machine would not fly, but suggested it as a start and was confident that the problem would be solved. He wrote: \\"It seems easier to talk of such a machine than to put it into actuality, for it requires greater force and less weight than exists in a human body. The science of mechanics might perhaps suggest a means, namely, a strong spiral spring. If these advantages and requisites are observed, perhaps in time to come someone might know how better to utilize our sketch and cause some addition to be made so as to accomplish that which we can only suggest. Yet there are sufficient proofs and examples from nature that such flights can take place without danger, although when the first trials are made you may have to pay for the experience, and not mind an arm or leg\\". Swedenborg would prove prescient in his observation that a method of powering of an aircraft was one of the critical problems to be overcome. On 16 May 1793, the Spanish inventor Diego Mar√≠n Aguilera managed to cross the river Arandilla in Coru√±a del Conde, Castile, flying 300 ‚Äì 400 m, with a flying machine. =19th century= Balloon jumping replaced tower jumping, also demonstrating with typically fatal results that man-power and flapping wings were useless in achieving flight. At the same time scientific study of heavier-than-air flight began in earnest. In 1801, the French officer Andr√© Guillaume Resnier de Gou√© managed a 300-metre glide by starting from the top of the city walls of Angoul√™me and broke only one leg on arrival.A√©rost√®les, aeronautical memorial sites In 1837 French mathematician and brigadier general Isidore Didion stated, \\"Aviation will be successful only if one finds an engine whose ratio with the weight of the device to be supported will be larger than current steam machines or the strength developed by humans or most of the animals\\".Isidore Didion Rapport sur la plus grande vitesse que l'on peut obtenir par la navigation a√©rienne, Congr√®s scientifique de France, 5th session, Metz, September 1837. He answered to the 12th and last question of the congress (Mathematics and Physic Sciences section) : \\"Will it be possible to improve the aerostatic art, by a better combination of means used until now, in order to leave up aerostats and conduct them\\", thus showing the interest of the scientists of that time (first half of the XIXth) century on that question.  Sir George Cayley and the first modern aircraft  Sir George Cayley was first called the \\"father of the aeroplane\\" in 1846. During the last years of the previous century he had begun the first rigorous study of the physics of flight and would later design the first modern heavier-than- air craft. Among his many achievements, his most important contributions to aeronautics include: * Clarifying our ideas and laying down the principles of heavier-than-air flight. * Reaching a scientific understanding of the principles of bird flight. * Conducting scientific aerodynamic experiments demonstrating drag and streamlining, movement of the centre of pressure, and the increase in lift from curving the wing surface. * Defining the modern aeroplane configuration comprising a fixed-wing, fuselage and tail assembly. * Demonstrations of manned, gliding flight. * Setting out the principles of power-to-weight ratio in sustaining flight. Cayley's first innovation was to study the basic science of lift by adopting the whirling arm test rig for use in aircraft research and using simple aerodynamic models on the arm, rather than attempting to fly a model of a complete design. In 1799, he set down the concept of the modern aeroplane as a fixed-wing flying machine with separate systems for lift, propulsion, and control. In 1804, Cayley constructed a model glider which was the first modern heavier-than-air flying machine, having the layout of a conventional modern aircraft with an inclined wing towards the front and adjustable tail at the back with both tailplane and fin. A movable weight allowed adjustment of the model's centre of gravity.Gibbs-Smith 2003, p. 35 \\"Governable parachute\\" design of 1852 In 1809, goaded by the farcical antics of his contemporaries (see above), he began the publication of a landmark three-part treatise titled \\"On Aerial Navigation\\" (1809‚Äì1810).Cayley, George. \\"On Aerial Navigation\\" Part 1 , Part 2 , Part 3 Nicholson's Journal of Natural Philosophy, 1809‚Äì1810. (Via NASA). Raw text . Retrieved: 30 May 2010. In it he wrote the first scientific statement of the problem, \\"The whole problem is confined within these limits, viz. to make a surface support a given weight by the application of power to the resistance of air\\". He identified the four vector forces that influence an aircraft: thrust, lift, drag and weight and distinguished stability and control in his designs. He also identified and described the importance of the cambered aerofoil, dihedral, diagonal bracing and drag reduction, and contributed to the understanding and design of ornithopters and parachutes. In 1848, he had progressed far enough to construct a glider in the form of a triplane large and safe enough to carry a child. A local boy was chosen but his name is not known. He went on to publish in 1852 the design for a full-size manned glider or \\"governable parachute\\" to be launched from a balloon and then to construct a version capable of launching from the top of a hill, which carried the first adult aviator across Brompton Dale in 1853. Minor inventions included the rubber-powered motor, which provided a reliable power source for research models. By 1808, he had even re-invented the wheel, devising the tension- spoked wheel in which all compression loads are carried by the rim, allowing a lightweight undercarriage.Pritchard, J. Laurence. Summary of First Cayley Memorial Lecture at the Brough Branch of the Royal Aeronautical Society Flight number 2390 volume 66 page 702, 12 November 1954. Retrieved: 29 May 2010. \\"In thinking of how to construct the lightest possible wheel for aerial navigation cars, an entirely new mode of manufacturing this most useful part of locomotive machines occurred to me: vide, to do away with wooden spokes altogether, and refer the whole firmness of the wheel to the strength of the rim only, by the intervention of tight cording.\\" Age of steam Drawing directly from Cayley's work, Henson's 1842 design for an aerial steam carriage broke new ground. Although only a design, it was the first in history for a propeller-driven fixed-wing aircraft. 1843 artist's impression of John Stringfellow's plane \\"Ariel\\" flying over the Nile 1866 saw the founding of the Aeronautical Society of Great Britain and two years later the world's first aeronautical exhibition was held at the Crystal Palace, London, where John Stringfellow was awarded a ¬£100 prize for the steam engine with the best power-to-weight ratio.Jarrett 2002, p. 53.Stokes 2002, pp. 163‚Äì166, 167‚Äì168. In 1848, Stringfellow achieved the first powered flight using an unmanned wingspan steam-powered monoplane built in a disused lace factory in Chard, Somerset. Employing two contra-rotating propellers on the first attempt, made indoors, the machine flew ten feet before becoming destabilised, damaging the craft. The second attempt was more successful, the machine leaving a guidewire to fly freely, achieving thirty yards of straight and level powered flight.First to Fly By Thomas C Parramore, p.46 Francis Herbert Wenham presented the first paper to the newly formed Aeronautical Society (later the Royal Aeronautical Society), On Aerial Locomotion. He advanced Cayley's work on cambered wings, making important findings. To test his ideas, from 1858 he had constructed several gliders, both manned and unmanned, and with up to five stacked wings. He realised that long, thin wings are better than bat-like ones because they have more leading edge for their area. Today this relationship is known as the aspect ratio of a wing. The latter part of the 19th century became a period of intense study, characterized by the \\"gentleman scientists\\" who represented most research efforts until the 20th century. Among them was the British scientist-philosopher and inventor Matthew Piers Watt Boulton, who studied lateral flight control and was the first to patent an aileron control system in 1868. In 1871, Wenham and Browning made the first wind tunnel.{{refnFrank H. Wenham, inventor of the wind tunnel, 1871, was a fan, driven by a steam engine, propelled air down a tube to the model. F√©lix du Temple's 1874 Monoplane. Meanwhile, the British advances had galvanised French researchers. In 1857, F√©lix du Temple proposed a monoplane with a tailplane and retractable undercarriage. Developing his ideas with a model powered first by clockwork and later by steam, he eventually achieved a short hop with a full-size manned craft in 1874. It achieved lift-off under its own power after launching from a ramp, glided for a short time and returned safely to the ground, making it the first successful powered glide in history. In 1865, Louis Pierre Mouillard published an influential book The Empire Of The Air (l'Empire de l'Air). Jean-Marie Le Bris and his flying machine, Albatros II, 1868. In 1856, Frenchman Jean-Marie Le Bris made the first flight higher than his point of departure, by having his glider \\"L'Albatros artificiel pulled by a horse on a beach. He reportedly achieved a height of 100 meters, over a distance of 200 meters. Planophore model aeroplane by Alphonse P√©naud, 1871 Alphonse P√©naud, a Frenchman, advanced the theory of wing contours and aerodynamics and constructed successful models of aeroplanes, helicopters and ornithopters. In 1871 he flew the first aerodynamically stable fixed-wing aeroplane, a model monoplane he called the \\"Planophore\\", a distance of . P√©naud's model incorporated several of Cayley's discoveries, including the use of a tail, wing dihedral for inherent stability, and rubber power. The planophore also had longitudinal stability, being trimmed such that the tailplane was set at a smaller angle of incidence than the wings, an original and important contribution to the theory of aeronautics. P√©naud's later project for an amphibian aeroplane, although never built, incorporated other modern features. A tailless monoplane with a single vertical fin and twin tractor propellers, it also featured hinged rear elevator and rudder surfaces, retractable undercarriage and a fully enclosed, instrumented cockpit. The Aeroplane of Victor Tatin, 1879. Equally authoritative as a theorist was P√©naud's fellow countryman Victor Tatin. In 1879, he flew a model which, like P√©naud's project, was a monoplane with twin tractor propellers but also had a separate horizontal tail. It was powered by compressed air. Flown tethered to a pole, this was the first model to take off under its own power. In 1884, Alexandre Goupil published his work La Locomotion A√©rienne (Aerial Locomotion), although the flying machine he later constructed failed to fly. Cl√©ment Ader Avion III (1897 photograph). In 1890, the French engineer Cl√©ment Ader completed the first of three steam-driven flying machines, the √âole. On 9 October 1890, Ader made an uncontrolled hop of around ; this was the first manned airplane to take off under its own power. His Avion III of 1897, notable only for having twin steam engines, failed to fly:Jarrett 2002, p. 87. Ader would later claim success and was not debunked until 1910 when the French Army published its report on his attempt. Maxim's flying machine Sir Hiram Maxim was an American engineer who had moved to England. He built his own whirling arm rig and wind tunnel and constructed a large machine with a wingspan of , a length of , fore and aft horizontal surfaces and a crew of three. Twin propellers were powered by two lightweight compound steam engines each delivering . The overall weight was . It was intended as a test rig to investigate aerodynamic lift: lacking flight controls it ran on rails, with a second set of rails above the wheels to restrain it. Completed in 1894, on its third run it broke from the rail, became airborne for about 200 yards at two to three feet of altitudeFlyingmachines.org . Retrieved 31 March 2014. and was badly damaged upon falling back to the ground. It was subsequently repaired, but Maxim abandoned his experiments shortly afterwards. Learning to glide The Biot-Massia glider, restored and on display in the Musee de l'Air. In the last decade or so of the 19th century, a number of key figures were refining and defining the modern aeroplane. Lacking a suitable engine, aircraft work focused on stability and control in gliding flight. In 1879, Biot constructed a bird-like glider with the help of Massia and flew in it briefly. It is preserved in the Musee de l'Air, France, and is claimed to be the earliest man-carrying flying machine still in existence. The Englishman Horatio Phillips made key contributions to aerodynamics. He conducted extensive wind tunnel research on aerofoil sections, proving the principles of aerodynamic lift foreseen by Cayley and Wenham. His findings underpin all modern aerofoil design. Between 1883 and 1886, the American John Joseph Montgomery developed a series of three manned gliders, before conducting his own independent investigations into aerodynamics and circulation of lift. Otto Lilienthal, 29 May 1895. Otto Lilienthal became known as the \\"Glider King\\" or \\"Flying Man\\" of Germany. He duplicated Wenham's work and greatly expanded on it in 1884, publishing his research in 1889 as Birdflight as the Basis of Aviation (Der Vogelflug als Grundlage der Fliegekunst). He also produced a series of hang gliders, including bat-wing, monoplane and biplane forms, such as the Derwitzer Glider and Normal soaring apparatus. Starting in 1891, he became the first person to make controlled untethered glides routinely, and the first to be photographed flying a heavier-than-air machine, stimulating interest around the world. He rigorously documented his work, including photographs, and for this reason is one of the best known of the early pioneers. Lilienthal made over 2,000 glides until his death in 1896 from injuries sustained in a glider crash. Picking up where Lilienthal left off, Octave Chanute took up aircraft design after an early retirement, and funded the development of several gliders. In the summer of 1896, his team flew several of their designs eventually deciding that the best was a biplane design. Like Lilienthal, he documented and photographed his work. In Britain Percy Pilcher, who had worked for Maxim, built and successfully flew several gliders during the mid to late 1890s. The invention of the box kite during this period by the Australian Lawrence Hargrave would lead to the development of the practical biplane. In 1894, Hargrave linked four of his kites together, added a sling seat, and was the first to obtain lift with a heavier than air aircraft, when he flew up . Later pioneers of manned kite flying included Samuel Franklin Cody in England and Captain G√©nie Saconney in France. = Langley = First failure of Langley's manned Aerodrome on the Potomac River, 7 October 1903 After a distinguished career in astronomy and shortly before becoming Secretary of the Smithsonian Institution, Samuel Pierpont Langley started a serious investigation into aerodynamics at what is today the University of Pittsburgh. In 1891, he published Experiments in Aerodynamics detailing his research, and then turned to building his designs. He hoped to achieve automatic aerodynamic stability, so he gave little consideration to in-flight control. On 6 May 1896, Langley's Aerodrome No. 5 made the first successful sustained flight of an unpiloted, engine-driven heavier-than-air craft of substantial size. It was launched from a spring-actuated catapult mounted on top of a houseboat on the Potomac River near Quantico, Virginia. Two flights were made that afternoon, one of and a second of , at a speed of approximately . On both occasions, the Aerodrome No. 5 landed in the water as planned, because, in order to save weight, it was not equipped with landing gear. On 28 November 1896, another successful flight was made with the Aerodrome No. 6\\\\. This flight, of , was witnessed and photographed by Alexander Graham Bell. The Aerodrome No. 6 was actually Aerodrome No. 4 greatly modified. So little remained of the original aircraft that it was given a new designation. With the successes of the Aerodrome No. 5 and No. 6, Langley started looking for funding to build a full-scale man-carrying version of his designs. Spurred by the Spanish‚ÄìAmerican War, the U.S. government granted him $50,000 to develop a man-carrying flying machine for aerial reconnaissance. Langley planned on building a scaled-up version known as the Aerodrome A, and started with the smaller Quarter-scale Aerodrome, which flew twice on 18 June 1901, and then again with a newer and more powerful engine in 1903. With the basic design apparently successfully tested, he then turned to the problem of a suitable engine. He contracted Stephen Balzer to build one, but was disappointed when it delivered only instead of he expected. Langley's assistant, Charles M. Manly, then reworked the design into a five-cylinder water-cooled radial that delivered at 950 rpm, a feat that took years to duplicate. Now with both power and a design, Langley put the two together with great hopes. To his dismay, the resulting aircraft proved to be too fragile. Simply scaling up the original small models resulted in a design that was too weak to hold itself together. Two launches in late 1903 both ended with the Aerodrome immediately crashing into the water. The pilot, Manly, was rescued each time. Also, the aircraft's control system was inadequate to allow quick pilot responses, and it had no method of lateral control, and the Aerodromes aerial stability was marginal. Langley's attempts to gain further funding failed, and his efforts ended. Nine days after his second abortive launch on 8 December, the Wright brothers successfully flew their Flyer. Glenn Curtiss made 93 modifications to the Aerodrome and flew this very different aircraft in 1914. Without acknowledging the modifications, the Smithsonian Institution asserted that Langley's Aerodrome was the first machine \\"capable of flight\\".Hallion (2003) pages 294‚Äì295. =Whitehead= The No. 21 monoplane seen from the rear. Whitehead sits beside it with daughter Rose in his lap; others in the photo are not identified. Gustave Wei√ükopf was a German who emigrated to the U.S., where he soon changed his name to Whitehead. From 1897 to 1915, he designed and built early flying machines and engines. On 14 August 1901, two and a half years before the Wright Brothers' flight, he claimed to have carried out a controlled, powered flight in his Number 21 monoplane at Fairfield, Connecticut. The flight was reported in the Bridgeport Sunday Herald local newspaper. About 30 years later, several people questioned by a researcher claimed to have seen that or other Whitehead flights. In March 2013, Jane's All the World's Aircraft, an authoritative source for contemporary aviation, published an editorial which accepted Whitehead's flight as the first manned, powered, controlled flight of a heavier-than-air craft.Paul Jackson; Executive Overview: Jane's All the World's Aircraft: Development & Production ‚Äì 'Justice delayed is justice denied' (2013) The Smithsonian Institution (custodians of the original Wright Flyer) and many aviation historians continue to maintain that Whitehead did not fly as suggested.Budd Davisson; Who Was First? The Wrights or Whitehead? Flight Journal (2013) = Wright brothers = The Wright Flyer: the first sustained flight with a powered, controlled aircraft. Using a methodical approach and concentrating on the controllability of the aircraft, the brothers built and tested a series of kite and glider designs from 1898 to 1902 before attempting to build a powered design. The gliders worked, but not as well as the Wrights had expected based on the experiments and writings of their predecessors. Their first full-size glider, launched in 1900, had only about half the lift they anticipated. Their second glider, built the following year, performed even more poorly. Rather than giving up, the Wrights constructed their own wind tunnel and created a number of sophisticated devices to measure lift and drag on the 200 wing designs they tested. As a result, the Wrights corrected earlier mistakes in calculations regarding drag and lift. Their testing and calculating produced a third glider with a higher aspect ratio and true three- axis control. They flew it successfully hundreds of times in 1902, and it performed far better than the previous models. By using a rigorous system of experimentation, involving wind-tunnel testing of airfoils and flight testing of full-size prototypes, the Wrights not only built a working aircraft the following year, the Wright Flyer, but also helped advance the science of aeronautical engineering. The Wrights appear to be the first to make serious studied attempts to simultaneously solve the power and control problems. Both problems proved difficult, but they never lost interest. They solved the control problem by inventing wing warping for roll control, combined with simultaneous yaw control with a steerable rear rudder. Almost as an afterthought, they designed and built a low-powered internal combustion engine. They also designed and carved wooden propellers that were more efficient than any before, enabling them to gain adequate performance from their low engine power. Although wing-warping as a means of lateral control was used only briefly during the early history of aviation, the principle of combining lateral control in combination with a rudder was a key advance in aircraft control. While many aviation pioneers appeared to leave safety largely to chance, the Wrights' design was greatly influenced by the need to teach themselves to fly without unreasonable risk to life and limb, by surviving crashes. This emphasis, as well as low engine power, was the reason for low flying speed and for taking off in a headwind. Performance, rather than safety, was the reason for the rear-heavy design because the canard could not be highly loaded; anhedral wings were less affected by crosswinds and were consistent with the low yaw stability. According to the Smithsonian Institution and F√©d√©ration A√©ronautique Internationale (FAI),Smithsonian Institution, \\"The Wright Brothers & The Invention of the Aerial Age\\" \\"100 Years Ago, the Dream of Icarus Became Reality.\\" FAI NEWS, 17 December 2003. Retrieved: 5 January 2007. the Wrights made the first sustained, controlled, powered heavier-than-air manned flight at Kill Devil Hills, North Carolina, four miles (8 km) south of Kitty Hawk, North Carolina on 17 December 1903. The first flight by Orville Wright, of in 12 seconds, was recorded in a famous photograph. In the fourth flight of the same day, Wilbur Wright flew in 59 seconds. The flights were witnessed by three coastal lifesaving crewmen, a local businessman, and a boy from the village, making these the first public flights and the first well-documented ones. Orville described the final flight of the day: \\"The first few hundred feet were up and down, as before, but by the time three hundred feet had been covered, the machine was under much better control. The course for the next four or five hundred feet had but little undulation. However, when out about eight hundred feet the machine began pitching again, and, in one of its darts downward, struck the ground. The distance over the ground was measured to be ; the time of the flight was 59 seconds. The frame supporting the front rudder was badly broken, but the main part of the machine was not injured at all. We estimated that the machine could be put in condition for flight again in about a day or two\\".Kelly, Fred C. The Wright Brothers: A Biography Chp. IV, p.101‚Äì102 (Dover Publications, NY 1943). They flew only about ten feet above the ground as a safety precaution, so they had little room to manoeuvre, and all four flights in the gusty winds ended in a bumpy and unintended \\"landing\\". Modern analysis by Professor Fred E. C. Culick and Henry R. Rex (1985) has demonstrated that the 1903 Wright Flyer was so unstable as to be almost unmanageable by anyone but the Wrights, who had trained themselves in the 1902 glider.Abzug, Malcolm J. and E. Eugene Larrabee.\\"Airplane Stability and Control, Second Edition: A History of the Technologies That Made Aviation Possible.\\" cambridge.org. Retrieved: 21 September 2010. The Wrights continued flying at Huffman Prairie near Dayton, Ohio in 1904‚Äì05. In May 1904 they introduced the Flyer II, a heavier and improved version of the original Flyer. On 23 June 1905, they first flew a third machine, the Flyer III. After a severe crash on 14 July 1905, they rebuilt the Flyer III and made important design changes. They almost doubled the size of the elevator and rudder and moved them about twice the distance from the wings. They added two fixed vertical vanes (called \\"blinkers\\") between the elevators and gave the wings a very slight dihedral. They disconnected the rudder from the wing-warping control, and as in all future aircraft, placed it on a separate control handle. When flights resumed the results were immediate. The serious pitch instability that hampered Flyers I and II was significantly reduced, so repeated minor crashes were eliminated. Flights with the redesigned Flyer III started lasting over 10 minutes, then 20, then 30. Flyer III became the first practical aircraft (though without wheels and needing a launching device), flying consistently under full control and bringing its pilot back to the starting point safely and landing without damage. On 5 October 1905, Wilbur flew in 39 minutes 23 seconds.\\"Dayton Metro Library Aero Club of America press release According to the April 1907 issue of the Scientific American magazine,Reprinted in Scientific American, April 2007, page 8. the Wright brothers seemed to have the most advanced knowledge of heavier-than-air navigation at the time. However, the same magazine issue also claimed that no public flight had been made in the United States before its April 1907 issue. Hence, they devised the Scientific American Aeronautic Trophy in order to encourage the development of a heavier-than-air flying machine.  Pioneer Era (1903‚Äì1914)  This period saw the development of practical aeroplanes and airships and their early application, alongside balloons and kites, for private, sport and military use. =Pioneers in Europe= The 14-bis, or Oiseau de proie. Early Voisin biplane Although full details of the Wright Brothers' system of flight control had been published in l'Aerophile in January 1906, the importance of this advance was not recognised, and European experimenters generally concentrated on attempting to produce inherently stable machines. Short powered flights were performed in France by Romanian engineer Traian Vuia on 18 March and 19 August 1906 when he flew 12 and 24 meters, respectively, in a self-designed, fully self-propelled, fixed-wing aircraft, that possessed a fully wheeled undercarriage. He was followed by Jacob Ellehammer who built a monoplane which he tested with a tether in Denmark on 12 September 1906, flying 42 meters.Jacob Ellehammer at EarlyAviators.com. Retrieved 7 March 2013. On 13 September 1906, a day after Ellehammer's tethered flight and three years after the Wright Brothers' flight, the Brazilian Alberto Santos-Dumont made a public flight in Paris with the 14-bis, also known as Oiseau de proie (French for \\"bird of prey\\"). This was of canard configuration with pronounced wing dihedral, and covered a distance of on the grounds of the Chateau de Bagatelle in Paris' Bois de Boulogne before a large crowd of witnesses. This well-documented event was the first flight verified by the A√©ro-Club de France of a powered heavier-than-air machine in Europe and won the Deutsch-Archdeacon Prize for the first officially observed flight greater than . On 12 November 1906, Santos-Dumont set the first world record recognized by the Federation Aeronautique Internationale by flying in 21.5 seconds.Jines.

Retrieved: 17 August 2009.\\"Cronologia de Santos Dumont\\" (in Portuguese). santos-dumont.net. Retrieved: 12 October 2010. Only one more brief flight was made by the 14-bis in March 1907, after which it was abandoned. In March 1907, Gabriel Voisin flew the first example of his Voisin biplane. On 13 January 1908, a second example of the type was flown by Henri Farman to win the Deutsch-Archdeacon Grand Prix d'Aviation prize for a flight in which the aircraft flew a distance of more than a kilometer and landed at the point where it had taken off. The flight lasted 1 minute and 28 seconds. =Flight as an established technology= Alberto Santos-Dumont flying the Demoiselle over Paris Santos-Dumont later added ailerons, between the wings in an effort to gain more lateral stability. His final design, first flown in 1907, was the series of Demoiselle monoplanes (Nos. 19 to 22). The Demoiselle No 19 could be constructed in only 15 days and became the world's first series production aircraft. The Demoiselle achieved 120 km/h.Hartmann, G√©rard. \\"Cl√©ment-Bayard, sans peur et sans reproche\\" (French). hydroretro.net. Retrieved: 14 November 2010. The fuselage consisted of three specially reinforced bamboo booms: the pilot sat in a seat between the main wheels of a conventional landing gear whose pair of wire-spoked mainwheels were located at the lower front of the airframe, with a tailskid half-way back beneath the rear fuselage structure. The Demoiselle was controlled in flight by a cruciform tail unit hinged on a form of universal joint at the aft end of the fuselage structure to function as elevator and rudder, with roll control provided through wing warping (No. 20), with the wings only warping \\"down\\". In 1908, Wilbur Wright travelled to Europe, and starting in August gave a series of flight demonstrations at Le Mans in France. The first demonstration, made on 8 August, attracted an audience including most of the major French aviation experimenters, who were astonished by the clear superiority of the Wright Brothers' aircraft, particularly its ability to make tight controlled turns. The importance of using roll control in making turns was recognised by almost all the European experimenters: Henri Farman fitted ailerons to his Voisin biplane and shortly afterwards set up his own aircraft construction business, whose first product was the influential Farman III biplane. The following year saw the widespread recognition of powered flight as something other than the preserve of dreamers and eccentrics. On 25 July, Louis Bl√©riot won worldwide fame by winning a ¬£1,000 prize offered by the British Daily Mail newspaper for a flight across the English Channel, and in August around half a million people, including the President of France Armand Falli√®res and David Lloyd George, attended one of the first aviation meetings, the Grande Semaine d'Aviation at Reims. = Rotorcraft = In 1877, Enrico Forlanini developed an unmanned helicopter powered by a steam engine. It rose to a height of 13 meters, where it remained for 20 seconds, after a vertical take-off from a park in Milan. Paul Cornu's helicopter, built in 1907, was the first manned flying machine to have risen from the ground using rotating wings instead of fixed wings. The first time a manned helicopter is known to have risen off the ground was on a tethered flight in 1907 by the Breguet-Richet Gyroplane. Later the same year the Cornu helicopter, also French, made the first rotary-winged free flight at Lisieux, France. However, these were not practical designs. = Military use = Nieuport IV, operated by most of the world's air forces before WW1 for reconnaissance and bombing, including during the Italian- Turkish war. Almost as soon as they were invented, airplanes were used for military purposes. The first country to use them for military purposes was Italy, whose aircraft made reconnaissance, bombing and artillery correction flights in Libya during the Italian-Turkish war (September 1911 ‚Äì October 1912). The first mission (a reconnaissance) occurred on 23 October 1911. The first bombing mission was flown on 1 November 1911.Ferdinando Pedriali. \\"Aerei italiani in Libia (1911‚Äì1912)\\"(Italian planes in Libya (1911‚Äì1912)). Storia Militare (Military History), N¬∞ 170/novembre 2007, p.31‚Äì40 Then Bulgaria followed this example. Its airplanes attacked and reconnoitered the Ottoman positions during the First Balkan War 1912‚Äì13. The first war to see major use of airplanes in offensive, defensive and reconnaissance capabilities was World War I. The Allies and Central Powers both used airplanes and airships extensively. While the concept of using the airplane as an offensive weapon was generally discounted before World War I,with the exception of Cl√©ment Ader, who had visionary views about this: \\"L'affaire de l'aviation militaire\\" (Military aviation concern), 1898 and \\"La premi√®re √©tape de l'aviation militaire en France\\" (The first step of military aviation en France), 1906 the idea of using it for photography was one that was not lost on any of the major forces. All of the major forces in Europe had light aircraft, typically derived from pre-war sporting designs, attached to their reconnaissance departments. Radiotelephones were also being explored on airplanes, notably the SCR-68, as communication between pilots and ground commander grew more and more important. World War I (1914‚Äì1918) Taube monoplane, illustration from 1917 = Combat schemes = It was not long before aircraft were shooting at each other, but the lack of any sort of steady point for the gun was a problem. The French solved this problem when, in late 1914, Roland Garros attached a fixed machine gun to the front of his plane, but while Adolphe Pegoud would become known as the first \\"ace\\", getting credit for five victories before also becoming the first ace to die in action, it was German Luftstreitkr√§fte Leutnant Kurt Wintgens who, on 1 July 1915, scored the very first aerial victory by a purpose-built fighter plane, with a synchronized machine gun. Aviators were styled as modern-day knights, doing individual combat with their enemies. Several pilots became famous for their air-to-air combat; the most well known is Manfred von Richthofen, better known as the Red Baron, who shot down 80 planes in air-to-air combat with several different planes, the most celebrated of which was the Fokker Dr.I. On the Allied side, Ren√© Paul Fonck is credited with the most all-time victories at 75, even when later wars are considered. France, Britain, Germany and Italy were the leading manufacturers of fighter planes that saw action during the war,WWI airplane statistics by nation with German aviation technologist Hugo Junkers showing the way to the future through his pioneering use of all-metal aircraft from late 1915. Between the World Wars (1918‚Äì1939) The years between World War I and World War II saw great advancements in aircraft technology. Airplanes evolved from low-powered biplanes made from wood and fabric to sleek, high- powered monoplanes made of aluminum, based primarily on the founding work of Hugo Junkers during the World War I period and its adoption by American designer William Bushnell Stout and Soviet designer Andrei Tupolev. The age of the great rigid airships came and went. The first successful rotorcraft appeared in the form of the autogyro, invented by Spanish engineer Juan de la Cierva and first flown in 1919. In this design, the rotor is not powered but is spun like a windmill by its passage through the air. A separate powerplant is used to propel the aircraft forwards. Flagg biplane from 1933. After World War I, experienced fighter pilots were eager to show off their skills. Many American pilots became barnstormers, flying into small towns across the country and showing off their flying abilities, as well as taking paying passengers for rides. Eventually, the barnstormers grouped into more organized displays. Air shows sprang up around the country, with air races, acrobatic stunts, and feats of air superiority. The air races drove engine and airframe development‚Äîthe Schneider Trophy, for example, led to a series of ever faster and sleeker monoplane designs culminating in the Supermarine S.6B. With pilots competing for cash prizes, there was an incentive to go faster. Amelia Earhart was perhaps the most famous of those on the barnstorming/air show circuit. She was also the first female pilot to achieve records such as the crossing of the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans. Qantas De Havilland biplane, c. 1930 Other prizes, for distance and speed records, also drove development forwards. For example, on 14 June 1919, Captain John Alcock and Lieutenant Arthur Brown co- piloted a Vickers Vimy non-stop from St. John's, Newfoundland to Clifden, Ireland, winning the ¬£13,000 ($65,000) Northcliffe prize. The first flight across the South Atlantic and the first aerial crossing using astronomical navigation, was made by the naval aviators Gago Coutinho and Sacadura Cabral in 1922, from Lisbon, Portugal, to Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, with only internal means of navigation, in an aircraft specifically fitted for himself with an artificial horizon for aeronautical use, an invention that revolutionized air navigation at the time (Gago Coutinho invented a type of sextant incorporating two spirit levels to provide an artificial horizon).CAMBESES J√öNIOR, Manuel, A Primeira Travessia A√©rea do Atl√¢ntico Sul, Bras√≠lia: INCAER, 2008 History of the Sextant includes a photograph of a Gago Coutinho spirit level attachment. Five years later Charles Lindbergh took the Orteig Prize of $25,000 for the first solo non-stop crossing of the Atlantic. Months after Lindbergh, Paul Redfern was the first to solo the Caribbean Sea and was last seen flying over Venezuela. Australian Sir Charles Kingsford Smith was the first to fly across the larger Pacific Ocean in the Southern Cross. His crew left Oakland, California to make the first trans-Pacific flight to Australia in three stages. The first (from Oakland to Hawaii) was , took 27 hours 25 minutes, and was uneventful. They then flew to Suva, Fiji away, taking 34 hours 30 minutes. This was the toughest part of the journey as they flew through a massive lightning storm near the equator. They then flew on to Brisbane in 20 hours, where they landed on 9 June 1928 after approximately total flight. On arrival, Kingsford Smith was met by a huge crowd of 25,000 at Eagle Farm Airport in his hometown of Brisbane. Accompanying him were Australian aviator Charles Ulm as the relief pilot, and the Americans James Warner and Captain Harry Lyon (who were the radio operator, navigator and engineer). A week after they landed, Kingsford Smith and Ulm recorded a disc for Columbia talking about their trip. With Ulm, Kingsford Smith later continued his journey being the first in 1929 to circumnavigate the world, crossing the equator twice. The first lighter- than-air crossings of the Atlantic were made by airship in July 1919 by His Majesty's Airship R34 and crew when they flew from East Lothian, Scotland to Long Island, New York and then back to Pulham, England. By 1929, airship technology had advanced to the point that the first round-the-world flight was completed by the Graf Zeppelin in September and in October, the same aircraft inaugurated the first commercial transatlantic service. However, the age of the rigid airship ended following the destruction by fire of the zeppelin LZ 129 Hindenburg just before landing at Lakehurst, New Jersey on 6 May 1937, killing 35 of the 97 people aboard. Previous spectacular airship accidents, from the Wingfoot Express disaster (1919) to the loss of the R101 (1930), the Akron (1933) and the Macon (1935) had already cast doubt on airship safety, but with the disasters of the U.S. Navy's rigids showing the importance of solely using helium as the lifting medium; following the destruction of the Hindenburg, the remaining airship making international flights, the Graf Zeppelin was retired (June 1937). Its replacement, the rigid airship Graf Zeppelin II, made a number of flights, primarily over Germany, from 1938 to 1939, but was grounded when Germany began World War II. Both remaining German zeppelins were scrapped in 1940 to supply metal for the German Luftwaffe; the last American rigid airship, the Los Angeles, which had not flown since 1932, was dismantled in late 1939. Meanwhile, Germany, which was restricted by the Treaty of Versailles in its development of powered aircraft, developed gliding as a sport, especially at the Wasserkuppe, during the 1920s. In its various forms, in the 21st century sailplane aviation now has over 400,000 participants.FAI web site First female combat pilot, Sabiha G√∂k√ßen, reviews her Breguet 19. In 1929, Jimmy Doolittle developed instrument flight. 1929 also saw the first flight of by far the largest plane ever built until then: the Dornier Do X with a wingspan of 48 m. On its 70th test flight on 21 October 1929, there were 169 people on board, a record that was not broken for 20 years. Less than a decade after the development of the first practical rotorcraft of any type with the autogyro, in the Soviet Union, Boris N. Yuriev and Alexei M. Cheremukhin, two aeronautical engineers working at the Tsentralniy Aerogidrodinamicheskiy Institut, constructed and flew the TsAGI 1-EA single rotor helicopter, which used an open tubing framework, a four- blade main rotor, and twin sets of diameter anti-torque rotors; one set of two at the nose and one set of two at the tail. Powered by two M-2 powerplants, up-rated copies of the Gnome Monosoupape rotary radial engine of World War I, the TsAGI 1-EA made several successful low altitude flights. By 14 August 1932, Cheremukhin managed to get the 1-EA up to an unofficial altitude of with what is likely to be the first successful single-lift rotor helicopter design ever tested and flown. Only five years after the German Dornier Do-X had flown, Tupolev designed the largest aircraft of the 1930s era, the Maksim Gorky in the Soviet Union by 1934, as the largest aircraft ever built using the Junkers methods of metal aircraft construction. In the 1930s, development of the jet engine began in Germany and in Britain ‚Äì both countries would go on to develop jet aircraft by the end of World War II. After enrolling in the Military Aviation Academy in Eskisehir in 1936 and undertaking training at the First Aircraft Regiment, Sabiha G√∂k√ßen, flew fighter and bomber planes becoming the first Turkish, female aviator and the world's first, female, combat pilot. During her flying career, she achieved some 8,000 hours, 32 of which were combat missions.https://www.guinnessworldrecords.com/world- records/first-female-combat- pilot?fb_comment_id=847048878660727_1953127661386171https://steemit.com/tr/@turkish- trail/turkeys-first-woman-aviator-sahiba- goekcenhttps://books.google.com/books?id=AfeZAwAAQBAJ&pg;=PT100&dq;=sabiha+gokcen+first+pilohttps://books.google.com/books?id=iQY6q91w8vIC&pg;=PA114&dq;=sabiha+gokcen+first+pilot  World War II (1939‚Äì1945)  World War II saw a great increase in the pace of development and production, not only of aircraft but also the associated flight-based weapon delivery systems. Air combat tactics and doctrines took advantage. Large-scale strategic bombing campaigns were launched, fighter escorts introduced and the more flexible aircraft and weapons allowed precise attacks on small targets with dive bombers, fighter-bombers, and ground-attack aircraft. New technologies like radar also allowed more coordinated and controlled deployment of air defense. Me 262, world first operational jet fighter The first jet aircraft to fly was the Heinkel He 178 (Germany), flown by Erich Warsitz in 1939, followed by the world's first operational jet aircraft, the Me 262, in July 1942 and world's first jet-powered bomber, the Arado Ar 234, in June 1943. British developments, like the Gloster Meteor, followed afterwards, but saw only brief use in World War II. The first cruise missile (V-1), the first ballistic missile (V-2), the first (and to date only) operational rocket-powered combat aircraft Me 163‚Äîwith attained velocities of up to in test flights‚Äîand the first vertical take-off manned point-defense interceptor, the Bachem Ba 349 Natter, were also developed by Germany. However, jet and rocket aircraft had only limited impact due to their late introduction, fuel shortages, the lack of experienced pilots and the declining war industry of Germany. Not only airplanes, but also helicopters saw rapid development in the Second World War, with the introduction of the Focke Achgelis Fa 223, the Flettner Fl 282 synchropter in 1941 in Germany and the Sikorsky R-4 in 1942 in the USA.  Postwar era (1945‚Äì1979)  D.H. Comet, the world's first jet airliner. As in this picture, it also saw RAF service A 1945 newsreel covering various firsts in human flight After World War II, commercial aviation grew rapidly, using mostly ex-military aircraft to transport people and cargo. This growth was accelerated by the glut of heavy and super-heavy bomber airframes like the B-29 and Lancaster that could be converted into commercial aircraft. The DC-3 also made for easier and longer commercial flights. The first commercial jet airliner to fly was the British de Havilland Comet. By 1952, the British state airline BOAC had introduced the Comet into scheduled service. While a technical achievement, the plane suffered a series of highly public failures, as the shape of the windows led to cracks due to metal fatigue. The fatigue was caused by cycles of pressurization and depressurization of the cabin and eventually led to catastrophic failure of the plane's fuselage. By the time the problems were overcome, other jet airliner designs had already taken to the skies. USSR's Aeroflot became the first airline in the world to operate sustained regular jet services on 15 September 1956 with the Tupolev Tu-104. The Boeing 707 and DC-8 which established new levels of comfort, safety and passenger expectations, ushered in the age of mass commercial air travel, dubbed the Jet Age. In October 1947, Chuck Yeager took the rocket-powered Bell X-1 through the sound barrier. Although anecdotal evidence exists that some fighter pilots may have done so while dive-bombing ground targets during the war, this was the first controlled, level flight to exceed the speed of sound. Further barriers of distance fell in 1948 and 1952 with the first jet crossing of the Atlantic and the first nonstop flight to Australia. The 1945 invention of nuclear bombs briefly increased the strategic importance of military aircraft in the Cold War between East and West. Even a moderate fleet of long-range bombers could deliver a deadly blow to the enemy, so great efforts were made to develop countermeasures. At first, the supersonic interceptor aircraft were produced in considerable numbers. By 1955, most development efforts shifted to guided surface-to-air missiles. However, the approach diametrically changed when a new type of nuclear-carrying platform appeared that could not be stopped in any feasible way: intercontinental ballistic missiles. The possibility of these was demonstrated in 1957 with the launch of Sputnik 1 by the Soviet Union. This action started the Space Race between the nations. In 1961, the sky was no longer the limit for manned flight, as Yuri Gagarin orbited once around the planet within 108 minutes, and then used the descent module of Vostok I to safely reenter the atmosphere and reduce speed from Mach 25 using friction and converting the kinetic energy of the velocity into heat. The United States responded by launching Alan Shepard into space on a suborbital flight in a Mercury space capsule. With the launch of the Alouette I in 1963, Canada became the third country to send a satellite into space. The space race between the United States and the Soviet Union would ultimately lead to the landing of men on the moon in 1969. In 1967, the X-15 set the air speed record for an aircraft at or Mach 6.1. Aside from vehicles designed to fly in outer space, this record was renewed by X-43 in the 21st century. Apollo 11 lifts off on its mission to land a man on the moon The Harrier Jump Jet, often referred to as just \\"Harrier\\" or \\"the Jump Jet\\", is a British designed military jet aircraft capable of Vertical/Short Takeoff and Landing (V/STOL) via thrust vectoring. It first flew in 1969, the same year that Neil Armstrong and Buzz Aldrin set foot on the moon, and Boeing unveiled the Boeing 747 and the A√©rospatiale-BAC Concorde supersonic passenger airliner had its maiden flight. The Boeing 747 was the largest commercial passenger aircraft ever to fly, and still carries millions of passengers each year, though it has been superseded by the Airbus A380, which is capable of carrying up to 853 passengers. In 1975, Aeroflot started regular service on the Tu-144‚Äîthe first supersonic passenger plane. In 1976, British Airways and Air France began supersonic service across the Atlantic, with Concorde. A few years earlier the SR-71 Blackbird had set the record for crossing the Atlantic in under 2 hours, and Concorde followed in its footsteps. In 1979, the Gossamer Albatross became the first human-powered aircraft to cross the English channel. This achievement finally saw the realization of centuries of dreams of human flight.  Digital age (1980‚Äìpresent)  Concorde, G-BOAB, in storage at London Heathrow Airport following the end of all Concorde flying. This aircraft flew for 22,296 hours between its first flight in 1976 and final flight in 2000. The last quarter of the 20th century saw a change of emphasis. No longer was revolutionary progress made in flight speeds, distances and materials technology. This part of the century instead saw the spreading of the digital revolution both in flight avionics and in aircraft design and manufacturing techniques. In 1986, Dick Rutan and Jeana Yeager flew an aircraft, the Rutan Voyager, around the world unrefuelled, and without landing. In 1999, Bertrand Piccard became the first person to circle the earth in a balloon. Digital fly-by-wire systems allow an aircraft to be designed with relaxed static stability. Initially used to increase the manoeuvrability of military aircraft such as the General Dynamics F-16 Fighting Falcon, this is now being used to reduce drag on commercial airliners. The U.S. Centennial of Flight Commission was established in 1999 to encourage the broadest national and international participation in the celebration of 100 years of powered flight. It publicized and encouraged a number of programs, projects and events intended to educate people about the history of aviation. 21st century 21st-century aviation has seen increasing interest in fuel savings and fuel diversification, as well as low cost airlines and facilities. Additionally, much of the developing world that did not have good access to air transport has been steadily adding aircraft and facilities, though severe congestion remains a problem in many up and coming nations. Around 20,000 city pairs are served by commercial aviation, up from less than 10,000 as recently as 1996. There appears to be newfound interest in returning to the supersonic era whereby waning demand in the turn of the 20th century made flights unprofitable, as well as the final commercial stoppage of the Concorde due to reduced demand following a fatal accident and rising costs. At the beginning of the 21st century, digital technology allowed subsonic military aviation to begin eliminating the pilot in favor of remotely operated or completely autonomous unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs). In April 2001 the unmanned aircraft Global Hawk flew from Edwards AFB in the US to Australia non-stop and unrefuelled. This is the longest point-to-point flight ever undertaken by an unmanned aircraft and took 23 hours and 23 minutes. In October 2003, the first totally autonomous flight across the Atlantic by a computer-controlled model aircraft occurred. UAVs are now an established feature of modern warfare, carrying out pinpoint attacks under the control of a remote operator. Major disruptions to air travel in the 21st century included the closing of U.S. airspace due to the September 11 attacks, and the closing of most of European airspace after the 2010 eruption of Eyjafjallaj√∂kull. In 2015, Andr√© Borschberg and Bertrand Piccard flew a record distance of from Nagoya, Japan to Honolulu, Hawaii in a solar-powered plane, Solar Impulse 2. The flight took nearly five days; during the nights the aircraft used its batteries and the potential energy gained during the day. On 14 July 2019, Frenchman Franky Zapata attracted worldwide attention when he participated at the Bastille Day military parade riding his invention, a jet-powered Flyboard Air. He subsequently succeeded in crossing the English Channel on his device on 4 August 2019, covering the 35-kilometre (22 mi) journey from Sangatte in northern France to St Margaret's Bay in Kent, UK, in 22 minutes, with a midpoint fueling stop included. 24 July 2019 was the busiest day in aviation, for Flightradar24 recorded a total of over 225,000 flights that day. It includes helicopters, private jets, gliders, sight-seeing flights, as well as personal aircraft. The website has been tracking flights since 2006. On 10 June 2020, the Pipistrel Velis Electro became the first electric aeroplane to secure a type certificate from EASA. In the early 21st Century, the first fifth-generation military fighters were produced, starting with the F-22 Raptor and currently Russia, America and China have 5th gen aircraft (2019). The COVID-19 pandemic had a significant impact on the aviation industry due to the resulting travel restrictions as well as slump in demand among travelers, and may also affect the future of air travel. For example, the mandatory use of face masks on airplanes has become a common feature of flying in 2020.

A group of monks laugh while a lone monk struggles with a donkey. Schadenfreude (; ; 'harm- joy') is the experience of pleasure, joy, or self-satisfaction that comes from learning of or witnessing the troubles, failures, or humiliation of another. Schadenfreude is a complex emotion, where rather than feeling sympathy toward someone's misfortune, schadenfreude evokes joyful feelings that take pleasure from watching someone fail. This emotion is displayed more in children than adults. However, adults also experience schadenfreude, although generally they conceal it.  Etymology  Schadenfreude is borrowed from German. It is a compound of Schaden, \\"damage, harm\\", and Freude, \\"joy\\". The German word was first mentioned in English texts in 1852 and 1867, and first used in English running text in 1895.Oxford English Dictionary, 1982, s.v. In German, it was first attested in the 1740s.Google Books (the 1659 and 1700 dates are incorrect) Although common nouns normally are not capitalised in English, schadenfreude sometimes is capitalised following the German convention. Psychological causes of schadenfreude Researchers have found that there are three driving forces behind schadenfreude: aggression, rivalry, and justice. Several studies have produced evidence that self-esteem has a negative relationship with the frequency and intensity of schadenfreude experienced by an individual. This means that the less self-esteem an individual has, the more frequently or more intensely they will experience schadenfreude. The reverse also holds true‚Äîthose with higher self-esteem experience schadenfreude less frequently or with less emotional intensity. It is hypothesized that this inverse relationship is mediated through the human psychological inclination to define and protect their self- and in-group- identity or self-conception. Specifically, for someone with high self-esteem, seeing another person fail may still bring them a small (but effectively negligible) surge of confidence because the observer's high self-esteem significantly lowers the threat they believe the visibly-failing human poses to their status or identity. Since this confident individual perceives that, regardless of circumstances, the successes and failures of the other person will have little impact on their own status or well-being, they have very little emotional investment in how the other person fares, be it positive or negative. Conversely, for someone with low self-esteem, someone who is more successful poses a threat to their sense of self, and seeing this 'mighty' person fall can be a source of comfort because they perceive a relative improvement in their internal or in-group standing. *Aggression-based schadenfreude primarily involves group identity. The joy of observing the suffering of others comes from the observer's feeling that the other's failure represents an improvement or validation of their own group's (in-group) status in relation to external (out-groups) groups. This is, essentially, schadenfreude based on group versus group status. *Rivalry-based schadenfreude is individualistic and related to interpersonal competition. It arises from a desire to stand out from and out-perform one's peers. This is schadenfreude based on another person's misfortune eliciting pleasure because the observer now feels better about their personal identity and self-worth, instead of their group identity. *Justice-based schadenfreude comes from seeing that behavior seen as immoral or \\"bad\\" is punished. It is the pleasure associated with seeing a \\"bad\\" person being harmed or receiving retribution. Schadenfreude is experienced here because it makes people feel that fairness has been restored for a previously un-punished wrong.  Synonyms  Schadenfreude has equivalents in many other languages, but no commonly-used precise English single-word equivalent. There are other ways to express the concept in English. \\"Epicaricacy\\" is a seldom-used direct equivalent, borrowed from Greek epichairekakia (·ºêœÄŒπœáŒ±ŒπœÅŒµŒ∫Œ±Œ∫ŒØŒ±, first attested in Aristotle Liddell- Scott-Jones, A Greek‚ÄìEnglish Lexicon s.v. ) from ·ºêœÄŒØ epi 'upon', œáŒ±œÅŒ¨ chara 'joy', and Œ∫Œ±Œ∫œåŒΩ kakon 'evil'. \\"Tall poppy syndrome\\" is a cultural phenomenon where people of high status are resented, attacked, cut down, or criticized because they have been classified as better than their peers. This is similar to \\"begrudgery\\", the resentment or envy of the success of a peer. If someone were to feel joy by the victim‚Äôs fall from grace, they would be experiencing schadenfreude. A \\"Roman holiday\\" is a metaphor from Byron's poem Childe Harold's Pilgrimage, where a gladiator in ancient Rome expects to be \\"butchered to make a Roman holiday\\" while the audience would take pleasure from watching his suffering. The term suggests debauchery and disorder in addition to sadistic enjoyment. \\"Morose delectation\\" (delectatio morosa in Latin), meaning \\"the habit of dwelling with enjoyment on evil thoughts\\",definition of morose delectation , Oxford English Dictionary was considered by the medieval church to be a sin.Prima Secundae Partis, Q. 74 , The Summa Theologica of St. Thomas Aquinas, Second and Revised Edition, 1920; Literally translated by Fathers of the English Dominican Province, Online Edition Copyright ¬© 2006 by Kevin Knight.Chapter 6 Proposing the Story of the World , Richard John Neuhaus, Catholic Matters: Confusion, Controversy, and the Splendor of Truth, Basic Books, 2006. French writer Pierre Klossowski maintained that the appeal of sadism is morose delectation.Heterodox Religion and Post-Atheism: Bataille / Klossowski/ Foucault , Jones Irwin, ISSN 1393-614X Minerva ‚Äì An Internet Journal of Philosophy Vol. 10 2006.Klossowski, Pierre. 1991. Sade, My Neighbour, translated by Alphonso Lingis. Illinois. Northwestern University Press. \\"Gloating\\" is an English word of similar meaning, where \\"gloat\\" means \\"to observe or think about something with triumphant and often malicious satisfaction, gratification, or delight\\" (e.g., to gloat over an enemy's misfortune).\\"Dictionary definition of gloat\\" . Gloating is different from schadenfreude in that it does not necessarily require malice (one may gloat to a friend about having defeated him in a game without ill intent), and that it describes an action rather than a state of mind (one typically gloats to the subject of the misfortune or to a third party). Also, unlike schadenfreude, where the focus is on another's misfortune, gloating often brings to mind inappropriately celebrating or bragging about one's own good fortune without any particular focus on the misfortune of others.  Related emotions or concepts  Permutations of the concept of pleasure at another's unhappiness are: pleasure at another's happiness, displeasure at another's happiness, and displeasure at another's unhappiness. Words for these concepts are sometimes cited as antonyms to schadenfreude, as each is the opposite in some way. Pleasure at another's happiness is described by the Buddhist concept of mudita or the concept of \\"compersion\\" in the polyamory community. A similar concept is the Hebrew slang term firgun, happiness at another's accomplishment. Displeasure at another's happiness is involved in envy, and perhaps in jealousy. The coinage \\"freudenschade\\" similarly means sorrow at another's success. Displeasure at another's good fortune is Gluckschmerz, a pseudo-German word coined in 1985 as a joke by the pseudonymous Wanda Tinasky; the correct German form would be Gl√ºcksschmerz. It has since been used in academic contexts. Displeasure at another's unhappiness is sympathy, pity, or compassion. Sadism gives pleasure through the infliction of pain, whereas schadenfreude is pleasure on observing misfortune and in particular, the fact that the other somehow deserved the misfortune.  Neologisms and variants  Neologisms and portmanteau words were coined from the word as early as 1993, when Lincoln Caplan, in his book Skadden: Power, Money, and the Rise of a Legal Empire, used the word Skaddenfreude to describe the delight that competitors of Skadden Arps took in its troubles of the early 1990s. Others include spitzenfreude, coined by The Economist to refer to the fall of Eliot Spitzer and Schadenford, coined by Toronto Life in regard to Canadian politician Rob Ford.  Literary usage and philosophical analysis  The Book of Proverbs mentions an emotion similar to schadenfreude: \\"Rejoice not when thine enemy falleth, and let not thine heart be glad when he stumbleth: Lest the LORD see it, and it displease him, and he turn away his wrath from him.\\" (Proverbs 24:17‚Äì18, King James Version). In the Nicomachean Ethics, Aristotle used epikhairekakia (·ºêœÄŒπœáŒ±ŒπœÅŒµŒ∫Œ±Œ∫ŒØŒ± in Greek) as part of a triad of terms, in which epikhairekakia stands as the opposite of phthonos (œÜŒ∏œåŒΩŒøœÇ), and nemesis (ŒΩŒ≠ŒºŒµœÉŒπœÇ) occupies the mean. Nemesis is \\"a painful response to another's undeserved good fortune\\", while phthonos is a painful response to any good fortune of another, deserved or not. The epikhairekakos (·ºêœÄŒπœáŒ±ŒπœÅŒ≠Œ∫Œ±Œ∫ŒøœÇ) person takes pleasure in another's ill fortune.Nicomachean Ethics, 2.7.1108b1-10 Lucretius characterises the emotion in an extended simile in De rerum natura: Suave, mari magno turbantibus aequora ventis, e terra magnum alterius spectare laborem, \\"It is pleasant to watch from the land the great struggle of someone else in a sea rendered great by turbulent winds.\\" The abbreviated Latin tag suave mare magno recalled the passage to generations familiar with the Latin classics.Patrick O'Brian's usage of the tag in his Aubrey-Maturin historical novels is reflected in Dean King's companion lexicon A Sea of Words (3rd ed.2000). Caesarius of Heisterbach regards \\"delight in the adversity of a neighbour\\" as one of the \\"daughters of envy... which follows anger\\" in his Dialogue on Miracles.Dialogus miraculorum, IV, 23. During the seventeenth century, Robert Burton wrote in his work The Anatomy of Melancholy, \\"Out of these two [the concupiscible and irascible powers] arise those mixed affections and passions of anger, which is a desire of revenge; hatred, which is inveterate anger; zeal, which is offended with him who hurts that he loves; and ·ºêœÄŒπœáŒ±ŒπœÅŒµŒ∫Œ±Œ∫ŒØŒ±, a compound affection of joy and hate, when we rejoice at other men's mischief, and are grieved at their prosperity; pride, self-love, emulation, envy, shame, &c.;, of which elsewhere.\\" The philosopher Arthur Schopenhauer mentioned schadenfreude as the most evil sin of human feeling, famously saying \\"To feel envy is human, to savor schadenfreude is diabolic.\\" The Bob Dylan 1965 song \\"Like a Rolling Stone\\" is an expression of schadenfreude in popular culture. The song \\"Schadenfreude\\" in the musical Avenue Q, is a comedic exploration of the general public's relationship with the emotion. Rabbi Harold S. Kushner in his book When Bad Things Happen to Good People describes schadenfreude as a universal, even wholesome reaction that cannot be helped. \\"There is a German psychological term, Schadenfreude, which refers to the embarrassing reaction of relief we feel when something bad happens to someone else instead of to us.\\" He gives examples and writes, \\"[People] don't wish their friends ill, but they can‚Äôt help feeling an embarrassing spasm of gratitude that [the bad thing] happened to someone else and not to them.\\" Susan Sontag's book Regarding the Pain of Others, published in 2003, is a study of the issue of how the pain and misfortune of some people affects others, namely whether war photography and war paintings may be helpful as anti-war tools, or whether they only serve some sense of schadenfreude in some viewers. Philosopher and sociologist Theodor Adorno defined schadenfreude as \\"... largely unanticipated delight in the suffering of another, which is cognized as trivial and/or appropriate.\\"Cited in Schadenfreude is steadily becoming a more popular word according to Google.https://www.wordgenius.com/all-words/schadenfreude WordGenius.com August 13, 2019  Scientific studies  A New York Times article in 2002 cited a number of scientific studies of schadenfreude, which it defined as \\"delighting in others' misfortune\\". Many such studies are based on social comparison theory, the idea that when people around us have bad luck, we look better to ourselves. Other researchers have found that people with low self-esteem are more likely to feel schadenfreude than are those who have high self-esteem. A 2003 study examined intergroup schadenfreude within the context of sports, specifically an international football (soccer) competition. The study focused on the German and Dutch football teams and their fans. The results of this study indicated that the emotion of schadenfreude is very sensitive to circumstances that make it more or less legitimate to feel such malicious pleasure toward a sports rival. A 2011 study by Cikara and colleagues using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) examined schadenfreude among Boston Red Sox and New York Yankees fans, and found that fans showed increased activation in brain areas correlated with self-reported pleasure (ventral striatum) when observing the rival team experience a negative outcome (e.g., a strikeout). By contrast, fans exhibited increased activation in the anterior cingulate and insula when viewing their own team experience a negative outcome. A 2006 experiment about \\"justice served\\" suggests that men, but not women, enjoy seeing \\"bad people\\" suffer. The study was designed to measure empathy by watching which brain centers are stimulated when subjects observed via fMRI see someone experiencing physical pain. Researchers expected that the brain's empathy center of subjects would show more stimulation when those seen as \\"good\\" got an electric shock, than would occur if the shock was given to someone the subject had reason to consider \\"bad\\". This was indeed the case, but for male subjects, the brain's pleasure centers also lit up when someone got a shock that the male thought was \\"well-deserved\\". Brain-scanning studies show that schadenfreude is correlated with envy in subjects. Strong feelings of envy activated physical pain nodes in the brain's dorsal anterior cingulate cortex; the brain's reward centers, such as the ventral striatum, were activated by news that other people who were envied had suffered misfortune. The magnitude of the brain's schadenfreude response could even be predicted from the strength of the previous envy response. A study conducted in 2009 provides evidence for people's capacity to feel schadenfreude in response to negative events in politics. The study was designed to determine whether or not there was a possibility that events containing objective misfortunes might produce schadenfreude. It was reported in the study that the likelihood of experiencing feelings of schadenfreude depends upon whether an individual's own party or the opposing party is suffering harm. This study suggests that the domain of politics is prime territory for feelings of schadenfreude, especially for those who identify strongly with their political party.

In the United Kingdom this legislation is formally made in the name of the monarch by and with the advice and consent of the Privy Council (Queen-in-Council), but in other countries the terminology may vary. The term should not be confused with Order of Council, which is made in the name of the Council without royal assent. Types, usage and terminology Two principal types of Order in Council exist: Orders in Council whereby the Queen-in-Council exercises the Royal Prerogative, and Orders in Council made in accordance with an Act of Parliament. In the United Kingdom, orders are formally made in the name of the Queen by the Privy Council (Queen-in- Council). In Canada, federal Orders in Council are made in the name of the Governor General by the Queen's Privy Council for Canada; provincial Orders- in-Council are of the Lieutenant-Governor-in-Council by the provincial Executive Council. In other places in name of the governor by the Executive Council (Governor-in-Council, Governor-General-in-Council, etc.). In New Zealand, the Orders in Council, undertaken by the Executive Council, are required to give effect to the government's decisions. Apart from Acts of Parliament, Orders in Council are the main method by which the government implements decisions that need legal force. =Prerogative orders= An Order in Council made under the Royal Prerogative is primary legislation and does not depend on any statute for its authority, although an Act of Parliament may change this.Council of Civil Service Unions v. Minister for the Civil Service [1985] 374 at 399, per Lord Fraser of Tullybelton This type has become less common with the passage of time, as statutes encroach on areas that used to form part of the Royal Prerogative. Matters which still fall within the Royal Prerogative and hence are regulated by (Prerogative) Orders in Council include dealing with servants of the Crown (e.g., standing orders for civil servants), appointing heads of Crown corporations, governance of British Overseas Territories, making appointments in the Church of England and dealing with international relations. Traditionally, Orders in Council are used as a way for the Prime Minister to make political appointments, but they can also be used to issue simple laws as a sort of decree. In times of emergency, a government may issue legislation directly through Orders in Council, forgoing the usual parliamentary procedure.Historical use: see Orders in Council (1807) Most Orders of this sort are eventually formalized according to the traditional lawmaking process, if they are not revoked at the end of the emergency. However, in the UK, this power was later superseded by a statutory power to make such Orders in Council under the Civil Contingencies Act. British Orders in Council may occasionally be used to effectively reverse court decisions applicable to British Overseas Territories without involving Parliament. Within the United Kingdom itself, court decisions can be formally overruled only by an Act of Parliament or by the decision of a higher court on appeal. In the rest of the Commonwealth they are used to carry out any decisions made by the cabinet and the executive that would not need to be approved by Parliament. It was long thought that prerogative orders, being primary legislation, were not subject to judicial review. This was reversed in the 1985 case Council of Civil Service Unions v Minister for the Civil Service, which however allowed for some exceptions, such as national security. A given prerogative order therefore may or may not be subject to judicial review, depending on its nature. =As statutory instruments= In this second case, an Order in Council is merely another form of statutory instrument (in the UK, regulated by the Statutory Instruments Act 1946), albeit subject to more formalities than a simple statutory instrument. This kind of Order in Council tends to be reserved for the most important pieces of subordinate legislation; its use is likely to become more common. Like all statutory instruments, they may simply be required to be laid before both Houses of Parliament, or they may be annulled in pursuance of a resolution of either the lower House (House of Commons in the UK and Canada or House of Representatives in the other realms) or the upper House (House of Lords in the UK or Senate in other realms) ('negative resolution procedure'), or require to be approved by a resolution of either or, exceptionally, both Houses ('affirmative resolution procedure'). That said, the use of Orders in Council has been extended recently, as the Scotland Act 1998 provides that draft Orders in Council may be laid before the Scottish Parliament in certain circumstances in the same way as they would have been laid before the Westminster Parliament. From 2007, legislation put before the Welsh Assembly will be enacted through Orders in Council after following the affirmative resolution procedure. An Order in Council of this type usually has the following form: \\"Her Majesty, in pursuance of [relevant section of primary legislation], is pleased, by and with the advice of Her Privy Council, to order, and it is hereby ordered, as follows:\\" For most of the period from 1972 to 2007, much Northern Ireland legislation was made by Order-in-Council as part of direct rule. This was done under the various Northern Ireland Acts 1974 to 2000, and not by virtue of the Royal Prerogative. Under the Government of Wales Act 2006, the royal assent to Measures of the National Assembly for Wales is given by Order-in-Council, but this is not done by Statutory Instrument but in a form similar to that of a prerogative Order.For example, the Order approving the NHS Redress (Wales) Measure 2008 Controversial uses =Canada= After the British Empire entered World War I on the Allied side, an Order in Council was made in Canada for the registration and in certain cases for the internment of aliens of \\"enemy nationality\\". Between 1914 and 1920, 8,579 \\"enemy aliens\\" were detained in internment camps.Luciuk, Lubomyr (1998). A Time for Atonement. The Limestone Press. An Order in Council made by the Brian Mulroney government on 21 November 1988 created Amex Bank of Canada, a Canadian banking subsidiary of American Express, although federal banking policy at the time would not ordinarily have permitted such an establishment by a foreign company.Newman, Peter C. (July 30, 1990). \\"The brash new kid on the block. (American Express Co. opens Amex Bank of Canada amid controversy)\\" (column). Maclean's, 30 July 1990 v103 n31 p33(1) In July 2004 and August 2006, Orders in Council were used to deny a passport to Abdurahman Khadr, a member of the Khadr family who had previously been held in detention by the United States at Guantanamo Bay, on the grounds of national security. The first was overturned on judicial review by the Federal CourtKhadr v. Canada (Attorney General), 2006 F.C. 727, [2007 2 F.C.R. 218]. as, at the time of his application, national security was not included as a ground for refusal in the Canadian Passport Order,Canadian Passport Order SI/81-86. which was since amended to include the ground. In July 2017, the Government of Canada used an Order in Council to strip ex-Nazi interpreter Helmut Oberlander of his Canadian citizenship. On May 1, 2020, an Order in Council was used to ban 1500 models, ultimately leading to more than 2200 sub models of firearms deemed ‚Äúmilitary-grade assault-style\\" from licensed firearms owners, in response to the 2020 Nova Scotia attacks.https://www.cbc.ca/news/politics/trudeau-gun-control-measures- ban-1.5552131 =United Kingdom= Orders in Council were controversially used in 2004 to overturn a court ruling in the United KingdomR (Bancoult) v Secretary of State For Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs [2008] UKHL 61 that held that the exile of the Chagossians from the British Indian Ocean Territory (BIOT) was unlawful. Initially, the High Court in 2006 held that these Orders in Council were unlawful: \\"The suggestion that a minister can, through the means of an order in council, exile a whole population from a British Overseas Territory and claim that he is doing so for the 'peace, order and good government' of the territory is to us repugnant.\\"\\"Britain shamed as exiles of the Chagos Islands win the right to go home\\", Neil Tweedie, The Daily Telegraph, 12 May 2006. Accessed 17 December 2006. The UK government's first appeal failed, with the Court of Appeal holding that the decision had been unlawfully taken by a government minister \\"acting without any constraint\\".\\"Chagos families win legal battle\\", BBC News, 23 May 2007 However, the government successfully appealed to the House of Lords, which overturned the High Court and Court of Appeal decisions (R v Secretary of State for Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs, ex parte Bancoult (No 2)).\\"Chagos exiles ruling overturned\\". BBC News, 22 October 2008 The Law Lords decidedR (Bancoult) v Secretary of State For Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs [2008] UKHL 61 that the validity of an order in council made under the prerogative legislating for a colony was amenable to judicial reviewNote: see paragraph 35 of the decision. Also, it was not for the courts to substitute their judgement for that of the Secretary of State as to what was conducive to the peace, order and good government of the BIOT. The orders were not Wednesbury unreasonable on the facts, given the considerations of security and cost of resettlement. Finally, none of the orders was open to challenge in the British courts on the ground of repugnancy to any fundamental principle relating to the rights of abode of the Chagossians in the Chagos Islands.

By treating the economy as a subsystem of Earth's larger ecosystem, and by emphasizing the preservation of natural capital, the field of ecological economics is differentiated from environmental economics, which is the mainstream economic analysis of the environment.Jeroen C.J.M. van den Bergh (2001). \\"Ecological Economics: Themes, Approaches, and Differences with Environmental Economics,\\" Regional Environmental Change, 2(1), pp. 13-23 (press +). One survey of German economists found that ecological and environmental economics are different schools of economic thought, with ecological economists emphasizing strong sustainability and rejecting the proposition that physical (human-made) capital can substitute for natural capital (see the section on weak versus strong sustainability below).Illge L, Schwarze R. (2006). A Matter of Opinion: How Ecological and Neoclassical Environmental Economists Think about Sustainability and Economics . German Institute for Economic Research. Ecological economics was founded in the 1980s as a modern discipline on the works of and interactions between various European and American academics (see the section on History and development below). The related field of green economics is in general a more politically applied form of the subject.Paehlke R. (1995). Conservation and Environmentalism: An Encyclopedia, p. 315. Taylor & Francis.Scott Cato, M. (2009). Green Economics. Earthscan, London. . According to ecological economist , ecological economics is defined by its focus on nature, justice, and time. Issues of intergenerational equity, irreversibility of environmental change, uncertainty of long-term outcomes, and sustainable development guide ecological economic analysis and valuation.Malte Faber. (2008). How to be an ecological economist. Ecological Economics 66(1):1-7. Preprint. Ecological economists have questioned fundamental mainstream economic approaches such as cost-benefit analysis, and the separability of economic values from scientific research, contending that economics is unavoidably normative, i.e. prescriptive, rather than positive or descriptive. Positional analysis, which attempts to incorporate time and justice issues, is proposed as an alternative.Mattson L. (1975). Book Review: Positional Analysis for Decision-Making and Planning by Peter Soderbaum. The Swedish Journal of Economics.Soderbaum, P. 2008. Understanding Sustainability Economics. Earthscan, London. . pp.109-110, 113-117. Ecological economics shares several of its perspectives with feminist economics, including the focus on sustainability, nature, justice and care values. History and development The antecedents of ecological economics can be traced back to the Romantics of the 19th century as well as some Enlightenment political economists of that era. Concerns over population were expressed by Thomas Malthus, while John Stuart Mill predicted the desirability of the stationary state of an economy. Mill thereby anticipated later insights of modern ecological economists, but without having had their experience of the social and ecological costs of the Post‚ÄìWorld War II economic expansion. In 1880, Marxian economist Sergei Podolinsky attempted to theorize a labor theory of value based on embodied energy; his work was read and critiqued by Marx and Engels. Otto Neurath developed an ecological approach based on a natural economy whilst employed by the Bavarian Soviet Republic in 1919. He argued that a market system failed to take into account the needs of future generations, and that a socialist economy required calculation in kind, the tracking of all the different materials, rather than synthesising them into money as a general equivalent. In this he was criticised by neo-liberal economists such as Ludwig von Mises and Freidrich Hayek in what became known as the socialist calculation debate.Cartwright Nancy, J. Cat, L. Fleck, and T. Uebel, 1996. Otto Neurath: philosophy between science and politics. Cambridge University Press The debate on energy in economic systems can also be traced back to Nobel prize-winning radiochemist Frederick Soddy (1877‚Äì1956). In his book Wealth, Virtual Wealth and Debt (1926), Soddy criticized the prevailing belief of the economy as a perpetual motion machine, capable of generating infinite wealth‚Äîa criticism expanded upon by later ecological economists such as Nicholas Georgescu-Roegen and Herman Daly.Zencey, Eric. (2009, April 12). Op-ed. New York Times, p. WK9. Accessed: December 23, 2012. European predecessors of ecological economics include K. William Kapp (1950)Kapp, K. W. (1950) The Social Costs of Private Enterprise. New York: Shocken. Karl Polanyi (1944),Polanyi, K. (1944) The Great Transformation. New York/Toronto: Rinehart & Company Inc. and Romanian economist Nicholas Georgescu-Roegen (1971). Georgescu-Roegen, who would later mentor Herman Daly at Vanderbilt University, provided ecological economics with a modern conceptual framework based on the material and energy flows of economic production and consumption. His magnum opus, The Entropy Law and the Economic Process (1971), is credited by Daly as a fundamental text of the field, alongside Soddy's Wealth, Virtual Wealth and Debt. Some key concepts of what is now ecological economics are evident in the writings of Kenneth Boulding and E.F. Schumacher, whose book Small Is Beautiful - A Study of Economics as if People Mattered (1973) was published just a few years before the first edition of Herman Daly's comprehensive and persuasive Steady-State Economics (1977).Schumacher, E.F. 1973. Small Is Beautiful: A Study of Economics as if People Mattered. London: Blond and Briggs.Daly, H. 1991. Steady-State Economics (2nd ed.). Washington, D.C.: Island Press. The first organized meetings of ecological economists occurred in the 1980s. These began in 1982, at the instigation of Lois Banner, with a meeting held in Sweden (including Robert Costanza, Herman Daly, Charles Hall, Bruce Hannon, H.T. Odum, and David Pimentel). Most were ecosystem ecologists or mainstream environmental economists, with the exception of Daly. In 1987, Daly and Costanza edited an issue of Ecological Modeling to test the waters. A book entitled Ecological Economics, by Juan Martinez-Alier, was published later that year.Costanza R. (2003). Early History of Ecological Economics and ISEE. Internet Encyclopaedia of Ecological Economics. He renewed interest in the approach developed by Otto Neurath during the interwar period.Martinez- Alier J. (1987)Ecological economics: energy, environment and society 1989 saw the foundation of the International Society for Ecological Economics and publication of its journal, Ecological Economics, by Elsevier. Robert Costanza was the first president of the society and first editor of the journal, which is currently edited by Richard Howarth. Other figures include ecologists C.S. Holling and H.T. Odum, biologist Gretchen Daily, and physicist Robert Ayres. In the Marxian tradition, sociologist John Bellamy Foster and CUNY geography professor David Harvey explicitly center ecological concerns in political economy. Articles by Inge Ropke (2004, 2005) and Clive Spash (1999) cover the development and modern history of ecological economics and explain its differentiation from resource and environmental economics, as well as some of the controversy between American and European schools of thought. An article by Robert Costanza, David Stern, Lining He, and Chunbo Ma responded to a call by Mick Common to determine the foundational literature of ecological economics by using citation analysis to examine which books and articles have had the most influence on the development of the field. However, citations analysis has itself proven controversial and similar work has been criticized by Clive Spash for attempting to pre-determine what is regarded as influential in ecological economics through study design and data manipulation. In addition, the journal Ecological Economics has itself been criticized for swamping the field with mainstream economics. = Schools of thought = Various competing schools of thought exist in the field. Some are close to resource and environmental economics while others are far more heterodox in outlook. An example of the latter is the European Society for Ecological Economics. An example of the former is the Swedish Beijer International Institute of Ecological Economics. Clive Spash has argued for the classification of the ecological economics movement, and more generally work by different economic schools on the environment, into three main categories. These are the mainstream new resource economists, the new environmental pragmatists,http://www.clivespash.org/wp- content/uploads/2015/04/Spash_NEP_2009_EV.pdf and the more radical social ecological economists. International survey work comparing the relevance of the categories for mainstream and heterodox economists shows some clear divisions between environmental and ecological economists. = Differences from mainstream economics = Some ecological economists prioritise adding natural capital to the typical capital asset analysis of land, labor, and financial capital. These ecological economists then use tools from mathematical economics as in mainstream economics, but may apply them more closely to the natural world. Whereas mainstream economists tend to be technological optimists, ecological economists are inclined to be technological sceptics. They reason that the natural world has a limited carrying capacity and that its resources may run out. Since destruction of important environmental resources could be practically irreversible and catastrophic, ecological economists are inclined to justify cautionary measures based on the precautionary principle. The most cogent example of how the different theories treat similar assets is tropical rainforest ecosystems, most obviously the Yasuni region of Ecuador. While this area has substantial deposits of bitumen it is also one of the most diverse ecosystems on Earth and some estimates establish it has over 200 undiscovered medical substances in its genomes - most of which would be destroyed by logging the forest or mining the bitumen. Effectively, the instructional capital of the genomes is undervalued by analyses that view the rainforest primarily as a source of wood, oil/tar and perhaps food. Increasingly the carbon credit for leaving the extremely carbon-intensive (\\"dirty\\") bitumen in the ground is also valued - the government of Ecuador set a price of US$350M for an oil lease with the intent of selling it to someone committed to never exercising it at all and instead preserving the rainforest. While this natural capital and ecosystems services approach has proven popular amongst many it has also been contested as failing to address the underlying problems with mainstream economics, growth, market capitalism and monetary valuation of the environment.Martinez- Alier, J., 1994.

Nature and ecology  Natural resources flow through the economy and end up as waste and pollution A simple circular flow of income diagram is replaced in ecological economics by a more complex flow diagram reflecting the input of solar energy, which sustains natural inputs and environmental services which are then used as units of production. Once consumed, natural inputs pass out of the economy as pollution and waste. The potential of an environment to provide services and materials is referred to as an \\"environment's source function\\", and this function is depleted as resources are consumed or pollution contaminates the resources. The \\"sink function\\" describes an environment's ability to absorb and render harmless waste and pollution: when waste output exceeds the limit of the sink function, long-term damage occurs.Harris J. (2006). Environmental and Natural Resource Economics: A Contemporary Approach. Houghton Mifflin Company. Some persistent pollutants, such as some organic pollutants and nuclear waste are absorbed very slowly or not at all; ecological economists emphasize minimizing \\"cumulative pollutants\\". Pollutants affect human health and the health of the ecosystem. The economic value of natural capital and ecosystem services is accepted by mainstream environmental economics, but is emphasized as especially important in ecological economics. Ecological economists may begin by estimating how to maintain a stable environment before assessing the cost in dollar terms. Ecological economist Robert Costanza led an attempted valuation of the global ecosystem in 1997. Initially published in Nature, the article concluded on $33 trillion with a range from $16 trillion to $54 trillion (in 1997, total global GDP was $27 trillion). Half of the value went to nutrient cycling. The open oceans, continental shelves, and estuaries had the highest total value, and the highest per-hectare values went to estuaries, swamps/floodplains, and seagrass/algae beds. The work was criticized by articles in Ecological Economics Volume 25, Issue 1, but the critics acknowledged the positive potential for economic valuation of the global ecosystem. The Earth's carrying capacity is a central issue in ecological economics. Early economists such as Thomas Malthus pointed out the finite carrying capacity of the earth, which was also central to the MIT study Limits to Growth. Diminishing returns suggest that productivity increases will slow if major technological progress is not made. Food production may become a problem, as erosion, an impending water crisis, and soil salinity (from irrigation) reduce the productivity of agriculture. Ecological economists argue that industrial agriculture, which exacerbates these problems, is not sustainable agriculture, and are generally inclined favorably to organic farming, which also reduces the output of carbon. Global wild fisheries are believed to have peaked and begun a decline, with valuable habitat such as estuaries in critical condition. The aquaculture or farming of piscivorous fish, like salmon, does not help solve the problem because they need to be fed products from other fish. Studies have shown that salmon farming has major negative impacts on wild salmon, as well as the forage fish that need to be caught to feed them. Knapp G, Roheim CA and Anderson JL (2007) The Great Salmon Run: Competition Between Wild And Farmed Salmon World Wildlife Fund. Washington Post. Salmon Farming May Doom Wild Populations, Study Says. Since animals are higher on the trophic level, they are less efficient sources of food energy. Reduced consumption of meat would reduce the demand for food, but as nations develop, they tend to adopt high- meat diets similar to that of the United States. Genetically modified food (GMF) a conventional solution to the problem, presents numerous problems - Bt corn produces its own Bacillus thuringiensis toxin/protein, but the pest resistance is believed to be only a matter of time. Global warming is now widely acknowledged as a major issue, with all national scientific academies expressing agreement on the importance of the issue. As the population growth intensifies and energy demand increases, the world faces an energy crisis. Some economists and scientists forecast a global ecological crisis if energy use is not contained - the Stern report is an example. The disagreement has sparked a vigorous debate on issue of discounting and intergenerational equity.

Ecological economics is more willing to entertain alternative conceptions of utility, efficiency, and cost- benefits such as positional analysis or multi-criteria analysis. Ecological economics is typically viewed as economics for sustainable development,Soderbaum P. (2004). Politics and Ideology in Ecological Economics. Internet Encyclopaedia of Ecological Economics. and may have goals similar to green politics. = Green economics = In international, regional, and national policy circles, the concept of the green economy grew in popularity as a response to the financial predicament at first then became a vehicle for growth and development. The United Nations Environment Program (UNEP) defines a ‚Äògreen economy‚Äô as one that focuses on the human aspects and natural influences and an economic order that can generate high-salary jobs. In 2011, its definition was further developed as the word ‚Äògreen‚Äô is made to refer to an economy that is not only resourceful and well-organized but also impartial, guaranteeing an objective shift to an economy that is low-carbon, resource-efficient, and socially-inclusive. The ideas and studies regarding the green economy denote a fundamental shift for more effective, resourceful, environment-friendly and resource‚Äêsaving technologies that could lessen emissions and alleviate the adverse consequences of climate change, at the same time confront issues about resource exhaustion and grave environmental dilapidation. As an indispensable requirement and vital precondition to realizing sustainable development, the Green Economy adherents robustly promote good governance. To boost local investments and foreign ventures, it is crucial to have a constant and foreseeable macroeconomic atmosphere. Likewise, such an environment will also need to be transparent and accountable. In the absence of a substantial and solid governance structure, the prospect of shifting towards a sustainable development route would be insignificant. In achieving a green economy, competent institutions and governance systems are vital in guaranteeing the efficient execution of strategies, guidelines, campaigns, and programmes. Shifting to a Green Economy demands a fresh mindset and an innovative outlook of doing business. It likewise necessitates new capacities, skills set from labor and professionals who can competently function across sectors, and able to work as effective components within multi-disciplinary teams. To achieve this goal, vocational training packages must be developed with focus on greening the sectors. Simultaneously, the educational system needs to be assessed as well in order to fit in the environmental and social considerations of various disciplines.UNEP, 2012. GREEN ECONOMY IN ACTION: Articles and Excerpts that Illustrate Green Economy and Sustainable Development Efforts, p. 6. Retrieved 8 June 2018 from http://www.un.org/waterforlifedecade/pdf/green_economy_in_action_eng.pdf  Topics  Among the topics addressed by ecological economics are methodology, allocation of resources, weak versus strong sustainability, energy economics, energy accounting and balance, environmental services, cost shifting, modeling, and monetary policy. = Methodology = A primary objective of ecological economics (EE) is to ground economic thinking and practice in physical reality, especially in the laws of physics (particularly the laws of thermodynamics) and in knowledge of biological systems. It accepts as a goal the improvement of human well-being through development, and seeks to ensure achievement of this through planning for the sustainable development of ecosystems and societies. Of course the terms development and sustainable development are far from lacking controversy. Richard B. Norgaard argues traditional economics has hi-jacked the development terminology in his book Development Betrayed.Norgaard, R. B. (1994) Development Betrayed: The End of Progress and a Coevolutionary Revisioning of the Future. London: Routledge Well-being in ecological economics is also differentiated from welfare as found in mainstream economics and the 'new welfare economics' from the 1930s which informs resource and environmental economics. This entails a limited preference utilitarian conception of value i.e., Nature is valuable to our economies, that is because people will pay for its services such as clean air, clean water, encounters with wilderness, etc. Ecological economics is distinguishable from neoclassical economics primarily by its assertion that the economy is embedded within an environmental system. Ecology deals with the energy and matter transactions of life and the Earth, and the human economy is by definition contained within this system. Ecological economists argue that neoclassical economics has ignored the environment, at best considering it to be a subset of the human economy. The neoclassical view ignores much of what the natural sciences have taught us about the contributions of nature to the creation of wealth e.g., the planetary endowment of scarce matter and energy, along with the complex and biologically diverse ecosystems that provide goods and ecosystem services directly to human communities: micro- and macro-climate regulation, water recycling, water purification, storm water regulation, waste absorption, food and medicine production, pollination, protection from solar and cosmic radiation, the view of a starry night sky, etc. There has then been a move to regard such things as natural capital and ecosystems functions as goods and services.Daily, G.C. 1997. Nature's Services: Societal Dependence on Natural Ecosystems. Washington, D.C.: Island Press.Millennium Ecosystem Assessment. 2005. Ecosystems and Human Well-Being: Biodiversity Synthesis. Washington, D.C.: World Resources Institute. However, this is far from uncontroversial within ecology or ecological economics due to the potential for narrowing down values to those found in mainstream economics and the danger of merely regarding Nature as a commodity. This has been referred to as ecologists 'selling out on Nature'. There is then a concern that ecological economics has failed to learn from the extensive literature in environmental ethics about how to structure a plural value system. = Allocation of resources = The marginal costs of a growing economy may gradually exceed the marginal benefits, however measured. Resource and neoclassical economics focus primarily on the efficient allocation of resources and less on the two other problems of importance to ecological economics: distribution (equity), and the scale of the economy relative to the ecosystems upon which it relies.Daly, H. and Farley, J. 2004. Ecological Economics: Principles and Applications. Washington: Island Press. Ecological economics makes a clear distinction between growth (quantitative increase in economic output) and development (qualitative improvement of the quality of life), while arguing that neoclassical economics confuses the two. Ecological economists point out that beyond modest levels, increased per-capita consumption (the typical economic measure of \\"standard of living\\") may not always lead to improvement in human well-being, but may have harmful effects on the environment and broader societal well-being. This situation is sometimes referred to as uneconomic growth (see diagram above). =Weak versus strong sustainability= File:Nested_sustainability-v2.gifrightThe three nested systems of sustainability - the economy wholly contained by society, wholly contained by the biophysical environment.

The impending depletion of natural resources and increase of climate-changing greenhouse gasses should motivate us to examine how political, economic and social policies can benefit from alternative energy. Shifting dependence on fossil fuels with specific interest within just one of the above-mentioned factors easily benefits at least one other. For instance, photo voltaic (or solar) panels have a 15% efficiency when absorbing the sun's energy, but its construction demand has increased 120% within both commercial and residential properties. Additionally, this construction has led to a roughly 30% increase in work demands (Chen). The potential for the substitution of man-made capital for natural capital is an important debate in ecological economics and the economics of sustainability. There is a continuum of views among economists between the strongly neoclassical positions of Robert Solow and Martin Weitzman, at one extreme and the 'entropy pessimists', notably Nicholas Georgescu-Roegen and Herman Daly, at the other. Neoclassical economists tend to maintain that man-made capital can, in principle, replace all types of natural capital. This is known as the weak sustainability view, essentially that every technology can be improved upon or replaced by innovation, and that there is a substitute for any and all scarce materials. At the other extreme, the strong sustainability view argues that the stock of natural resources and ecological functions are irreplaceable. From the premises of strong sustainability, it follows that economic policy has a fiduciary responsibility to the greater ecological world, and that sustainable development must therefore take a different approach to valuing natural resources and ecological functions. Recently, Stanislav Shmelev developed a new methodology for the assessment of progress at the macro scale based on multi-criteria methods, which allows consideration of different perspectives, including strong and weak sustainability or conservationists vs industrialists and aims to search for a 'middle way' by providing a strong neo-Keynesian economic push without putting excessive pressure on the natural resources, including water or producing emissions, both directly and indirectly.Shmelev, S.E. 2012. Ecological Economics. Sustainability in Practice, Springer = Energy economics = Exergy analysis can be performed to find connections between economic value and the physical world. Here the costs of heating (vertical axis) are compared with the exergy content of different energy carriers (horizontal axis). Red dots and trend line indicate energy prices for consumers, blue dots and trend line indicate total price for consumers including capital expenditure for the heating system. Energy carriers included are district heating (D), ground-source heat pump (G), exhaust air heat pump (A), bioenergy meaning firewood (B), heating oil (O) and direct electric heating (E). A key concept of energy economics is net energy gain, which recognizes that all energy sources require an initial energy investment in order to produce energy. To be useful the energy return on energy invested (EROEI) has to be greater than one. The net energy gain from the production of coal, oil and gas has declined over time as the easiest to produce sources have been most heavily depleted. Ecological economics generally rejects the view of energy economics that growth in the energy supply is related directly to well being, focusing instead on biodiversity and creativity - or natural capital and individual capital, in the terminology sometimes adopted to describe these economically. In practice, ecological economics focuses primarily on the key issues of uneconomic growth and quality of life. Ecological economists are inclined to acknowledge that much of what is important in human well-being is not analyzable from a strictly economic standpoint and suggests an interdisciplinary approach combining social and natural sciences as a means to address this. Thermoeconomics is based on the proposition that the role of energy in biological evolution should be defined and understood through the second law of thermodynamics, but also in terms of such economic criteria as productivity, efficiency, and especially the costs and benefits (or profitability) of the various mechanisms for capturing and utilizing available energy to build biomass and do work.Peter A. Corning 1 *, Stephen J. Kline. (2000). Thermodynamics, information and life revisited, Part II: Thermoeconomics and Control information Systems Research and Behavioral Science, Apr. 07, Volume 15, Issue 6, Pages 453 ‚Äì 482Corning, P. (2002). ‚ÄúThermoeconomics ‚Äì Beyond the Second Law ‚Äù ‚Äì source: www.complexsystems.org As a result, thermoeconomics is often discussed in the field of ecological economics, which itself is related to the fields of sustainability and sustainable development. Exergy analysis is performed in the field of industrial ecology to use energy more efficiently. The term exergy, was coined by Zoran Rant in 1956, but the concept was developed by J. Willard Gibbs. In recent decades, utilization of exergy has spread outside of physics and engineering to the fields of industrial ecology, ecological economics, systems ecology, and energetics. = Energy accounting and balance = An energy balance can be used to track energy through a system, and is a very useful tool for determining resource use and environmental impacts, using the First and Second laws of thermodynamics, to determine how much energy is needed at each point in a system, and in what form that energy is a cost in various environmental issues. The energy accounting system keeps track of energy in, energy out, and non-useful energy versus work done, and transformations within the system. Scientists have written and speculated on different aspects of energy accounting.Stabile, Donald R. \\"Veblen and the Political Economy of the Engineer: the radical thinker and engineering leaders came to technocratic ideas at the same time,\\" American Journal of Economics and Sociology (45:1) 1986, 43-44. = Ecosystem services and their valuation = Ecological economists agree that ecosystems produce enormous flows of goods and services to human beings, playing a key role in producing well-being. At the same time, there is intense debate about how and when to place values on these benefits.Farley, Joshua. \\"Ecosystem services: The economics debate.\\" Ecosystem services 1.1 (2012): 40-49. https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ecoser.2012.07.002 A study was carried out by Costanza and colleagues to determine the 'value' of the services provided by the environment. This was determined by averaging values obtained from a range of studies conducted in very specific context and then transferring these without regard to that context. Dollar figures were averaged to a per hectare number for different types of ecosystem e.g. wetlands, oceans. A total was then produced which came out at 33 trillion US dollars (1997 values), more than twice the total GDP of the world at the time of the study. This study was criticized by pre-ecological and even some environmental economists - for being inconsistent with assumptions of financial capital valuation - and ecological economists - for being inconsistent with an ecological economics focus on biological and physical indicators. The whole idea of treating ecosystems as goods and services to be valued in monetary terms remains controversial. A common objection is that life is precious or priceless, but this demonstrably degrades to it being worthless within cost-benefit analysis and other standard economic methods. Reducing human bodies to financial values is a necessary part of mainstream economics and not always in the direct terms of insurance or wages. Economics, in principle, assumes that conflict is reduced by agreeing on voluntary contractual relations and prices instead of simply fighting or coercing or tricking others into providing goods or services. In doing so, a provider agrees to surrender time and take bodily risks and other (reputation, financial) risks. Ecosystems are no different from other bodies economically except insofar as they are far less replaceable than typical labour or commodities. Despite these issues, many ecologists and conservation biologists are pursuing ecosystem valuation. Biodiversity measures in particular appear to be the most promising way to reconcile financial and ecological values, and there are many active efforts in this regard. The growing field of biodiversity financeSocialEdge.org. Accessed: December 23, 2012. began to emerge in 2008 in response to many specific proposals such as the Ecuadoran Yasuni proposal Multinational Monitor, 9/2007. Accessed: December 23, 2012. or similar ones in the Congo. US news outlets treated the stories as a \\"threat\\" to \\"drill a park\\" reflecting a previously dominant view that NGOs and governments had the primary responsibility to protect ecosystems. However Peter Barnes and other commentators have recently argued that a guardianship/trustee/commons model is far more effective and takes the decisions out of the political realm. Commodification of other ecological relations as in carbon credit and direct payments to farmers to preserve ecosystem services are likewise examples that enable private parties to play more direct roles protecting biodiversity, but is also controversial in ecological economics. The United Nations Food and Agriculture Organization achieved near-universal agreement in 2008 that such payments directly valuing ecosystem preservation and encouraging permaculture were the only practical way out of a food crisis. The holdouts were all English-speaking countries that export GMOs and promote \\"free trade\\" agreements that facilitate their own control of the world transport network: The US, UK, Canada and Australia. = Not 'externalities', but cost shifting = Ecological economics is founded upon the view that the neoclassical economics (NCE) assumption that environmental and community costs and benefits are mutually canceling \\"externalities\\" is not warranted. Joan Martinez Alier, for instance shows that the bulk of consumers are automatically excluded from having an impact upon the prices of commodities, as these consumers are future generations who have not been born yet. The assumptions behind future discounting, which assume that future goods will be cheaper than present goods, has been criticized by David PearcePearce, David \\"Blueprint for a Green Economy\\" and by the recent Stern Report (although the Stern report itself does employ discounting and has been criticized for this and other reasons by ecological economists such as Clive Spash). Concerning these externalities, some like the eco-businessman Paul Hawken argue an orthodox economic line that the only reason why goods produced unsustainably are usually cheaper than goods produced sustainably is due to a hidden subsidy, paid by the non-monetized human environment, community or future generations.Hawken, Paul (1994) \\"The Ecology of Commerce\\" (Collins) These arguments are developed further by Hawken, Amory and Hunter Lovins to promote their vision of an environmental capitalist utopia in Natural Capitalism: Creating the Next Industrial Revolution.Hawken, Paul; Amory and Hunter Lovins (2000) \\"Natural Capitalism: Creating the Next Industrial Revolution\\" (Back Bay Books) In contrast, ecological economists, like Joan Martinez-Alier, appeal to a different line of reasoning.Martinez- Alier, Joan (2002) The Environmentalism of the Poor: A Study of Ecological Conflicts and Valuation. Cheltenham, Edward Elgar Rather than assuming some (new) form of capitalism is the best way forward, an older ecological economic critique questions the very idea of internalizing externalities as providing some corrective to the current system. The work by Karl William Kapp explains why the concept of \\"externality\\" is a misnomer.Kapp, Karl William (1963) The Social Costs of Business Enterprise. Bombay/London, Asia Publishing House. In fact the modern business enterprise operates on the basis of shifting costs onto others as normal practice to make profits.Kapp, Karl William (1971) Social costs, neo-classical economics and environmental planning. The Social Costs of Business Enterprise, 3rd edition. K. W. Kapp. Nottingham, Spokesman: 305-318 Charles Eisenstein has argued that this method of privatising profits while socialising the costs through externalities, passing the costs to the community, to the natural environment or to future generations is inherently destructive.Eisenstein , Charles (2011), \\"Sacred Economics: Money, Gift and Society in an Age in Transition\\" (Evolver Editions) As social ecological economist Clive Spash has noted, externality theory fallaciously assumes environmental and social problems are minor aberrations in an otherwise perfectly functioning efficient economic system. Copy also available at Internalizing the odd externality does nothing to address the structural systemic problem and fails to recognize the all pervasive nature of these supposed 'externalities'. = Ecological-economic modeling = Mathematical modeling is a powerful tool that is used in ecological economic analysis. Various approaches and techniques include:Proops, J., and Safonov, P. (eds.) (2004), Modelling in Ecological Economics , Edward ElgarFaucheux, S., Pearce, D., and Proops, J. (eds.) (1995), Models of Sustainable Development, Edward Elgar evolutionary, input-output, neo-Austrian modeling, entropy and thermodynamic models, multi-criteria, and agent-based modeling, the environmental Kuznets curve, and Stock-Flow consistent model frameworks. System dynamics and GIS are techniques applied, among other, to spatial dynamic landscape simulation modeling.Costanza, R., and Voinov, A. (eds.) (2004), Landscape Simulation Modeling. A Spatially Explicit, Dynamic Approach, Springer-Verlag New-York, Inc. The Matrix accounting methods of Christian Felber provide a more sophisticated method for identifying \\"the common good\\"Felber, Christian (2012), \\"La economia del bien commun\\" (Duestro) = Monetary theory and policy = Ecological economics draws upon its work on resource allocation and strong sustainability to address monetary policy. Drawing upon a transdisciplinary literature, ecological economics roots its policy work in monetary theory and its goals of sustainable scale, just distribution, and efficient allocation. Ecological economics' work on monetary theory and policy can be traced to Frederick Soddy's work on money. The field considers questions such as the growth imperative of interest-bearing debt, the nature of money, and alternative policy proposals such as alternative currencies and public banking. Criticism Assigning monetary value to natural resources such as biodiversity, and the emergent ecosystem services is often viewed as a key process in influencing economic practices, policy, and decision-making.Mace GM. Whose conservation? Science (80- ). 2014 Sep 25;345(6204):1558‚Äì60.Dasgupta P. Nature‚Äôs role in sustaining economic development. Philos Trans R Soc Lond B Biol Sci. 2010 Jan 12;365(1537):5‚Äì11. While this idea is becoming more and more accepted among ecologists and conservationist, some argue that it is inherently false. McCauley argues that ecological economics and the resulting ecosystem service based conservation can be harmful. He describes four main problems with this approach: Firstly, it seems to be assumed that all ecosystem services are financially beneficial. This is undermined by a basic characteristic of ecosystems: they do not act specifically in favour of any single species. While certain services might be very useful to us, such as coastal protection from hurricanes by mangroves for example, others might cause financial or personal harm, such as wolves hunting cattle.Mech LD. The Challenge and Opportunity of Recovering Wolf Populations. Conserv Biol. 1995 Apr;9(2):270‚Äì8 The complexity of Eco-systems makes it challenging to weigh up the value of a given species. Wolves play a critical role in regulating prey populations; the absence of such an apex predator in the Scottish Highlands has caused the over population of deer, preventing afforestation, which increases the risk of flooding and damage to property. Secondly, allocating monetary value to nature would make its conservation reliant on markets that fluctuate. This can lead to devaluation of services that were previously considered financially beneficial. Such is the case of the bees in a forest near former coffee plantations in Finca Santa Fe, Costa Rica. The pollination services were valued to over US$60,000 a year, but soon after the study, coffee prices dropped and the fields were replanted with pineapple.Ricketts TH, Daily GC, Ehrlich PR, Michener CD. Economic value of tropical forest to coffee production. Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A. 2004 Aug 24;101(34):12579‚Äì82 Pineapple does not require bees to be pollinated, so the value of their service dropped to zero. Thirdly, conservation programmes for the sake of financial benefit underestimate human ingenuity to invent and replace ecosystem services by artificial means. McCauley argues that such proposals are deemed to have a short lifespan as the history of technology is about how Humanity developed artificial alternatives to nature's services and with time passing the cost of such services tend to decrease. This would also lead to the devaluation of ecosystem services. Lastly, it should not be assumed that conserving ecosystems is always financially beneficial as opposed to alteration. In the case of the introduction of the Nile perch to Lake Victoria, the ecological consequence was decimation of native fauna. However, this same event is praised by the local communities as they gain significant financial benefits from trading the fish. McCauley argues that, for these reasons, trying to convince decision-makers to conserve nature for monetary reasons is not the path to be followed, and instead appealing to morality is the ultimate way to campaign for the protection of nature.

Abstract. Due to diversity of issues and methods applied and shared with a number of academic disciplines, energy economics does not present itself as a self-contained academic discipline, but it is an applied subdiscipline of economics. From the list of main topics of economics, some relate strongly to energy economics: * Computable general equilibrium * Econometrics * Environmental economics * Finance * Industrial organization * Input‚Äìoutput model * Microeconomics * Macroeconomics * Operations research * Resource economics Energy economics also draws heavily on results of energy engineering, geology, political sciences, ecology etc. Recent focus of energy economics includes the following issues: * Climate change and climate policy * Demand response * Elasticity of supply and demand in energy market * Energy and economic growth * Energy derivatives * Energy elasticity * Energy forecasting * Energy markets and electricity markets - liberalisation, (de- or re-) regulation * Economics of energy infrastructure * Energy policy * Environmental policy * Risk analysis and security of supply * Sustainability Some institutions of higher education (universities) recognise energy economics as a viable career opportunity, offering this as a curriculum. The University of Cambridge, Massachusetts Institute of Technology and the Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam are the top three research universities, and Resources for the Future the top research institute. There are numerous other research departments, companies and professionals offering energy economics studies and consultations. History World prices for energy, 1991‚Äì2010. 2000=100. Energy related issues have been actively present in economic literature since the 1973 oil crisis, but have their roots much further back in the history. As early as 1865, W.S. Jevons expressed his concern about the eventual depletion of coal resources in his book The Coal Question. One of the best known early attempts to work on the economics of exhaustible resources (incl. fossil fuel) was made by H. Hotelling, who derived a price path for non-renewable resources, known as Hotelling's rule.

It is a primarily undergraduate university offering bachelor's degrees in the arts (humanities and social sciences), education, and social work to approximately 1,900 students. The average class size is 30 and no class is larger than 60. The university offers a number of unique programs including recognized majors in Criminology, Journalism, Human Rights, and Communications and Public Policy. St. Thomas is the home of the Frank McKenna Centre for Communications and Public Policy. The university is unique in Canada for its sole focus on liberal arts and its commitment to social justice. St. Thomas' notable alumni includes a Canadian prime minister, Brian Mulroney, a New Brunswick premier, Shawn Graham, federal and provincial cabinet ministers, clerics, university presidents as well as several Rhodes Scholars. History St. Thomas University traces its institutional origins to the establishment of a Catholic academy in the former community of Chatham, New Brunswick (now Miramichi) in the late nineteenth century. Due to an influx of Irish immigration in northwestern New Brunswick, Chatham saw a need for more centres of education and religious instruction. Officially opened in October of 1860, St. Michael‚Äôs Academy was inaugurated by Bishop James Rogers of the newly formed Diocese of Chatham.Church, Politics, and STU: The Relocation of St. Thomas University from Chatham to Fredericton, p. 3-4. St. Michael‚Äôs Academy catered to young English-speaking males in the Miramichi River Valley and the growing port town of Chatham. A women‚Äôs academy was created a year later. St. Michael‚Äôs consisted of a single wooden structure constructed near the seat of the Diocese of Chatham, the new St. Michael‚Äôs Cathedral. The institution offered a classical education and was intended to prepare students to study for the diocesan priesthood. From 1865, the school was known as St. Michael‚Äôs College. It closed for several years in the 1870s and 1880s. Its uneven operation was curbed by the Basilian Fathers, a religious order who assumed the administration of the College in 1910. Since the Toronto-based religious order already had a Catholic college in the Ontario capital, named St. Michael's College (a federated component of the University of Toronto), St. Michael‚Äôs in Chatham was renamed St. Thomas College after Thomas Aquinas. It remained a high school and a junior college; however, in 1934 the institution gained degree granting status from the Government of New Brunswick. STU's lower campus in Fredericton After 1923, the Basilian Fathers transferred the administration of the college to the Diocese of Chatham.Church, Politics, and STU: The Relocation of St. Thomas University from Chatham to Fredericton, p.3-4. The diocese was restructured as the Diocese of Bathurst. Its seat was moved to the primarily francophone community, Bathurst, south of Chatham. While St. Thomas College remained in Chatham, its future remained uncertain. In 1959, the college was subject to territorial changes in the reorganized Diocese of Bathurst. English-speaking parishes and the college were transferred to the Diocese of Saint John with its seat in New Brunswick's major port city.Church, Politics, and STU, 53-55. The Bishop of Saint John became the Chancellor of St. Thomas. By mid-century, the economic and social significance of post-secondary institutions saw an increased role of state intervention. In 1960, the institution was renamed St. Thomas University by an act of the New Brunswick Legislature. Under the government of Louis Robichaud, the Royal Commission on Higher Education was launched. Headed by John James Deutsch, a professor and administrator from Queen‚Äôs University, the commission recommended greater centralization and public funding in post-secondary education. Arising from the Commission‚Äôs recommendations, St. Thomas University was encouraged to relocated to the campus of the University of New Brunswick in Fredericton to share facilities. Not without controversy and animosity, St. Thomas University moved to the provincial capital and abandoned its secondary school curriculum. A new campus was built in the Neo-Georgian style by the architects of the University of New Brunswick (Larson & Larson) to compliment the campus of its institutional neighbour.Church, Politics, and STU, p.176-177. It officially welcomed students in October of 1964. Today, St. Thomas University is largely a secular institution and remains the only exclusive liberal arts university in Canada. Relationship with the UNB St. Thomas University and the University of New Brunswick's Fredericton campus are located in the College Hill neighbourhood in Fredericton. The two institutions share facilities for their student unions, libraries, athletics, and a common heating plant and building maintenance services. Students from STU are permitted to take a certain number of classes at UNB and vice versa. However, STU and UNBF itself are financially and academically separate. STU is able to offer many amenities other smaller schools cannot, in large part to its UNB partnership. The two universities enjoy a good-natured rivalry. Now sharing a campus with the University of New Brunswick (pictured), STU relocated to Fredericton from Chatham, New Brunswick in 1964 Academics STU offers the following programmes to students: Bachelor of Arts, Bachelor of Applied Arts, Bachelor of Education, Bachelor of Social Work.St. Thomas University Programmes STU offers the following degrees to students: Anthropology, Catholic Studies, Communications and Public Policy, Criminology & Criminal Justice, Economics, Education, English Language and Literature (with the option to additionally concentrate in Creative Writing or Drama), Environment and Society, Fine Arts, French, Gerontology, Great Books, History, Human Rights, Humanities, Interdisciplinary Studies, International Relations, Irish Studies, Journalism, Mathematics, Media Studies, Native Studies, Philosophy, Political Science, Psychology, Religious Studies, Romance Languages, Science and Technology Studies, Social Work, Sociology, Spanish, Women's Studies and Gender Studies. Scholarships and bursaries The Government of Canada sponsors an Aboriginal Bursaries Search Tool that lists over 680 scholarships, bursaries, and other incentives offered by governments, universities, and industry to support Aboriginal post-secondary participation. St. Thomas University scholarships for Aboriginal, First Nations and M√©tis students include: ATV Media Scholarship.St. Thomas University Overview of Scholarships STU's upper campus Research At St. Thomas University, there are 6 focal areas of research: qualitative analysis, human rights and social justice, New Brunswick studies/Atlantic region, narrative studies, global and international studies, and on learning and teaching. The university holds Canada Research Chairs (with the associated research centres) in New Brunswick studies, social justice, qualitative analysis, and narrative. The university is home to the Centre for Interdisciplinary Research on Narrative. Campus life Brian Mulroney Hall There are six academic buildings on campus housing classrooms and faculty offices. They are: James Dunn Hall, Edmund Casey Hall, George Martin Hall, Brian Mulroney Hall, Holy Cross House, and Margaret Norrie McCain Hall. STU's athletic facility is called the J.B. O'Keefe Centre. There are four residence buildings at St. Thomas University. Three are located on campus (Harrington and Vanier Halls, and Holy Cross House), while two are located a short distance away (Rigby Hall and Chatham Hall). The university maintains its own campus police force. Campus police members are students who are hired annually by the University to maintain security at campus events.Employment on Campus The student newspaper, The Aquinian, is available on campus and around the city during the regular academic year.

Behavioral economics studies the effects of psychological, cognitive, emotional, cultural and social factors on the decisions of individuals and institutions and how those decisions vary from those implied by classical economic theory. Behavioral economics is primarily concerned with the bounds of rationality of economic agents. Behavioral models typically integrate insights from psychology, neuroscience and microeconomic theory. in The study of behavioral economics includes how market decisions are made and the mechanisms that drive public choice.  History  Adam Smith, author of The Wealth of Nations (1776) and The Theory of Moral Sentiments (1759). During the classical period of economics, microeconomics was closely linked to psychology. For example, Adam Smith wrote The Theory of Moral Sentiments, which proposed psychological explanations of individual behavior, including concerns about fairness and justice.. Jeremy Bentham wrote extensively on the psychological underpinnings of utility. Then, during the development of neo- classical economics, economists sought to reshape the discipline as a natural science, deducing behavior from assumptions about the nature of economic agents. They developed the concept of homo economicus, whose behavior was fundamentally rational. Neo-classical economists did incorporate psychological explanations: this was true of Francis Edgeworth, Vilfredo Pareto and Irving Fisher. Economic psychology emerged in the 20th century in the works of Gabriel Tarde, George Katona, and Laszlo Garai. Expected utility and discounted utility models began to gain acceptance, generating testable hypotheses about decision-making given uncertainty and intertemporal consumption, respectively. Observed and repeatable anomalies eventually challenged those hypotheses, and further steps were taken by Maurice Allais, for example, in setting out the Allais paradox, a decision problem he first presented in 1953 that contradicts the expected utility hypothesis. In the 1960s cognitive psychology began to shed more light on the brain as an information processing device (in contrast to behaviorist models). Psychologists in this field, such as Ward Edwards, Amos Tversky and Daniel Kahneman began to compare their cognitive models of decision-making under risk and uncertainty to economic models of rational behavior. Mathematical psychology reflects a longstanding interest in preference transitivity and the measurement of utility. = Nobel Laureates = In 2002, psychologist Daniel Kahneman was awarded the Nobel Memorial Prize in Economic Sciences \\"for having integrated insights from psychological research into economic science, especially concerning human judgment and decision-making under uncertainty.\\" In 2013, economist Robert J. Shiller received the Nobel Memorial Prize in Economic Sciences \\"for his empirical analysis of asset prices\\" (within the field of behavioral finance). In 2017, economist Richard Thaler was awarded the Nobel Memorial Prize in Economic Sciences for \\"his contributions to behavioral economics and his pioneering work in establishing that people are predictably irrational in ways that defy economic theory.\\" Kahneman and Tversky's in the late 1960s, published about 200 works, most of which relate to psychological concepts with implications for behavioral finance. In 2002, Kahneman received the Nobel Memorial Prize in Economic Sciences for his contributions to the study of rationality in economics, a total of six Nobel prizes have been awarded for behavioral research.  Bounded rationality  Herbert A. Simon, winner of the 1975 Turing award and the 1978 Nobel Prize in economics Bounded rationality is the idea that when individuals make decisions, their rationality is limited by the tractability of the decision problem, their cognitive limitations and the time available. Decision-makers in this view act as satisficers, seeking a satisfactory solution rather than an optimal one. Herbert A. Simon proposed bounded rationality as an alternative basis for the mathematical modeling of decision-making. It complements \\"rationality as optimization\\", which views decision-making as a fully rational process of finding an optimal choice given the information available. Simon used the analogy of a pair of scissors, where one blade represents human cognitive limitations and the other the \\"structures of the environment\\", illustrating how minds compensate for limited resources by exploiting known structural regularity in the environment. Bounded rationality implicates the idea that humans take shortcuts that may lead to suboptimal decision-making. Behavioral economists engage in mapping the decision shortcuts that agents use in order to help increase the effectiveness of human decision-making. One treatment of this idea comes from Cass Sunstein and Richard Thaler's Nudge. Sunstein and Thaler recommend that choice architectures are modified in light of human agents' bounded rationality. A widely cited proposal from Sunstein and Thaler urges that healthier food be placed at sight level in order to increase the likelihood that a person will opt for that choice instead of less healthy option. Some critics of Nudge have lodged attacks that modifying choice architectures will lead to people becoming worse decision-makers. Bounded rationality was shown to be essential to predict human sociability properties in a particular model by Vernon L. Smith and Michael J. Campbell. There, an agent-based model correctly predicts that agents are averse to resentment and punishment, and that there is an asymmetry between gratitude/reward and resentment/punishment. The purely rational Nash equilibrium is shown to have no predictive power for that model, and the boundedly rational Gibbs equilibrium must be used to predict phenomena outlined in Humanomics.  Prospect theory  Daniel Kahneman, winner of the 2002 Nobel Prize in economics In 1979, Kahneman and Tversky published Prospect Theory: An Analysis of Decision Under Risk, that used cognitive psychology to explain various divergences of economic decision making from neo-classical theory. Prospect theory has two stages: an editing stage and an evaluation stage. In the editing stage, risky situations are simplified using various heuristics. In the evaluation phase, risky alternatives are evaluated using various psychological principles that include: *Reference dependence: When evaluating outcomes, the decision maker considers a \\"reference level.\\" Outcomes are then compared to the reference point and classified as \\"gains\\" if greater than the reference point and \\"losses\\" if less than the reference point. * Loss aversion: Losses are avoided more than equivalent gains are sought. In their 1992 paper, Kahneman and Tversky found the median coefficient of loss aversion to be about 2.25, i.e., losses hurt about 2.25 times more than equivalent gains reward.Abstract. * Non-linear probability weighting: Decision makers overweigh small probabilities and underweigh large probabilities‚Äîthis gives rise to the inverse-S shaped \\"probability weighting function.\\" * Diminishing sensitivity to gains and losses: As the size of the gains and losses relative to the reference point increase in absolute value, the marginal effect on the decision maker's utility or satisfaction falls. Prospect theory is able to explain everything that the two main existing decision theories‚Äîexpected utility theory and rank dependent utility theory‚Äîcan explain. Further, prospect theory has been used to explain phenomena that existing decision theories have great difficulty in explaining. These include backward bending labor supply curves, asymmetric price elasticities, tax evasion and co-movement of stock prices and consumption. In 1992, in the Journal of Risk and Uncertainty, Kahneman and Tversky gave a revised account of prospect theory that they called cumulative prospect theory. The new theory eliminated the editing phase in prospect theory and focused just on the evaluation phase. Its main feature was that it allowed for non-linear probability weighting in a cumulative manner, which was originally suggested in John Quiggin's rank-dependent utility theory. Psychological traits such as overconfidence, projection bias, and the effects of limited attention are now part of the theory. Other developments include a conference at the University of Chicago, a special behavioral economics edition of the Quarterly Journal of Economics (\\"In Memory of Amos Tversky\\"), and Kahneman's 2002 Nobel Prize for having \\"integrated insights from psychological research into economic science, especially concerning human judgment and decision- making under uncertainty.\\"  Nudge theory  Nudge is a concept in behavioral science, political theory and economics which proposes positive reinforcement and indirect suggestions as ways to influence the behavior and decision making of groups or individuals. Nudging contrasts with other ways to achieve compliance, such as education, legislation or enforcement. The concept has influenced British and American politicians. Several nudge units exist around the world at the national level (UK, Germany, Japan and others) as well as at the international level (OECD, World Bank, UN). The first formulation of the term and associated principles was developed in cybernetics by James Wilk before 1995 and described by Brunel University academic D. J. Stewart as \\"the art of the nudge\\" (sometimes referred to as micronudges). It also drew on methodological influences from clinical psychotherapy tracing back to Gregory Bateson, including contributions from Milton Erickson, Watzlawick, Weakland and Fisch, and Bill O'Hanlon. In this variant, the nudge is a microtargetted design geared towards a specific group of people, irrespective of the scale of intended intervention. In 2008, Richard Thaler and Cass Sunstein's book Nudge: Improving Decisions About Health, Wealth, and Happiness brought nudge theory to prominence. It also gained a following among US and UK politicians, in the private sector and in public health.See: Dr. Jennifer Lunt and Malcolm Staves The authors refer to influencing behavior without coercion as libertarian paternalism and the influencers as choice architects. Thaler and Sunstein defined their concept as: In this form, drawing on behavioral economics, the nudge is more generally applied to influence behavior. One of the most frequently cited examples of a nudge is the etching of the image of a housefly into the men's room urinals at Amsterdam's Schiphol Airport, which is intended to \\"improve the aim.\\" Nudging techniques aim to use judgmental heuristics to our advantage. In other words, a nudge alters the environment so that when heuristic, or System 1, decision-making is used, the resulting choice will be the most positive or desired outcome. An example of such a nudge is switching the placement of junk food in a store, so that fruit and other healthy options are located next to the cash register, while junk food is relocated to another part of the store. In 2008, the United States appointed Sunstein, who helped develop the theory, as administrator of the Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs. Notable applications of nudge theory include the formation of the British Behavioural Insights Team in 2010. It is often called the \\"Nudge Unit\\", at the British Cabinet Office, headed by David Halpern. Both Prime Minister David Cameron and President Barack Obama sought to employ nudge theory to advance domestic policy goals during their terms. In Australia, the government of New South Wales established a Behavioural Insights community of practice. Nudge theory has also been applied to business management and corporate culture, such as in relation to health, safety and environment (HSE) and human resources. Regarding its application to HSE, one of the primary goals of nudge is to achieve a \\"zero accident culture.\\" Leading Silicon Valley companies are forerunners in applying nudge theory in a corporate setting. These companies are using nudges in various forms to increase the productivity and happiness of employees. Recently, further companies are gaining interest in using what is called \\"nudge management\\" to improve the productivity of their white-collar workers. Behavioral insights and nudges are currently used in many countries around the world. = Criticisms = Nudging has also been criticised. Tammy Boyce, from public health foundation The King's Fund, has said: \\"We need to move away from short-term, politically motivated initiatives such as the 'nudging people' idea, which is not based on any good evidence and doesn't help people make long-term behaviour changes.\\" Cass Sunstein has responded to critiques at length in his The Ethics of Influence making the case in favor of nudging against charges that nudges diminish autonomy, threaten dignity, violate liberties, or reduce welfare. Ethicists have debated this rigorously. These charges have been made by various participants in the debate from Bovens to Goodwin. Wilkinson for example charges nudges for being manipulative, while others such as Yeung question their scientific credibility. Some, such as Hausman & Welch have inquired whether nudging should be permissible on grounds of (distributive) justice; Lepenies & Malecka have questioned whether nudges are compatible with the rule of law. Similarly, legal scholars have discussed the role of nudges and the law. Behavioral economists such as Bob Sugden have pointed out that the underlying normative benchmark of nudging is still homo economicus, despite the proponents' claim to the contrary. It has been remarked that nudging is also a euphemism for psychological manipulation as practiced in social engineering. There exists an anticipation and, simultaneously, implicit criticism of the nudge theory in works of Hungarian social psychologists who emphasize the active participation in the nudge of its target (Ferenc Merei and Laszlo Garai).  Behavioral finance  Behavioral Finance is the study of the influence of psychology on the behavior of investors or financial analyst. It assumes that investors are not always rational, have limits to their self-control and are influenced by their own biases. For example, behavioral law and economics scholars studying the growth of financial firms‚Äô technological capabilities have attributed decision science to irrational consumer decisions.' It also includes the subsequent effects on the markets. Behavioral Finance attempts to explain the reasoning patterns of investors and measures the influential power of these patterns on the investor's decision making. The central issue in behavioral finance' is explaining why market participants make irrational systematic errors contrary to assumption of rational market participants. Such errors affect prices and returns, creating market inefficiencies. = Evolution = The foundations of behavioral finance can be traced back over 150 years. Several original books written in the 1800s and early 1900s marked the beginning of the behavioral finance school. Originally published in 1841, MacKay's 'Extraordinary Popular Delusions' and 'The Madness of Crowds' presents a chronological timeline of the various panics and schemes throughout history. This work shows how group behavior applies to the financial markets of today. Le Bon's important work, The Crowd: A Study of the Popular Mind, discusses the role of \\"crowds\\" (also known as crowd psychology) and group behavior as they apply to the fields of behavioral finance, social psychology, sociology, and history. Selden's 1912 book Psychology of The Stock Market was one of the first to apply the field of psychology directly to the stock market. This classic discusses the emotional and psychological forces at work on investors and traders in the financial markets. These three works along with several others form the foundation of applying psychology and sociology to the field of finance. The foundation of behavioral finance is an area based on an interdisciplinary approach including scholars from the social sciences and business schools. From the liberal arts perspective, this includes the fields of psychology, sociology, anthropology, economics and behavioral economics. On the business administration side, this covers areas such as management, marketing, finance, technology and accounting. = Traditional finance = The accepted theories of finance are referred to as traditional finance. The foundation of traditional finance is associated with the modern portfolio theory (MPT) and the efficient-market hypothesis (EMH). Modern portfolio theory is a stock or portfolio's expected return, standard deviation, and its correlation with the other stocks or mutual funds held within the portfolio. With these three concepts, an efficient portfolio can be created for any group of stocks or bonds. An efficient portfolio is a group of stocks that has the maximum (highest) expected return given the amount of risk assumed, contains the lowest possible risk for a given expected return. The efficient-market hypothesis states that all information has already been reflected in a security's price or market value, and that the current price of the stock or bond always trades at its fair value. The proponents of the traditional theories believe that 'investors should just own the entire market rather than attempting to outperform the market'. Behavioral finance has emerged as an alternative to these theories of traditional finance and the behavioral aspects of psychology and sociology are integral catalysts within this field of study. = Themes = The prevalent themes in behavioral finance are:  Heuristics Heuristics are mental shortcuts or rules of thumb. that simplify the complex methods to make a judgment. Investor as a decision- maker confronts a set of choices within certainty and limited ability to quantify results. Heuristics help to make decision. Some of heuristics are representativeness, anchoring and adjustments, familiarity, overconfidence, regret aversion, conservatism, mental accounting, availability, ambiguity aversion and effect.  Framing  Framing: The collection of anecdotes and stereotypes that make up the mental filters individuals rely on to understand and respond to events. The perceptions of choices that people have are strongly influenced by how these choices are framed. It means choices depend on how question is framed, even though the objective facts remain constant. Psychologists refer this behavior as a 'frame dependence'.  Emotions  Emotions and associated human unconscious needs, fantasies, and fears drive much decision of human beings. Behavioral finance recognizes the role Keynes's \\"animal spirit\\" plays in explaining investor choices, and thus shaping financial markets. Decision making based on extreme emotions or emotional strains such as anxiety, anger, fear, or excitement are a key reason why people do not make rational choices.  Market inefficiencies  These include mis-pricing and non-rational decision making. Behavioral finance affirms the fact that market prices did not appear to be fair. Traditional finance argues that investors' mistakes would not affect market prices because when prices deviate from fundamental value, rational investor would exploit the mispricing for their own profit. Even institutional investor exhibits the inefficiency. Arbitragers are those who make good profit when there is mispricing between the two markets. Market with people of different beliefs and motives prevents rational investor from correcting price deviations from fundamental value. This leaves open the possibility that correlated cognitive errors of investor could affect market prices. = Concepts =  Anchoring The concept of anchoring is based on one's tendency to attach or \\"anchor\\" thoughts to a reference point. Investor when making a decision evaluates a fact or a past event as a reference point which may or may not have a logical bearing to the decision in question. This becomes quite common when individuals evaluate decisions that are new or unfamiliar to them.  Overreaction and availability bias  Investors tend to overreact on the news, which ends up creating a disproportionate effect on share prices. Market overreacting signals a buying opportunity for investors. Availability bias is a part of overreaction, when investors decision-making process is strongly influenced by events closest and most available to them.  Mental accounting  Mental accounting refers to the propensity to allocate money for specific purposes. Mental accounting is a behavioral bias that causes one to separate money into different categories known as mental accounts either based on the source of money or the intention of the money.  Confirmation and hindsight bias  Investor is inclined to confirm to that piece of information or pay more attention to the things that support their own preconceived ideas and opinions, this is known as confirmation bias. Anything that is contrary to the confirmed view is ignored and rationalized. Hindsight bias is a tendency to see the past as being predictable and explainable. The truth is information now and information then is completely different.  Narrative fallacy  The narrative fallacy theory states that one is more likely to predict \\"tail\\" on the next outcome. This is because it is impossible to have \\"heads\\" consecutively for so many rounds. The truth is in every round, the chances of getting a \\"heads\\" or \\"tail\\" are always 50-50. The probability shouldn't be based on past results.  Herd behavior  Herd behavior states that people tend to mimic the financial behaviors of the majority of the herd. Herd behavior is like the collective wisdom of the crowd. Everyone thinks the same way, shares the same optimism and feel safe and secure with the crowd.  Overconfidence  Investors become overconfident of their abilities when they are on a winning streak. The ability to hand-pick selective stocks, beat the market and make a huge ton of money are all characteristics of Overconfidence. The skills are overestimated and the risks involved is underestimated. = Biases =  Disposition bias  Disposition bias refers to when investors sell their winners and hang onto their losers. Investors' thinking is that they want to realize gains quickly. When an investment is losing money, they'll hold onto it because they want to get back to even or their initial price. Investors tend to admit they are correct about an investment quickly (when there's a gain). However, investors are reluctant to admit when they made an investment mistake (when there's a loss).  Experiential bias  An experiential bias occurs when investors' memory of recent events makes them biased or leads them to believe that the event is far more likely to occur again. When investors have a bias toward accepting information that confirms their past experience in an investment. If information surfaces, investors accept it readily to confirm that they're correct about their investment decision and continue hold this bias unless proved wrong.  Familiarity bias  The familiarity bias is when investors tend to invest in what they know, such as domestic companies or locally owned investments. As a result, investors are not diversified across multiple sectors and types of investments, which can reduce risk. Investors tend to go with investments that they have a history with or have familiarity.  Loss aversion bias  Loss aversion occurs when investors place a greater weighting on the concern for losses than the pleasure from market gains. In other words, they're far more likely to try to assign a higher priority on avoiding losses than making investment gains. As a result, some investors might want a higher payout to compensate for losses. If the high payout isn't likely, they might try to avoid losses altogether even if the investment's risk is acceptable from a rational standpoint. = Criticisms = Critics such as Eugene Fama typically support the efficient-market hypothesis. They contend that behavioral finance is more a collection of anomalies than a true branch of finance and that these anomalies are either quickly priced out of the market or explained by appealing to market microstructure arguments. However, individual cognitive biases are distinct from social biases; the former can be averaged out by the market, while the other can create positive feedback loops that drive the market further and further from a \\"fair price\\" equilibrium. Fama argued that many of the findings in behavioral finance itself appear to be collection of anomalies that can be explained by market. It is observed that, the problem with the general area of behavioral finance is that it only serves as a complement to general economics. Similarly, for an anomaly to violate market efficiency, an investor must be able to trade against it and earn abnormal profits; this is not the case for many anomalies. A specific example of this criticism appears in some explanations of the equity premium puzzle. It is argued that the cause is entry barriers (both practical and psychological) and that the equity premium should reduce as electronic resources open up the stock market to more traders.See Freeman, 2004 for a review In response, others contend that most personal investment funds are managed through superannuation funds, minimizing the effect of these putative entry barriers. In addition, professional investors and fund managers seem to hold more bonds than one would expect given return differentials.  Quantitative behavioral finance  Quantitative behavioral finance uses mathematical and statistical methodology to understand behavioral biases. In marketing research, a study shows little evidence that escalating biases impact marketing decisions. Leading contributors include Gunduz Caginalp (Editor of the Journal of Behavioral Finance from 2001‚Äì04), and collaborators include 2002 Nobel Laureate Vernon Smith, David Porter, Don Balenovich, Vladimira Ilieva and Ahmet Duran, and Ray Sturm. = Financial models = Some financial models used in money management and asset valuation incorporate behavioral finance parameters. Examples: * Thaler's model of price reactions to information, with three phases (underreaction, adjustment, and overreaction), creating a price trend. :* One characteristic of overreaction is that average returns following announcements of good news is lower than following bad news. In other words, overreaction occurs if the market reacts too strongly or for too long to news, thus requiring an adjustment in the opposite direction. As a result, outperforming assets in one period is likely to underperform in the following period. This also applies to customers' irrational purchasing habits. :* The stock image coefficient.  Economic reasoning in animals  A handful of comparative psychologists have attempted to demonstrate quasi-economic reasoning in non-human animals. Early attempts along these lines focus on the behavior of rats and pigeons. These studies draw on the tenets of comparative psychology, where the main goal is to discover analogs to human behavior in experimentally-tractable non-human animals. They are also methodologically similar to the work of Ferster and Skinner. Methodological similarities aside, early researchers in non-human economics deviate from behaviorism in their terminology. Although such studies are set up primarily in an operant conditioning chamber using food rewards for pecking/bar-pressing behavior, the researchers describe pecking and bar- pressing not in terms of reinforcement and stimulus-response relationships but instead in terms of work, demand, budget, and labor. Recent studies have adopted a slightly different approach, taking a more evolutionary perspective, comparing economic behavior of humans to a species of non-human primate, the capuchin monkey. = Animal studies = Many early studies of non-human economic reasoning were performed on rats and pigeons in an operant conditioning chamber. These studies looked at things like peck rate (in the case of the pigeon) and bar-pressing rate (in the case of the rat) given certain conditions of reward. Early researchers claim, for example, that response pattern (pecking/bar-pressing rate) is an appropriate analogy to human labor supply. Researchers in this field advocate for the appropriateness of using animal economic behavior to understand the elementary components of human economic behavior. In a paper by Battalio, Green, and Kagel, they write, = Labor supply = The typical laboratory environment to study labor supply in pigeons is set up as follows. Pigeons are first deprived of food. Since the animals become hungry, food becomes highly desired. The pigeons are then placed in an operant conditioning chamber and through orienting and exploring the environment of the chamber they discover that by pecking a small disk located on one side of the chamber, food is delivered to them. In effect, pecking behavior becomes reinforced, as it is associated with food. Before long, the pigeon pecks at the disk (or stimulus) regularly. In this circumstance, the pigeon is said to \\"work\\" for the food by pecking. The food, then, is thought of as the currency. The value of the currency can be adjusted in several ways, including the amount of food delivered, the rate of food delivery and the type of food delivered (some foods are more desirable than others). Economic behavior similar to that observed in humans is discovered when the hungry pigeons stop working/work less when the reward is reduced. Researchers argue that this is similar to labor supply behavior in humans. That is, like humans (who, even in need, will only work so much for a given wage), the pigeons demonstrate decreases in pecking (work) when the reward (value) is reduced. = Demand = In human economics, a typical demand curve has negative slope. This means that as the price of a certain good increase, the amount that consumers are willing and able to purchase decreases. Researchers studying the demand curves of non-human animals, such as rats, also find downward slopes. Researchers have studied demand in rats in a manner distinct from studying labor supply in pigeons. Specifically, in an operant conditioning chamber containing rats as experimental subjects, we require them to press a bar, instead of pecking a small disk, to receive a reward. The reward can be food (reward pellets), water, or a commodity drink such as cherry cola. Unlike in previous pigeon studies, where the work analog was pecking and the monetary analog was a reward, the work analog in this experiment is bar-pressing. Under these circumstances, the researchers claim that changing the number of bar presses required to obtain a commodity item is analogous to changing the price of a commodity item in human economics. In effect, results of demand studies in non-human animals show that, as the bar- pressing requirement (cost) increase, the number of times an animal presses the bar equal to or greater than the bar-pressing requirement (payment) decreases.  Applied issues  = Intertemporal choice = David Laibson, professor of economics at Harvard University Behavioral economics has been applied to intertemporal choice, which is defined as making a decision and having the effects of such decision happening in a different time. Intertemporal choice behavior is largely inconsistent, as exemplified by George Ainslie's hyperbolic discounting‚Äîone of the prominently studied observations‚Äîand further developed by David Laibson, Ted O'Donoghue and Matthew Rabin. Hyperbolic discounting describes the tendency to discount outcomes in the near future more than outcomes in the far future. This pattern of discounting is dynamically inconsistent (or time-inconsistent), and therefore inconsistent with basic models of rational choice, since the rate of discount between time t and t+1 will be low at time t-1 when t is the near future, but high at time t when t is the present and time t+1 is the near future. This pattern can also be explained through models of sub-additive discounting that distinguish the delay and interval of discounting: people are less patient (per-time-unit) over shorter intervals regardless of when they occur. = Behavioral game theory = Behavioral game theory, invented by Colin Camerer, analyzes interactive strategic decisions and behavior using the methods of game theory, in experimental economics, and experimental psychology. Experiments include testing deviations from typical simplifications of economic theory such as the independence axiom and neglect of altruism, in fairness, in and framing effects. Pdf version. On the positive side, the method has been applied to interactive learning in and social preferences. in in As a research program, the subject is a development of the last three decades.Games and Economic Behavior (journal), Elsevier. Online = Artificial intelligence = Much of the decisions are more and more made either by human beings with the assistance of artificial intelligent machines or wholly made by these machines. Tshilidzi Marwala and Evan Hurwitz in their book, studied the utility of behavioral economics in such situations and concluded that these intelligent machines reduce the impact of bounded rational decision making. In particular, they observed that these intelligent machines reduce the degree of information asymmetry in the market, improve decision making and thus making markets more rational. The use of AI machines in the market in applications such as online trading and decision making has changed major economic theories. Other theories where AI has had impact include in rational choice, rational expectations, game theory, Lewis turning point, portfolio optimization and counterfactual thinking. = Other areas of research = Other branches of behavioral economics enrich the model of the utility function without implying inconsistency in preferences. Ernst Fehr, Armin Falk, and Rabin studied fairness, inequity aversion and reciprocal altruism, weakening the neoclassical assumption of perfect selfishness. This work is particularly applicable to wage setting. The work on \\"intrinsic motivation by Gneezy and Rustichini and \\"identity\\" by Akerlof and Kranton assumes that agents derive utility from adopting personal and social norms in addition to conditional expected utility. According to Aggarwal, in addition to behavioral deviations from rational equilibrium, markets are also likely to suffer from lagged responses, search costs, externalities of the commons, and other frictions making it difficult to disentangle behavioral effects in market behavior. \\"Conditional expected utility\\" is a form of reasoning where the individual has an illusion of control, and calculates the probabilities of external events and hence their utility as a function of their own action, even when they have no causal ability to affect those external events. Behavioral economics caught on among the general public with the success of books such as Dan Ariely's Predictably Irrational. Practitioners of the discipline have studied quasi-public policy topics such as broadband mapping. Applications for behavioral economics include the modeling of the consumer decision-making process for applications in artificial intelligence and machine learning. The Silicon Valley-based start- up Singularities is using the AGM postulates proposed by Alchourr√≥n, G√§rdenfors, and Makinson‚Äîthe formalization of the concepts of beliefs and change for rational entities‚Äîin a symbolic logic to create a \\"machine learning and deduction engine that uses the latest data science and big data algorithms in order to generate the content and conditional rules (counterfactuals) that capture customer's behaviors and beliefs.\\" Applications of behavioral economics also exist in other disciplines, for example in the area of supply chain management. = Natural experiments = From a biological point of view, human behaviors are essentially the same during crises accompanied by stock market crashes and during bubble growth when share prices exceed historic highs. During those periods, most market participants see something new for themselves, and this inevitably induces a stress response in them with accompanying changes in their endocrine profiles and motivations. The result is quantitative and qualitative changes in behavior. This is one example where behavior affecting economics and finance can be observed and variably- contrasted using behavioral economics. Behavioral economics' usefulness applies beyond environments similar to stock exchanges. Selfish-reasoning, 'adult behaviors', and similar, can be identified within criminal- concealment(s), and legal-deficiencies and neglect of different types can be observed and discovered. Awareness of indirect consequence (or lack of), at least in potential with different experimental models and methods, can be used as well‚Äîbehavioral economics' potential uses are broad, but its reliability needs scrutiny. Underestimation of the role of novelty as a stressor is the primary shortcoming of current approaches for market research. It is necessary to account for the biologically determined diphasisms of human behavior in everyday low-stress conditions and in response to stressors. Limitations of experimental methods (e.g. randomized control trials) and their use in economics were famously analyzed by Angus Deaton.  Criticism  Critics of behavioral economics typically stress the rationality of economic agents. A fundamental critique is provided by Maialeh (2019) who argues that no behavioral research can establish an economic theory. Examples provided on this account include pillars of behavioral economics such as satisficing behavior or prospect theory, which are confronted from the neoclassical perspective of utility maximization and expected utility theory respectively. The author shows that behavioral findings are hardly generalizable and that they do not disprove typical mainstream axioms related to rational behavior. Others note that cognitive theories, such as prospect theory, are models of decision-making, not generalized economic behavior, and are only applicable to the sort of once-off decision problems presented to experiment participants or survey respondents. Others argue that decision-making models, such as the endowment effect theory, that have been widely accepted by behavioral economists may be erroneously established as a consequence of poor experimental design practices that do not adequately control subject misconceptions. A notable concern is that despite a great deal of rhetoric, no unified behavioral theory has yet been espoused: behavioral economists have proposed no unified theory. David Gal has argued that many of these issues stem from behavioral economics being too concerned with understanding how behavior deviates from standard economic models rather than with understanding why people behave the way they do. Understanding why behavior occurs is necessary for the creation of generalizable knowledge, the goal of science. He has referred to behavioral economics as a \\"triumph of marketing\\" and particularly cited the example of loss aversion. Traditional economists are skeptical of the experimental and survey-based techniques that behavioral economics uses extensively. Economists typically stress revealed preferences over stated preferences (from surveys) in the determination of economic value. Experiments and surveys are at risk of systemic biases, strategic behavior and lack of incentive compatibility. Some researchers point out that participants of experiments conducted by behavioral economists are not representative enough and drawing broad conclusions on the basis of such experiments is not possible. An acronym WEIRD has been coined in order to describe the studies participants - as those, who come from Western, Educated, Industrialized, Rich, and Democratic societies.Joseph Henrich, Steven J. Heine, Ara Norenzayan, The weirdest people in the world?, ‚ÄûBehavioral and brain sciences\\", 2010. = Responses = Matthew Rabin dismisses these criticisms, countering that consistent results typically are obtained in multiple situations and geographies and can produce good theoretical insight. Behavioral economists, however, responded to these criticisms by focusing on field studies rather than lab experiments. Some economists see a fundamental schism between experimental economics and behavioral economics, but prominent behavioral and experimental economists tend to share techniques and approaches in answering common questions. For example, behavioral economists are investigating neuroeconomics, which is entirely experimental and has not been verified in the field. The epistemological, ontological, and methodological components of behavioral economics are increasingly debated, in particular by historians of economics and economic methodologists. According to some researchers, when studying the mechanisms that form the basis of decision- making, especially financial decision-making, it is necessary to recognize that most decisions are made under stress because, \\"Stress is the nonspecific body response to any demands presented to it.\\"  Related fields  = Experimental economics = Experimental economics is the application of experimental methods, including statistical, econometric, and computational, to study economic questions. Data collected in experiments are used to estimate effect size, test the validity of economic theories, and illuminate market mechanisms. Economic experiments usually use cash to motivate subjects, in order to mimic real-world incentives. Experiments are used to help understand how and why markets and other exchange systems function as they do. Experimental economics have also expanded to understand institutions and the law (experimental law and economics). A fundamental aspect of the subject is design of experiments. Experiments may be conducted in the field or in laboratory settings, whether of individual or group behavior.‚Ä¢ Vernon L.

Abstract. = Neuroeconomics = Neuroeconomics is an interdisciplinary field that seeks to explain human decision making, the ability to process multiple alternatives and to follow a course of action. It studies how economic behavior can shape our understanding of the brain, and how neuroscientific discoveries can constrain and guide models of economics. It combines research methods from neuroscience, experimental and behavioral economics, and cognitive and social psychology. As research into decision-making behavior becomes increasingly computational, it has also incorporated new approaches from theoretical biology, computer science, and mathematics. Neuroeconomics studies decision making by using a combination of tools from these fields so as to avoid the shortcomings that arise from a single-perspective approach. In mainstream economics, expected utility (EU) and the concept of rational agents are still being used. Many economic behaviors are not fully explained by these models, such as heuristics and framing. Behavioral economics emerged to account for these anomalies by integrating social, cognitive, and emotional factors in understanding economic decisions. Neuroeconomics adds another layer by using neuroscientific methods in understanding the interplay between economic behavior and neural mechanisms. By using tools from various fields, some scholars claim that neuroeconomics offers a more integrative way of understanding decision making. = Evolutionary psychology = An evolutionary psychology perspective states that many of the perceived limitations in rational choice can be explained as being rational in the context of maximizing biological fitness in the ancestral environment, but not necessarily in the current one. Thus, when living at subsistence level where a reduction of resources may result in death, it may have been rational to place a greater value on preventing losses than on obtaining gains. It may also explain behavioral differences between groups, such as males being less risk-averse than females since males have more variable reproductive success than females. While unsuccessful risk- seeking may limit reproductive success for both sexes, males may potentially increase their reproductive success from successful risk-seeking much more than females can.Paul H.

Left graph: A risk averse utility function is concave (from below), while a risk loving utility function is convex. Middle graph: In standard deviation-expected value space, risk averse indifference curves are upward sloped. Right graph: With fixed probabilities of two alternative states 1 and 2, risk averse indifference curves over pairs of state-contingent outcomes are convex. In economics and finance, risk aversion is the behavior of humans (especially consumers and investors), who, when exposed to uncertainty, attempt to lower that uncertainty. It is the hesitation of a person to agree to a situation with an unknown payoff rather than another situation with a more predictable payoff but possibly lower expected payoff. For example, a risk-averse investor might choose to put their money into a bank account with a low but guaranteed interest rate, rather than into a stock that may have high expected returns, but also involves a chance of losing value. Example A person is given the choice between two scenarios, one with a guaranteed payoff and one without. In the guaranteed scenario, the person receives $50. In the uncertain scenario, a coin is flipped to decide whether the person receives $100 or nothing. The expected payoff for both scenarios is $50, meaning that an individual who was insensitive to risk would not care whether they took the guaranteed payment or the gamble. However, individuals may have different risk attitudes. A person is said to be: * risk averse (or risk avoiding) - if they would accept a certain payment (certainty equivalent) of less than $50 (for example, $40), rather than taking the gamble and possibly receiving nothing. * risk neutral ‚Äì if they are indifferent between the bet and a certain $50 payment. * risk loving (or risk seeking) ‚Äì if they would accept the bet even when the guaranteed payment is more than $50 (for example, $60). The average payoff of the gamble, known as its expected value, is $50. The smallest dollar amount that the individual would accept instead of the bet is called the certainty equivalent, and the difference between the expected value and the certainty equivalent is called the risk premium. For risk-averse individuals, it is positive, for risk-neutral persons it is zero, and for risk-loving individuals their risk premium is negative. Utility of money In expected utility theory, an agent has a utility function u(c) where c represents the value that he might receive in money or goods (in the above example c could be $0 or $40 or $100). The utility function u(c) is defined only up to positive affine transformation ‚Äì in other words, a constant could be added to the value of u(c) for all c, and/or u(c) could be multiplied by a positive constant factor, without affecting the conclusions. An agent possesses risk aversion if and only if the utility function is concave. For instance u(0) could be 0, u(100) might be 10, u(40) might be 5, and for comparison u(50) might be 6. The expected utility of the above bet (with a 50% chance of receiving 100 and a 50% chance of receiving 0) is :E(u)=(u(0)+u(100))/2, and if the person has the utility function with u(0)=0, u(40)=5, and u(100)=10 then the expected utility of the bet equals 5, which is the same as the known utility of the amount 40. Hence the certainty equivalent is 40. The risk premium is ($50 minus $40)=$10, or in proportional terms :(\\\\$50-\\\\$40)/\\\\$40 or 25% (where $50 is the expected value of the risky bet: (\\\\tfrac {1}{2} 0 + \\\\tfrac{1}{2} 100). This risk premium means that the person would be willing to sacrifice as much as $10 in expected value in order to achieve perfect certainty about how much money will be received. In other words, the person would be indifferent between the bet and a guarantee of $40, and would prefer anything over $40 to the bet. In the case of a wealthier individual, the risk of losing $100 would be less significant, and for such small amounts his utility function would be likely to be almost linear, for instance if u(0) = 0 and u(100) = 10, then u(40) might be 4.0001 and u(50) might be 5.0001. The utility function for perceived gains has two key properties: an upward slope, and concavity. (i) The upward slope implies that the person feels that more is better: a larger amount received yields greater utility, and for risky bets the person would prefer a bet which is first-order stochastically dominant over an alternative bet (that is, if the probability mass of the second bet is pushed to the right to form the first bet, then the first bet is preferred). (ii) The concavity of the utility function implies that the person is risk averse: a sure amount would always be preferred over a risky bet having the same expected value; moreover, for risky bets the person would prefer a bet which is a mean-preserving contraction of an alternative bet (that is, if some of the probability mass of the first bet is spread out without altering the mean to form the second bet, then the first bet is preferred).  Measures of risk aversion under expected utility theory There are multiple measures of the risk aversion expressed by a given utility function. Several functional forms often used for utility functions are expressed in terms of these measures. =Absolute risk aversion= The higher the curvature of u(c), the higher the risk aversion. However, since expected utility functions are not uniquely defined (are defined only up to affine transformations), a measure that stays constant with respect to these transformations is needed. One such measure is the Arrow‚ÄìPratt measure of absolute risk aversion (ARA), after the economists Kenneth Arrow and John W. Pratt, Reprinted in: Essays in the Theory of Risk Bearing, Markham Publ. Co., Chicago, 1971, 90‚Äì109. also known as the coefficient of absolute risk aversion, defined as :A(c)=-\\\\frac{u(c)}{u'(c)} where u'(c) and u(c) denote the first and second derivatives with respect to c of u(c). The following expressions relate to this term: * Exponential utility of the form u(c)=1-e^{-\\\\alpha c} is unique in exhibiting constant absolute risk aversion (CARA): A(c)=\\\\alpha is constant with respect to c. * Hyperbolic absolute risk aversion (HARA) is the most general class of utility functions that are usually used in practice (specifically, CRRA (constant relative risk aversion, see below), CARA (constant absolute risk aversion), and quadratic utility all exhibit HARA and are often used because of their mathematical tractability). A utility function exhibits HARA if its absolute risk aversion is a hyperbolic function, namely : A(c) = -\\\\frac{u(c)}{u'(c)}=\\\\frac{1}{ac+b} The solution to this differential equation (omitting additive and multiplicative constant terms, which do not affect the behavior implied by the utility function) is: : u(c) = \\\\frac{(c-c_s)^{1-R}}{1-R} where R=1/a and c_s = -b/a . Note that when a = 0 , this is CARA, as A(c) = 1/b = const , and when b=0 , this is CRRA (see below), as c A(c) = 1/a = const . See * Decreasing/increasing absolute risk aversion (DARA/IARA) is present if A(c) is decreasing/increasing. Using the above definition of ARA, the following inequality holds for DARA: :\\\\frac{\\\\partial A(c)}{\\\\partial c} = -\\\\frac{u'(c)u'(c) - [u(c)]^2}{[u'(c)]^2} < 0 and this can hold only if u(c)>0. Therefore, DARA implies that the utility function is positively skewed; that is, u(c)>0. Analogously, IARA can be derived with the opposite directions of inequalities, which permits but does not require a negatively skewed utility function (u(c)<0). An example of a DARA utility function is u(c)=\\\\log(c), with A(c)=1/c, while u(c)=c-\\\\alpha c^2, \\\\alpha >0, with A(c)=2 \\\\alpha/(1-2 \\\\alpha c) would represent a quadratic utility function exhibiting IARA. *Experimental and empirical evidence is mostly consistent with decreasing absolute risk aversion. * Contrary to what several empirical studies have assumed, wealth is not a good proxy for risk aversion when studying risk sharing in a principal- agent setting. Although A(c)=-\\\\frac{u(c)}{u'(c)} is monotonic in wealth under either DARA or IARA and constant in wealth under CARA, tests of contractual risk sharing relying on wealth as a proxy for absolute risk aversion are usually not identified. =Relative risk aversion= The Arrow‚ÄìPratt measure of relative risk aversion (RRA) or coefficient of relative risk aversion is defined as :R(c) = cA(c)=\\\\frac{-cu(c)}{u'(c)}. Unlike ARA whose units are in $‚àí1, RRA is a dimension-less quantity, which allows it to be applied universally. Like for absolute risk aversion, the corresponding terms constant relative risk aversion (CRRA) and decreasing/increasing relative risk aversion (DRRA/IRRA) are used. This measure has the advantage that it is still a valid measure of risk aversion, even if the utility function changes from risk averse to risk loving as c varies, i.e. utility is not strictly convex/concave over all c. A constant RRA implies a decreasing ARA, but the reverse is not always true. As a specific example of constant relative risk aversion, the utility function u(c) = \\\\log(c) implies RRA = 1. In intertemporal choice problems, the elasticity of intertemporal substitution often cannot be disentangled from the coefficient of relative risk aversion. The isoelastic utility function :u(c) = \\\\frac{c^{1-\\\\rho}-1}{1-\\\\rho} exhibits constant relative risk aversion with R(c) = \\\\rho and the elasticity of intertemporal substitution \\\\varepsilon_{u(c)} = 1/\\\\rho. When \\\\rho = 1, using l'H√¥pital's rule shows that this simplifies to the case of log utility, u(c) = log c, and the income effect and substitution effect on saving exactly offset. A time- varying relative risk aversion can be considered. =Implications of increasing/decreasing absolute and relative risk aversion= The most straightforward implications of increasing or decreasing absolute or relative risk aversion, and the ones that motivate a focus on these concepts, occur in the context of forming a portfolio with one risky asset and one risk-free asset. If the person experiences an increase in wealth, he/she will choose to increase (or keep unchanged, or decrease) the number of dollars of the risky asset held in the portfolio if absolute risk aversion is decreasing (or constant, or increasing). Thus economists avoid using utility functions such as the quadratic, which exhibit increasing absolute risk aversion, because they have an unrealistic behavioral implication. Similarly, if the person experiences an increase in wealth, he/she will choose to increase (or keep unchanged, or decrease) the fraction of the portfolio held in the risky asset if relative risk aversion is decreasing (or constant, or increasing). In one model in monetary economics, an increase in relative risk aversion increases the impact of households' money holdings on the overall economy. In other words, the more the relative risk aversion increases, the more money demand shocks will impact the economy.Benchimol, J., Four√ßans, A. (2012), Money and risk in a DSGE framework : A Bayesian application to the Eurozone, Journal of Macroeconomics, vol. 34, pp. 95‚Äì111. =Portfolio theory= In modern portfolio theory, risk aversion is measured as the additional expected reward an investor requires to accept additional risk. Here risk is measured as the standard deviation of the return on investment, i.e. the square root of its variance. In advanced portfolio theory, different kinds of risk are taken into consideration. They are measured as the n-th root of the n-th central moment. The symbol used for risk aversion is A or An. :A = \\\\frac{dE(c)}{d\\\\sigma} :A_n = \\\\frac{dE(c)}{d\\\\sqrt[n]{\\\\mu_n}} Limitations of expected utility treatment of risk aversion The notion of using expected utility theory's approach to risk aversion to analyze small stakes decisions has come under criticism from behavioral economics. Matthew Rabin has showed that a risk-averse, expected- utility-maximizing individual who, from any initial wealth level [...] turns down gambles where she loses $100 or gains $110, each with 50% probability [...] will turn down 50‚Äì50 bets of losing $1,000 or gaining any sum of money. Rabin criticizes this implication of expected utility theory on grounds of implausibility‚Äîindividuals who are risk averse for small gambles due to diminishing marginal utility would exhibit extreme forms of risk aversion in risky decisions under larger stakes. One solution to the problem observed by Rabin is that proposed by prospect theory and cumulative prospect theory, where outcomes are considered relative to a reference point (usually the status quo), rather than to consider only the final wealth. Another limitation is the reflection effect which demonstrates the reversing of risk aversion. This effect was first presented by Kahneman and Tversky as a part of the prospect theory, in the behavioral economics domain. The reflection effect is an identified pattern of opposite preferences between negative prospects as opposed to positive prospects. According to this effect, people tend to avoid risks under the gain domain, and to seek risks under the loss domain. Meaning, no risk aversion is expected under the loss domain. For example, in the gain domain, most people prefer a certain gain of 3000, than a gain of 4000 with a risk of 80 percent. When posing the same problem under the loss domain - with negative values, most people prefer a loss of 4000 with 80 percent chance, over a certain loss of 3000. The reflection effect (as well as the certainty effect) is inconsistent with the expected utility hypothesis. It is assumed that the psychological principle which stands behind this kind of behavior is the overweighting of certainty. Meaning, options which are perceived as certain, are over-weighted relative to uncertain options. This pattern is an indication of a risk seeking behavior in negative prospects and eliminates other explanations for the certainty effect such as aversion for uncertainty or variability. The initial findings regarding the reflection effect faced criticism regarding its validity, as it was claimed that there are insufficient evidence to support the effect on the individual level. Subsequently, an extensive investigation revealed its possible limitations, suggesting that the effect is most prevalent when either small or large amounts and extreme probabilities are involved. In the brain Attitudes towards risk have attracted the interest of the field of neuroeconomics and behavioral economics. A 2009 study by Christopoulos et al. suggested that the activity of a specific brain area (right inferior frontal gyrus) correlates with risk aversion, with more risk averse participants (i.e. those having higher risk premia) also having higher responses to safer options. This result coincides with other studies, that show that neuromodulation of the same area results in participants making more or less risk averse choices, depending on whether the modulation increases or decreases the activity of the target area. Public understanding and risk in social activities In the real world, many government agencies, e.g. Health and Safety Executive, are fundamentally risk- averse in their mandate. This often means that they demand (with the power of legal enforcement) that risks be minimized, even at the cost of losing the utility of the risky activity. It is important to consider the opportunity cost when mitigating a risk; the cost of not taking the risky action. Writing laws focused on the risk without the balance of the utility may misrepresent society's goals. The public understanding of risk, which influences political decisions, is an area which has recently been recognised as deserving focus. In 2007 Cambridge University initiated the Winton Professorship of the Public Understanding of Risk, a role described as outreach rather than traditional academic research by the holder, David Spiegelhalter. =Children= Children's services such as schools and playgrounds have become the focus of much risk-averse planning, meaning that children are often prevented from benefiting from activities that they would otherwise have had. Many playgrounds have been fitted with impact-absorbing matting surfaces. However, these are only designed to save children from death in the case of direct falls on their heads and do not achieve their main goals. They are expensive, meaning that less resources are available to benefit users in other ways (such as building a playground closer to the child's home, reducing the risk of a road traffic accident on the way to it), and‚Äîsome argue‚Äîchildren may attempt more dangerous acts, with confidence in the artificial surface. Shiela Sage, an early years school advisor, observes \\"Children who are only ever kept in very safe places, are not the ones who are able to solve problems for themselves. Children need to have a certain amount of risk taking ... so they'll know how to get out of situations.\\" =Mobile phones= Mobile phones may carry some small health risk. While most people would accept that unproven risk to gain the benefit of improved communication, others remain so risk averse that they do not. (The COSMOS cohort study continues to study the actual risks of mobile phones.) =Game shows and investments= One experimental study with student-subject playing the game of the TV show Deal or No Deal finds that people are more risk averse in the limelight than in the anonymity of a typical behavioral laboratory. In the laboratory treatments, subjects made decisions in a standard, computerized laboratory setting as typically employed in behavioral experiments. In the limelight treatments, subjects made their choices in a simulated game show environment, which included a live audience, a game show host, and video cameras. In line with this, studies on investor behavior find that investors trade more and more speculatively after switching from phone-based to online trading and that investors tend to keep their core investments with traditional brokers and use a small fraction of their wealth to speculate online.

In 1971, Jonico Music filed for copyright on the song, crediting it to Joe Raposo. During the early part of the 2000s, the music Recording Industry Association of America actively prosecuted individuals for downloading music using file-sharing services. Widespread media attention was paid to one 12-year-old, whose downloads included \\"If You're Happy and You Know It\\" from Kazaa. Lyric variations Like many children's songs, there are many versions of the lyrics. A popular version goes like this: If you're happy and you know it, clap your hands! If you're happy and you know it, clap your hands! If you're happy and you know it, and you really want to show it; If you're happy and you know it, clap your hands!

Her poetry is noted for formal innovation, precise diction, irony, and wit.  Early life  Moore was born in Kirkwood, Missouri, in the manse of the Presbyterian church where her maternal grandfather, John Riddle Warner, served as pastor. Her father, John Milton Moore, a mechanical engineer and inventor, suffered a psychotic episode, as a consequence of which her parents separated before she was born; Moore never met him. She and her elder brother, John Warner Moore, were reared by their mother, Mary Warner Moore. The family wrote voluminous letters to one another throughout their lives, often addressing each other by playful nicknames and using a private language. Like her mother and her elder brother, Moore remained a devoted Presbyterian, strongly influenced by her grandfather, approaching her Christian faith as a lesson in strength vindicated through trials and temptations; her poems often deal with the themes of strength and adversity.Molesworth, Charles. Introduction. Marianne Moore: A Literary Life. New York: Macmillan, 1990. She thought \\"it was not possible to live without religious faith\\".Letter to Miss Gray (November 5, 1935), reproduced in Molesworth, Charles, Marianne Moore: A Literary Life. New York: Macmillan, 1990. Moore lived in the St. Louis area until she was 16. After her grandfather died in 1894, the three stayed with relatives near Pittsburgh for two years, then moved to Carlisle, Pennsylvania, where her mother found employment teaching English in a private girls school. Moore entered Bryn Mawr College in 1905. She was graduated four years later with an A.B., having majored in history, economics, and political science.Leavell, Linda. Holding On Upside Down: The Life and Work of Marianne Moore. New York: Farrar Straus and Giroux, 2014. The poet H.D. was among her classmates during their freshman year. At Bryn Mawr, Moore started writing short stories and poems for Tipyn O'Bob,https://archive.org/stream/lantern1619stud#page/n251/mode/2up/search/marianne+moore Tipyn O'Bob at Internet Archive the campus literary magazine, and decided to become a writer. After graduation, she worked briefly at Melvil Dewey's Lake Placid Club, then taught business subjects at the Carlisle Indian Industrial School from 1911 to 1914.  Poetic career  Moore's first professionally published poems appeared in The Egoist and Poetry in the spring of 1915. Harriet Monroe, the editor of the latter, would describe them in her biography as possessing \\"an elliptically musical profundity\\".Monroe, Harriet. A Poets's Life. New York: Macmillan, 1938. In 1916, Moore moved with her mother to Chatham, New Jersey, a community with commuting transportation to Manhattan. Two years later, the two moved to New York City's Greenwich Village, where Moore socialized with many avant-garde artists, especially those associated with Others magazine. The innovative poems she was writing at that time received high praise from Ezra Pound, William Carlos Williams, H.D., T. S. Eliot, and later, Wallace Stevens. Moore's first book, Poems, was published without her permission in 1921 by the Imagist poet H.D. and H.D.'s partner, the British novelist Bryher.Pinsky, Robert. Singing School: Learning to Write (and Read) Poetry by Studying with the Masters. New York: W. W. Norton, 2014. Moore's later poetry shows some influence from the Imagists' principles.Pratt, William. Introduction. The Imagist Poem: Modern Poetry in Miniature. New York: Dutton, 1963. Her second book, Observations, won the Dial Award in 1924. She worked part-time as a librarian during these years; then from 1925 to 1929, she edited The Dial magazine, a literary and cultural journal. This position in the literary and arts community extended her influence as an arbiter of modernist taste; much later, she encouraged promising young poets, including Elizabeth Bishop, Allen Ginsberg, John Ashbery, and James Merrill. When The Dial ceased publication in 1929, she moved to 260 Cumberland StreetPage, Chester. Memoirs of a Charmed Life in New York. Bloomington, IN: iUniverse, 2007. in the Fort Greene neighborhood of Brooklyn, where she remained for thirty-six years. She continued to write while caring for her ailing mother, who died in 1947. For nine years before and after her mother's death, Moore translated the Fables of LaFontaine. Photograph by Carl Van Vechten (1948) In 1933, Moore was awarded the Helen Haire Levinson Prize by Poetry magazine. In 1951, her Collected Poems won the National Book Award, \\"National Book Awards ‚Äì 1952\\". National Book Foundation. Retrieved 2012-03-02. (With acceptance speech by Moore and essay by Lee Felice Pinkas from the Awards' 60-year anniversary blog.) the Pulitzer Prize, and the Bollingen Prize. In the book's introduction, T. S. Eliot wrote, \\"My conviction has remained unchanged for the last 14 years that Miss Moore's poems form part of the small body of durable poetry written in our time.\\" After years of seclusion, she emerged as a celebrity, speaking at college campuses across the country and appearing in photographic essays in Life and Look magazines. Moore became a member of the American Academy of Arts and Letters in 1955. She was elected a Fellow of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences in 1962. Moore continued to publish poems in various magazines, including, The Nation, The New Republic, Partisan Review, and The New Yorker, as well as publishing various books and collections of her poetry and criticism. She moved to 35 West Ninth Street in Manhattan in 1965. After she moved back to Greenwich Village, she was widely recognized around town for her tricorn hat and black cape. She liked athletics and was a great admirer of Muhammad Ali, for whose spoken-word album I Am the Greatest! she wrote the liner notes. She became known as a baseball fan, first of the Brooklyn Dodgers and then of the New York Yankees. She threw out the ball to open the season at Yankee Stadium in 1968. Moore suffered a series of strokes in her last years. She died in 1972, and her ashes were interred with those of her mother at the family's burial plot at the Evergreen Cemetery in Gettysburg, Pennsylvania. By the time of her death, she had received many honorary degrees and virtually every honor available to an American poet. The New York Times printed a full-page obituary. In 1996, she was inducted into the St. Louis Walk of Fame. Moore corresponded with Ezra Pound from 1918, and visited him regularly during his incarceration at St. Elizabeth's. She opposed Benito Mussolini and Fascism from the start, and objected to Pound's antisemitism. Moore was a Republican and supported Herbert Hoover in 1928 and 1932. She was a lifelong ally and friend of the American poet Wallace Stevens, as demonstrated in her review of Stevens's first collection, Harmonium, and, in particular, by her comment about the influence of Henri Rousseau on the poem \\"Floral Decorations for Bananas\\". She also corresponded, from 1943 to 1961, with the reclusive collage artist Joseph Cornell, whose methods of collecting and appropriation were much like her own. In 1955, Moore was invited informally by David Wallace, manager of marketing research for Ford's \\"E-car\\" project, and his co-worker Bob Young, to suggest a name for the car. Wallace's rationale was \\"Who better to understand the nature of words than a poet?\\" In October 1955, Moore was approached to submit \\"inspirational names\\" for the E-car, and on November 7, she offered her list of names, which included such notables as \\"Resilient Bullet\\", \\"Ford Silver Sword\\", \\"Mongoose Civique\\", \\"Varsity Stroke\\", \\"Pastelogram\\", and \\"Andante con Moto\\". On December 8, she submitted her last and most famous name, \\"Utopian Turtletop\\". The E-car was christened by Ford as the Edsel.Her experience was memorably recounted in her epistolic article for The New Yorker of April 13, 1957, titled \\"Correspondence with David Wallace\\". It is anthologized in Mordechai Richler's The Best of Modern Humour, Knopf, 1983, pp 66-73. She notes in her preface, \\"[These letters] should correct the impression persistent among inquirers, that I succeeded in finding for the new products division ... a name for the new car I had been recruited to name; whereas I did not give the car the name it now has.\\" See also: Edsel.com Moore never married. Her living room has been preserved in its original layout in the collections of the Rosenbach Museum and Library in Philadelphia. Her entire library, knick-knacks (including a baseball signed by Mickey Mantle), all of her correspondence, photographs, and poetry drafts are available for public viewing. Like Robert Lowell, Moore revised many of her early poems in later life. Most of these revised works appeared in the Complete Poems of 1967. Facsimile editions of the theretofore out-of-print 1924 Observations became available in 2002. Since that time, there has been no critical consensus about which versions are authoritative.

In her will, she established a fund for the support of the Camperdown Elm in Brooklyn's Prospect Park, a rare and ancient tree that she had celebrated in a poem.http://brooklynbased.com/blog/2012/10/16/brooklyn- history-the-singularly-curious-weeping-elm/ Moore and the Camperdown Elm In 2012, she was inducted into the New York State Writers Hall of Fame.  Poetic style  Moore's most famous poem is perhaps the one entitled, appropriately, \\"Poetry\\", in which she hopes for poets who can produce \\"imaginary gardens with real toads in them\\". It also expressed her idea that meter, or anything else that claims the exclusive title \\"poetry\\", is not so important as delight in language and precise, heartfelt expression in any form. Moore's meter was radically separate from the English tradition; writing her syllabic poems after the advent of free verse, she was encouraged thereby to try previously unusual meters.Hartman, Charles. Free Verse: An Essay on Prosody. Princeton: Princeton University Press, 1980. She credited the poetry of Edith Sitwell as \\"intensifying her interest in rhythm and encouraging her rhythmic eccentricities\\". In response to a biographical sketch in 1935, Moore indicated \\"a liking for unaccented rhyme, the movement of the poem musically is more important than the conventional look of lines upon the page, and the stanza as the unit of composition rather than the line\\". Later in her Selected Poems of 1969, she also commented in regard to her poetic form, that \\"in anything I have written, there have been lines in which the chief interest is borrowed, and I have not yet been able to outgrow this hybrid method of composition\\".Moore, Marianne. Note to Selected Poems. London: Faber & Faber, 1969. Moore often composed her poetry in syllabics, she used stanzas with a predetermined number of syllables as her \\"unit of sense\\", with indentation underlining the parallels, the shape of the stanza indicating the syllabic disposition, and her reading voice conveying the syntactical line.Schmidt, Michael. Lives of the Poets. London: Orion Press, 1998. These syllabic lines from \\"Poetry\\" illustrate her position: poetry is a matter of skill and honesty in any form whatsoever, while anything written poorly, although in perfect form, cannot be poetry:  Involvement in the American suffrage movement  Moore was involved in the American suffrage movement starting in her university years at Bryn Mawr, from 1905 to 1909. During this time in the American suffrage movement, Anna Howard Shaw had just taken over as president of the National American Woman Suffrage Association; Harriot Stanton Blatch formed the Equality League of Self Supporting Women, which started the practice of suffrage parades; and soon (in 1910) women in the state of Washington were granted the right to vote. Moore's combined major in history, politics, and economics and the suffrage involvement of professors and other students at Bryn Mawr exposed her to the women's suffrage movement, especially because it was a \\"unique period in the history of women‚Äôs college, as the values of progressivism, women‚Äôs education, and the ideology of separate spheres came together in a kind of perfect storm that created a climate for cultural change\\". Moore was involved in a \\"suffrage society\\", a chapter of the National College Equal Suffrage League, and she was present at most of their events. Notably, Moore wrote in her personal letters to her family that she attended lectures at Bryn Mawr by the well-known feminist Jane Addams and the British suffragette Anne Cobden-Sanderson. Of the American suffragist Anna Howard Shaw, she wrote: \\"Miss Shaw spoke last night on the Modern Democratic ideal. I couldn‚Äôt say how she delighted me. No decent, half-kind, creature could possibly think of fighting suffrage if he or it had heard her arguments.\\" Moore went on a trip to New York City in 1909 with another Bryn Mawr student, where she heard a lecture by the Colorado suffragist Judge Ben Lindsey, went to a suffrage mass meeting, and saw J. M. Barrie‚Äôs classic suffragist-themed play What Every Woman Knows. There is speculation that Moore also participated in the women's suffrage parade of 1913 in Washington, D.C., one day before Woodrow Wilson‚Äôs presidential inauguration. Although in her personal letters she told her brother, Warner, that she did not participate in the parade after he cautioned her about the possible dangers she would face from the opponents of the parade, \\"[h]er scrapbook includes programs and newspaper clippings about the march\\", and she later told the poet Elizabeth Bishop that she \\"paraded with the suffragettes, led by Inez Milholland on her white horse\\". Moore was never as public about her involvement in the suffrage movement after that parade in 1913, because afterward she began participating anonymously, mostly through writing, using a pseudonym. During her stay in Carlisle, Pennsylvania, she admitted years later, she \\"wrote suffrage pieces for the Carlisle newspaper\\", which at the time appeared to be authored anonymously. Dr. Mary Chapman (University of British Columbia) argues that Moore was the writer of suffragist writings of the time in Carlisle news publications and that could be analyzed by examining her specific writing style alongside suffragist prose and poetry that were published in the Carlisle Evening Herald in 1915: \\"Many of the prosuffrage articles that appeared in the Heraldexhibit Moore‚Äôs characteristic reliance on quotation.\\" Additionally, a letter appealing for the women's suffrage movement in the Carlisle Evening Sentinel is signed \\"Miss M.M.\\", which scholars believe could stand for Marianne Moore because \\"the absence of any other documented unmarried female suffragists in the Carlisle area with the initials M.M. make it likely that the Sentinel reader who coyly constructs a letter to the editor almost entirely from quotation is Marianne Moore\\". Moore's poem \\"Silence\\" (1924) also resembles the writing style that was seen in the Sentinel letter. Moore established herself on the surface as a modernist poet, and the common practice within the modernist circle of poets was to not engage with the politics of the time; but her writings displayed a \\"sophisticated political subtext\\".

Linguistically, vicar is cognate with the English prefix \\"vice\\", similarly meaning \\"deputy\\". The title appears in a number of Christian ecclesiastical contexts, but also as an administrative title, or title modifier, in the Roman Empire. In addition, in the Holy Roman Empire a local representative of the emperor, perhaps an archduke, might be styled \\"vicar\\". Roman Catholic Church The Pope uses the title Vicarius Christi, meaning the vicar of Christ. The papacy first used this title in the 6th century; earlier they used the title \\"vicar of Saint Peter\\" or vicarius principis apostolorum, the \\"vicar of the chief of the apostles\\". In Catholic canon law, a vicar is the representative of any ecclesiastic entity. The Romans had used the term to describe officials subordinate to the praetorian prefects. In the early Christian churches, bishops likewise had their vicars, such as the archdeacons and archpriests, and also the rural priest, the curate who had the cure or care of all the souls outside the episcopal cities. The position of the Roman Catholic vicar as it evolved is sketched in the Catholic Encyclopedia, 1908. Vicars have various titles based on what role they are performing. An apostolic vicar is a bishop or priest who heads a missionary particular Church that is not yet ready to be a full diocese ‚Äì he stands as the local representative of the Pope, in the Pope's role as bishop of all unorganized territories. A vicar capitular, who exercises authority in the place of the diocesan chapter, is a temporary ordinary of a diocese during a sede vacante period. Vicars exercise authority as the agents of the bishop of the diocese. Most vicars, however, have ordinary power, which means that their agency is not by virtue of a delegation but is established by law. Vicars general, episcopal vicars, and judicial vicars exercise vicarious ordinary power; they each exercise a portion of the power of the diocesan bishop (judicial for the judicial vicar, executive for the others) by virtue of their office and not by virtue of a mandate. A vicar forane, also known as an archpriest or dean, is a priest entrusted by the bishop with a certain degree of leadership in a territorial division of a diocese or a pastoral region known as a vicarate forane or a deanery. A parochial vicar is a priest assigned to a parish in addition to, and in collaboration with, the parish priest or rector. He exercises his ministry as an agent of the parish's pastor, who is termed parochus in Latin. Some papal legates are given the title Vicar of the Apostolic See. A vicar can be the priest of a \\"chapel of ease\\", a building within the parish which is not the parish church. Non- resident canons led also to the institution of vicars choral, each canon having his own vicar, who sat in his stall in his absence (see Cathedral). In Opus Dei, a regional vicar is a priest designated to fulfil responsibilities for an entire country or region, such as France or the United States. Eastern Orthodox churches In the Russian Orthodox Church and some other non-Hellenic Eastern Orthodox Churches that historically follow Russian tradition, vicar (Russian: vikariy / –≤–∏–∫–∞—Ä–∏–π) is a term for what is known as suffragan bishop in the Anglican Communion or as auxiliary bishop in the Latin Rite of the Roman Catholic Church. A vicar bishop usually bears in his title the names of both his titular see (usually, a smaller town within the diocese he ministers in) and the see he is subordinate to. For example, Ignaty Punin, the vicar bishop under the Diocese of Smolensk, is titled \\"The Rt Revd Ignaty, the bishop of Vyazma, the vicar of the Diocese of Smolensk\\", Vyasma being a smaller town inside the territory of the Diocese of Smolensk. Normally, only large dioceses have vicar bishops, sometimes more than one. Usually, Russian Orthodox vicar bishops have no independent jurisdiction (even in their titular towns) and are subordinate to their diocesan bishops; though some of them de facto may have jurisdiction over some territories, especially when there is a need to avoid an overlapping jurisdiction. In some other Eastern Orthodox Churches the term \\"chorbishop\\" is used instead of \\"vicar bishop\\". Anglicanism In Anglicanism, a vicar is a type of parish priest. Historically, parish priests in the Church of England were divided into vicars, rectors, and perpetual curates. The parish clergy and church were supported by tithes‚Äîlike a local tax (traditionally, as the etymology of tithe suggests, of ten percent) levied on the personal as well as agricultural output of the parish. Roughly speaking, the distinction was that a rector directly received both the greater and lesser tithes of his parish while a vicar received only the lesser tithes (the greater tithes going to the lay holder, or impropriator, of the living); a perpetual curate with a small cure and often aged or infirm received neither greater nor lesser tithes, and received only a small salary (paid sometimes by the diocese). (See also in Church of England.) Today, the roles of a rector and a vicar are essentially the same. Which of the two titles is held by the parish priest is historical. Some parishes have a rector, others a vicar. In the Episcopal Church in the United States of America, the positions of \\"vicar\\" and \\"curate\\" are not recognized in the canons of the entire church. However, some diocesan canons do define \\"vicar\\" as the priest in charge of a mission; and \\"curate\\" is often used for assistants, being entirely analogous to the English situation. =Vicarage= St John's Vicarage, Penzance, Cornwall A vicarage, or vicarage house, is a residence provided by the church for the priest. They were usually located near the church and were sometimes quite elaborate and other times inadequate. Dating from medieval times, they were often rebuilt and modernized. In the second half of the 20th century, most large vicarages were replaced with more modern and simpler houses. Lutheran usage In the Evangelical Lutheran Church in America, the Lutheran Church‚ÄìMissouri Synod, the Lutheran Church‚ÄìCanada, and the Wisconsin Evangelical Lutheran Synod, a vicar is a candidate for ordained pastoral ministry, serving in a vicariate or internship, usually in the third year of seminary training, though it can be delayed to the fourth year (this is often referred to as \\"a vicarage\\", a homonym of the residence of the Vicar). Typically at the end of the year of vicarage, the candidate returns to seminary and completes a final year of studies. After being issued a call or assignment, the candidate is ordained as a pastor in the ministry of Word and Sacrament. The role of a vicar in the Lutheran tradition is most comparable to that of a transitional deacon in the Anglican and Roman churches, except that Lutheran vicars are not ordained. In the Evangelical Lutheran Church in South Africa, a vicar is a person who has completed seminary training and is awaiting ordination while serving at a parish where the Diocesan Council places him or her. The title \\"Vikar\\", used in the Lutheran churches in Germany, is comparable while the Lutheran Church of Sweden calls it \\"kyrkoherde\\" (\\"church shepherd\\"), although that title is more comparable to a rector. Notable vicars Oliver Goldsmith's novel The Vicar of Wakefield (1766) and Honor√© de Balzac's The Curate of Tours (Le Cur√© de Tours; 1832) evoke the impoverished world of the 18th- and 19th-century vicar. Anthony Trollope's Chronicles of Barsetshire are peopled with churchmen of varying situations, from wealthy to impoverished; the income differences prompted a digression in Framley Parsonage (chapter 14) on the incomprehensible logic that made one vicar rich and another poor. The 18th- century satirical ballad \\"The Vicar of Bray\\" reveals the changes of conscience a vicar (whether of the Bray in Berkshire or of that in County Wicklow) might undergo in order to retain his meagre post, between the 1680s and 1720s. \\"The Curate of Ars\\" (usually in French: Le Cur√© d'Ars) is a style often used to refer to Saint Jean Vianney, a French parish priest canonized on account of his piety and simplicity of life.

Ronald Erwin McNair (October 21, 1950 ‚Äì January 28, 1986) was an American NASA astronaut and physicist. He died during the launch of the Space Shuttle Challenger on mission STS-51-L, in which he was serving as one of three mission specialists in a crew of seven. Prior to the Challenger disaster, he flew as a mission specialist on STS-41-B aboard Challenger from February 3 to February 11, 1984, becoming the second African American to fly in space. Challenger crew: (front row) Michael J. Smith, Dick Scobee, Ronald McNair; (back row) Ellison Onizuka, Christa McAuliffe, Gregory Jarvis, Judith Resnik Background McNair was born October 21, 1950, in Lake City, South Carolina, to Pearl M. and Carl C. McNair. He had two brothers, Carl S. and Eric A. McNair. In the summer of 1959, he refused to leave the segregated Lake City Public Library without being allowed to check out his books. After the police and his mother were called, he was allowed to borrow books from the library, which is now named after him. A children's book, Ron's Big Mission, offers a fictionalized account of this event. His brother, Carl S., also wrote the official biography, In the Spirit of Ronald E. McNair‚ÄîAstronaut: An American Hero. McNair graduated as valedictorian of Carver High School in 1967. In 1971, he received a Bachelor of Science degree in engineering physics, magna cum laude, from the North Carolina Agricultural and Technical State University in Greensboro, North Carolina. In 1976, he received a Ph.D. degree in Physics from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology under the guidance of Michael Feld, becoming nationally recognised for his work in the field of laser physics. After graduation from MIT (receiving four honorary doctorates, a score of fellowships and commendations while achieving a 6th-degree black belt in taekwondo), he became a staff physicist at the Hughes Research Lab in Malibu, California. McNair was a member of the Omega Psi Phi Fraternity and a member of the Bah√°'√≠ Faith. Astronaut career In 1978, McNair was selected as one of thirty-five applicants from a pool of ten thousand for the NASA astronaut program. He flew as a mission specialist on STS-41-B aboard Challenger from February 3 to February 11, 1984, becoming the second African American to fly in space. Astronaut candidates Ron McNair, Guy Bluford, and Fred Gregory wearing Apollo spacesuits, May 1978 =Challenger disaster= Following the STS-41-B mission, McNair was selected for STS-51-L as one of three mission specialists in a crew of seven. The mission launched on January 28, 1986. He was killed when Challenger disintegrated nine miles above the Atlantic Ocean 73 seconds after liftoff. He was initially buried at Rest Lawn Memorial Park in Lake City, South Carolina. His remains were disinterred in 2004 and moved to Ronald E. McNair Memorial Park, located elsewhere in Lake City.https://discoversouthcarolina.com/products/26303 Music in space McNair was an accomplished saxophonist. Before his last fateful space mission, he had worked with the composer Jean-Michel Jarre on a piece of music for Jarre's then-upcoming album Rendez-Vous. It was intended that he would record his saxophone solo onboard the Challenger, which would have made McNair's solo the first original piece of music to have been recorded in space (although the song \\"Jingle Bells\\" had been played on a harmonica during an earlier Gemini 6 spaceflight). However, the recording was never made, as the flight ended in the disaster and the deaths of its entire crew. The final track on Rendez- Vous, \\"Last Rendez-Vous,\\" has the subtitle \\"Ron's Piece,\\" and the liner notes include a dedication from Jarre: \\"Ron was so excited about the piece that he rehearsed it continuously until the last moment. May the memory of my friend the astronaut and the artist Ron McNair live on through this piece.\\" Ron McNair was supposed to have taken part in Jarre's Rendez-vous Houston concert through a live feed from the orbiting Shuttlecraft.

Although it is lower than Mount Fairweather and Mount Quincy Adams, which straddle the United States border between Alaska and British Columbia, Mount Waddington is the highest peak that lies entirely within British Columbia. It and the subrange which surround it, known as the Waddington Range, stands at the heart of the Pacific Ranges, a remote and extremely difficult set of mountains and river valleys. It is not so far north as its extreme Arctic-like conditions might indicate and Mount Waddington and its attendant peaks pose some of the most serious expedition mountaineering to be had in North America -- and some of the most extreme relief and spectacular mountain scenery. From Waddington's fang to sea level at the heads of Bute and Knight Inlets is only a few miles; across the gorges of the Homathko and the Klinaklini Rivers stand mountains almost as high, and icefields even vaster and whiter, only a few aerial miles away, with a maw deeper than the Grand Canyon, comparable in relief to the Himalayas (to which the terrain of British Columbia was compared by colonial-era travellers). Mount Waddington is the namesake of the Mount Waddington Regional District, which takes in the seaward slope of the Waddington Range and the adjoining coastline and parts of northern Vancouver Island adjacent to Queen Charlotte Strait. Discovery and exploration by Europeans In 1925, while on a trip to Mount Arrowsmith, Vancouver Island, Don and Phyllis Munday spotted what they believed to be a peak taller than Mount Robson, the then accepted tallest peak entirely within British Columbia. In the words of Don Munday, \\"The compass showed the alluring peak stood along a line passing a little east of Bute Inlet and perhaps 150 miles away, where blank spaces on the map left ample room for many nameless mountains.\\"Munday p. 4 While there is debate as to whether the peak they saw was Mount Waddington (Don Munday observed that the feat is impossible),Fairley p. 59 they almost certainly saw a peak in the Waddington Range, and this led the Mundays to explore that area. Over the next decade, the Mundays mounted several expeditions into the area in an attempt to climb it. Known to them as \\"The Mystery Mountain\\", in 1927 the height was measured at 13,260 feet by triangulation;Munday p. 124 they reached the lower summit in 1928, deeming the main summit too risky. On their recommendation the Geographical Names Board of Canada gave it the name Mount Waddington after Alfred Waddington who was a proponent of a road route, known as Waddington's Road, and again later the same for a railway, via the Homathko River valley and Bute Inlet, which would connect to Vancouver Island via Seymour Narrows. In the summer of 1934, two expeditions attempted to climb the mountain. The first expedition, made up of climbers from Winnipeg, made their attempt on the northwestern flank which had not been explored by the Mundays. After crossing Tatlayoko Lake and making their way down the Homathko River, they then spent two days constructing a bridge over Nude Creek before reaching the Tiedemann Glacier on June 23. It took them three days to reach the shoulder of Mt. Waddington at . They attempted the summit on June 28 but poor weather and route conditions on the final tower forced them to retreat, from the top.Scott, pp. 113-114 The second expedition, consisting of climbers from British Columbia, made their attempt from the southeast. On June 23, they established their base camp on the Franklin Glacier. The ascent abruptly ended three days later when one of the climbers fell to his death from the southeast ridge.Scott, p. 114 In 1935, a group of climbers from the Sierra Club of California made three attempts from their base camp at the Dais Glacier. The group failed in two attempts on the south face due to stormy conditions, poor route conditions and falling ice. Two climbers succeeded in reaching the northwest summit (first climbed by the Mundays) on a third attempt but proceeded no further. First ascent On July 4, 1936, Fritz Wiessner, Bill House, Elizabeth Woolsey and Alan Willcox reached the head of the Knight Inlet. For the next twelve days they ferried loads to their base camp at Icefall Point on the Dais Glacier. While on the glacier, they were joined by another expedition led by members of the British Columbia Mountaineering Club and the Sierra Club. Wiessner and House agreed to allow the others a first chance at the summit but this group failed to find a route up the south face.Scott, pp. 114-116 On July 20, Wiessner and House first attempted the line of a great couloir that comes directly down between the main summit tower and the northwest peak. It was an excellent line for quickly ascending but they were unable to traverse onto the south face proper due to poor rock conditions and were forced to retreat to base camp. By 3 am the next morning they were already climbing up a couloir to the right of the face. Good weather the past few days had cleared most of the snow away from the ledges making for good climbing conditions. Following the left branch of the couloir, they reached a snow patch in the middle of the face. The final of the south face then presented a fierce hurdle of \\"sheer forbidding-looking rocks\\" as noted by Wiessner. While Wiessner initially started in boots, he quickly changed to rope-soled shoes and gave his ice axe and extra rope to House. Wiessner led several pitches up technically difficult rock including several overhangs. After traversing east across the face they rested on a ledge just below the southeastern ridge, a full 9 hours since leaving the snow patch on the south face. After climbing a short chimney they finally reached the small snowy mass at the top, 13 hours after their start in base camp. They aborted their earlier plan of descending the shorter north face and retraced their ascent line, reaching their tent on the Dais Glacier at 2 am. The ascent to the summit and back to base camp had taken over 23 hours.

Waddington to Mt. Asperity, high peaks solo traverse; first solo ascents\\", American Alpine Journal, 2013, Retrieved on 23 June 2018  Climate  The Waddington Range massif is known for fierce as well as unpredictable weather, located as it is at the brunt of the warm, wet winds that soak the British Columbia Coast, of which it is the highest point. Precipitation levels in the area of the peak are among the highest in the Coast Mountains. The peak has an ice cap climate (EF).  Access  To reach Mount Waddington, one could take a long approach originating from Vancouver, with the bulk of the journey consisting of a long boat ride through the Strait of Georgia and the Knight Inlet, taking up to three days. A shorter water approach from Port McNeill, British Columbia, a northern community of Vancouver Island accessible by scheduled daily air connections and/or road from Victoria, reducing the water journey to less than a day may be undertaken. Alternately trails and rough roads do exist from the Chilcotin side of the range, and may be accessed via BC Highway 20, from Williams Lake, departing from the main route to Bella Coola at Tatla Lake to connect to the Homathko River and up a side creek or glacier from there. This inland route is also the access route for the neighbouring Niut and Pantheon Ranges. Mount Waddington is a popular destination among mountain climbers since it is the highest peak in the Coast Mountains and a challenging climb. It has been compared to Mont Blanc's structure.

In pre-monotheistic religious traditions, there is no fundamental distinction between religious practice and magic; tutelary deities concerned with magic are sometimes called hermetic deities or spirit guides.  Magical practices in prehistory  = Anthropological and psychological perspectives = It is a postulate of modern anthropology, at least since early 1930s, that there is complete continuity between magic and religion.Cassirer, Ernst (1944) An Essay On Man, pt.II, ch.7 Myth and Religion, pp.122-3. Quotation: Robert Ranulph Marett (1932) Faith, Hope and Charity in Primitive Religion , in Gifford Lectures. Lecture II Hope. Quotation: Functional differences between religion and magic Early sociological interpretations of magic by Marcel Mauss and Henri Hubert emphasized the social conditions in which the phenomenon of magic develops.Pasi, M. 2006. \\"Magic\\". in von Stuckrad, K. (ed.) The Brill Dictionary of Ancient Religion. Volume III. M-R. Leiden and Boston, Brill. 1134-1140. According to them, religion is the expression of a social structure and serves to maintain the cohesion of a community (religion is therefore public) and magic is an individualistic action (and therefore private). Ralph Merrifield, the British archaeologist credited as producing the first full- length volume dedicated to a material approach to magic,Houlbrook, C. and Armitage, N. 'Introduction: The materiality of the materiality of magic', in Houlbrook, C. and Armitage, N. (eds.) The Materiality of Magic: An artefactual investigation into ritual practices and popular beliefs.Oxford and Philadelphia, Oxbow Books. 1-13. defined the differences between religion and magic: \\"'Religion' is used to indicate the belief in supernatural or spiritual beings; 'magic', the use of practices intended to bring occult forces under control and so to influence events; 'ritual', prescribed or customary behaviour that may be religious, if it is intended to placate or win favour of supernatural beings, magical if it is intended to operate through impersonal forces of sympathy or by controlling supernatural beings, or social if its purpose is to reinforce a social organisation or facilitate social intercourse\\".Merrifield, R. 1987. The Archaeology of Ritual and Magic. London, Guild Publishing. In 1991 Henk Versnel argued that magic and religion function in different ways and that these can be broadly defined in four areas: Intention - magic is employed to achieve clear and immediate goals for an individual, whereas religion is less purpose-motivated and has its sights set on longer-term goals; Attitude ‚Äì magic is manipulative as the process is in the hands of the user, ‚Äúinstrumental coercive manipulation‚Äù, opposed to the religious attitude of ‚Äúpersonal and supplicative negotiation‚Äù; Action ‚Äì magic is a technical exercise that often requires professional skills to fulfil an action, whereas religion is not dependent upon these factors but the will and sentiment of the gods; Social ‚Äì the goals of magic run counter to the interests of a society (in that personal gain for an individual gives them an unfair advantage over peers), whereas religion has more benevolent and positive social functions.Versnel, H. S. 1991. ‚ÄúSome Reflections on the Relationship Magic-Religion.‚Äù Numen 38 (2). 177-195. This separation of the terms 'religion' and 'magic' in a functional sense is disputed. It has been argued that abandoning the term magic in favour of discussing \\"belief in spiritual beings\\" will help to create a more meaningful understanding of all associated ritual practices.Otto, B-C. 2013. \\"Towards Historicizing 'Magic' in Antiquity\\", Numen 60. 308-347. However using the word 'magic' alongside 'religion' is one method of trying to understand the supernatural world, even if some other term can eventually take its place. Religious practices and magic Both magic and religion contain rituals. Most cultures have or have had in their past some form of magical tradition that recognizes a shamanistic interconnectedness of spirit. This may have been long ago, as a folk tradition that died out with the establishment of a major world religion, such as Judaism, Christianity, Islam or Buddhism, or it may still co-exist with that world religion.Magic and Religion Coptic Christians were writing magical spells from the 1st to 12th centuries. = Names of the gods = There is a long-standing belief in the power of true names, this often descends from the magical belief that knowing a being's true name grants power over it. If names have power, then knowing the name of a god regarded as supreme in a religion should grant the greatest power of all. This belief is reflected in traditional Wicca, where the names of the Goddess and the Horned God - the two supreme deities in Wicca - are usually held as a secret to be revealed only to initiates. This belief is also reflected in ancient Judaism, which used the Tetragrammaton (YHWH, usually translated as \\"Lord\\" in small caps) to refer to God in the Tanakh. The same belief is seen in Hinduism, but with different conclusions; rather, attaining transcendence and the power of God is seen as a good thing. Thus, some Hindus chant the name of their favorite deities as often as possible, the most common being Krishna. Magic and Abrahamic religion Magic and Abrahamic religions have had a somewhat checkered past. The King James Version of the Bible included the famous translation \\"Thou shalt not suffer a witch to live\\" (Exodus 22:18), and Saul is rebuked by God for seeking advice from a diviner who could contact spirits. On the other hand, seemingly magical signs are documented in the Bible: For example, both the staff of Pharaoh's sorcerers as well as the staff of Moses and Aaron could be turned into snakes (Exodus 7:8-13). However, as Scott Noegel points out, the critical difference between the magic of Pharaoh's magicians and the non- magic of Moses is in the means by which the staff becomes a snake. For the Pharaoh's magicians, they employed \\"their secret arts\\" whereas Moses merely throws down his staff to turn it into a snake. To an ancient Egyptian, the startling difference would have been that Moses neither employed secret arts nor magical words. In the Torah, Noegel points out that YHWH does not need magical rituals to act.http://faculty.washington.edu/snoegel/PDFs/articles/Noegel%2019%20-%20JANES%201996.pdf The words 'witch' and 'witchcraft' appear in some English versions of the Bible. One verse that is probably responsible for more deaths of suspected witches than any other passage from the Hebrew Scriptures (Old Testament) is Exodus 22:18. In the King James Version, this reads: \\"Thou shalt not suffer a witch to live.\\" The precise meaning of the Hebrew word mechshepha (root kashaph) here translated as 'witch' and in some other modern versions, 'sorceress', is uncertain. In the Septuagint it was translated as pharmakeia, meaning 'pharmacy', and on this basis, Reginald Scot claimed in the 16th century that 'witch' was an incorrect translation and poisoners were intended.Scot, Reginald (c. 1580) The Discoverie of Witchcraft Booke VI Ch. 1.

He was the youngest and last survivor of the five Marx Brothers. He appeared in the first five Marx Brothers feature films, from 1929 to 1933, but then left the act to start his second career as an engineer and theatrical agent. Early life Zeppo was born in Manhattan, New York City, on February 25, 1901. His parents were Sam Marx (called \\"Frenchie\\" throughout his life), and his wife, Minnie Sch√∂nberg Marx. Minnie's brother was Al Shean, who later gained fame as half of the vaudeville team Gallagher and Shean. Marx's family was Jewish. His mother was from East Frisia in Germany; and his father was a native of France, and worked as a tailor. Name As with all of the Marx Brothers, different theories exist as to where Zeppo got his stage name: Groucho said in his Carnegie Hall concert in 1972 that the name was derived from the Zeppelin airship. Zeppo's ex-wife Barbara Sinatra repeated this in her 2011 book, Lady Blue Eyes: My Life with Frank. His brother Harpo offered a different account in his 1961 autobiography, Harpo Speaks!, claiming (p. 130) that there was a popular trained chimpanzee named Mr. Zippo, and that \\"Herbie\\" was tagged with the name \\"Zippo\\" because he liked to do chinups and acrobatics, as the chimp did in its act. The youngest brother objected to his being likened to a chimpanzee, and it was altered to \\"Zeppo\\". In a rare TV interview years later, Zeppo said that Zep is Italian-American slang for baby and as Zeppo was the youngest or baby Marx Brother, he was called Zeppo (BBC Archives). Career Zeppo replaced brother Gummo in the Marx Brothers' stage act when the latter joined the army in 1918. Zeppo was at that time employed as a mechanic for the Ford Motor Company, but he remained with the team and appeared in their successes in vaudeville, on Broadway, and the first five Marx Brothers films, as a straight man and romantic lead, before leaving the team. He also made a solo appearance in the Adolphe Menjou comedy A Kiss in the Dark, as Herbert Marx. It was described in newspaper reviews as a minor role. In Lady Blue Eyes, Barbara Sinatra, Zeppo's second wife, reported that Zeppo was considered too young to perform with his brothers, and when Gummo joined the Army, Zeppo was asked to join the act as a last-minute stand-in at a show in Texas. Zeppo was supposed to go out that night with a Jewish friend of his. They were supposed to take out two Irish girls, but Zeppo had to cancel to board the train to Texas. His friend went ahead and went on the date, and was shot a few hours later when he was attacked by an Irish gang that disapproved of a Jew dating an Irish girl. As the youngest and having grown up watching his brothers, Zeppo could fill in for and imitate any of the others when illness kept them from performing. Groucho suffered from appendicitis during the Broadway run of Animal Crackers and Zeppo filled in for him as Captain Spaulding. TIME in 1932 \\"He was so good as Captain Spaulding in Animal Crackers that I would have let him play the part indefinitely, if they had allowed me to smoke in the audience\\", Groucho recalled.Marx, Arthur. My Life with Groucho: Growing Up with the Marx Brothers. Barricade Books (June 1992) However, a comic persona of his own that could stand up against those of his brothers did not emerge. As critic Percy Hammond wrote, sympathetically, in 1928: > One of the handicaps to the thorough enjoyment of the Marx Brothers in their > merry escapades is the plight of poor Zeppo Marx. While Groucho, Harpo, and > Chico are hogging the show, as the phrase has it, their brother hides in an > insignificant role, peeping out now and then to listen to plaudits in which > he has no share.The Theater : Poor Zeppo Marx !, The Pittsburgh Press, > November 18, 1928. The popular assumption that Zeppo's character was superfluous was fueled in part by Groucho. According to Groucho's own story, when the group became the Three Marx Brothers, the studio wanted to trim their collective salary, and Groucho replied, \\"We're twice as funny without Zeppo!\\"Duck Soup ‚Äì Encyclop√¶dia Britannica. Groucho later said of his brother: \\"Except for the chorus girls, being a straight man in the Marx Brothers wasn't fun for him. He wanted to be a comedian, too, but there just wasn't room for another funny Marx Brother. ... But offstage, he was the funniest one of us\\". Zeppo had great mechanical skills and was largely responsible for keeping the Marx family car running. He later owned a company that machined parts for the war effort during World War II, Marman Products Co. of Inglewood, California, later acquired by the Aeroquip Company.Aeroquip Corporation.\\" International Directory of Company Histories, edited by Tina Grant, vol. 16, St. James Press, 1997, pp. 7-9. This company produced a motorcycle, called the Marman Twin,Marman Twin ‚Äì Herbert Zeppo Marx ‚Äì Marx Brothers and the Marman clamps used to hold the \\"Fat Man\\" atomic bomb inside the B-29 bomber Bockscar.

He also founded a large theatrical agency with his brother Gummo. During their time as theatrical agents, Zeppo and Gummo represented numerous screenwriters and actors, including their brothers.Louvish, Simon. Monkey Business: The Lives and Legends of the Marx Brothers. Thomas Dunne Books; 1st U.S. edition (2000). Also e-text at Google Books Personal life On April 12, 1927, Zeppo married Marion Bimberg Benda.Mallory Curley, Zeppo's Marion Benda and Valentino's Marion Benda: A Legacy of Confusion (Randy Press, 2016), p. 23. The couple adopted two children, Timothy and Thomas, in 1944 and 1945, and later divorced on May 12, 1954. On September 18, 1959, Marx married Barbara Blakeley, whose son, Bobby Oliver, he wanted to adopt and give his surname, but Bobby's father would not allow it. Bobby simply started using the last name \\"Marx\\". Blakeley wrote in her book, Lady Blue Eyes, that Zeppo never made her convert to Judaism. Blakeley was of Methodist faith and said that Zeppo told her she became Jewish by \\"injection\\". Blakeley also wrote in her book that Zeppo wanted to keep her son out of the picture, adding a room for him onto his estate, which was more of a guest house, as it was separated from the main residence. It was also decided that Blakeley's son would go to military school, which according to Blakeley, pleased Zeppo. Zeppo owned a house on Halper Lake Drive in Rancho Mirage, California, which was built off the fairway of the Tamarisk Country Club. The Tamarisk Club had been set up by the Jewish community, which rivaled the gentile club called The Thunderbird. His neighbor happened to be Frank Sinatra. Zeppo later attended the Hillcrest Country Club with friends such as Sinatra, George Burns, Jack Benny, Danny Kaye, Sid Caesar, and Milton Berle. Blakeley became involved with the Cedars- Sinai Medical Center, and had arranged to show Spartacus (featuring Kirk Douglas) for charity, selling tickets, and organizing a postscreening ball. At the last minute, Blakeley was told she could not have the film, so Zeppo went to the country club and spoke to Sinatra, who agreed to let him have an early release of a film he had just finished named Come Blow Your Horn. Sinatra also flew everyone involved to Palm Springs for the event. Zeppo was a very jealous and possessive husband, and hated for Blakeley to talk to other men. Blakeley claimed that Zeppo grabbed Victor Rothschild by the throat at a country club because she was talking to him. Blakeley had caught Zeppo on many occasions with other women; the biggest incident was a party Zeppo had thrown on his yacht. After the incident, Zeppo took Blakeley to Europe, and accepted more invitations to parties when they arrived back in the States. Some of these parties were at Sinatra's compound; he often invited Blakeley and Zeppo to his house two or three times a week. Sinatra would also send champagne or wine to their home, as a nice gesture. Blakeley and Sinatra began a love affair, unbeknownst to Zeppo. The press eventually got wind of the affair, snapping photos of Blakely and Sinatra together, or asking Blakeley questions whenever they spotted her. Both Sinatra and she denied the affair. Zeppo and Blakeley divorced in 1973. Zeppo let Blakeley keep the 1969 Jaguar he had bought her, and agreed to pay her $1,500 () per month for 10 years. Sinatra upgraded Blakeley's Jaguar to the latest model. Sinatra also gave her a house to live in. The house had belonged to Eden Hartford, Groucho Marx's third wife. Blakeley and Sinatra continued to date, and were constantly hounded by the press until the divorce between Zeppo and Blakeley became final. Blakeley and Sinatra were married in 1976. Zeppo became ill with cancer in 1978. He sold his home, and moved to a house on the fairway off Frank Sinatra Drive. The doctors thought the cancer had gone into remission, but it returned. Zeppo called Blakeley, who accompanied him to doctor's appointments. Zeppo spent his last days with Blakeley's family. Death The last surviving Marx Brother, Zeppo died of lung cancer at the Eisenhower Medical Center in Rancho Mirage on November 30, 1979, at the age of 78. He was cremated and his ashes were scattered into the Pacific Ocean. In his will, Zeppo left stepson Bobby Marx a few possessions and enough money to finish law school. Both Sinatra and Blakeley attended his funeral. Legacy Zeppo introduced Jack Benny to his wife Mary Livingstone. Several critics have challenged the notion that Zeppo did not develop a comic persona in his films. James Agee considered Zeppo \\"a peerlessly cheesy improvement on the traditional straight man\\".Joe Adamson. Groucho, Harpo, Chico and Sometimes Zeppo: A Celebration of the Marx Brothers. New York: Simon and Schuster, 1973. Along similar lines, Gerald Mast, in his book The Comic Mind: Comedy and Movies, noted that Zeppo's comedic persona, while certainly more subtle than his brothers', was undeniably present: > [He] added a fourth dimension as the clich√© of the [romantic] juvenile, the > bland wooden espouser of sentiments that seem to exist only in the world of > the sound stage. ... [He is] too schleppy, too nasal, and too wooden to be > taken seriously.Mast, Gerald. The Comic Mind: Comedy and Movies, pp. 282, > 285. University of Chicago Press, 1979. While this interpretation of Zeppo's comedic contributions could seemingly be considered a contemporary reappraisal of his role in the Paramount pictures, more astute film reviewers were apparently in on the joke as far back as the release of The Cocoanuts in 1929. The New York Times review of the movie, for example, ranked all four Marx Brothers equally ‚Äî \\"When the four Marx brothers are on the screen, it's a riot\\" [emphasis added] ‚Äî and went on to describe each of the brothers' unique style of comedy, and praised Zeppo as \\"the handsome but dogged straight man with the charisma of an enamel washstand.\\"Cinema Year by Year, 1894‚Äì2001. London: Dorling Kindersley Limited, 2001, p. 205. In his essay \\"The Marx Brothers: From Vaudeville to Hollywood,\\" Roger S. Bader observes that the films that the Marx Brothers made as a trio after Zeppo left the group should generally be considered a different comedy team altogether, noting that \\"changes in the Marx Brothers‚Äô screen personas [were] immediate and apparent,\\" with less of vaudevillian-inspired anarchy and more in tune with standard Hollywood comedies where \\"love stories [were] injected in the plots [to] make their films more palatable to female moviegoers.\\" Bader notes Zeppo's absence as a symptom of his older brothers' watered-down new act: > Their zaniness and anarchy would be heavily diluted at M-G-M as the studio > found them a wider audience. ‚Ä¶ These are not vaudeville‚Äôs Marx Brothers. But > in the Paramount films they certainly are the Marx Brothers of the stage ‚Äì > the FOUR Marx Brothers, as Minnie intended them to be.

He was neither totally a straight man nor totally a comedian, but combined elements of both, as did Margaret Dumont. Zeppo's importance to the Marx Brothers' initial success was as a Marx Brother who could 'pass' as a normal person. None of Zeppo's replacements (Allan Jones, Kenny Baker and others) could assume this character as convincingly as Zeppo, because they were actors, and Zeppo was the real thing, cast to type\\" (562). Zeppo's comic persona was further highlighted in the \\"dictation scene\\" of Animal Crackers. In his book Groucho, Harpo, Chico, and Sometimes Zeppo, Joe Adamson analyzed the scene, showing how it revealed Zeppo's ability to one-up Groucho with simple, plain-English rebuttals. In the scene, Groucho dictates a letter to his lawyer, which Zeppo takes down. Adamson noted, > There is a common assumption that Zeppo = Zero, which this scene does its > best to contradict. Groucho dictating a letter to anybody else would hardly > be cause for rejoicing. We have to believe that someone will be there to > accept all his absurdities and even respond somewhat in kind before things > can progress free from conflict into this genial mishmash. Groucho clears > his throat in the midst of his dictation, and Zeppo asks him if he wants > that in the letter. Groucho says, 'No, put it in the envelope.' Zeppo nods. > And only Zeppo could even try such a thing as taking down the heading and > the salutation and leaving out the letter because it didn't sound important > to him. It takes a Marx Brother to pull something like that on a Marx > Brother and get away with it.Joe Adamson, Groucho, Harpo, Chico and > Sometimes Zeppo: A History of the Marx Brothers and a Satire on the Rest of > the World, Simon & Schuster, Paperback (1983). In the same book, Adamson noted Zeppo's position as the campy parody of the juvenile romantic in his analysis of Horse Feathers. This tongue-in-cheek observation bolstered the theory of Zeppo's stiffness as a deliberate comic persona: > Each Marx Brother has his own form of comedy. Zeppo is at his funniest when > he opens his mouth and sings. It has taken forty years, of course, for the > full humor to come across. For a normal comedian this may be bad timing, but > for a Marx Brother it's immortality. Almost every crooner of 1932 looks > stilted and awkward now, but with Zeppo, who was never very convincing in > the first place, the effect crosses the threshold into lovable comedy. \\"I > think you're wonderful!\\" he oozes charmingly to Thelma Todd, and we know he > never met her before shooting started. Critic Dan√©l Griffin, who praises Zeppo as \\"that great comic parody of the schleppy juvenile role of the 1920s/30s musicals,‚Äù believes that the onscreen dynamic between Groucho and Zeppo is one of the ‚Äúkey relationships between the individual Marx Brothers [that] shape their comedic strategy, not counting when the four of them are onstage together.‚Äù Griffin points out that Zeppo is often the brother who puts ideas into Groucho's head that set up storylines and big laughs; he goes on to explain, > Zeppo‚Äôs onscreen relationship with Groucho has always been tricky to > ascertain; Zeppo is generally Groucho‚Äôs aloof secretary in their films, but > he is seemingly capable of reducing Groucho to stunned silence with simple, > plain-English rebuttals (see Animal Crackers) when Chico‚Äôs snappy comebacks > only fuel Groucho‚Äôs insults all the more. ‚Ä¶ Zeppo‚Äôs parts are usually small, > but he performs exactly what is required of him as an outwardly wooden > fellow who is incapable of being rattled by a man whose business is to > rattle. Allen W. Ellis wrote in his article \\"Yes, Sir: The Legacy of Zeppo Marx\\": > Indeed, Zeppo is a link between the audience and Groucho, Harpo and Chico. > In a sense, he is us on the screen.

Zeppo's performances produced this tribute from a prominent fan, written in Marc Eliot's 2005 biography of Cary Grant. Grant, a teenager performing in vaudeville under his real name, Archie Leach, loved the Marx Brothers. And as Eliot put it, > While the rest of the country preferred Groucho, Zeppo, the good-looking > straight man and romantic lead, was Archie's favorite, the one whose foil > timing he believed was the real key to the act's success.

The New Yorker, June 1, 2016 =Awards and honors= In the 1974 Academy Awards telecast, Jack Lemmon presented Groucho with an honorary Academy Award to a standing ovation. The award was also on behalf of Harpo, Chico, and Zeppo, whom Lemmon mentioned by name. It was one of Groucho's final major public appearances. \\"I wish that Harpo and Chico could be here to share with me this great honor,\\" he said, naming the two deceased brothers (Zeppo was still alive at the time and in the audience). Groucho also praised the late Margaret Dumont as a great straight woman who never understood any of his jokes. In popular culture On the television series Cheers, Lilith Crane said Zeppo was her favorite Marx brother. A third season episode of the television series Buffy the Vampire Slayer was titled \\"The Zeppo\\". This episode focuses on the perspective of the character Xander Harris; his position as ostensibly the least impressive or capable member of the cast is compared to Zeppo Marx. The Mystery Science Theater 3000 character TV's Frank revealed in episode 323 featuring Sax Rohmer's The Castle of Fu Manchu, that while he was working at Arby's, he was given the nickname of \\"Zeppo\\" due to his supposed sense of humor.

However, his grandfather recounts via flashback a cautionary tale of a great love affair with a \\"fallen women\\" during his own youth. When he was 28 years old, Tom Armstrong, the son of an aristocratic family and the rector of St. Giles, meets the famous Italian opera star Rita Cavallini (Greta Garbo) at an evening party given by Cornelius Van Tuyl (Lewis Stone). Tom falls in love with Rita even though there are rumors that she is Van Tuyl's mistress. Tom's family disapproves of Rita but he continues to pursue her until he discovers that she had been lying to him about the true nature of her relationship with Van Tuyl. Though he forgives and loves her, their different lives and different social class make an engagement untenable. Ultimately, the old bishop later married Harry's grandmother and counsels Harry to marry the woman he loves regardless of the consequences.

It was written and directed by Edmund Goulding and was first filmed as a silent film. A sound version was quickly made and was a big hit for its star, Gloria Swanson. Goulding remade the film as That Certain Woman (1937) with Bette Davis and Henry Fonda. Preservation status George Eastman House preserved the film with the help of the American Film Institute and The Film Foundation. This restored version was shown on Turner Classic Movies on December 14, 2011. Legacy The Trespasser proved to be one of Swanson's only two hit sound films, the other being Sunset Boulevard (1950) many years later. Subsequent films like What a Widow! (1930), Indiscreet (1931), Tonight or Never (1931), Perfect Understanding (1933), and Music in the Air (1934) were all box-office flops. The Trespasser was an important film for Swanson, following the financially disastrous Queen Kelly (1929) and the hit Sadie Thompson (1928). This was Swanson's second Oscar nomination. Despite the disappointments following The Trespasser, Swanson was remembered by Billy Wilder, a screenwriter on Music in the Air (1934), when he was casting the part of Norma Desmond for Sunset Boulevard (1950).

The film tells the story of dockside innkeeper Min's tribulations as she tries to protect the innocence of her adopted daughter Nancy, all while loving and fighting with boozy fisherman Bill, who resides at the inn. Min and Bill stars Marie Dressler (Min), Wallace Beery (Bill), Dorothy Jordan (Nancy), and Marjorie Rambeau (Bella, Nancy's ill-reputed mother), and was directed by George W. Hill. Dressler won the Academy Award for Best Actress in 1931 for her performance in this film. This film was such a runaway hit that it and its near-sequel Tugboat Annie, which re-teamed Dressler and Beery in similar roles, boosted both to superstar status. Dressler topped Quigley Publications' annual Top Ten Money Making Stars Poll of movie exhibitors in 1933, and the two pairings with Dressler were primarily responsible for Beery becoming MGM's highest-paid actor in the early 1930s, before Clark Gable took over that crown; Beery had a clause in his 1932 contract that he be paid a dollar per year more than any other actor on the lot. From the original 1930 M-G-M trailer Min, Bill and Nancy, the cobbled-together family that snared Marie Dressler an Oscar Plot Min Divot (Marie Dressler) runs a dockside inn. She has been raising Nancy Smith (Dorothy Jordan) as her own since her prostitute mother, Bella (Marjorie Rambeau), left her at the inn as an infant. Min frequently argues with fisherman Bill (Wallace Beery). Despite Bill's near-constant drinking, Min and he care for each other. Bill and she are the only ones who know the identity of Nancy's real, still living, mother. Min does her best to raise Nancy and keep her from learning about the real activities of the people who live and work on the docks. Despite not having much extra money or a home outside her inn, Min does her best to raise Nancy into a young lady. She does everything she can to make sure Nancy is never around when Bella arrives for a visit. Nancy loves Min as her own mother and frequently skips school to be with her. After repeatedly dealing with the truant officer, Min uses the money she had hidden in her room to send Nancy to a fancy boarding school. She hopes the school will teach Nancy better manners than those she had been picking up from Bill and the others on the docks. The schooling works, and Nancy returns to Min with good manners, an education, and the news that she is now engaged to a very wealthy man named Dick Cameron. She wants Min to attend the wedding. Min is thrilled, until she finds out that Bella has returned. Seeing how happy Nancy is to be getting married (and the wedding will be taking place in a few days), Min deliberately argues with Nancy and says terrible things she does not mean for Nancy to immediately leave. She is mad at herself for hurting Nancy, but is relieved that she is gone by the time Bella arrives. Min stalls Bella, hoping the wedding will take place and the couple can leave for their honeymoon before Bella can interfere. Bella arrives as the ceremony takes place. She confronts Min in an upstairs room in her inn. She has discovered her daughter's identity, and that of her very wealthy new husband. She taunts Min with the information and pledges to torment Nancy and her new husband until they give her money and take her into their new home. Min thinks about the wedding and Nancy's happiness, and tries to prevent Bella from leaving. When Bella attacks Min with a hot curling iron and attempts to leave, Min takes a hidden gun and shoots her dead. Min drops the gun and flees the room. Bill, knowing what was going on, tries to help Min by pleading with her to drive down to Mexico on his boat. Once Min and Bill leave the inn for the boat, an eavesdropping sailor enters Min's room and discovers Bella's corpse. Just as Min and Bill are about to board Bill's boat, however, Min sees Nancy and Dick Cameron about to board a boat to their honeymoon, and is drawn silently to the happy couple. She wants to see Nancy one last time.. Min watches, but decides not to let Nancy know she is there, and stays hidden in the crowd. Two police officers quietly confront Min about the shooting at the inn. Min does not say much. She takes one final look at a smiling Nancy as she leaves with her husband. Min turns back and smiles as she quietly walks away with the officers. She is sad that it may be the last time she ever sees Nancy, but at the same time, she is happy that Nancy managed to escape a dead- end life by the docks. Bill watches helplessly.

The Hungarian or Magyar Vizsla are sporting dogs and loyal companions. The Vizsla's medium size is one of the breed's most appealing characteristics. As a hunter of fowl and upland game, the Vizsla has held a prominent position among sporting dogs - that of household companion and family dog. The Vizsla is a natural hunter endowed with an excellent nose and outstanding trainability. It was bred to work in fields, forests or bodies of water. Although they are lively, gentle-mannered, demonstrably affectionate and sensitive, they are also fearless and possess a well-developed protective instinct. Description =Appearance= The Vizsla is a short-coated hunting dog of distinguished appearance and bearing. Robust, but rather lightly built, they are lean dogs that have defined muscles. Various breeds are often mistaken for Vizslas and vice versa. Redbone Coonhounds, Weimaraners and Rhodesian Ridgebacks are most commonly mixed up. The body structure of a Vizsla is very similar in appearance to a Weimaraner and a Redbone Coonhound, though the Vizsla is typically leaner with a more defined musculature. However, Weimaraners and Rhodesian Ridgebacks are larger than Vizslas. The nose of the Vizsla will always have a reddish color that blends with the coat color. Black, brown, light pink, or another color nose is an indication of another breed. A Vizsla's eye and nail color should also blend with the coat color. Color and coats The standard coat is a solid golden rust color in several shadings. The coat could also be described as a copper-brown color, russet gold, and dark sandy gold. Solid, dark, mahogany red and pale yellow are considered faults and a disqualification in competitions. Small areas of white on the fore-chest, neck, or tail are permissible but not preferred. Some variations in the Vizsla coat color along their back (saddle-type marks) are typical. The American Kennel Club (AKC) breed standards for the Vizsla states that the coat should be short, smooth, dense, and close-lying, without a woolly undercoat. The Vizsla is not suited to being kept outside since, unlike most other breeds, it does not have an undercoat. They are self-cleaning dogs and rarely need to be bathed, if ever. They have little noticeable \\"dog smell\\" detectable by humans. After several forays into lakes and streams they will develop an aroma that is a weaker version of the 'wet dog' smell. A quick bath and this odor will vanish. Size The Vizsla is a medium-sized dog, The average height and weight: *Males **Height: **Weight: *Females **Height: **Weight: File:Anzu.JPGVizslas are gentle-mannered dogs File:Wy≈ºe≈Ç wƒôgierski g≈Çadkow≈Çosy 500.jpgThe Vizsla is a short-coated hunting dog File:Male Vizsla.jpgVizsla portrait File:Vizsla-profile.jpgFive-month-old Vizsla with the AKC standard \\"golden rust\\" coat Tail Vizsla pointing Vizsla in water The American breed standard does call for the tail to be docked to two- thirds of its original length. Breed standards in countries where docking is banned, such as the United Kingdom, do not allow this and docking has been condemned by the American Veterinary Medical Association,https://www.avma.org/KB/Policies/Pages/Ear-Cropping-and-Tail- Docking-of-Dogs.aspx the American Animal Hospital Association, and the Canadian Veterinary Medical Association. The Vizsla holds its tail horizontal to the ground and wags it vigorously while charging through rough scrub and undergrowth. The docked tail of the Vizsla is significantly longer than that of other dogs with traditionally docked tails such as the Weimaraner, Dobermann, Boxer, and Australian Shepherd. Since the tail is docked when the puppy is less than three days old, this longer dock can result in some variation in tail length among Vizsla dogs from different breeding programs. =Temperament= thumb Vizslas are very high energy, gentle-mannered, loyal, caring, and very affectionate. They quickly form close bonds with their owners, children, and even strangers. Often, they are referred to as \\"velcro\\" dogs because of their loyalty and affection. Vizslas will cry or whine when they feel neglected or are otherwise unhappy. Some will bark at strangers if they feel that they are invading the \\"pack\\" space. They are very good guard dogs when trained to be so. They are natural hunters with an excellent ability to take training. Not only are they great pointers, but they are excellent retrievers as well. They will retrieve on land and in the water making the most of their natural instincts. However, they must be trained gently and without harsh commands or strong physical correction, as they have sensitive temperaments and can be easily damaged if trained too harshly. However the owner must show quiet authority in training, otherwise the dog is likely to take over the training session. Vizslas thrives on attention, exercise, and interaction. They are intelligent dogs and need a lot of mental stimulation when young. If left alone for long hours, they can be bored and become destructive. With proper socialization and training, Vizslas are very gentle dogs that can be great around children. The Vizsla wants to be close to its owner as much as possible, and it is commonly observed that vizslas insist on sleeping under the covers in their owner's bed at night. Health Vizslas are excellent swimmers. Vizslas that live in cold weather climates often need protection from the harsh conditions. The American Kennel Club states that a typical lifespan for the Vizsla is between 12-14 years, while a 2008 Vizsla Club of America survey puts the average lifespan of the Vizsla at 9.15 years.The Vizsla is considered to be a robust dog but some localized breeding programs using a small number of dogs have led to heritable illnesses in some offspring including: * Hip dysplasia is very rare but remotely possible. * Canine epilepsy * Cancer (mast cell tumors, hemangiosarcoma, lymphoma) * Sebaceous adenitis Responsible breeders do not select dogs for breeding if they have such inherent problems. Vizslas can also suffer from hypothyroidism, dwarfism, persistent right aortic arch, tricuspid valve dysplasia, and progressive retinal atrophy. Major risks include epilepsy and lymphosarcoma. Vizslas can also be prone to skin and food allergies.Dogster Vizsla Resource. Accessed 20 April 2010. Unlike many other dogs, Vizslas do not have an undercoat. Therefore, they are unsuited for living outdoors.Hungarian dog breeds. Dr. S√°rk√°ny P√°l ‚Äì Dr.√ìcsag Imre. . History The first written reference to the Vizsla dog breed has been recorded in the Illustrated Vienna Chronicle prepared on order of King Louis I of Hungary by the Carmelite Friars in 1357. As companions of the early warlords and barons, Vizsla blood was preserved pure for centuries by the land-owning aristocracy who guarded them jealously and continued to develop the hunting ability of these \\"yellow- pointers\\". Records of letters and writings show the high esteem in which the Vizsla was held. The Vizsla has survived the Turkish occupation (1526‚Äì1696), the Hungarian Revolution of 1848, World War I, World War II and the Hungarian People's Republic. However, Vizslas faced and survived several near- extinctions in their history, including being overrun by English Pointers and German Shorthaired Pointers in the 1800s (Boggs, 2000:19) and again to near- extinction after World War II. A careful search of Hungary and a poll of Hungarian sportsmen revealed only about a dozen Vizslas of the true type still alive in the country. From that minimum stock, the breed rose to prominence once again. The various \\"strains\\" of the Vizsla have become somewhat distinctive as individuals bred stock that suited their hunting style. Outside Hungary, vizslas are commonly bred in Romania, Austria, Slovakia, and Serbia. The Vizsla started arriving in the United States at the close of World War II. As interest in and devotion to the breed began to increase, owners formed the Vizsla Club of America in order to gain AKC recognition. As a result of registering foundation stock with the AKC, Vizsla owners were able to obtain official recognition on 25 November 1960, as the Vizsla became the 115th breed recognized by the American Kennel Club. The Vizsla was used in development of other breeds, most notably the Weimaraner, Wirehaired Vizsla and German Shorthaired Pointer breeds. There is much conjecture about those same breeds, along with other pointer breeds, being used to reestablish the Vizsla breed at the end of the 19th century.

She is best known for her comedic roles, despite being in films of varied genres. After her father died when she was fourteen, Dunne's family relocated from Kentucky to Indiana and she became determined to become an opera singer, but when she was rejected by The Met, she performed in musicals on Broadway until she was scouted by RKO and made her Hollywood film debut in the 1930 musical Leathernecking. She starred in 42 movies and in popular anthology television, and made guest appearances on radio until 1962; she was nominated five times for the Academy Award for Best Actress‚Äîfor her performances in Cimarron (1931), Theodora Goes Wild (1936), The Awful Truth (1937), Love Affair (1939), and I Remember Mama (1948)‚Äîand was one of the top 25 highest-paid actors of her time. In the present, Dunne is considered one of the greatest actresses who never won an Academy Award. Some critics theorize that her performances have been underappreciated and largely forgotten, overshadowed by movie remakes and her better-known co-stars. Dunne once fled across the Atlantic Ocean to avoid starring in a comedy, but she has been praised by many during her career, and after her death, as one of the best comedic actresses in the screwball genre. She was nicknamed \\"The First Lady of Hollywood\\" for her regal manner despite being proud of her Irish-American, country girl roots. Dunne devoted her retirement to philanthropy and was chosen by President Dwight D. Eisenhower as a delegate for the United States to the United Nations, in which she advocated for world peace and highlighted refugee-relief programs. She also used the time to be with her family‚Äîher husband, dentist Dr. Francis Griffin, and their daughter Mary Frances, whom they adopted in 1938. She received numerous awards for her philanthropy, including honorary doctorates, a Laetare Medal from the University of Notre Dame, and a papal knighthood‚ÄîDame of the Order of the Holy Sepulchre. In 1985, she was awarded a Kennedy Center Honor for her services to the arts. Early life Irene Marie Dunn was born on December 20, 1898, at 507 East Gray Street in Louisville, Kentucky, to Joseph John Dunn (1863‚Äì1913), an Irish-American steamboat engineer/inspector for the United States government, and Adelaide Antoinette Dunn (n√©e, Henry) (1871‚Äì1936), a concert pianist/music teacher of German descent from Newport. She was their second child and second daughter, and had a younger brother named Charles (1901‚Äì1981); Dunne's elder sister, born 1897, died soon after her birth. The family alternated between living in Kentucky and St. Louis, due to her father's job offers, but he died in April 1913 from a kidney infection when she was fourteen. She saved all of his letters and both remembered and lived by what he told her the night before he died: \\"Happiness is never an accident. It is the prize we get when we choose wisely from life's great stores.\\" Following her father's death, Dunne's family moved to her mother's hometown of Madison, Indiana, living on W. Second St., in the same neighborhood as Dunne's grandparents' home. Dunne's mother taught her to play the piano as a very small girl‚Äîaccording to Dunne, \\"Music was as natural as breathing in our house,\\"‚Äîbut unfortunately for her, music lessons frequently prevented her from playing with the neighborhood kids. Her first school production of A Midsummer Night's Dream began her interest in drama, so she took singing lessons as well, and sang in local churches and high school plays before her graduation in 1916. Her first ambition was to become a music teacher and studied at the Indianapolis Conservatory of Music and Webster College, earning a diploma in 1918, but saw an audition advertizement for the Chicago Musical College when she visited friends during a journey to Gary, and won the College scholarship, officially graduating in 1926. She hoped to become a soprano opera singer, relocating to New York after finishing her second year in 1920, but failed two auditions with the Metropolitan Opera Company due to her inexperience and her \\"slight\\" voice. Career Dunne dressed as a rabbit for a Broadway show, c. mid-1920s Dunne took more singing lessons and then dancing lessons to prepare for a possible career in musical theater. On a New York vacation to visit family friends, she was recommended to audition for a stage musical, eventually starring as the leading role in the popular play Irene, which toured major cities as a roadshow throughout 1921. \\"Back in New York,\\" Dunne reflected, \\"I thought that with my experience on the road and musical education it would be easy to win a role. It wasn't.\\" Her Broadway debut was December 25 the following year as Tessie in Zelda Sears's The Clinging Vine. She then obtained the leading role when the original actress took a leave of absence in 1924. Supporting roles in musical theater productions followed in the shows The City Chap (1925), (Dunne is credited as \\"Irene Dunn\\") Yours Truly (1927) and She's My Baby (1928). Her first top-billing, leading role Luckee Girl (1928) was not as successful as her previous projects. She would later call her career beginnings \\"not great furor.\\" At this time, Dunne added the extra \\"e\\" to her surname, which had ironically been misspelled as \\"Dunne\\" at times throughout her life until this point; until her death, \\"Dunne\\" would then occasionally be misspelled as \\"Dunn.\\" Starring as Magnolia Hawks in a road company adaptation of Show Boat was the result of a chance meeting with its director Florenz Ziegfeld Jr. in an elevator the day she returned from her honeymoon, when he mistook her for his next potential client, eventually sending his secretary to chase after her. A talent scout for RKO Pictures attended a performance, and Dunne signed the studio's contract, appearing in her first movie, Leathernecking (1930), an adaptation of the musical Present Arms. Already in her 30s when she made her first film, she would be in competition with younger actresses for roles, and found it advantageous to evade questions that would reveal her age, so publicists encouraged the belief that she was born in 1901 or 1904; the former is the date engraved on her tombstone. Dunne in Love Affair (1939) The \\"Hollywood musical\\" era had fizzled out so Dunne moved to dramatic roles during the Pre-Code era, leading a successful campaign for the role of Sabra in Cimarron (1931) with her soon-to-be co-star Richard Dix, earning her first Best Actress nomination. A Photoplay review declared, \\"[This movie] starts Irene Dunne off as one of our greatest screen artists.\\" Other dramas included Back Street (1932) and No Other Woman (1933); for Magnificent Obsession (1935), she reportedly studied Braille and focused on her posture with blind consultant Ruby Fruth. This was after she and Dix reunited for Stingaree (1934), where overall consensus from critics was that Dunne had usurped Dix's star power. The 1934 Sweet Adeline remake and Roberta (1935) were Dunne's first two musicals since Leathernecking; Roberta also starred dancing partners Fred Astaire and Ginger Rogers, and she sang the musical's breakaway pop hit \\"Smoke Gets in Your Eyes.\\" In 1936, she starred as Magnolia Hawks in Show Boat (1936), directed by James Whale. Dunne had concerns about Whale's directing decisions, but she later admitted that her favorite scene to film was \\"Make Believe\\" with Allan Jones because the blocking reminded her of Romeo and Juliet. It was during this year that Dunne's RKO contract had expired and she had decided to become a freelance actor, with the power to choose studios and directors. She was apprehensive about attempting her first comedy role as the title character in Theodora Goes Wild (1936), but discovered that she enjoyed the production process, and received her second Best Actress Oscar nomination for the performance. Dunne followed Theodora Goes Wild with other romantic and comedic roles. The Awful Truth (1937) was the first of three films also starring Cary Grant and was later voted the 68th best comedy in American cinema history by the American Film Institute. Their screwball comedy My Favorite Wife (1940) was praised as an excellent spiritual successor, whereas Penny Serenade (1941) was a \\"romantic comedy that frequently embraced melodrama.\\" Dunne also starred in three films with Charles Boyer: Love Affair (1939), When Tomorrow Comes (1939), and Together Again (1944). Love Affair was such an unexpected critical and financial success that the rest of Dunne and Boyer's films were judged against it; When Tomorrow Comes was considered the most disappointing of the \\"trilogy,\\" and the advertizing for Together Again promoted the actors' reunion more than the movie. Dunne and Grant were praised as one of the best romantic comedy couples, while the Dunne and Boyer pairing was praised as the most romantic in Hollywood. On her own, Dunne showed versatility through many film genres. Critics praised her comedic skills in Unfinished Business (1941) and Lady in a Jam (1942), despite both movies' negative reception. When the United States entered the Second World War, Dunne participated in celebrity bond tours around the country, announcing at a rally in 1942, \\"This is no time for comedy. I'm now a saleswoman, I sell bonds.\\" She followed the tour with her only two war films: A Guy Named Joe (1943) and The White Cliffs of Dover (1944). Despite A Guy Named Joes troubled production and mixed reviews, it was one of the most successful films of the year. Over 21 (1945) was Dunne's return to comedy but the themes of war (such as her character's husband enlisting in the army) immediately dated the story, which may have contributed to its lack of success. Strong but ladylike motherly roles in the vein of Cimarrons Sabra would follow throughout her next films, such as Anna Leonowens in the fictionalized biopic Anna and the King of Siam (1946), and mothers Vinnie Day in Life with Father (1947), and Marta Hanson in I Remember Mama (1948). Dunne openly disliked Vinnie's ditziness and had rejected Life with Father numerous times, eventually taking the role because \\"it seemed to be rewarding enough to be in a good picture that everyone will see.\\" For I Remember Mama, Dunne worked on her Norwegian accent with dialect coach Judith Sater, and wore body padding to appear heavier; Marta Hanson was her fifth and final Best Actress nomination. Dunne's last three films were box-office failures. The comedy Never a Dull Moment (1950) was accused of trying too hard. Dunne was excited to portray Queen Victoria in The Mudlark (1950) for a chance to \\"hide\\" behind a role with heavy makeup and latex prosthetics. It was a success in the UK, despite initial critical concern over the only foreigner in a British film starring as a well-known British monarch, but her American fans disapproved of the prosthetic decisions. The comedy It Grows on Trees (1952) became Dunne's last movie performance, although she remained on the lookout for suitable film scripts for years afterwards. She filmed a television pilot based on Cheaper by the Dozen that was not picked up. On the radio, she and Fred MacMurray respectively played a feuding editor and reporter of a struggling newspaper in the 52-episode comedy-drama Bright Star, which aired in syndication between 1952 and 1953 by the Ziv Company. She also starred in and hosted episodes of television anthologies, such as Ford Theatre, General Electric Theater, and the Schlitz Playhouse of Stars. Faye Emerson wrote in 1954 that \\"I hope we see much more of Miss Dunne on TV,\\" and Nick Adams called Dunne's performance in Saints and Sinners worthy of an Emmy nomination. Dunne's last acting credit was in 1962, but she was once rumored to star in a movie named Heaven Train, and rejected an offer to cameo in Airport '77. \\"I never formally retired,\\" she later explained, \\"but an awful lot of the girls my age soldiered on in bad vehicles. [I] couldn't run around with an ax in my hand like Bette [Davis] and Joan [Crawford] did to keep things going.\\" Hollywood retirement Dunne christens SS Carole Lombard next to 253x253px Dunne appeared at 1953's March of Dimes showcase in New York City to introduce two little girls nicknamed the Poster Children, who performed a dramatization about polio research. She was later present at Disneyland's \\"Dedication Day\\" in 1955 to christen the Mark Twain Riverboat with a bottle containing water from several major rivers across the United States. Years before, Dunne had also christened the SS Carole Lombard. = Activism = During the Second World War, Dunne co-founded the Clark Gable's Hollywood Victory Committee. It organized servicemen entertainment and war bond sales tours on behalf of willing Hollywood participants. In her retirement, she devoted herself primarily to humanitarianism. Some of the organizations she worked with include the American Cancer Society, the Los Angeles Orphanage, and the American Red Cross. She was also president of Santa Monica's St. John's Hospital and Health Clinic and became a board member of Technicolor in 1965, the first woman ever elected to the board of directors. She established an African American school for Los Angeles, negotiated donations to St. John's through box office results, and served as chairwoman in 1949 for the American Heart Association's women's committee, and Hebrew University Rebuilding Fun's sponsors committee. She appeared in 1955's celebrity-rostered television special Benefit Show for Retarded Children with Jack Benny as host. Dunne also donated to refurbishments in Madison, Indiana, funding the manufacture of Camp Louis Ernst Boy Scout's gate in 1939 and the Broadway Fountain's 1976 restoration. In 1987, she founded the Irene Dunne Guild, a foundation which remains \\"instrumental in raising funds to support programs and services at St. John's.\\" It was reported that the Guild had raised $20 million by the time of her death. Dunne reflected in 1951: \\"If I began living in Hollywood today I would certainly one thing that I did when I arrived, and that is to be active in charity. If one is going to take something out of a community‚Äîany community‚Äîone must put something in, too.\\" She also hoped that charity would encourage submissive women to find independence: \\"I wish women would be more direct. [...] I was amazed when some quiet little mouse of a woman was given a job which seemed to be out of all proportion to her capabilities. Then I saw the drive with which she undertook that job and put it through to a great finish. It was both inspiring and surprising. I want women to be individuals. They should not lean on their husbands' opinions and be merely echoes of the men of the family[.]\\" () = American delegate to the United Nations = In 1957, President Eisenhower appointed Dunne one of five alternative U.S. delegates to the United Nations in recognition of her interest in international affairs and Roman Catholic and Republican causes. Dunne admired the U.N.'s dedication to creating world peace,: 'Says Irene: \\"You never for a moment forget that war and peace and life itself are at stake. When I go back home after this session of the General Assembly, I'll be an enthusiastic saleslady for the U.N. as an essential force [for] world peace in this age of atoms and outer-space moons.\\"' and was inspired by colleagues' beliefs that Hollywood influenced the world.: '\\"There are a great many thoughtful people in Hollywood,\\" Irene says, \\"especially among the writers, directors, and technicians. I think they are aware of Hollywood's impact on people all over the world, but even they have no idea of how tremendous that impact is. I know now‚Äîfrom talking with the other U.N. delegates. And I'm going home and try to tell the people back there what an important contribution Hollywood can make, or how much harm it can do.\\"' On September 12, she was sworn in with Herman B. Wells, Walter H. Judd, A. S. J. Carnahan, Philip M. Klutznick and George Meany. She held delegacy for two years and addressed the General Assembly twice. She gave her delegacy its own anthem: \\"Getting to Know You\\" because \\"it's so simple, and yet so fundamental in international relations today.\\" Dunne later described her Assembly request for $21 million to help Palestinian refugees as her \\"biggest thrill,\\" and called her delegacy career the \\"highlight of my life.\\" She also concluded, \\"I came away greatly impressed with the work the U.N. does in its limited field‚Äîand it does have certain limits. I think we averted a serious situation in Syria, which might have been much more worse without a forum to hear it... And I'm much impressed with the work the U.N. agencies do. I'm especially interested in UNICEF's work with children[,] and the health organization [.]\\" =Political views= Dunne was a lifelong Republican and participated in 1948's Republican convention. She accepted the U.N. delegacy offer because she viewed the U.N. as apolitical. She later explained: \\"I'm a Nixon Republican, not a Goldwater one. I don't like extremism in any case. The extreme rights do as much harm as the extreme lefts.\\" Her large input in politics created an assumption that she was a member of the \\"Hollywood right-wing fringe,\\" which Dunne denied, calling herself \\"foolish\\" for being involved years before other celebrities did. Personal life Dunne with 214x214px Dunne's father frequently told Dunne about his memories of traveling on bayous and lazy rivers. Dunne's favorite family vacations were riverboat rides and parades, later recalling a voyage from St. Louis to New Orleans, and watching boats on the Ohio River from the hillside. She admitted, \\"No triumph of either my stage or screen career has ever rivaled the excitement of trips down the Mississippi on the riverboats with my father.\\" Dunne was an avid golf player and had played since high school graduation; she and her husband often played against each other and she made a hole in one in two different games. She was good friends with Loretta Young, Jimmy Stewart, Bob Hope, Ronald Reagan, Carole Lombard, and George Stevens Jr., and became godmother to Young's son, Peter. Dunne also bonded with Leo McCarey over numerous similar interests, such as their Irish ancestry, music, religious backgrounds, and humor. School friends nicknamed her \\"Dunnie\\" and she was referred to as this in Madison High School's 1916 yearbook, along with the description \\"divinely tall and most divinely fair.\\" One of Dunne's later public appearances was in April 1985, when she attended the unveiling of a bronze bust in her honor at St. John's Hospital and Health Clinic. The artwork, commissioned by the hospital from artist Artis Lane, has a plaque reading \\"IRENE DUNNE First Lady Of Saint John's Hospital and Health Center Foundation.\\" = Relationships = Between 1919 and 1922, Dunne was close to Fritz Ernst, a businessman based in Chicago who was 20 years older than she, and a member of one of the richest families in Madison, Indiana. They frequently corresponded over letters while Dunne was training for musical theater but when Fritz proposed, Dunne rejected, due to pressure from her mother and wanting to focus on acting. They remained friends and continued writing letters until Ernst died in 1959. Dunne with husband, Dr. Francis Griffin At a New York, Biltmore Hotel supper party in 1924, Dunne met Northampton-born dentist Francis Griffin. According to Dunne, he preferred being a bachelor, yet tried everything he could to meet her. To her frustration, he did not telephone her until over a month later, but the relationship had strengthened and they married in Manhattan on July 13, 1927. (Dunne and Griffin's marriage license code is 19627; Dunne's name is on page 372, and Griffin's name is on page 588) They had constantly argued about the state of their careers if they ever got married, with Dunne agreeing to consider theater retirement sometime in the future and Griffin agreeing to support Dunne's acting. Griffin later explained: \\"I didn't like the moral tone of show business. [...] Then Ziegfeld signed her for 'Show Boat' and it looked like she was due for big things. Next came Hollywood and [she] was catapulted to the top. Then I didn't feel I could ask her to drop her career. [I] really didn't think marriage and the stage were compatible but we loved each other and we were both determined to make our marriage work.\\" When Dunne decided to star in Leathernecking, it was meant to be her only Hollywood project, but when it was a box-office bomb, she took an interest in Cimarron. Soon after, she and her mother moved to Hollywood and maintained a long-distance relationship with her husband and brother in New York until they joined her in California in 1936. They remained married until Griffin's death on October 14, 1965, and lived in the Holmby Hills in a \\"kind of French Chateau\\" they designed.: \\"When Irene and her husband, Frank Griffin, who was a dentist, arrived in Hollywood in 1930, they bought a lot in Holmby Hills for $10[,]000 and built a two-story house on it for $40[,]000.\\" They had one daughter, Mary Frances (n√©e Anna Mary Bush; born 1932), who was adopted by the couple in 1936 (finalized in 1938) from the New York Foundling Hospital, run by the Sisters of Charity of New York. Due to Dunne's privacy, Hollywood columnists struggled to find scandals to write about her‚Äîan eventual interview with Photoplay included the disclaimer, \\"I can guarantee no juicy bits of intimate gossip. Unless, perhaps she lies awake nights heartsick about the kitchen sink in her new home. She's afraid it's too near to the door. Or would you call that juicy? No? No, I thought not.\\" When the magazines alleged that Dunne and Griffin would divorce, Griffin released a statement denying any marital issues. When Griffin was asked about how the marriage had lasted, he replied, \\"When she had to go on location for a film I arranged my schedule so I could go with her. When I had to go out of town she arranged her schedule so she could be with me. We co-operate in everything. [...] I think a man married to a career woman in show business has to be convinced that his wife's talent is too strong to be dimmed or put out. Then, he can be just as proud of her success as she is and, inside he can take a bow himself for whatever help he's been.\\" After retiring from dentistry, Griffin became Dunne's business manager, and helped negotiate her first contract. The couple became interested in real estate, later investing in the Beverly Wilshire and partnering with Griffin's family's businesses (Griffin Equipment Company and The Griffin Wellpoint Company.) Griffin sat as a board member of numerous banks, but his offices were relocated from Century City to their home after his death, when Dunne took over as president. = Religion = Dunne was a devout Roman Catholic, who became a daily communicant. She was a member of the Church of the Good Shepherd and the Catholic Motion Picture Guild in Beverly Hills, California. In 1953, Pope Pius XII awarded Dunne and her husband papal knighthoods as Dame and Knight of the Holy Sepulchre, respectively. Griffin also became a Knight of Malta in 1949. Death Crypt of Irene Dunne at Calvary Cemetery (notice incorrect birth year) Dunne died at the age of 91 in her Holmby Hills home on September 4, 1990, and is entombed in the Calvary Cemetery, East Los Angeles. She had been unwell for a year and became bedridden about a month before. Her personal papers are housed at the University of Southern California. She was survived by her daughter, two grandchildren and two great-grandchildren. Legacy Dunne is considered one of the best actresses of The Golden Age of Hollywood never to win an Academy Award.: \\"Louisville native Irene Dunne is such a good actress that she never won an Academy Award[. This] is easily explained. Like her frequent co-stars Cary Grant and Charles Boyer, Miss Dunne was so consistently splendid [that] she was always taken for granted at Oscar time.\\" After I Remember Mama was released, Liberty magazine hoped that she would \\"do a Truman\\" at the 1949 Oscars. In 1985, Roger Fristoe pointed out that \\"a generation of filmgoers is mostly unfamiliar with her work\\" because some of her movies had been remade, including Love Affair (remade as An Affair to Remember), Show Boat (remade in 1951), My Favourite Wife (remade as Move Over, Darling), and Cimarron (remade in 1960). Dunne once noted that she had lacked the \\"terrifying ambition\\" of some other actresses, explaining in 1977, \\"I drifted into acting and drifted out. Acting is not everything. Living is.\\" Dunne addresses the United Nations General Assembly about American donations towards the United Nations' refugee-relief programs. Although known for her comedic roles, Dunne admitted that she never saw comedy as a worthy genre, even leaving the country to the London premiere of Show Boat with her husband and James Whale to get away from being confronted with a script for Theodora Goes Wild. \\"I never admired a comedienne,\\" she said retrospectively, \\"yet it was very easy for me, very natural. It was no effort for me to do comedy at all. Maybe that's why I wasn't so appreciative of it.\\" She ascribed her sense of humor to her late father, as well as her \\"Irish stubbornness.\\" Her screwball comedy characters have been praised for their subversions to the traditional characterisation of female leads in the genre, particularly Susan (Katharine Hepburn) in Bringing Up Baby and Irene (Carole Lombard) in My Man Godfrey. \\"Unlike the genre's stereotypical leading lady, who exhibits bonkers behaviour continuously,\\" writes Wes D. Gehring, \\"Dunne's screwball heroine [in Theodora Goes Wild] chooses when she goes wild.\\" Biographers and critics argue that Dunne's groundedness made her screwball characters more attractive than her contemporaries. In his review for My Favorite Wife, Bosley Crowther wrote that a \\"mere man is powerless\\" to \\"her luxurious and mocking laughter, her roving eyes and come-hither glances.\\" Maria DiBattista points out that Dunne is the \\"only comic actress working under the strictures of the Production Code\\" who ends both of her screwball movies alongside Cary Grant with a heavy implication of sharing a bed with him, \\"under the guise of keeping him at bay.\\" Meanwhile, outside of comedy, Andrew Sarris theorized that Dunne's sex appeal is due to the common narrative in her movies about a good girl \\"going bad.\\" Dunne was popular with co-workers off-camera, earning a reputation as warm, approachable and having a \\"poised, gracious manner\\" like royalty, which spilled into her persona in movies. She earned the nickname \\"The First Lady of Hollywood\\" because \\"she was the first real lady Hollywood has ever seen,\\" said Leo McCarey, with Gregory La Cava adding, \\"If Irene Dunne isn't the first lady of Hollywood, then she's the last one.\\" Ironically, this title had been bestowed on her when she was a little girl when an aunt cooed \\"What a little lady!\\" This ladylike attitude furthered Sarris' sex appeal claims, admitting that the scene when she shares a carriage with Preston Foster on the train in Unfinished Business was practically his \\"rite of passage\\" to a sex scene in a film, theorizing that the sex appeal of Dunne came from \\"a good girl deciding thoughtfully to be bad.\\" On the blatant eroticism of the same train scene, Megan McGurk wrote, \\"The only thing that allowed this film to pass the censors was that good-girl Irene Dunne can have a one-night stand with a random because she loves him, rather than just a once-off fling. For most other women of her star magnitude, you could not imagine a heroine without a moral compass trained on true north. Irene Dunne elevates a tawdry encounter to something justifiably pure or blameless. She's just not the casual sex type, so she gets away with it.\\" When approached about the nickname in 1936, Dunne admitted that it had grown tiresome but approved if it was meant as \\"the feminine counterpart of 'gentleman'\\"; a later interview she did have with the Los Angeles Times would ironically be titled \\"Irene Dunne, Gentlewoman.\\" She would also be made a Dame (or Lady) of the Order of the Holy Sepulchre. The Los Angeles Times referred to Dunne's publicity in their obituary as trailblazing, noting her as one of the first actors to become a freelancer in Hollywood during its rigid studio system through her \\"non-exclusive contract that gave her the right to make films at other studios and to decide who should direct them,\\" and her involvement with the United Nations as a decision that allowed entertainers from movies and television to branch out into philanthropy and politics, such as Ronald Reagan and George Murphy. Dunne later said, \\"Cary Grant always said that I had the best timing of anybody he ever worked with.\\" Lucille Ball admitted at an American Film Institute seminar that she based her comedic skills on Dunne's performance in Joy of Living. When asked about life after retiring from baseball, Lou Gehrig stated that he would want Dunne as a screen partner if he ever became a movie actor. Charles Boyer described her as \\"a gracious house,\\" adding, \\"the best room would be the music room [...] Great music, and the best of good swing, and things by Gershwin would sound there always. The acoustics would be perfect. Guests in this house would be relaxed and happy but they would have to mind their manners.\\" Dunne told James Bawden in 1977: \\"Now don't you dare call me normal. I was never a Pollyanna. There was always a lot of Theodora in me.\\" Awards and nominations Dunne looking at her Laetare Medal with her husband and daughter, Mary Frances, at the University of Notre Dame in 1949. Cardinal McIntyre at Loyola University's graduation ceremony in 1958. She attended to accept her honorary Law degree and give a commencement speech. Dunne received five Best Actress nominations during her career: for Cimarron (1931), Theodora Goes Wild (1936), The Awful Truth (1937), Love Affair (1939) and I Remember Mama (1948); she was the first actor to lose against the same actor in the same category twice, losing to Best Actress winner Luise Rainer in 1936 and 1937. When asked if she ever resented never winning, Dunne pointed out that the nominees she was up against had strong support, believing that she would never have had a chance, especially when Love Affair was against Gone with the Wind. \\"I don't mind at all,\\" she told Joyce Haber, \\"Greta Garbo never got an Oscar either [and] she's a living legend.\\" However, Dunne was honored numerous times for her philanthropy from Catholic organizations and schools, receiving the University of Notre Dame's Laetare Medal, and the Bellarmine Medal from Bellarmine College.

It provides services related to the session layer of the OSI model allowing applications on separate computers to communicate over a local area network. As strictly an API, NetBIOS is not a networking protocol. Older operating systems ran NetBIOS over IEEE 802.2 and IPX/SPX using the NetBIOS Frames (NBF) and NetBIOS over IPX/SPX (NBX) protocols, respectively. In modern networks, NetBIOS normally runs over TCP/IP via the NetBIOS over TCP/IP (NBT) protocol. This results in each computer in the network having both an IP address and a NetBIOS name corresponding to a (possibly different) host name. History and terminology NetBIOS is a non-routable OSI Session Layer 5 Protocol and a service that allows applications on computers to communicate with one another over a local area network (LAN). NetBIOS was developed in 1983 by Sytek Inc. as an API for software communication over IBM PC Network LAN technology. On PC-Network, as an API alone, NetBIOS relied on proprietary Sytek networking protocols for communication over the wire. Despite supporting a maximum of 80 PCs in a LAN, NetBIOS became an industry standard. In 1985, IBM went forward with the token ring network scheme and a NetBIOS emulator was produced to allow NetBIOS-aware applications from the PC-Network era to work over this new design. This emulator, named NetBIOS Extended User Interface (NetBEUI), expanded the base NetBIOS API with, among other things, the ability to deal with the greater node capacity of token ring. A new networking protocol, NBF, was simultaneously produced to allow NetBEUI (NetBIOS) to provide its services over token ring ‚Äì specifically, at the IEEE 802.2 Logical Link Control layer. In 1985, Microsoft created a NetBIOS implementation for its MS-Net networking technology. As in the case of IBM's token ring, the services of Microsoft's NetBIOS implementation were provided over the IEEE 802.2 Logical Link Control layer by the NBF protocol. Until Microsoft adopted Domain Name System (DNS) resolution of hostnames Microsoft operating systems used NetBIOS to resolve names in Windows client-server networks. In 1986, Novell released Advanced Novell NetWare 2.0 featuring the company's own NetBIOS emulator. Its services were encapsulated within NetWare's IPX/SPX protocol using the NetBIOS over IPX/SPX (NBX) protocol. In 1987, a method of encapsulating NetBIOS in TCP and UDP packets, NetBIOS over TCP/IP (NBT), was published. It was described in RFC 1001 (\\"Protocol Standard for a NetBIOS Service on a TCP/UDP Transport: Concepts and Methods\\") and RFC 1002 (\\"Protocol Standard for a NetBIOS Service on a TCP/UDP Transport: Detailed Specifications\\"). The NBT protocol was developed in order to \\"allow an implementation [of NetBIOS applications] to be built on virtually any type of system where the TCP/IP protocol suite is available,\\" and to \\"allow NetBIOS interoperation in the Internet.\\" After the PS/2 computer hit the market in 1987, IBM released the PC LAN Support Program, which included a driver for NetBIOS. There is some confusion between the names NetBIOS and NetBEUI. NetBEUI originated strictly as the moniker for IBM's enhanced 1985 NetBIOS emulator for token ring. The name NetBEUI should have died there, considering that at the time, the NetBIOS implementations by other companies were known simply as NetBIOS regardless of whether they incorporated the API extensions found in that emulator. For MS-Net, however, Microsoft elected to name its implementation of the NBF protocol \\"NetBEUI\\" ‚Äì naming its implementation of the transport protocol after IBM's second version of the API. Consequently Microsoft file and printer sharing over Ethernet continues to be called NetBEUI, with the name NetBIOS commonly used only in for file and printer sharing over TCP/IP. More accurately, the former is the NetBIOS Frames protocol (NBF), and the latter is NetBIOS over TCP/IP (NBT). Since its original publishing in a technical reference book from IBM, the NetBIOS API specification has become a de facto standard. Services NetBIOS provides three distinct services: *Name service (NetBIOS-NS) for name registration and resolution. *Datagram distribution service (NetBIOS-DGM) for connectionless communication. *Session service (NetBIOS-SSN) for connection-oriented communication. (Note: SMB, an upper layer, is a service that runs on top of the Session Service and the Datagram service, and is not to be confused as a necessary and integral part of NetBIOS itself. It can now run atop TCP with a small adaptation layer that adds a packet length to each SMB message; this is necessary because TCP only provides a byte-stream service with no notion of packet boundaries.) =Name service= In order to start sessions or distribute datagrams, an application must register its NetBIOS name using the name service. NetBIOS names are 16 octets in length and vary based on the particular implementation. Frequently, the 16th octet, called the NetBIOS Suffix, designates the type of resource, and can be used to tell other applications what type of services the system offers. In NBT, the name service operates on UDP port 137 (TCP port 137 can also be used, but rarely is). The name service primitives offered by NetBIOS are: *Add name ‚Äì registers a NetBIOS name. *Add group name ‚Äì registers a NetBIOS \\"group\\" name. *Delete name ‚Äì un-registers a NetBIOS name or group name. *Find name ‚Äì looks up a NetBIOS name on the network. NetBIOS name resolution is not supported by Microsoft for Internet Protocol Version 6 (IPv6). =Datagram distribution service= Datagram mode is connectionless; the application is responsible for error detection and recovery. In NBT, the datagram service runs on UDP port 138. The datagram service primitives offered by NetBIOS are: *Send Datagram ‚Äì send a datagram to a remote NetBIOS name. *Send Broadcast Datagram ‚Äì send a datagram to all NetBIOS names on the network. *Receive Datagram ‚Äì wait for a packet to arrive from a Send Datagram operation. *Receive Broadcast Datagram ‚Äì wait for a packet to arrive from a Send Broadcast Datagram operation. =Session service= Session mode lets two computers establish a connection, allows messages to span multiple packets, and provides error detection and recovery. In NBT, the session service runs on TCP port 139. The session service primitives offered by NetBIOS are: *Call ‚Äì opens a session to a remote NetBIOS name. *Listen ‚Äì listen for attempts to open a session to a NetBIOS name. *Hang Up ‚Äì close a session. *Send ‚Äì sends a packet to the computer on the other end of a session. *Send No Ack ‚Äì like Send, but doesn't require an acknowledgment. *Receive ‚Äì wait for a packet to arrive from a Send on the other end of a session. In the original protocol used to implement NetworkBIOS services on PC-Network, to establish a session, the initiating computer sends an Open request which is answered by an Open acknowledgment. The computer that started the session will then send a Session Request packet which will prompt either a Session Accept or Session Reject packet. During an established session, each transmitted packet is answered by either a positive-acknowledgment (ACK) or negative-acknowledgment (NAK) response. A NAK will prompt retransmission of the data. Sessions are closed by the non-initiating computer by sending a close request. The computer that started the session will reply with a close response which prompts the final session closed packet. NetBIOS name vs Internet host name When NetBIOS is run in conjunction with Internet protocols (e.g., NBT), each computer may have multiple names: one or more NetBIOS name service names and one or more Internet host names. =NetBIOS name= The NetBIOS name is 16 ASCII characters, however Microsoft limits the host name to 15 characters and reserves the 16th character as a NetBIOS Suffix. This suffix describes the service or name record type such as host record, master browser record, or domain controller record or other services. The host name (or short host name) is specified when Windows networking is installed/configured, the suffixes registered are determined by the individual services supplied by the host. In order to connect to a computer running TCP/IP via its NetBIOS name, the name must be resolved to a network address. Today this is usually an IP address (the NetBIOS name to IP address resolution is often done by either broadcasts or a WINS Server ‚Äì NetBIOS Name Server). A computer's NetBIOS name is often the same as that computer's host name (see below), although truncated to 15 characters, but it may also be completely different. NetBIOS names are a sequence of alphanumeric characters. The following characters are explicitly not permitted: \\\\/:*?\\"<>. Since Windows 2000, NetBIOS names also had to comply with restrictions on DNS names: they cannot consist entirely of digits, and the hyphen (\\"-\\") or full-stop (\\".\\") characters may not appear as the first or last character. Since Windows 2000, Microsoft has advised against including any full-stop (\\".\\") characters in NetBIOS names, such that applications can use the presence of a full-stop to distinguish domain names from NetBIOS names. The Windows LMHOSTS file provides a NetBIOS name resolution method that can be used for small networks that do not use a WINS server. =Internet host name= A Windows machine's NetBIOS name is not to be confused with the computer's Internet host name (assuming that the computer is also an Internet host in addition to being a NetBIOS node, which need not necessarily be the case). Generally a computer running Internet protocols (whether it is a Windows machine or not) usually has a host name (also sometimes called a machine name). Originally these names were stored in and provided by a hosts file but today most such names are part of the hierarchical Domain Name System (DNS). Generally the host name of a Windows computer is based on the NetBIOS name plus the Primary DNS Suffix, which are both set in the System Properties dialog box. There may also be connection-specific suffixes which can be viewed or changed on the DNS tab in Control Panel ‚Üí Network ‚Üí TCP/IP ‚Üí Advanced Properties. Host names are used by applications such as telnet, ftp, web browsers, etc. To connect to a computer running the TCP/IP protocol using its name, the host name must be resolved into an IP address, typically by a DNS server. (It is also possible to operate many TCP/IP-based applications, including the three listed above, using only IP addresses, but this is not the norm.) Node types Under Windows, the node type of a networked computer relates to the way it resolves NetBIOS names to IP addresses. This assumes that there are any IP addresses for the NetBIOS nodes, which is assured only when NetBIOS operates over NBT; thus, node types are not a property of NetBIOS per se but of interaction between NetBIOS and TCP/IP in the Windows OS environment. There are four node types. *B-node: 0x01 Broadcast *P-node: 0x02 Peer (WINS only) *M-node: 0x04 Mixed (broadcast, then WINS) *H-node: 0x08 Hybrid (WINS, then broadcast) The node type in use is displayed by opening a command line and typing ipconfig /all. A Windows computer registry may also be configured in such a way as to display \\"unknown\\" for the node type. NetBIOS Suffixes The NetBIOS Suffix, alternately called the NetBIOS End Character (endchar), is the 16th character of a NetBIOS name and indicates service type for the registered name. The number of record types is limited to 255; some commonly used values are: For unique names: *00: Workstation Service (workstation name) *03: Windows Messenger service *06: Remote Access Service *20: File Service (also called Host Record) *21: Remote Access Service client *1B: Domain Master Browser ‚Äì Primary Domain Controller for a domain *1D: Master Browser For group names: *00: Workstation Service (workgroup/domain name) *1C: Domain Controllers for a domain (group record with up to 25 IP addresses) *1E: Browser Service Elections See also *NetBIOS over TCP/IP *NetBIOS Frames protocol *Server Message Block References Further reading * Haugdahl, J.

Papers and photographs from Mooney are in the collections of the National Anthropological Archives, Department of Anthropology, Smithsonian Institution.\\"James Mooney,\\" American Anthropologist, Vol. 24, No. 2 (April‚ÄìJune 1922), pp. 209-214. Biography James Mooney was born on February 10, 1861 in Richmond, Indiana, son of Irish Catholic immigrants. His formal education was limited to the public schools of the city. He became a self-taught expert on American tribes by his own studies and his careful observation during long residences with different groups. In 1885 he started working with the Bureau of American Ethnology at Washington, D.C. under John Wesley Powell. He compiled a list of tribes which contained 3,000 names. It ended after the US Army's 1890 massacre of Lakota people at Wounded Knee, South Dakota. Mooney was recognized as a national expert on the American Indian. He married Ione Lee Gaut on September 28, 1897 in Washington, D.C., and had six children. One son was the writer Paul Mooney. Mooney died of heart disease in Washington, D.C. on December 22, 1921. Mooney's obituary is available on JSTOR in American Anthropologist 24, #2 (New Series), pp. 209‚Äì214. He was buried in Mount Olivet Cemetery (Washington, D.C.). A fuller biographical profile by George Ellison can be found in \\"James Mooney's history, myths, and sacred formulas of the Cherokees.\\"  Writing Career  Mooney's writing style was widely considered as evocative and his sympathetic treatment of Native Americans is owed much to his upbringing and ethnic heritage. Although he wrote as a scientist, his clear objectivity towards Native Americans was in sharp contrast to how most other pieces of writing about the Native American population were written during this time. He largely accepted the goal of Indian assimilation as outlined by reformers of the era. However, he still had the restraint to watch what was being done to these innocent people and remained objective. The late 1800s was a time where Native Americans were criminally disrespected and subjected to genocide by the United States of America. The reputation forced upon the Native Americans by the majority of the white press available to Americans spoke unnecessarily ill of the Natives. Mooney was able to speak on the situation objectively, and considering the alternatives being published at the time, made Native Americans out to be rightfully a lot less dangerous then perceived by the majority of white Americans who read newspapers. Mooney took the time to observe various Native American tribes the way they lived, instead of observing from a far, which prior to Mooney's findings, was the only way people outside reservations knew what was going on in the Native American community. He did not do anything groundbreaking, looking back. But he took the time and effort to treat Native Americans with the respect they deserved and wanted to learn an teach others about their culture. He did so by publishing various books documenting his time with Native American tribes. = The Ghost-dance Religion and the Sioux Outbreak of 1890 = The book, perhaps Mooney's most famous, is prefaced with a historical survey of comparable millenarian movements among other American Indian groups. In response to the rapid spread of the Ghost Dance among tribes of the western United States in the early 1890s, Mooney set out to describe and understand the phenomenon. He visited Wovoka, the Ghost Dance prophet, at his home in Nevada and traced the progress of the Ghost Dance from place to place, describing the ritual and recording the distinctive song lyrics of seven separate tribes. = Calendar History of the Kiowa Indians (1898) = \\"The desire to preserve to future ages the memory of past achievements is a universal human instinct,\\"Mooney said. \\"The reliability of the record depends chiefly on the truthfulness of the recorder and the adequacy of the method employed.\\" Mooney was able to confide in the Kiowa Indians and find out that the first calendar keeper in their tribe was Little Bluff, or Tohausan, who was the principal chief of the tribe from 1833 to 1866. Mooney also worked with two other calendar keepers, Settan, or Little Bear, and Ankopaingyadete, In the Middle of Many Tracks, commonly known as Anko. Other Plains tribes kept pictorial records, known as \\"winter counts\\". However, what was unique to the Kiowa was they recorded two events for each year, offering a finer-grained record and twice as many entries for any given period. Silver Horn (1860‚Äì1940), or Haungooah, was the most highly esteemed artist of the Kiowa tribe in the 19th and 20th centuries, and kept a calendar. He was a respected religious leader in his later years. = Myths of the Cherokee (1900) = Mooney also spent a lot of time with the Cherokee studying their language, culture, and mythology. His research resulted in this comprehensive volume, comprising 126 Cherokee myths, including sacred stories, animal myths, local legends, wonder stories, historical traditions, and miscellaneous myths and legends. Some myths included: * How the World was Made * Why the Deer's Teeth are Blunt * How the Turkey got his Beard * Why the Possum's Tail is Bare The book also includes original Cherokee manuscripts, relating to the history, archaeology, geographic nomenclature, personal names, botany, medicine, arts, home life, religion, songs, ceremonies, and language of the tribe. = Historical Sketch of the Cherokee (1975) = Published posthumously, this account of the Cherokee started with their first contact with whites and, through battles won and lost, treaties signed then broken, towns destroyed and people massacred, ended around 1900. There is humanity along with inhumanity in the relations between the Cherokee and other groups, Indian and non-Indian; there is fortitude and persistence balanced with disillusionment and frustration. In these respects, the history of the Cherokee epitomizes the experience of most Native Americans, Mooney writes. This, among with most, if not all of Mooney's works, is considered dispassionate and matter-of-fact, which is why his works are found in the Bureau of American Ethnology.

Such a policy can complement or avert the need for regulatory (command and control) approaches. Often, an ecotax policy proposal may attempt to maintain overall tax revenue by proportionately reducing other taxes (e.g. taxes on human labor and renewable resources); such proposals are known as a green tax shift towards ecological taxation. Ecotaxes address the failure of free markets to consider environmental impacts. Ecotaxes are examples of Pigouvian taxes, which are taxes that attempt to make the private parties involved feel the social burden of their actions. An example might be philosopher Thomas Pogge's proposed Global Resources Dividend. Taxes affected Examples of taxes which could be lowered or eliminated by a green tax shift are: * Payroll, income, and, to a lesser extent, sales taxes. * Corporate taxes (taxes on investment and entrepreneurship). * Property taxes on buildings and other infrastructure. Examples of ecotaxes which could be implemented or increased are: * Carbon taxes on the use of fossil fuels by greenhouse gases produced. Old hydrocarbon taxes don't penalize green house gas (GHG) production. * Duties on imported goods containing significant non-ecological energy input (to a level necessary to treat fairly local manufacturers) * Severance taxes on the extraction of mineral, energy, and forestry products. * License fees for camping, hiking, fishing and hunting and associated equipment. * Specific taxes on technologies and products which are associated with substantial negative externalities. * Waste disposal taxes and refundable fees. * Steering taxes on effluents, pollution and other hazardous wastes. * Site value taxes on the unimproved value of land. Economic frameworks and strategies employing tax shifting The object of a green tax shift is often to implement a \\"full cost accounting\\" or \\"true cost accounting\\", using fiscal policy to internalize market distorting externalities, which leads to sustainable wealth creation. The broader measures required for this are also sometimes called ecological fiscal reform, especially in Canada, where the government has generally employed this terminology. In some countries the name is eco-social market economy. Tax shifting usually includes balancing taxation levels to be revenue-neutral for government and to maintain overall progressiveness. It also usually includes measures to protect the most vulnerable, such as raising the minimum income to file income tax at all, or an increase to pension and social assistance levels to offset increased costs of fuel consumption. Basic economic theory recognizes the existence of externalities and their potential negative effects. To the extent that green taxes correct for externalities such as pollution, they correspond with mainstream economic theory. In practice, however, setting the correct taxation level or the tax collection system needed to do so is difficult, and may lead to further distortions or unintended consequences. Taxes on consumption may take the \\"feebate\\" approach advocated by Amory Lovins, in which additional fees on less sustainable products--such as sport utility vehicles--are pooled to fund subsidies on more sustainable alternatives, such as hybrid electric vehicles. However, they may simply act as incentives to change habits and make capital investments in newer more efficient vehicles or appliances or to upgrade buildings. Small changes in corporate tax rates for instance can radically change return on investment of capital projects, especially if the averted costs of future fossil fuel use are taken into account. The same logic applies to major consumer purchases. A \\"green mortgage\\" such as a Location Efficient Mortgage, for example, recognizes that persons who do not drive cars and live generally energy-efficient lifestyles pay far less per month than others and accordingly have more to pay a heftier mortgage bill with. This justifies lending them much more money to upgrade a house to use even less energy overall. The result is a bank taking more per month from a consumer's income as utilities and car insurance companies take less, and housing stock upgraded to use the minimum energy feasible with current technology. Aside from energy, the refits will generally be those required to be maximally accommodating to telework, permaculture gardens (for example green roofs), and a lifestyle that is generally localized in the community not based on commuting. The last, especially, raises real state valuations for not only the neighborhood but the entire surrounding region. Consumers living sustainable lifestyles in upgraded housing will generally be unwilling to drive around aimlessly shopping, for instance, to save a few dollars on their purchases. Instead, they'll stay nearer to home and create jobs in grocery delivery and small organic grocers, spending substantially less money on gasoline and car operation costs even if they pay more for food. Progressive or regressive? Some green tax shift proposals have been criticized as being fiscally regressive (a tax with an average tax rate that decreases as the taxpayer's income increases). Taxing negative externalities usually entails exerting a burden on consumption, and since the poor consume more and save or invest less as a share of their income, any shift towards consumption taxes can be regressive. In 2004, research by the Policy Studies Institute and Joseph Rowntree Foundation indicated that flat rate taxes on domestic rubbish, energy, water and transport use would have a relatively higher impact on poorer households. However, conventional regulatory approaches can affect prices in much the same way, while lacking the revenue-recycling potential of ecotaxes. Moreover, correctly assessing distributive impact of any tax shift requires an analysis of the specific instrument design features. For example, tax revenue could be redistributed on a per capita basis as part of a basic income scheme; in this case, the poorest would gain what the average citizen pays as ecotaxes, minus their own small contribution (no car, small apartment, ...). This design would be highly progressive. Alternatively, an ecotax can have a \\"lifeline\\" design, in which modest consumption levels are priced relatively low (even zero, in the case of water), and higher consumption levels are priced at a higher rate. Furthermore, an ecotax policy package can include revenue recycling to reduce or eliminate any regressivity; an increase in an ecotax could be more than offset by a decrease in a (regressive) payroll or consumption tax. Some proponents claim a second benefit of increased employment or lower health care costs as the market and society adjust to the new fiscal policy (these claims, as with the claim \\"tax cuts create jobs,\\" are often difficult to prove or disprove even after the fact). Furthermore, pollution and other forms of environmental harm are often felt more acutely by the poor, who cannot \\"buy their way out\\" of being receptors of air pollution, water pollution, etc. Such losses, although externalities, have real economic welfare impacts. Thus by reducing environmental harm, such instruments have a progressive effect. Ecotax policies enacted An ecotax has been enacted in Germany by means of three laws in 1998, 1999 and 2002. The first introduced a tax on electricity and petroleum, at variable rates based on environmental considerations; renewable sources of electricity were not taxed. The second adjusted the taxes to favor efficient conventional power plants. The third increased the tax on petroleum. At the same time, income taxes were reduced proportionally so that the total tax burden remained constant. The regional government of Balearic Islands (then held by an ecosocialist coalition) established an ecotax in 1999. The Balearic Island suffer a high human pressure from tourism, that at the same time provides the main source of income. The tax (‚Ç¨1.00 per person per day) would be paid by visitors staying at tourist resorts. This was criticized by the conservative opposition as contrary to business interests, and they abolished the tax in 2003 after seizing back the government. A variety of ecotaxes (often called \\"severance taxes\\") have been enacted by various states in the United States. The Supreme Court of the United States held in Commonwealth Edison Co. v. Montana, 453 U.S. 609 (1981), that in the absence of federal law to the contrary, states may set ecotaxes as high as they wish without violating the Commerce Clause or the Supremacy Clause of the United States Constitution.Elison, Larry M. and Snyder, Fritz. The Montana State Constitution: A Reference Guide. Santa Barbara, Calif.: Greenwood Publishing Group, 2001. =Registration taxes= The Netherlands, Portugal, Canada, Spain and Finland have introduced differentiations into their car registration taxes to encourage car buyers to opt for the cleanest car models. In the Netherlands, the new registration taxes, payable when a car is sold to its first buyer, can earn the owner of a hybrid a discount up to ‚Ç¨6000. Spain reduced taxes for cars that produced less CO2 (some of which will be exempted), while the more consuming, like SPV and 4WD saw their taxes increased. Austria has had a registration tax based on fuel consumption for several years. Worldwide implementation =United Kingdom= In 1993, the conservative government introduced the Fuel Price Escalator, featuring a small but steady increase of fuel taxes, as proposed by Weizs√§cker and Jesinghaus in 1992.Weizs√§cker, Ernst Ulrich and Jesinghaus, Jochen. Ecological Tax Reform. London: ZED Books, 1992. Online The FPE was stopped in 2000, following nationwide protests; while fuel was relatively cheap in 1993, fuel prices were then among the highest in Europe. Under the 1997-2007 Labour government, despite Gordon Brown‚Äôs promise to the contrary, green taxes as a percentage of overall taxes had actually fallen from 9.4% to 7.7%, according to calculations by Friends of the Earth. In a 2006 proposal, the U.K.'s then-Environment Secretary David Miliband had the government in discussions on the use of various green taxes to reduce climate-changing pollution. Of the proposed taxes, which were meant to be revenue-neutral, Miliband stated: \\"They're not fundamentally there to raise revenue.\\" Miliband provided additional comments on their need, saying: \\"Changing people's behaviour is only achieved by \\"market forces and price signals\\", and \\"As our understanding of climate change increases, it is clear more needs to be done.\\" =Ukraine= Starting in 1999, the Ukrainian government has been collecting an ecological tax, officially known as Environmental Pollution Fee (), which is collected from all polluting entities, whether it's one-time or ongoing pollution and regardless of whether the polluting act was legal or illegal at the time.Resolution by the Cabinet of Minister of Ukraine on March 1, 1999 N 303 \\"On approval of regulations establishing fees for environmental pollution and recovery of this collection¬ªJoint Order of the Ministry of Environmental Protection and Nuclear Safety of Ukraine and State Tax Administration of Ukraine from 19.07.99 #162/379 \\"On approval of Instruction on procedure of calculation and payment of the environmental pollution —Ç–∞—Ö\\"Explanation of the Environmental Pollution Fee by the Tax Administration of Ukraine =India= The Ministry of Environment and Forests, Government of India, asked Madras School of Economics, Chennai, to undertake a study of taxes on polluting inputs and outputs in 2001. Raja Chelliah, Paul Appasamy, U.Sankar and Rita Pandey (Academic Foundation, 2007, New Delhi) recommended eco taxes on coal, automobiles, chlorine, phosphate detergents, chemical pesticides, chemical fertilizers, lead acid batteries and plastics. See Ecotaxes on polluting inputs and outputs, Academic Foundation, New Delhi,2007. The Finance Minister introduced a coal cess at the rate of Rs 50 per ton in 2010. =France= The French government shared its intentions to establish a new fee on plane tickets with the purpose to fund environment-friendly alternatives, such as eco-friendly transport infrastructure, including rail. The proposed tax would range between 1.50 euros ($1.7) and 18 euros ($20) and apply to most flights departing in France. The French government expects the new tax to raise over 180 million euros ($200 million) from 2020.

Administration =Organization= The UM System is governed by a board of curators, consisting of nine members appointed by the governor with the advice and consent of the Missouri Senate. Curators serve six-year terms, staggered by three positions expiring every two years. Not more than one curator can be appointed from the same congressional district, and no more than five curators can belong to the same political party. In addition, there is a non-voting student representative to the board, likewise appointed and confirmed, who serves a two-year term. The post is rotated among the four universities.UM System Board of Curators Presently, the post is held by Avery Welker from the S&T; campus. The board of curators selects the president of the system, who reports to the board along with the general counsel.

Mun Choi (2017‚Äìpresent) History The University of Missouri was founded in 1839 in Columbia. It was the first public institution of higher learning west of the Mississippi River. It became a land-grant university after passage of the Morrill Act of 1862. In 1870, the University established the Missouri School of Mines and Metallurgy in Rolla. The UM System was created in 1963 when the University of Kansas City, which had been a private institution, was acquired and renamed University of Missouri-Kansas City. That same year, a new university named University of Missouri-St. Louis was created. In 1964, the School of Mines ‚Ä° was renamed the University of Missouri-Rolla, and the original university in Columbia was renamed University of Missouri-Columbia. Effective January 1, 2008, UM‚ÄìRolla became the Missouri University of Science and Technology. =Naming= Since its founding in 1839 until the formation of the system in 1963, the institution in Columbia was known simply as the University of Missouri. When the University of Missouri System was established, the existing institutions‚Äîthe University of Missouri in Columbia and its offshoot, the Missouri School of Mines and Metallurgy in Rolla were renamed the University of Missouri‚ÄìColumbia and the University of Missouri‚ÄìRolla.The Missouri School of Mines and Metallurgy was briefly named the University of Missouri at Rolla in 1963 before changing to the University of Missouri‚ÄìRolla in 1964. The formerly private institution acquired by the system, the University of Kansas City, was renamed the University of Missouri‚ÄìKansas City. The newly created institution in St. Louis was suitably named the University of Missouri‚ÄìSt. Louis, thus creating a uniformly named system of institutions. The original generic name, the University of Missouri, was not officially assigned to any of the schools or the system. However, it has been commonly used both formally and informally to mean the original Columbia campus or the system. It has also been used to mean any of the other three campuses, though this is most often done in a casual manner at the campus in question, or by persons unfamiliar with the system. All four campuses have felt their regional designations potentially cause them to be mistaken as second-tier regional institutions. Considerable controversy over use of the generic name has been caused by the Columbia campus claiming de facto ownership, further marginalizing the other three campuses. The Rolla campus was first to enact a break from regional designation. On 6 April 2007, the Board of Curators approved a proposal to rename the school the Missouri University of Science and Technology, effective 1 January 2008. In addition to ridding itself of a regional designation, it also emphasizes the school's technological research mission.The Case for a Name Change This quickly catalyzed a long-dormant \\"name restoration\\" campaign at the Columbia campus to drop its regional designation.MU Name Restoration This proposal met with considerable criticism, mainly from the Kansas City and St. Louis campuses, who saw this as unnecessary or unfair and an intentional detriment to their campuses. On 29 November 2007, the Board of Curators voted unanimously to allow the Columbia campus to use the generic University of Missouri name for essentially all public purposes, but not when dealing with \\"official business\\" such as budget documents, legal contracts, and other internal UM System documentation, or whenever clarification from the system or other campuses is needed. Use of the generic name is not compulsory and the Columbia designation may continue to be used in any context. The decision also stipulates that the UM System utilize the \\"System\\" designation in most instances. Proponents of the change say that it simply provides clarification and recognizes what has always been common usage, but the issue remains controversial. Southwest Missouri State University sought and eventually was granted permission to drop its regional designation and become Missouri State University. This change was initially vehemently opposed by the UM System, as it saw this as a threat to its funding and its stature as the premier public institution of higher learning in Missouri. It also would create historic entanglements, as the University of Missouri had interchangeably used the Missouri State University name at times in its history. This resulted from MU being designated as both a land grant and a research institution, unlike states such as Iowa where separate institutions (University of Iowa and Iowa State University) were created. =Proposed merger= In April 2003, Northwest Missouri State University in Maryville approached the UM System with the possibility of becoming the fifth school in the system. Name proposals for the university after the merger, such as the University of Missouri‚ÄìNorthwest, were to reflect the school's separate heritage. The Maryville institution would have become a doctoral degree-granting research university of equal stature with the existing UM System universities.Northwest considers merging with the UM SystemBoard approves memorandum of understanding for Northwest merger However, the enabling legislation before the Missouri General Assembly never passed and the deal sunset. There have been no further attempts at a merger. = 2015 racial controversies, protests, and resignations = In 2015, Wolfe was the subject of criticism from a variety of groups over his failure to address a series of racist incidents at the University of Missouri, including students openly using racial slurs towards minority student leaders, and an October incident where feces was used to draw a swastika, drawing condemnation from black and Jewish student organizations. In November 2015, Missouri's Legion of Black Collegians announced that approximately thirty athletes would not participate in any team activities unless Wolfe resigned. On November 8, 2015, the Missouri Student Association joined in calling for Wolfe's resignation. On November 9, 2015, Wolfe resigned at a special Board of Curators meeting that morning. In a statement, he said, \\"My motivation in making this decision comes from a love of Columbia where I grew up and the state of Missouri. I thought and prayed over this decision. It is the right thing to do. ... The frustration and anger I see is real and I don't doubt it for a second. ... I take full responsibility for the actions that have occurred. I have asked everybody to use my resignation to heal. Let's focus in changing what we can change today and in the future, not what we can't change in the past.\\" References External links * Public university systems in the United States Organizations based in Columbia, Missouri ","title":"University of Missouri System"},{"id":"177765","title":"Feminist economics"},{"id":"177766","title":"IAU designated constellations by area"},{"id":"177773","text":"Financial instruments are monetary contracts between parties.

The screenplay by Charles MacArthur and Ben Hecht was adapted from the play The Lullaby by Edward Knoblock. It tells the story of a wrongly imprisoned woman who turns to theft and prostitution in order to support her son. Plot When neglected wife Alice (Karen Morley) decides to leave her doctor husband Lawrence (Robert Young), his friend Dr. Dulac (Jean Hersholt) stops her and tells her the life story of another woman, Madelon Claudet (Helen Hayes), who was persuaded by her American boyfriend, artist Larry Maynard (Neil Hamilton), to run away with him. Eventually, he has to return to the U.S. because his father is sick. Once there however, he betrays her and marries a woman approved of by his parents. Unbeknownst to him, Madelon gives birth to a son. When her lover does not come back, her father (Russ Powell) gets her to agree to marry Hubert (Alan Hale), a farmer. However, when she refuses to give up her illegitimate son, Hubert and her father abandon her. She becomes the mistress of an older acquaintance, Count Carlo Boretti (Lewis Stone), while her friends Rosalie (Marie Prevost) and Victor Lebeau (Cliff Edwards) care for the boy. After a while, Carlo proposes marriage and Madelon accepts. However, when they go out to celebrate, he is arrested as a jewel thief. He manages to commit suicide, but Madelon is sentenced to ten years in prison as his accomplice, even though she is innocent. When she finally is released in 1919, she goes to see her teenage son Lawrence, now living at a state boarding school. A conversation with the school's doctor proves crucial. Dr. Dulac reveals that because his father was a criminal, he cannot get better work elsewhere. Determined not to become a similar burden to her own child, she tells her son that she is an old friend of his mother, and that his mother is dead. Madelon is determined to finance Lawrence's medical education, but with the end of World War I, millions of Frenchmen are released from the army and jobs are scarce. When a man mistakes her for a prostitute, she takes up the profession. As she ages and loses her looks, she is forced to steal as well, but finally, her goal is realized, and Lawrence receives his degree. Aged and destitute, she decides to give up her freedom and commit herself to state charity, but visits her son one last time, pretending to be a patient. When she leaves, she encounters Dr. Dulac, who recognizes her and persuades his friend Dr. Claudet, still unaware of her true identity, to provide for her. After hearing of the woman's self-sacrifice, Alice Claudet suggests to Lawrence he invite Madelon to live with them.

Following its first preview, it was panned by critics, who were impressed by Hayes in her sound film debut after a couple of silent films, but thought the plot was conventional and sappy. Producer Irving Thalberg called in playwright Charles MacArthur, who was Hayes' husband, to doctor the script. He thoroughly revised it, omitting inconsequential characters and framing the story as a flashback. Hayes had begun filming Arrowsmith for Samuel Goldwyn and had to complete that project before shooting her new scenes for the Thalberg film.

Islamic economics () is a term used to refer to Islamic commercial jurisprudence (, fiqh al-mu'ƒÅmalƒÅt), and also to an ideology of economics based on the teachings of Islam that takes a middle ground between the systems of Marxism and capitalism. Islamic commercial jurisprudence entails the rules of transacting finance or other economic activity in a Shari'a compliant manner, i.e., a manner conforming to Islamic scripture (Quran and sunnah). Islamic jurisprudence (fiqh) has traditionally dealt with determining what is required, prohibited, encouraged, discouraged, or just permissible, according to the revealed word of God (Quran) and the religious practices established by Muhammad (sunnah). This applied to issues like property, money, employment, taxes, loans, along with everything else. The social science of economics, on the other hand, works to describe, analyse and understand production, distribution, and consumption of goods and services, and studied how to best achieve policy goals, such as full employment, price stability, economic equity and productivity growth. Early forms of mercantilism and capitalism are thought to have been developed in the Islamic Golden Age from the 9th centuryMaya Shatzmiller (1994), Labor in the Medieval Islamic World, pp. 402‚Äì03, Brill Publishers, . and later became dominant in European Muslim territories like Al-Andalus and the Emirate of Sicily. The Islamic economic concepts taken and applied by the states Age of the Islamic Gunpowders and various Islamic kingdoms and sultanates led to systemic changes in their economy. Particularly in the Mughal India, its wealthiest region of Bengal, a major trading nation of the medieval world, signaled the period of proto- industrialization. In the mid-twentieth century, campaigns began promoting the idea of specifically Islamic patterns of economic thought and behavior. By the 1970s, \\"Islamic economics\\" was introduced as an academic discipline in a number of institutions of higher learning throughout the Muslim world and in the West. The central features of an Islamic economy are often summarized as: (1) the \\"behavioral norms and moral foundations\\" derived from the Quran and Sunnah; (2) collection of zakat and other Islamic taxes, (3) prohibition of interest (riba) charged on loans.Quran (Al-Baqarah 2:275), (Al-Baqarah 2:276‚Äì80), (Al-'Imran 3:130), (Al-Nisa 4:161), (Ar-Rum 30:39)Financial Regulation in Crisis?: The Role of Law and the Failure of Northern Rock By Joanna Gray, Orkun Akseli p. 97 Advocates of Islamic economics generally describe it as neither socialist nor capitalist, but as a \\"third way\\", an ideal mean with none of the drawbacks of the other two systems.Islam and Economic Justice: A 'Third Way' Between Capitalism and Socialism?

Some definitions that have been offered include: ***\\"that branch of knowledge which helps to realize human well-being through an allocation and distribution of scarce resources that is in conformity with Islamic teachings without unduly curbing individual freedom or creating continued macroeconomic and ecological imbalances.\\"** (Umar Chapra) (similarly, the \\"study of human behavior with regard to acquiring and using resources for the satisfaction of necessities, needs, and other desires,\\" but \\"based on the assumptions\\" of the Islamic \\"outlook on life and humanity\\". (Monzer Kahf))Kahf, \\"Relevance definition and methodology\\", 2003: p.25 *\\"the study of an ... economy which abides by the rules of the Shariah\\", i.e. an Islamic economy. (A definition used by some, according to M. Anas Zarqa)Zarqa, M. Anas. (2008), Duality of sources in Islamic economics, and its methodological consequences. Paper presented at 7th International Conference on Islamic Economics, King Abdulaziz University, 1‚Äì3 April, Jeddah. p.30 Khan, What Is Wrong with Islamic Economics?, 2013: p.4 *a discipline that goes beyond the practice of Western economics‚Äîwhich seeks to make \\"positive analysis\\" and give an objective description of what is‚Äîto provide normative policy prescriptions of what ought to be and can be. And which seeks to achieve a \\"transformation of human beings from followers of base desires to people concerned with achieving higher goals\\". (Feisal KhanKhan, Islamic Banking in Pakistan, 2015: p.66 describing the ideas of M.R. Zaman, and also M.U. Chapra, and M.N. Khan and M.I. Bhatti.) *\\"a discipline that is guided by the Shariah and studies all human societies\\" (A definition used by others, according to M. Anas Zarqa) *\\"restatements of Islamic economic teachings\\", using \\"modern economic jargon\\". (What most of the knowledge content in the body of Islamic economics amounts to according to economist Muhammad Akram Khan)Khan, What Is Wrong with Islamic Economics?, 2013: p.xv *an ideology **\\"a revolutionary ideology\\" to change \\"the corrupt reality ... into a pure one\\", and \\"not a science of political economy\\" or \\"an objective analysis of existing reality\\". (Ayatollah Murtaza Mutahhari) **an \\"ideological construct\\" developed by 20th century Islamists (by Abul A'la Maududi, Ayatollah Muhammad Baqir al- Sadr, Abolhassan Banisadr, etc.) taking basic prescriptions from sharia (Islamic law), and systematizing and conceptualizing them \\"to construct a coherent and functional ensemble offering a middle ground between the two systems of the twentieth century, Marxism and capitalism.\\" (Social scientist Olivier Roy) * Zaman(2015) argues that confusion regarding appropriate definition of Islamic Economics have arose because of attempts to mix Western Economics concepts with Islamic ideals, when the two are diametrically opposed to each other in many dimensions. He proposes a definition based on purely Islamic sources: \\"Islamic Economics is the EFFORT/STRUGGLE to implement the orders of Allah pertaining to economic affairs in our individual lives (Micro), in our communities (Meso), and at the level of Ummah (Macro).\\" =Fiqh and Islamic economics= Fiqh (religious law) has developed several traditional concepts having to do with economics. These included: * Zakat‚Äîthe \\"charitable taxing of certain assets, such as currency, gold, or harvest, with an eye to allocating these taxes to eight expenditures that are also explicitly defined in the Quran, such as aid to those in need.\\" * Gharar‚Äî\\"uncertainty\\". The presence of any element of excessive uncertainty, in a contract is prohibited. * Riba‚Äî\\"referred to as usury (modern Islamic economists reached consensus that Riba is any kind of interest, rather than just usury)\\" is prohibited. Another source lists \\"general rules\\" include prohibition of Riba, Gharar, and also *Qimar (gambling) and *the encouragement of Taa‚Äôwon (mutual cooperation), *\\"the overriding doctrine of fairness in commercial dealings is established.\\" These concepts, like others in Islamic law, came from study of the Quran and ahadith‚Äîor as one observer put it, were > constructed on the basis of isolated prescriptions, anecdotes, examples, > words of the Prophet, all gathered together and systematized by commentators > according to an inductive, casuistic method.\\" In addition to Quran and ahadith, sometimes other sources such as al-urf (custom), or al-ijma (consensus of the jurists) are employed, to create laws that determine whether actions were forbidden, discouraged, allowed, encouraged and obligatory for Muslims. The different school of fiqh (madhhab) vary slightly in their rulings. Works of fiqh are typically divided into different \\"books\\" such as a Book of Iman, of Salah, Zakat, Taqwa, Hajj, but not \`economics\` or \`economy\`. Some brief works might contain almost nothing related to matters of property, sales, finance Others do not gather questions on economic issues in one heading, the case in Tawzih al-masa'il, a work of fatawa by Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini, who although a pioneer of political Islam approached the subject of economy > \\"as the classical ulamas do ... the chapter on selling and buying (Kharid o > forush) comes after the one on pilgrimage and present economic questions as > individual acts open to moral analysis: \`To lend [without interest, on a > note from the lender] is among the good works that are particularly > recommended in the verses of the Quran and in the Traditions.\`\\"(source: > Ruhollah Khomeini, Tawzih al-masa'il, p.543) Other works divided the subjects of fiqh into four \\"quarters\\":JALIL, et. al., FOUR INTRODUCTORY THEORIES OF FIQH MUAMALAT: p.8 typically worship (al-\`Ibadat), marriage and family law (al-Munakahat), criminal law (Jinayat), commercial transaction law (Mu'amalat). At least one author (M. Kahf) writes that Mu'amalat is \\"closely related\\" to Islamic Economics.Kahf, \\"Relevance definition and methodology\\", 2003: p.46 (However even with the \\"quarters\\" division of fiqh topics mu'amalat would not include inheritance or wedding dower (mahr) (which at least often comes under marriage and family law), or calculation of alms (zakat, which comes under al-\`Ibadat)). A number of scholars (Olivier Roy, Timur Kuran, Omar Norman) have noted the recentness of reflecting on economic issues in the Islamic world, and the difference between economics the social science based on data, and Islamic jurisprudence based on revealed truth. Salman Ahmed Shaikh and Monzer Kahf insist on a clear distinction between the roles of Fiqh and Islamic Economics, Shaikh saying > to be meritorious as a separate field of inquiry, Islamic economics cannot > confine itself just to explaining and deducing laws in economic matters > based on core principles. Since this function is already performed by the > discipline of Islamic jurisprudence ... M. Kahf writes that mu'amalat and Islamic economics \\"often intermingle\\",Kahf, \\"Relevance definition and methodology\\", 2003: p.47 mu'amalat \\"sets terms and conditions of conduct for economic and financial relationships in the Islamic economy\\" and provides the \\"grounds on which new instruments\\" of Islamic financing are developed, but that the \\"nature of Fiqh imposes a concern about individual transactions and their minute legalistic characteristics\\", so that analyzing Islamic economics in terms of Fiqh\\" risks losing \\"the ability to provide a macro economic theory\\".Kahf, \\"Relevance definition and methodology\\", 2003: p.49 According to economist Muhammad Akram Khan the \\"main plank\\" of Islamic economics is the \\"theory of riba\\", while \\"another landmark\\" is zakat, a tax on wealth and income.Khan, What Is Wrong with Islamic Economics?, 2013: p.xv-xvi According to another contemporary writer Salah El-Sheikh, \\"Islamic economic principles\\" (what he calls a \\"FiqhiConomic model\\") utilize the Faqƒ´h (Islamic jurisprudence) as supporting material, but are grounded upon the ethical teachings within the Qu'rƒÅn. Sharƒ´ah's basic tenets involve gharar and (fadl mƒÅl bilƒÅ 'iwad). Gharar insists all knowledge about a trade or transaction is known before two individuals complete a transaction and (fadl mƒÅl bilƒÅ 'iwad) warns against unjustified enrichment through trade and business. These tenets were \\"among the first economic regulations\\" and their philosophy can be seen today in modern Capitalism. Within Sharƒ´ah, El-Sheikh states, Gharar functions as a divine deterrent against asymmetric information and allows trade to prosper. Riba, ensures each transaction is conducted at a fair price, not allowing one party to benefit exceedingly, which shares a parallel philosophy with Karl Marx \\"Das Kapital\\": seeking a greater outcome for the community. History =Pre-modern Muslim thought on economics= Classical scholars in the Muslim world did however, make valuable contributions to Islamic thought on issues involving production, consumption, income, wealth, property, taxation, land ownership, etc. are Abu Yusuf (d. 798), Muhammad bin al-Hasan (d. 805), Al-Mawardi (d. 1058), Ibn Hazm (d. 1064), Sarakhsi (d. 1090), Tusi (d. 1093), Ghazali (d. 1111), Al-Dimashqi (d. after 1175), Ibn Rushd (d. 1187), Ibn Taymiyyah (d.1328), Ibn al-Ukhuwwah (d. 1329), Ibn al-Qayyim (d. 1350), Sayyid Ali Hamadani (d. 1384), Al-Shatibi (d. 1388), Ibn Khaldun (d. 1406), Al-Maqrizi (d. 1442), Dawwani (d. 1501), Muhammad Aurangzeb Alamgir (d. 1707), and Shah Waliullah Dehlawi (d. 1762). Abu Yusuf (d. 798) was author of the book al Kharaj--literally \\"the return or revenue\\" but was used by the author to mean \\"public revenues and taxation\\"-- which was a policy guide to Harun al-Rashid, the fifth Abbasid Caliph.Kahf, \\"Relevance definition and methodology\\", 2003: p.2 Muhammad bin al-Hasan (d.805) wrote al Iktisab fi al Rizq al Mustatab [Earned Desired income], intended as advice to businessmen \\"in their endeavors to create income opportunities\\". Abu 'Ubaid al Qasim bin Sallam (d.839) was the author of al- Amwal (plural of \\"wealth\\"). Perhaps the most well-known Islamic scholar who wrote about economical issues was Ibn Khaldun,Mahmassani, Sobhi (1932). Les Id√©es Economiques d'Ibn Khaldoun (The Economic Thought of Ibn Khaldoun), BOSC Fr√®res, M. et L. RIOU, Lyon, is an early treatise on Ibn Khaldun's economic thought. who has been called \\"the father of modern economics\\" by I.M. Oweiss.I. M. Oweiss (1988), \\"Ibn Khaldun, the Father of Economics\\", Arab Civilization: Challenges and Responses, New York University Press, . Ibn Khaldun wrote on what is now called economic and political theory in the introduction, or Muqaddimah (Prolegomena), of his History of the World (Kitab al-Ibar). He discussed what he called asabiyya (social cohesion), which he cited as the cause of the advancement of some civilizations. Ibn Khaldun felt that many social forces are cyclic, although there could be sudden sharp turns that break the pattern. His ideas about the benefits of the division of labor also relate to asabiyya, the greater the social cohesion, the more complex the successful division may be, the greater the economic growth. He noted that growth and development positively stimulates both supply and demand, and that the forces of supply and demand are what determines the prices of goods. quotes Muqaddimah 2:276‚Äì78 He also noted macroeconomic forces of population growth, human capital development, and technological developments effects on development. quotes Muqaddimah 2: 272‚Äì73 In fact, Ibn Khaldun thought that population growth was directly a function of wealth. Medieval Islamic economics appears to have somewhat resembled a form of capitalism, some arguing that it laid the foundations for the development of modern capitalism. =Development of \\"Islamic economics\\"= According to Turkish-American economist Timur Kuran, \\"not until the mid-twentieth century\\" was there any body of thought that could be called \\"Islamic economics\\", that was \\"recognizable as a coherent or self-contained doctrine\\". But around 1950 \\"campaigns launched to identify self-consciously, if not also exclusively, Islamic patterns of economic thought and behavior\\". The famous early-20th Century Muslim nationalist and author Muhammad Iqbal, for example, did not refer to religion in his treatise on economics. Islamic economics grew naturally from the Islamic revival and political Islam whose adherents considered Islam to be a complete system of life in all its aspects, rather than a spiritual formulaThe Economic Life of Islam and believed that it logically followed that Islam must have an economic system, unique from and superior to non-Islamic economic systems. \\"Islamic economics\\" \\"emerged\\" in the 1940s according to the Encyclopedia of Islam and the Muslim World. Maulana ala Maududi's 1941 address \\"The economic problem of man and its Islamic solution\\" (Insaan ka Maashi Maslah aur aus ka Islami Hul) is \\"generally considered to be one of the founding documents of modern Islamic economics\\"Khan, Islamic Banking in Pakistan, 2015: pp.57 More conservative salafi have shown less interest in socioeconomic issues, asking the question, \\"the prophet and his companions didn't study \`laws\` of economics, look for patterns, strive for understanding of what happens in commerce, production, consumption. Why should we?\\" Maududi himself also dismissed the need for a \\"new science of economics, embodied in voluminous books, with high-sounding terminology and large organisation\\", as the true \\"economic problem of man\\" ‚Äî along with all his social, political and other problems ‚Äî \\"can be easily understood\\" and is simply the failure to follow Islamic law. ;1960, 70s In the 1960s and 1970s, Shi'a thinkers worked to describe Islamic economics' \\"own answers to contemporary economic problems.\\" Several works were particularly influential: * Eslam va Malekiyyat (Islam and Property) by Mahmud Taleqani (1951), * Iqtisaduna (Our Economics) by Mohammad Baqir al-Sadr (1961) and * Eqtesad-e Towhidi (The Economics of Divine Harmony) by Abolhassan Banisadr (1978) * Some Interpretations of Property Rights, Capital and Labor from Islamic Perspective by Habibullah Peyman (1979).Bakhash, Shaul, The Reign of the Ayatollahs, Basic Books, c1984, pp. 167‚Äì68Revolutionary Surge and Quiet Demise of Islamic Economics in Iran Al-Sadr in particular was described as having \\"almost single-handedly developed the notion of Islamic economics\\"The Renewal of Islamic Law In their writings, Sadr and the other authors \\"sought to depict Islam as a religion committed to social justice, the equitable distribution of wealth, and the cause of the deprived classes,\\" with doctrines \\"acceptable to Islamic jurists,\\" while refuting existing non-Islamic theories of capitalism and Marxism. Mohammad Baqir al-Sadr and also cleric Mahmoud Taleghani developed an \\"Islamic economics\\" emphasizing a major role for the state in matters such as circulation and equitable distribution of wealth, and a reward to participants in the marketplace for being exposed to risk or liability. This version of Islamic economics, which influenced the Iranian Revolution, called for public ownership of land and of large \\"industrial enterprises,\\" while private economic activity continued \\"within reasonable limits.\\" These ideas informed the large public sector and public subsidy policies of the Iranian Revolution. Sunni cleric Taqiuddin al-Nabhani proposed economic system (Nidham ul-Iqtisad fil Islam (The Economic System of Islam) by Taqiuddin Nabhani (1953)) combined public ownership of large chunks of the economy (utilities, public transport, health care, energy resources such as oil, and unused farm land), with use of the gold standard and specific instructions for the gold and silver weights of coins, arguing this would \\"demolish ... American control and the control of the dollar as an international currency.\\" In the Sunni world the first international conference on Islamic economics was held at the King Abdulaziz University in Jeddah in 1976. Since then the International Association for Islamic Economics in collaboration with the Islamic Development Bank has held conferences in Islamabad (1983), Kuala Lumpur (1992), Loughborough (2000), Bahrain (2003), Jakarta (2005) and Jeddah (2008), Iqbal (2008).Iqbal, Zamir and Abbas Mirakhor (2008). An Introduction to Islamic finance. Lahore; Vanguard Books In addition there have been hundreds of seminars, workshops and discussion groups around the world on Islamic economics and finance.Khan, What Is Wrong with Islamic Economics?, 2013: p.6 In the U.S. a small number of patent applications have been filed for Sharia compliant financial service methods.An example of a pending patent application: \\"Declining balance co-ownership financing arrangement\\" (an allegedly Sharia compliant financing arrangement for home purchases and refinances that does not involve the payment of interest). ;Khomeini era What has been called one of \\"two versions\\" of \\"Islamic economy\\" existed during the first ten years (1979-1989) of the Islamic Republic of Iran during the life of Supreme Leader (and revolution founder) Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini. This was an \\"Islamist socialist, and state-run\\": It was \\"little by little supplanted\\" by a more liberal economic policy.Roy, Olivier, The Failure of Political Islam by Olivier Roy, translated by Carol Volk, Harvard University Press, 1994, p.138, 140 ;Post-socialist trend In the 1980s and 1990s, as the Islamic revolution failed to reach the per capita income level achieved by the regime it overthrew, and Communist states and socialist parties in the non-Muslim world turned away from socialism, Muslim interest shifted away from government ownership and regulation. In Iran, \\"eqtesad-e Eslami (meaning both Islamic economics and economy) ... once a revolutionary shibboleth, is indubitably absent in all official documents and the media. It disappeared from Iranian political discourse\\" about 1990. During the era of Zia-ul-Haq, several Islamic economic concepts and practices were introduced into the domestic economy, as part of Zia's Islamisation reforms (see Islamic economics in Pakistan). The term lived on in the Muslim world, shifting form to the less ambitious goal of interest-free banking. Some Muslim bankers and religious leaders suggested ways to integrate Islamic law on usage of money with modern concepts of ethical investing. In banking this was done through the use of sales transactions (focusing on the fixed rate return modes) to support investing without interest-bearing debt. Many modern writers have strongly criticized this approach as a means of covering conventional banking with an Islamic facade.Kahn, Muhammad, What is Wrong with Islamic Economics Edward Elgar Publishing, 2013, pp. 216 et seq.

The Centre for Research in Islamic Economics, an organ of the Jeddah University in Saudi Arabia, for example, \\"cannot allow publication of any work that goes against the orthodox thinking of the influential\\" Saudi religious leadership. Despite \\"tall talk about ijtehad\\", Islamic economists \\"are shy\\" about \\"suggesting innovative ideas\\" for fear of antagonizing religious clerics.

Nomani and A. Rahnema, the Qur'an states that God is the sole owner of all matter in the heavens and the earth,Nomani and Rahnema quote , , , , but man is God's viceregent on earth and holds God's possessions in trust (amanat). Islamic jurists divide properties into public, state, private categories.F. Nomani and A. Rahnema. 1994. Islamic Economic Systems, Zed Press. pp. 66‚Äì70 Some Muslims believe that the Shariah provides \\"specific laws and standards regarding the use and allocation of resources including land, water, animals, minerals, and manpower.\\" =Public property= According to M.A.Khan, \\"Islam introduced the distinction between private property and public property and made the rulers accountable to the people\\". Scholars F. Nomani and A. Rahnema state that public property in Islam refers to natural resources (forests, pastures, uncultivated land, water, mines, oceanic resources etc.) to which all humans have equal right. Such resources are considered the common property of the community. Such property is placed under the guardianship and control of the Islamic state, and can be used by any citizen, as long as that use does not undermine the rights of other citizens, according to Nomani and Rahnema. The owner of previously public property that is privatized pays zakat and, according to Shi'ite scholars, khums as well. In general, the privatization and nationalization of public property is subject to debate amongst Islamic scholars. According to an analysis by Walid El-Malik in 1993, only the Maliki school took the position that all kinds of natural resources are state-owned; the Hanafi school took the opposite view and held that mineral ownership followed surface ownership, while the other two schools, Shafi'i and Hanbali, drew a distinction between \\"hidden\\" and \\"unhidden\\" minerals. =State property= State property includes certain natural resources, as well as other property that can't immediately be privatized. Islamic state property can be movable, or immovable, and can be acquired through conquest or peaceful means. Unclaimed, unoccupied and heir- less properties, including uncultivated land (mawat), can be considered state property. During the life of Muhammad, one fifth of military equipment captured from the enemy in the battlefield was considered state property. During his reign, Umar (on the recommendation of Ali) considered conquered land to be state rather than private property (as was usual practice). The purported reason for this was that privatizing this property would concentrate resources in the hands of a few, and prevent it from being used for the general good. The property remained under the occupation of the cultivators, but taxes were collected on it for the state treasury. Muhammad said \\"Old and fallow lands are for God and His Messenger (i.e. state property), then they are for you\\". Jurists draw from this the conclusion that, ultimately, private ownership takes over state property. =Private property= There is consensus amongst Islamic jurists and social scientists that Islam recognizes and upholds the individual's right to private ownership. The Qur'an extensively discusses taxation, inheritance, prohibition against stealing, legality of ownership, recommendation to give charity and other topics related to private property. Islam also guarantees the protection of private property by imposing stringent punishments on thieves. Muhammad said that he who dies defending his property was like a martyr. Islamic economists classify the acquisition of private property into involuntary, contractual and non-contractual categories. Involuntary means are inheritances, bequests, and gifts. Non-contractual acquisition involves the collection and exploitation of natural resources that have not previously been claimed as private property. Contractual acquisition includes activities such as trading, buying, renting, hiring labor etc. A tradition attributed to Muhammad, with which both Sunni and Shi'a jurists agree, in cases where the right to private ownership causes harm to others, then Islam favors curtailing the right in those cases. Maliki and Hanbali jurists argue that if private ownership endangers public interest, then the state can limit the amount an individual is allowed to own. This view, however, is debated by others. When Muhammad migrated to Madinah many of the Muslims owned agricultural land. Muhammad confirmed this ownership and allocated land to individuals. The land allotted would be used for housing, farming or gardening. For example, Bilal b. Harith was given land with mineral deposits at 'Aqiq Valleyal-Baladhuri, Futuh al-Buldan Hassan b. Thabit was afforded the garden of BayruhaSahih al-Bukhari, 17 and Zubayr received oasis land at Khaybar and Banu Nadir.Futuh al-Buldan, Abu Ubayd During the reign of Caliph Umar, a vast expanse of Persian royal family terrain had been acquired, this lead his successor Caliph Uthman to accelerate the allotment of land to individuals in return for a portion of the crop yield.al-Maqrizi, al-Mawa'iz wa'l-I'tibar Markets According to M.S.Naz, regulation of markets is among the main functions of hisbah,Zaman, Islamic Economics: A Survey ..., 2008: p.111M.S.

It was ‚Äúcharged with responsibility of carrying out the spirit of the system, setting conditions that preserve and enhance the public health and interests, protect the consumers, solve business and labor disputes, promote good market behavior, and ensure their observance.‚ÄùMonzer Kahf (1996) Principles of Islamic Economics, IIUM. 41, 115, 123. M.A. Khan states, institution of Hisbah as established to \\"supervise markets, to provide municipal services, and to settle petty disputes\\".Ibn Tamiyah, Public Duties in Islam, Leicester: The Islamic Foundation, 1981.Khan, Introduction to Islamic Economics, 1994: p.83 In the contemporary era, Pakistan has attempted to re-create this institution, although it has jurisdiction only over the administrative excesses of the federal government departments and agencies, not provincial ones or private companies. According to Nomani and Rahnema, Islam accepts markets as the basic coordinating mechanism of the economic system. Islamic teaching holds that the market, given perfect competition, allows consumers to obtain desired goods and producers to sell their goods at a mutually acceptable price. Three necessary conditions for an operational market are said (by Nomani and Rahnema) to be upheld in Islamic primary sources: * Freedom of exchange: the Qur'an calls on believers to engage in trade, and rejects the contention that trade is forbidden. cite , and * Private ownership (see above). * Security of contract: the Qur'an calls for the fulfillment and observation of contracts. cite , , , and The longest verse of the Qur'an deals with commercial contracts involving immediate and future payments. cite . Another author (Nima Mersadi Tabari) claims that the general doctrine of fairness in sharia law creates \\"an ethical economic model\\" and forbids market manipulation such as \\"inflating the price of commodities by creating artificial shortages (Ihtekar), overbidding for the sole purpose of driving the prices up (Najash) and concealment of vital information in a transaction from the other party (Ghish)\\". Further, \\"uninformed speculation\\" not based on a proper analysis of available information is forbidden because it is a form of Qimar, or gambling, and results in accumulating Maysir (unearned income). Commercial contracting under conditions of \\"excessive uncertainty\\" (however that is defined) is a form of Gharar and so also forbidden. =Interference= Proponents such as M.A.Khan,Khan, Introduction to Islamic Economics, 1994: p.10 Nomani and Rahnema also contend that the \\"Islamic economy\\" forbids or at least discourages market manipulation such as price fixing, hoarding and bribery. Government intervention in the economy is tolerated under specific circumstances. Another author (Nima Mersadi Tabari) states that in Islam \\"everything is Halal (allowed) unless it has been declared Haram (forbidden)\\", consequently \\"the Islamic economic model is based on the freedom of trade and freedom of contract so far as the limits of Shari‚Äôah allow\\". Nomani and Rahnema say that Islam prohibits price fixing by a dominating handful of buyers or sellers. During the days of Muhammad, a small group of merchants met agricultural producers outside the city and bought the entire crop, thereby gaining a monopoly over the market. The produce was later sold at a higher price within the city. Muhammad condemned this practice since it caused injury both to the producers (who in the absence of numerous customers were forced to sell goods at a lower price) and the inhabitants. The above-mentioned reports are also used to justify the argument that the Islamic market is characterized by free information. Producers and consumers should not be denied information on demand and supply conditions. Producers are expected to inform consumers of the quality and quantity of goods they claim to sell. Some scholars hold that if an inexperienced buyer is swayed by the seller, the consumer may nullify the transaction upon realizing the seller's unfair treatment. The Qur'an also forbids discriminatory transactions. cite , , . They also point out that a chapter is devoted to such fraudulent practices: Bribery is also forbidden in Islam and can therefore not be used to secure a deal or gain favor in a transaction, it was narrated that Muhammad cursed the one who offers the bribe, the one who receives it, and the one who arranges it.Reported by Ahmad and al-Hakim Nomani and Rahnema say government interference in the market is justified in exceptional circumstances, such as the protection of public interest. Under normal circumstances, governmental non-interference should be upheld. When Muhammad was asked to set the price of goods in a market he responded, \\"I will not set such a precedent, let the people carry on with their activities and benefit mutually.\\" Banking and finance Islamic banking has been called \\"the most visible practical achievement\\" of Islamic economics, and the \\"most visible mark\\" of Islamic revivalism.Farooq, Riba- Interest Equation and Islam, 2005:p.33 By 2009, there were over 300 \\"shariah compliant banks and 250 mutual funds around the world, and around $2 trillion were sharia-compliant by 2014. However, the domination of the industry by debt-like instruments such as murabaha rather than risk-sharing products, has driven even some leading advocates and experts in Islamic banking (such as Muhammad Nejatullah Siddiqi) to talk about \\"a crisis of identity of the Islamic financial movement.\\"referring to Siddiqi, 1983 (Mohammad Nejatullah SIDDIQI. Issues in Islamic Banking [Leicester: The Islamic Foundation, UK, 1983), in Munawar IQBAL and Philip Molyneux. Thirty Years of Islamic Banking: History, Performance and Prospects [Palgrave, 2005], p. 125 =Interest= The most noticeable and/or important objective of Islamic Banking has been a ban on the charging of interest on loans. The Quran (3: 130) condemns riba (which is usually translated as \\"interest\\"): \\"O, you who believe! Devour not riba, doubled and redoubled, and be careful of Allah; but fear Allah that you may be successful.\\" =Islamic public finance (Bayt-al-Mal)= The only financial institution under Islamic Governance (Prophethood and Caliph Period) was Baitulmaal (public treasury) wherein the wealths were distributed instantly on the basis of need. During Prophethood the last receipt was tribute from Bahrain amounting eight hundred thousands dirham which was distributed in just one sitting. Though the first Caliph earmarked a house for Baitulmaal where all money was kept on receipt. As all money was distributed immediately the treasury generally remained locked up. At the time of his death there was only one dirham in the Baitulmaal. The second caliph besides developing the Central Baitulmaal also opened Baitulmaal at state and headquarters levels. He also carried census during his caliphate; and provisioned salaries to Government employees, stipend to poor and needy people along with social security to unemployed and retirement pensions. The concept of a public financial institution played a historic role in the Islamic economy. The idea of state collected wealth being made available to the needy general public was relatively new. The resources in the Bayt-al-Mal were considered God's resources and a trust, money paid into the shared bank was common property of all the Muslims and the ruler was just the trustee. The shared bank was treated as a financial institution and therefore subjected to the same prohibitions regarding interest.K-al-Mabsut, Al-Sarakhsi, Shamsuddin Caliph Umar spoke on the shared bank saying: \\"I did not find the betterment of this wealth except in three ways: (i) it is received by right, (ii) it is given by right, and (iii) it is stopped from wrong. As regards my own position vis-a- vis this wealth of yours; it is like that of a guardian of an orphan. If I am well-off, I shall leave it, but if I am hard-pressed I shall take from it as is genuinely permissible.\\"Uyun-al-Akhbar, ad-Dinawri =Proposals= Savings and investment An alternative Islamic savings-investment model can be built around venture capital; investment banks; restructured corporations; and restructured stock market. This model looks at removing the interest-based banking and in replacing market inefficiencies such as subsidization of loans over profit-sharing investments due to double taxation and restrictions on investment in private equity. Hybrids Islamic banks have grown recently in the Muslim world, but are a very small share of the global economy compared to the Western debt banking paradigm. Hybrid approaches, which applies classical Islamic values but uses conventional lending practices, are much lauded by some proponents of modern human development theory. Criticism and dispute Islamic economics has been disparaged for *its alleged \\"incoherence, incompleteness, impracticality, and irrelevance\\", driven by \\"cultural identity\\" rather than problem solving (Timur Kuran, John Foster);Kuran, \\"The Economic Impact of Islamic Fundamentalism,\\" in Marty and Appleby Fundamentalisms and the State, U of Chicago Press, 1993, pp. 302‚Äì41\\"The Discontents of Islamic Economic Mortality\\" by Timur Kuran, American Economic Review, 1996, pp. 438‚Äì42 *being \\"a hodgepodge of populist and socialist ideas\\" in theory, and \\"nothing more than inefficient state control of the economy and some almost equally ineffective redistribution policies\\" in practice (Fred Halliday);Halliday, Fred, 100 Myths about the Middle East, Saqi Books, 2005 p. 89 > In a political and regional context where Islamist and ulema claim to have > an opinion about everything, it is striking how little they have to say > about this most central of human activities, beyond repetitious pieties > about how their model is neither capitalist nor socialist. *being little more than a mimicry of conventional economics embellished with verses of the Quran and sunnah (Muhammad Ahram Khan); *claiming to call for a return to Islamic practices that are actually an \\"invented tradition\\" (Timur Kuran); *failing to achieve its goals of abolishing interest on money, establishing economic equality, and a superior business ethic; but nonetheless \\"spared critical scrutiny out of ignorance, misguided tolerance\\", and because its methods and objectives are considered \\"too unrealistic to threaten prevailing economic structures\\" (Timur Kuran). ;Islamic banking and finance One significant result of Islamic economics (and target of criticism) is the creation of Islamic banking and finance industry.Farooq, Riba-Interest Equation and Islam, 2005: p.34 According to several scholars it has bred a new \\"Power Alliance\\" of \\"wealth and Shari'ah scholarship\\",Monzer KAHF. \\"Islamic Banks: The Rise of a New Power Alliance of Wealth and Shari'ah Scholarship,\\" in Clement HENRY and Rodney WILSON (eds.). The Politics of Islamic Finance [Edinburgh University Press, 2004], pp. 17-36.Farooq, Riba-Interest Equation and Islam, 2005: p.27Khan, What Is Wrong with Islamic Economics?, 2013: p.317‚Äîwealthy banks and clients paying Islamic scholars to provide bank products with Islamic \\"shariah compliance\\". Journalist John Foster, quotes an investment banker based in the Islamic Banking hub of Dubai on the practice of \\"fatwa shopping\\", > \\"We create the same type of products that we do for the conventional > markets. We then phone up a Sharia scholar for a Fatwa [seal of approval, > confirming the product is Shari'ah compliant]. If he doesn't give it to us, > we phone up another scholar, offer him a sum of money for his services and > ask him for a Fatwa. We do this until we get Sharia compliance. Then we are > free to distribute the product as Islamic.\\" Foster explains that the fee for services provided by \\"top\\" scholars is \\"often\\" in six-figures, i.e. over US$100,000. One critic (Muhammad O. Farooq) argues that this unfortunate situation has arisen because the \\"preoccupation\\" among supporters of Islamic Economics that any and all interest on loans is riba and forbidden by Islam, and because risk-sharing alternatives to interest bearing loans originally envisioned for Islamic banking have not proven feasible. With the elimination of interest being both the basis of the industry and impractical, shari'a scholars have become \\"entrapped in a situation\\" where they are forced to approve transactions fundamentally similar to conventional loans but using \\"hiyal\\" manipulation to \\"maintain an Islamic veneer\\".Farooq, Riba-Interest Equation and Islam, 2005: p.36 ;Justice Instead of \\"fixating\\" on interest, Farooq urges a focus on \\"the larger picture\\" of \\"justice\\", and in economics on fighting exploitation from \\"greed and profit,\\" and the concentration of wealth. He quotes an ayat in support: \\"What God has bestowed on his Messenger (and taken away) from the people of the townships, - belongs to God, - to his Messenger and to kindred and orphans, the needy and the wayfarer; in order that it may not (merely) make a circuit between the wealthy among you. ...\\" Farooq, Riba-Interest Equation and Islam, 2005: p.33 As an example of the neglect of this issue, Farooq complains that one \\"rather comprehensive\\" bibliography of Islamic economics and finance, contains \\"not a single citation for exploitation or injustice\\" among its 700 entries.Farooq, Riba-Interest Equation and Islam, 2005: p.31 A former director of Pakistan Institute of Development Economics and the head of Pakistan's Economic Affairs Division, Syed Nawab Haider Naqvi, also called for \\"comprehensive Islamic reform to establish an exploitation-free economic system\\" and not just \\"mechanical substitution of profit for interest.\\"Syed Nawab Haider NAQVI. Ethics and Economics: An Islamic Synthesis [U.K.: The Islamic Foundation, 1981], p.124 ;Zakat On the issue of zakat, one of the pillars of Islam, M.A.Khan also criticizes the conservatism of Islamic Economics, complaining that \\"the insistence of Muslim scholars in implementing it in the same form in which it was in vogue in the days of the Prophet and the first four caliphs ... has made it irrelevant to the needs of a contemporary society.\\"Khan, What Is Wrong with Islamic Economics?, 2013: p.xvi ;Practicality A supporter of Islamic economics (Asad Zaman) describes a \\"major difficulty\\" faced by Islamic reformers of Islamic economics and pointed out by other authors, namely that because a financial system is an \\"integrated and coherent structure\\", to create an Islamic system \\"based on trust, community and no interest\\" requires \\"changes and interventions on several different fronts simultaneously\\".

Behrman, and Robert Sherwood. However, she enjoyed one of the greatest critical successes of her career as Nina Leeds, the desperate heroine of Eugene O'Neill's controversial nine-act drama Strange Interlude. From the late 1920s on, Fontanne acted exclusively in vehicles also starring her husband. Among their greatest theater triumphs were Design for Living (1933), The Taming of the Shrew (1935‚Äì36), Idiot's Delight (1936), There Shall Be No Night (1940), and Quadrille (1952). Design for Living, which Coward wrote expressly for himself and the Lunts, was so risqu√©, with its theme of bisexuality and a m√©nage √† trois, that Coward premiered it in New York, knowing it would not survive the censor in London. The duo remained active onstage until retiring from stage performances in 1958. Fontanne was nominated for a Tony Award for one of her last stage roles, in The Visit (1959). Fontanne and Lunt worked together in 27 productions. Of her acting style with Lunt, British broadcasting personality Arthur Marshall - having seen her in Caprice St James's Theatre (1929) - observed: \\"In the plays of the period, actors waited to speak until somebody else had finished; the Lunts turned all that upside down. They threw away lines, they trod on each others words, they gabbled, they spoke at the same time. They spoke, in fact, as people do in ordinary life.\\"Marshall, Arthur. Life's Rich Pageant, BBC Radio Collection, 1988. Fontanne made only four films but nevertheless was nominated for the Academy Award for Best Actress in 1931 for The Guardsman, losing to Helen Hayes. She also appeared in the silent films Second Youth (1924) and The Man Who Found Himself (1925). She and husband Alfred also were in Hollywood Canteen (1944) in which they had cameos as themselves. The Lunts starred in four television productions in the 1950s and 1960s with both Lunt and Fontanne winning Emmy Awards in 1965 for The Magnificent Yankee, Fontanne narrated the 1960 television production of Peter Pan starring Mary Martin and received a second Emmy nomination for playing Grand Duchess Marie in the Hallmark Hall of Fame telecast of Anastasia in 1967, two of the few productions in which she appeared without her husband. The Lunts also starred in several radio dramas in the 1940s, notably on the Theatre Guild programme. Many of these broadcasts still survive. On 5 May 1958, the former Globe Theatre, at Broadway and 46th Street, originally opened in 1910 and later turned into a motion picture venue after the Stock Market Crash of 1929, was reopened after a massive gut renovation and renamed the Lunt-Fontanne Theatre. On that day the Lunts opened their new house with, The Visit, by D√ºrrenmatt. After 189 performances, The Visit would be their last appearance on Broadway. Twenty years later, on 5 May 1978, Lynn Fontanne, aged ninety, was honored at the Lunt-Fontanne Theater, during a revival performance of Hello, Dolly!, by its star Carol Channing. A reminiscence of that evening, \\"An Evening with Lynn Fontanne\\", was published on-line by Martha Rofheart, a former prot√©g√©e of Fontanne. In 1964, Lunt and Fontanne were presented with the Presidential Medal of Freedom by then-President Lyndon Johnson. Like Lunt, Fontanne was a member of the American Theatre Hall of Fame. Fontanne was also a Kennedy Center honoree in 1980.

It is the westernmost continental district of Hong Kong. It had a population of 487,546 in 2011. Part of the district is the Tuen Mun New Town (or simply Tuen Mun), which contains one of the largest residential areas in the New Territories. History =Etymology= Tuen Mun, (), rumoured as the short for , literally mean the door to garrison. Other interpretation of the name includes means opening of the water route. The District was named after the area. =Before the establishment of the District= According to the Old history book of Tang dynasty (), and the New history book of Tang dynasty () Tuen Mun was a major trading port, and there were garrison as early as the Tang dynasty (A.D. 618‚Äì907). The geo features that described by the historical literature, matching the modern day Tuen Mun. However, some scholar also dispute the interpretation of the location of Tuen Mun. They suggests the historic Tuen Mun may refer to the Nantou in the modern day Shenzhen (historically the residual part of the Xin'an County) instead. Another scholar, Lau Chi-pang, rebutted their interpretation in his article. The area around Tuen Mun, excluding Tai Lam and Lung Kwu Tan, was placed under Yuen Long yeuk () soon after the signing of the Convention for the Extension of Hong Kong Territory in 1898. The Convention leased the New Territories and New Kowloon to the British Empire as an extension of the Colony of Hong Kong. Before the lease, Tuen Man was part of the Xin'an County. In the Xin'an Xianzhi (literally Gazetteer of the Xin'an County) Kangxi edition, Tuen Mun village was under the administration of Wu-dou (). Also under Wu-dou, were Kam Tin, Ping Shan, Yuen Long and Shek Kong. They were areas of the modern day Yuen Long District. Soon after, the District Office North (Northern District, not to be confused with modern day the Northern District) was established to administer the New Territories including Tuen Mun. After WWII, the Yuen Long District Office was spin-off from the District Office North. Tuen Mun and its surrounding area were administratively part of Yuen Long District Office until 1974. (some author stated Tuen Mun (branch-)office \\"established after 1969\\") Meanwhile, originally named Castle Peak New Town when planning, the new town of the area was finally named Tuen Mun New Town, adopting the historic name of the region in 1972. The new town was built on reclaimed land from the Castle Peak Bay, as well as levelled hillside areas, starting from the 1960s. =Establishment to present= In 1974, Tuen Mun District Office, part of the New Territories Administration, was established. In 1982, the Tuen Mun District Council (at first known as Tuen Mun District Board) was established as part of the political reform of the district-level government. Tourist attractions =Tuen Mun Town Centre= Tuen Mun Town Centre is the focal point of the district. It features a range of cultural and entertainment facilities and several government buildings, including Tuen Mun Town Plaza, Tuen Mun Cultural Square, Tuen Mun Town Hall, Tuen Mun Public Library, Tuen Mun Park, Tuen Mun Law Courts, Tuen Mun Central Post Office and Tuen Mun Government Offices. =Lung Kwu Tan= Lung Kwu Tan Village has a history of a few hundred years. It is located at the southwest of Castle Peak and consists of Lung Kwu Tan and Lung Kwu Sheung Tan. It is said that Emperor Bing of Song went down the south as far as to Lung Kwu Tan when he fled from the invading Mongols. There is a cave at Lung Kwu Tan later known as the Emperor's Cave, which is presumably where Emperor Bing took refuge during his stay. Other famous spots include the Tin Hau Temple and the Bogy's Rock. While Lung Kwu Tan is place of primitive simplicity, the opening of privately run barbecue sites have always drawn crowds of holidaymakers. =Dragon Boat Racing= Every year at Tuen Ng Festival (), which is the 5th day of the fifth lunar month, there is dragon boat racing at Castle Peak Bay. The venue is one of the several places where this international cultural and sports event takes place. Every year many people from different companies or organisations join the exciting competition. The event also attracts crowds to watch the exciting race. =Reptile House= Located in Tuen Mun Park, the Reptile House is home to 29 species of reptiles. It opened in 1999 and is operated by the Leisure and Cultural Services Department. =Tsing Chuen Wai= Tsing Chuen Wai is situated in the northern part of Tuen Mun near Lam Tei Tsuen. Tsing Chuen Wai used to be known as Mak Yuen Wai (i.e. Wheat Field Walled Village). Its present name came from the fact that the village was surrounded by its protective walls made of green bricks. Tsing Chuen Wai is mainly populated by the To Clan. The Tin Hau Temple and the Ancestral Hall in the village are of great historical value. The only surviving portion of the original green-brick boundary wall at the main entrance of the Wai gives visitors an insight into the walled village's precious outlook, which makes an interesting contrast with the newly constructed archway. =Tuen Mun Public Riding School= Opened in 1994, Tuen Mun Public Riding School is located at Lung Mun Road and adjacent to Tuen Mun Ferry Pier. The School, which occupies an area of 3.58 hectares, is the largest public riding school in Hong Kong. The Hong Kong Jockey Club, which contributed $50 million for the construction of the School, is also the management agent. The School is well equipped with three paddocks for riding practice, covering a total area of 8,150 square metres. Apart from riding training, the school organises activities for families.

Its full facilities comprises a world-class resort hotel, a convention centre, a shopping mall, a marina club, the well-known Golden Beach and the newly constructed Hong Kong Gold Coast Dolphin Square. The Golden Beach is located at 18.5 Miles, Castle Peak Road, adjacent to the Cafeteria New Beach. It is the largest public beach in Tuen Mun and the first artificial beach in Hong Kong. The 545-metre long beach has a total area of 7.85 hectares. Tropical trees, like coconut, and flowers of various species are planted on both sides of a 480-metre long promenade running parallel to it. The design of the snack kiosks and the changing rooms strike a natural harmony with that of the hotel and the shopping mall. Hong Kong Gold Coast sits close to Castle Peak Bay. The complex in European style replicates the Mediterranean Sentiment. Watching the sunset at an open caf√© on the palm-lined seashore can be an infinite source of artistic inspirations and creativity. The leisurely and artistic environment makes Hong Kong Gold Coast another Montmartre for Western culture lovers to share their artistic passions by a fine display of art craft. Opened since July 1995, the Gold Coast Montmartre is the first arena of its kind in Hong Kong for street art and culture. The Art Promenade, located at the seashore outside the Marina Magic Shopping Mall, is an ideal showcase for amateur artists to present their talent in handicrafts such as monochrome drawing, cartoon figure drawing, ornament design, ceramics, rice art, model making, stained sand, colour dyeing, etc. Performances like Western verse recital, live bands and classical music are put on at the Cultural Square, which provides an open stage for both the professionals and the amateurs. =Hung Lau= Hung Lau is located in Chung Shan Park at Lung Mun Road and adjacent to Castle Peak Farm. Hung Lau faces southeast with Pui To Peak at its back, overlooking the sea off Tuen Mun and facing Lantau Island further across it. The area near the present Butterfly Estate was uninhabited in the late Qing Dynasty and was accessible by water transport only. Legends leave it that Hung Lau became a base for the revolutionaries of the Revive China Society. It was said that secret meetings convened by Dr. Sun Yat-sen and other revolutionaries for planning the Huang Hua-Gang Uprising and the Huizhou Uprising took place at Hung Lau. It was also where they took oath and got their ammunition and food supplies. Thus, Hung Lau has been of great significance to the Nationalist Revolution. A monument to Dr. Sun, a bust of him, a reproduction of his will and a gomuti palm tree planted by the revolutionary martyrs can also be found in Chung Shan Park. =Tuen Mun Golf Centre= The Tuen Mun Golf Centre, located at Lung Mun Road, is the first public golf driving range in Hong Kong.

Places of worship =Ching Leung Nunnery= Situated at Fu Tei, Ching Leung Nunnery was built more than a hundred years ago during the reign of Guang Xu of the Qing Dynasty. Lying in its serenity, the Nunnery was initially known as the Garden of Sweet-scented Osmanthus because this species was seen almost everywhere in the area. It was later renamed Ching Leung Nunnery. The Nunnery is famous for its quality vegetarian food. Coupled also with a tearoom, it is a must-go for gourmet visitors to savour vegetarian meals and Chinese tea. Besides the pavilions and ponds commonly found in most Buddhist retreats and monasteries, there is also a rubbing of the Sixteen Arhats hanging in the worship hall. It is a rubbing of the stone carving that Emperor Qian Long of the Qing Dynasty found himself enjoying during his visit to the Sheng Yin Temple in Hangzhou. Take LRT route No. 610, 614, 615 or 715 and alight at Lam Tei Stop, or KMB route No. 53, 63X, 68A, 258P, or 960P, or minibus running between Jordan and Yuen Long. =Tsing Shan Monastery= The Tsing Shan Monastery nestles at the foot of Castle Peak. There are the Pui To Cave, Tsing Wan Koon and Tsing Shan Temple. These historical monuments, characterised by their simplicity and solemnity, have stood through the ages on the wooded hill in the secluded and scenic surroundings. Upon entering the Monastery, visitors will see the Chinese characters \\"È¶ôÊµ∑ÂêçÂ±±\\" (Fragrant Sea and Prestigious Hill) engraved on the archway. It is an inscription by the then Governor Sir Cecil Clementi. On the other side of the archway are the characters \\"ÂõûÈ†≠ÊòØÂ≤∏\\" (Turn Back and There is the Shore, meaning Repentance is Salvation), an inscription by Master Tit Xim. Both the surroundings and the inscriptions naturally inspire nostalgic thoughts of the Monastery's unique past. Originating from Shiwan, the ridge tile of the archway is an exquisite art. Legend has it that an accomplished Indian Buddhist monk who liked roaming around in a big wooden cup eventually came to Castle Peak. Attracted by the favourable environment for spiritual nurturing, he built a cottage there for practising his religion. Since then, the name of Master Pui To (meaning Traveling in a Cup) has become widely known. In memory of him, his followers made an altar out of a flat rock inside the Cave, and behind the altar a statue of him. However, other legends say the Pui To Cave was built in the Jin Dynasty and redeveloped in the Song Dynasty. Subsequent maintenance from time to time managed to preserve the relic to this day. Adjacent to the Mahavira Hall is Ching Wan Koon, which is dedicated to Dou Lao, a goddess who is believed to be able to free people from their worries. Tsing Shan Temple is the leading one among the three major ancient temples in Hong Kong. There is the Mahavira Hall in the Temple. Up on the stone steps leading to the Hall are inscribed \\"‰∏ÄÂàáÊúâÊÉÖ„ÄÅÂêåÁôªË¶∫Âú∞\\" (Let All Sentiment Beings Reach Nirvana Together), which speaks of the appealing Buddhist way of ultimate rest. Take LRT route No. 610 or 615 and alight at Tsing Shan Tsuen Stop. Then walk along the Tsing Shan Monastery Path for about 30 minutes, or take KMB route No. 57M, 66X, or MTR bus No. 506. =Ching Chung Koon= Ching Chung Koon is another tourist attraction in Tuen Mun. It is a Taoist temple originally opened as a rural retreat in 1949. This peaceful temple also contains many treasures, such as lanterns from Beijing's Imperial Palace. The temple is divided into several houses where many dead peoples' bone ash are permanently stored in special apartments with their picture, name, date of birth, date of death and his or her origin. During Ching Ming Festival and Chung Yeung Festival, many people go there to reminisce and respect their deceased friends or relatives. To get to Ching Chung Koon, we can take LRT route no. 615P, 615 or 610 from Siu Hong Station and then get off the train in Tsing Shan Tsuen LRT Station. =Miu Fat Buddhist Monastery= Miu Fat Buddhist Monastery (left) in Lam Tei Based on the principle of practising mercy, Miu Fat Buddhist Monastery, in Lam Tei, has been actively organising activities to promote Buddhism as well as education, culture, charity and welfare for years. The Miu Fat Buddhist Monastery was first constructed in 1950. Over the following two decades came the construction of the 3-storey Ten Thousand Buddhas Hall at a cost of $60 million. It took six years to complete, with its consecration ceremony held in May 1980. The Mahavira Hall, located on the top storey, has a floor height of about 20 metres. In the middle of the Hall, there are three gold-plated statues of the Buddha Sakyamuni, each of them is about 5 metres tall. Its interior walls are adorned with over 10 thousands of Buddha reliefs and a number of murals featuring a blend of Sino- Thai cultures, which are so magnificent and eye-catching. Higher up in the Hall are the Library of Buddhist Scriptures and the Attic of the Jade Buddha. On each side of the main entrance of the Hall is a 20-metre column carved with a dazzling lifelike giant gold-scaled dragon, making the building prominently imposing. The Monastery also has a kitchen serving mouthwatering vegetarian food for visitors. Adjoining the existing Ten Thousand Buddha Pagoda, the 45-metre-high and 7-storey main complex of Miu Fat Buddhist Monastery has been built since 1999. It comprises a Buddhist shrine, a community hall, a library and cultural/welfare facilities. The complex is meticulously designed with Lotus Shrine on the top floor resembling a gigantic crystal lotus blossom viewed from afar. A ceremony was held in mid-March in 2010 to mark the completion of this electricity-saving and trendy Shrine. The lookout of the Shrine overlooks the landscape of Tuen Mun rural area. =Hau Kok Tin Hau Temple= Hau Kok Tin Hau Temple is located in Tin Hau Road, next to Tuen Mun Station on West Rail Line. Being a hub of waterway transport, Tuen Mun attracted fishermen communities in ancient times. The fishermen wished to enjoy the protection and blessings of the heavenly goddess Tin Hau and built a temple at Hau Kok in Kau Hui to worship her and pray for safety. During the Ming Dynasty, the To clansmen, who were engaged in the salt business, migrated to Tuen Mun. They developed close ties with local fishermen and worked together for the expansion of the Temple. People living in the walled villages also helped in financing its renovation on a number of occasions. The Temple has always been well patronised by worshippers. During the Tin Hau Festival (i.e. the 23rd day of the third month in the Chinese calendar) every year, villagers and fishermen hold a series of celebrations in the open space in front of the temple. They pray for prosperity and peace by staging thanksgiving opera performances as well as dragon and lion dances. Every year, Lunar New Year fair will be organised in the square in front of Tin Hau Temple. Besides, it is also a place for earthen pot gathering.

The picture stars Katharine Hepburn, Douglas Fairbanks Jr., and Adolphe Menjou, was adapted by Howard J. Green from a then-unproduced stage play of the same nameAFI Catalog of Feature Films: Morning Glory Linked 2013-11-02 by Zo√´ Akins, and was directed by Lowell Sherman. Hepburn won her first Academy Award for Best Actress for this movie. Morning Glory was remade in 1958 under the title Stage Struck. Plot Eva Lovelace (Katharine Hepburn) is a performer from a small town who has dreamed since childhood of making it big on Broadway. She has evidently gone to many auditions, but no one has given her a break. At the management office of the Easton Theatre, where she hopes to land a role, another actress, current star Rita Vernon (Mary Duncan), breezes in to see the handsome middle-aged theater owner and producer, Louis Easton (Adolphe Menjou), a consummate businessman who is well aware of his prestige in the theater world. Blonde diva Rita is high-handed and self-absorbed, with an alcohol problem as well, but she's under verbal contract to Easton. She shamelessly flirts as she negotiates a deal; she'll accept a small role (which she doesn't want) in the upcoming play, for one big concession: her pick of roles in the next production. The principals are taking a risk that she'll contain her artistic temperament and lay off the bottle. Even so, her name and fame will help launch the play, a new comedy by Joseph Sheridan (Douglas Fairbanks Jr.) Meanwhile, as she waits to see if she'll get a chance to talk to Easton, Eva meets and impresses Robert Hedges (C. Aubrey Smith), an experienced character actor also under contract to Easton. Delighted with her childlike ebullience, Hedges agrees to help her. He takes Eva into the office and introduces her as his protegee. Sheridan, there to cast his upcoming comedy production, is also immediately struck by Eva's vivacious and eccentric personality, A non-stop talker, Eva bubbles over with intensity about her small town bourgeois background and her belief in non- conformity and self-realization. She declares that after a long and successful career, she'll kill herself onstage as a dramatic farewell to her fans. Joseph is entranced, but the aristocratic Easton sees her as too young and inexperienced, even somewhat crazy. Months pass. Hedges has lost touch with Eva. She frequently moves due to poor finances and hasn't been cast in meaningful roles. Hedges finds her struggling and hungry. Eva expresses regret that Easton gave her a small role in one of his lesser plays, one which flopped. She bravely declares she won't take any more offers, unless the role truly suits her abilities. Realizing she's broke and basically starving, Hodges escorts her to a celebrity party at Easton's apartment. Eva quickly downs two glasses of champagne, although she's not a drinker. Inebriated, Eva sits on the arm of Easton's chair, stroking his face and vowing to prove her dramatic talents to him. She makes a spectacle of herself before the bemused party guests. Then unexpectedly she gives two Shakespearean orations, Hamlet's well-known monologue (\\"to be or not to be\\") followed by Juliet's balcony scene. The difference in the roles demonstrates her art; she gets a polite ovation from the guests and further impresses Sheridan. Eva lays her head on Easton's lap and promptly falls asleep. His butler put her to bed in his own bedroom. The next morning, Easton asks Sheridan for help. Easton gave in to temptation and explains the encounter through innuendo. He's remorseful at taking advantage of a girl's innocence and can't face her. Joseph is devastated to learn that the overnight guest was Eva. Easton apologizes and leaves. A radiant Eva comes downstairs and sees Joseph, whom she regards as \\"just a friend.\\" Happily she tells him everything. To her, the night with Easton is the beginning of a long commitment. Joseph can't bring himself to break her heart. He lets her go without explaining. More months pass. Eva has tried numerous times to see Easton. Unwilling to face her, Easton has simply ignored her. Joseph keeps his own love a secret. Easton's theater company is ready to showcase Joseph's dramatic masterpiece. The play will star Rita Vernon. Joseph approves of her performance in rehearsals. Backstage on opening night, Rita calls Easton into her dressing room. Heretofore she and Easton have had only verbal agreements. Aware of the power she holds at this late hour, Rita now has outrageous demands. She wants a written contract with a huge salary increase and half the profits from the entire run of the play. Otherwise, she won't go onstage. Easton thinks he has no choice but to comply. Joseph draws him aside. He urges Easton to let Rita go. Instead, they can bring in a special understudy, one he's kept secret until this very moment. She is now revealed as Eva Lovelace. Easton reluctantly agrees and Rita storms off the set. Eva and Joseph end up together in the star's dressing room. Faced with this sudden opportunity, Eva seems overcome with doubt and fear. She can't perform with Easton in the audience; they haven't spoken since their night together. She feels unsure of her talents and feels doomed to failure. Joseph reassures her that she can handle whatever is thrown at her. She's strong and beautiful, a born actress who can now prove it. Eva rallies, gathers her self-confidence, and resolves to conquer the role. As Joseph predicted, Eva is a complete success. Backstage, Easton reconciles with Eva, offering her his professional friendship and aid. When he goes, Joseph gathers the courage to declare his love for Eva. Unsure of everything, Eva hushes him and makes him leave. Now she's there with only her dresser, an elegant elderly lady who was herself once a brief star or \\"morning glory.\\" The dresser comforts Eva, assuring her that she has the talent to succeed in show business and life; but really only one thing matters, true love. She knows that because she once spurned the love she was offered, choosing fame instead, at the beginning of her all too brief career. Renewed, Eva readies herself to forge down the rocky road to stardom ahead of her. The film ends with some uncertainty, but on an upbeat note. Once again self-confident, dramatic to the heart, Eva declares to her dresser, \\"I'm not afraid...to be a morning glory. I am not afraid!\\" Main cast Lobby card *Katharine Hepburn as Eva Lovelace *Douglas Fairbanks Jr. as Joseph Sheridan *Adolphe Menjou as Louis Easton *Mary Duncan as Rita Vernon *C.

However, when newcomer Katharine Hepburn read the script, she convinced producer Pandro S. Berman that she was born to play the part, and she was given the role over the more popular Bennett, who was thereupon reassigned to Bed of Roses (1933). When RKO bought the rights to the play from Zo√´ Akins, it still hadn't been produced on stage. It eventually saw a limited stage run in 1939. The director Lowell Sherman managed to get the RKO bosses to agree that he was given a week of rehearsal with the actors before the shooting began, in return for promising a shooting schedule of only 18 days (April 21 - May 12, 1933). Unlike most feature films, Morning Glory was shot in the same sequence as the script. Katharine Hepburn was paid $2,500 per week for her work on the picture, for which she eventually won her first Academy Award for Best Actress. Reception After cinema circuits deducted their exhibition share of boxoffice ticket sales this production earned a profit of $115,000. Radio adaptation In October, 1942, Lux Radio Theatre broadcast a radio adaptation of the film, starring Judy Garland as Eva Lovelace and Adolphe Menjou reprising his role of Louis Easton. Garland performed the song \\"I'll Remember April\\" on the broadcast. In 1949, a second radio adaptation was aired on the radio, this time with Elizabeth Taylor in the lead role of Eva Lovelace.

A major stage actress of the late 19th and early 20th century, Robson is best known today for the dozens of 1930s motion pictures she appeared in when she was well into her 70s, usually playing cross old women with hearts of gold. Robson was the earliest-born person to enjoy a major Hollywood career and receive an Academy Award nomination, which she got for her leading role in Lady for a Day in 1933. She was also the first Australian to be nominated for an Oscar. Early life Mary Jeanette Robison was born on 19 April 1858 in Moama, New South Wales, Australia, in what Robson described as \\"the Australian bush\\". She was the fourth child of Henry and Julia Robison; her siblings were Williams, James, and Adelaide. Henry Robison (1810‚Äì1860) was born in Penrith, Cumberland, England and lived in Liverpool. He served 24 years in the foreign trade of the British Merchant Navy as a mate and a sea captain. Robison retired at half-pay due to his poor health and traveled with Julia Robison to Melbourne, Victoria, Australia in 1853 on the SS Great Britain. By April 1855, Henry was a watchmaker, jeweller, silversmith and ornamental hairworker in Melbourne. According to Robson, her parents both suffered from phthisis pulmonalis, and moved to \\"the bush\\" for their heath. Henry bought a large brick mansion in Moama, New South Wales in August 1857 and opened the Prince of Wales Hotel. From there, he co-operated Robison and Stivens, coach proprietors for the Bendigo - Moama - Deniliquin service. The hotel was Robson's first home. Henry Robison died in Moama Maiden's Punt on 27 January 1860. On 19 November 1862, Julia married Walter Moore Miller, solicitor and mayor of Albury, New South Wales at St Paul's Cathedral, Melbourne. Julia, Walter, and the four children moved to Melbourne in 1866. Miller was a partner with De Courcy Ireland in the firm of Miller and Ireland in Melbourne in November 1867, and until 20 January 1870, when it was mutually dissolved. In 1870, the family moved to London. Robson attended Sacred Heart Convent School at Highgate, north London and studied languages in Brussels. She went to Paris for her examinations in French. According to her obituary, Robson was also educated in Australia. Marriages and children Robson ran away from home to marry her first husband, 18 year-old Charles Leveson Gore, in London. They were married on 1 November 1875 at the parish church in Camden Town, London. The couple traveled on the steamer SS Vaderland and arrived in New York on 17 May 1877. The Gores purchased 380 acres of land in Fort Worth, Texas where they built a house and established a cattle ranch. According to Jan Jones, \\"the Gores survived two years in their prairie manor house before homesickness, rural isolation, and repeated bouts of fever convinced them to sell and try their fortunes in the more settled east.\\" They moved to New York City with little money and Robson says that shortly after, Gore died. Robson produced crocheted hoods and embroidery, designed dinner cards, and taught painting to support her three children. By the time she began her acting career in 1883, two of Robson's three children had died due to illness. The surviving child was Edward Hyde Leveson Gore. Six years after beginning her stage career, Robson married Augustus Homer Brown, a police surgeon, on 29 May 1889. They remained together until his death on 1 April 1920. Robson's son, Edward Gore, was her business manager. Career May Robson in 1907 Warren William and May Robson in Lady for a Day (1933) A Star is Born (1937) May Robson in Four Daughters (1938) On 17 September 1883, she became an actress in Hoop of Gold at the Brooklyn Grand Opera House stage. Her name was incorrectly spelled \\"Robson\\" in the billing, which she used from that point forward \\"for good luck\\". Over the next several decades, she flourished on the stage as a comedian and character actress. Her success was partly due to her affiliation with powerful manager and producer Charles Frohman and the Theatrical Syndicate. She established her own touring theatrical company by 1911. She appeared as herself in a cameo in the 1915 silent film, How Molly Made Good. Robson starred in the 1916 silent film A Night Out, an adaptation of the play she co-wrote, The Three Lights. In 1927, Robson went to Hollywood where she had a successful film career as a senior aged woman. Among her starring roles was in The She-Wolf (1931) as a miserly millionaire businesswoman based on the real-life miser Hetty Green. She also starred in the final segment of the anthology film If I Had a Million (1932) as a rest home resident who gets a new lease on life when she is given a $1,000,000 check by a dying business tycoon. She played the Queen of Hearts in Alice in Wonderland (1933), Countess Vronsky in Anna Karenina (1935), Aunt Elizabeth in Bringing Up Baby (1938), Aunt Polly in The Adventures of Tom Sawyer (1938), and a sharp-tongued Granny in A Star Is Born (1937). Robson was top-billed as late as 1940, starring in Granny Get Your Gun at age 82. Her last film was 1942's Joan of Paris. Academy Award nomination In 1933, Robson was nominated for an Academy Award at age 75 in the Best Actress category for Lady for a Day but lost to Katharine Hepburn; both actresses later appeared in the Hepburn-Grant classic film, Bringing Up Baby (1938). Robson was the first Australian-born person to be nominated for an acting Oscar, and, for many years, she held the record as the oldest performer nominated for an Oscar. Death May Robson died in 1942 at her Beverly Hills, California home at age 84. In its obituary of Robson, the Nevada State Journal stated that Robson died of \\"a combination of ailments, aggravated by neuritis and advanced age.\\" Her remains were cremated and buried at the Flushing Cemetery in Queens, New York, next to her second husband, Augustus Brown. The New York Times obituary for Robson called her the \\"dowager queen of the American screen and stage\\".

The chain starts with God and progresses downward to angels, humans, animals, plants, and minerals. The Great Chain of Being (, \\"Ladder of Being\\") is a concept derived from Plato, Aristotle (in his Historia Animalium), Plotinus and Proclus. Further developed during the Middle Ages, it reached full expression in early modern Neoplatonism.\\"This idea of a great chain of being can be traced to Plato's division of the world into the Forms, which are full beings, and sensible things, which are imitations of the Forms and are both being and not being. Aristotle's teleology recognized a perfect being, and he also arranges all animals by a single natural scale according to the degree of perfection of their souls. The idea of the great chain of being was fully developed in Neoplatonism and in the Middle Ages.\\", Blackwell Dictionary of Western Philosophy, p. 289 (2004)Edward P. Mahoney, \\"Lovejoy and the Hierarchy of Being\\", Journal of the History of Ideas Vol. 48, No 2, pp. 211-230. Divisions The Chain of Being is a hierarchy, with God at the top, above angels, which like him are entirely in spirit form, without material bodies, and hence unchangeable. Beneath them are humans, consisting both of spirit and matter; they can change and die, and are thus essentially impermanent. Lower still are animals and plants. At the bottom are the mineral materials of the earth itself; they consist only of matter. Thus, the higher the being is in the chain, the more attributes it has, including all the attributes of the beings below it. The minerals are, in the medieval mind, a possible exception to the unchangeability of the material beings in the chain, as alchemy promised to turn lower elements like lead into those higher up the chain, like silver or gold. Subdivisions Orthodox Christian icon of nine orders of angels Each link in the chain might be divided further into its component parts. In medieval secular society, for example, the king is at the top, succeeded by the aristocratic lords and the clergy, and then the peasants below them. Solidifying the king's position at the top of humanity's social order is the doctrine of the divine right of kings. The implied permanent state of inequality became a source of popular grievance, and led eventually to political change as in the French Revolution. The hierarchy was visible in every structure of society: \\"In the family, the father is head of the household; below him, his wife; below her, their children.\\" Milton's Paradise Lost ranked the angels (c.f. Pseudo-Dionysius the Areopagite's ranking of angels), and Christian culture conceives of angels \\"in orders of archangels, seraphim, and cherubim, among others.\\" The animal division is similarly subdivided, from strong, wild, and untameable lions at the top, to useful but still spirited domestic animals like dogs and horses, to merely docile farm stock like sheep. In the same way, birds could be ranked from lordly eagles high above common birds like pigeons. Below them were fish, those with bones being above the various soft sea creatures. Lower still were insects, with useful ones like bees high above nuisances like flies and beetles. The snake found itself at the bottom of the animal scale, cast down, the medievals supposed, for its wicked role in the Garden of Eden.\\" Below animals came plants, ranging from the useful and strong oak at the top to the supposedly demonic yew tree at the bottom. Crop plants too were ranked from highest to lowest. which in turn cites \\"WK 2011\\" The minerals too were graded, from useful metals (from gold down to lead), to rocks (again, from useful marble downwards), all the way down to soil.  The Chain  St Thomas Aquinas classified all beings by rank. At its simplest, the chain of being runs God, Angels, Humans, Animals, Plants, Minerals. These links of the chain are described in more detail below. =God= God has created all other beings and is therefore outside creation, time, and space. He has all the spiritual attributes found in humans and angels, and uniquely has his own attributes of omnipotence, omniscience, and omnipresence. He is the model of perfection for all lower beings. =Angelic beings= In Christian angelology, angels are immortal beings of pure spirit without physical bodies, so they require temporary bodies made of earthly materials to be able to do anything in the material world. They were thought to have spiritual attributes such as reason, love, and imagination. Based on mentions of types of angel in the Bible, Pseudo-Dionysios devised a hierarchy of angelic beings, which other theologians like St. Thomas Aquinas adopted: * Seraphim (seraph is the primate, or superior type of angel) * Cherubim * Thrones (Ophanim) * Dominions * Virtues * Powers * Principalities * Archangels * Angels =Humanity= possibility of progress: Ramon Lull's Ladder of Ascent and Descent of the Mind, 1305 Humans uniquely shared spiritual attributes with God and the angels above them, like love and language, and physical attributes with the animals below them, like having material bodies that experienced emotions and sensations like lust and pain, and physical needs such as hunger and thirst. =Animals= Charles Bonnet's chain of being from Trait√© d'insectologie, 1745 Animals have senses, are able to move, and have physical appetites. The highest animals like the lion, the king of beasts, could move vigorously, and had powerful senses such as excellent eyesight and the ability to smell their prey, while lower animals might wriggle or crawl, and the lowest like oysters were sessile, attached to the sea-bed. All, however, had the senses of touch and taste. =Plants= Plants lacked sense organs and the ability to move, but they could grow and reproduce. The highest plants had attractive attributes like leaves and flowers, while the lowest plants, like mushrooms and moss, did not, and stayed low on the ground, close to the mineral earth. All the same, many plants had useful properties serving for food or medicine. =Minerals= At the bottom of the chain, minerals were unable to move, sense, grow, or reproduce. Their attributes were being solid and strong, while the gemstones possessed magic. The king of gems was the diamond. Natural science =From Aristotle to Linnaeus= The basic idea of a ranking of the world's organisms goes back to Aristotle's biology. In his History of Animals, where he ranked animals over plants based on their ability to move and sense, and graded the animals by their reproductive mode, live birth being \\"higher\\" than laying cold eggs, and possession of blood, warm-blooded mammals and birds again being \\"higher\\" than \\"bloodless\\" invertebrates. Aristotle's non-religious concept of higher and lower organisms was taken up by natural philosophers during the Scholastic period to form the basis of the Scala Naturae. The scala allowed for an ordering of beings, thus forming a basis for classification where each kind of mineral, plant and animal could be slotted into place. In medieval times, the great chain was seen as a God-given and unchangeable ordering. In the Northern Renaissance, the scientific focus shifted to biology; the threefold division of the chain below humans formed the basis for Carl Linnaeus's Systema Natur√¶ from 1737, where he divided the physical components of the world into the three familiar kingdoms of minerals, plants and animals. =In alchemy= Alchemy used the great chain as the basis for its cosmology. Since all beings were linked into a chain, so that there was a fundamental unity of all matter, transformation from one place in the chain to the next might, according to alchemical reasoning, be possible. In turn, the unit of matter enabled alchemy to make another key assumption, the philosopher's stone, which somehow gathered and concentrated the universal spirit found in all matter along the chain, and which ex hypothesi might enable the alchemical transformation of one substance to another, such as the base metal lead to the noble metal gold. =Scala naturae in evolution= recapitulating its phylogeny back to amoeba shown as a reinterpreted chain of being with living and fossil animals. From a critique of Ernst Haeckel's theories, 1873. The set nature of species, and thus the absoluteness of creatures' places in the great chain, came into question during the 18th century. The dual nature of the chain, divided yet united, had always allowed for seeing creation as essentially one continuous whole, with the potential for overlap between the links. Radical thinkers like Jean-Baptiste Lamarck saw a progression of life forms from the simplest creatures striving towards complexity and perfection, a schema accepted by zoologists like Henri de Blainville. The very idea of an ordering of organisms, even if supposedly fixed, laid the basis for the idea of transmutation of species, whether progressive goal-directed orthogenesis or Charles Darwin's undirected theory of evolution. The Chain of Being continued to be part of metaphysics in 19th century education, and the concept was well known. The geologist Charles Lyell used it as a metaphor in his 1851 Elements of Geology description of the geological column, where he used the term \\"missing links\\" in relation to missing parts of the continuum. The term \\"missing link\\" later came to signify transitional fossils, particularly those bridging the gulf between man and beasts. The idea of the great chain as well as the derived \\"missing link\\" was abandoned in early 20th century science, as the notion of modern animals representing ancestors of other modern animals was abandoned in biology. The idea of a certain sequence from \\"lower\\" to \\"higher\\" however lingers on, as does the idea of progress in biology. Politics Allenby and Garreau propose the Catholic Church's narrative of the Great Chain of Being kept the peace for centuries in Europe. The very concept of rebellion simply lay outside the reality within which most people lived for to defy the King was to defy God. King James I himself wrote, \\"The state of monarchy is the most supreme thing upon earth: for kings are not only God's Lieutenants upon earth, and sit upon God's throne, but even by God himself they are called Gods.\\" The Enlightenment broke this supposed divine plan and fought the last vestiges of feudal hierarchy by creating secular governmental structures that vested power into the hands of ordinary citizens rather than divinely ordained monarchs. However, scholars such as Brian Tierney and Michael Novak have noted the medieval contribution to democracy and human rights. Adaptations and similar concepts The American philosopher Ken Wilber described a \\"Great Nest of Being\\" which he claims to belong to a culture-independent \\"perennial philosophy\\" traceable across 3000 years of mystical and esoteric writings. Wilber's system corresponds with other concepts of transpersonal psychology. In his 1977 book A Guide for the Perplexed, the economist E. F. Schumacher described a hierarchy of beings, with humans at the top able mindfully to perceive the \\"eternal now\\". See also References Sources Further reading * Tillyard, E. M. W.

Life and career Born in Lewisham, South London, Wynyard began her career on the stage. After performing in Liverpool and London with the Liverpool Repertory Company and the Hamilton Deane Repertory Company, she performed on Broadway, appearing first in Rasputin and the Empress in 1932, with Ethel, John, and Lionel Barrymore. She appeared in the film version, beginning her brief Hollywood career. Fox Film Corporation then borrowed her for their lavish film version of No√´l Coward's stage spectacle Cavalcade (1933). As the noble wife and mother she aged gracefully against a background of the Boer War, the sinking of the Titanic, the First World War, and the arrival of the Jazz Age. With this performance, she became the first British actress to be nominated for the Academy Award for Best Actress. After a handful of film roles, including playing John Barrymore's old flame in Reunion in Vienna, she returned to Britain, but concentrated on theatre work, including roles as Charlotte Bront√´ in Clemence Dane's Wild Decembers, in Sweet Aloes, and as Gilda in the British premiere of No√´l Coward's Design for Living. She was tempted to return to the screen to play opposite Ralph Richardson in On the Night of the Fire (1939), a film directed by Brian Desmond Hurst. Her best remembered success was as the frightened heroine of Gaslight (1940), the first film version of Patrick Hamilton's play Gas Light. This was followed by roles opposite Clive Brook in Freedom Radio, John Gielgud in The Prime Minister and Michael Redgrave in Kipps (all 1941), directed by Carol Reed, later her first husband. After World War II Raymond Massey, Diana Wynyard (seated), Judith Evelyn, Mel Ferrer and Audrey Hepburn in Mayerling (1957 TV production) Her stage career flourished after the war, and as a Shakespearean leading lady at Stratford, in London's West End and on tour in Australia, she had her pick of star parts. Between 1948 and 1952, she played Portia, Gertrude, Lady Macbeth, Katherine the shrew, Desdemona, Katherine of Aragon, Hermione in The Winter's Tale, and Beatrice to Gielgud's Benedick in Much Ado About Nothing. In this production, she succeeded her friend Peggy Ashcroft. Wynyard stumbled off the rostrum during the sleepwalking scene in Macbeth in 1948. She fell 15 feet, but was able to continue. Throughout the 1940s and 1950s she also had success in the works of several contemporary writers, including the British production of Tennessee Williams's Camino Real. She appeared in Alexander Korda's version An Ideal Husband (1947), based on the Oscar Wilde play, but her remaining film appearances were in supporting roles. Usually maternal, these included Tom Brown's Schooldays (1951) and the secretive mother (of James Mason's character) in Island in the Sun (1957). She played Empress Elisabeth of Austria in Mayerling (1957), an early American television film which starred Audrey Hepburn. In 1958 she appeared in the West End in A Touch of the Sun by N.C. Hunter. She was appointed Commander of the Order of the British Empire (CBE) in 1953.Notice of CBE Personal life She was married to the English film director Carol Reed from 3 February 1943 until August 1947, and subsequently to a Hungarian physician, Tibor Csato. She died from renal disease in Holborn, Central London in 1964, aged 58, while rehearsing The Master Builder with Michael Redgrave and Maggie Smith as part of the new National Theatre Company.

While Moore's year of birth is often given as 1901, including on her gravestone, census records and other records confirm she was born in 1898.January 26, 1947) was an American operatic soprano and actress in musical theatre and film.Obituary Variety, January 29, 1947, page 48. She was nicknamed the \\"Tennessee Nightingale.\\" Her films helped to popularize opera by bringing it to a larger audience. She was nominated for the Academy Award for Best Actress for her performance in One Night of Love. In 1947, Moore died in a plane crash at the age of 48. She published an autobiography in 1944 titled You're Only Human Once. In 1953, a film about her life was released titled So This Is Love starring Kathryn Grayson. Early life Moore was born Mary Willie Grace Moore, the daughter of Tessa Jane (n√©e Stokely) and Richard Lawson Moore. She was born in the community of Slabtown (now considered part of Del Rio) in Cocke County, Tennessee. By the time she was two years old, her family had relocated to Knoxville, a move Moore later described as traumatic, as she found urban life distasteful at the time.Jack Neely, \\"Grace Under Pressure.\\" From the Shadow Side (Oak Ridge, Tenn.: Tellico Books, 2003), pp. 167‚Äì174. After several years in Knoxville, the family again relocated to Jellico, Tennessee, where Moore spent her adolescence. After high school in Jellico, she studied briefly at Ward-Belmont College in NashvilleZepp, George. Opera star trained at Ward- Belmont The Tennessean, April 26, 2006. before moving to Washington, D.C. and New York City to continue her musical training and begin her career. Her first paying job as a singer was at the Black Cat Cafe in Greenwich Village. Career =Musical theater= Grace Moore monument in Jellico, Tennessee. Grace Moore's first Broadway appearance was in 1920 in the musical Hitchy-Koo, by Jerome Kern. In 1922 and 1923 she appeared in the second and third of Irving Berlin's series of four Music Box Revues. In the 1923 edition she and John Steel introduced Berlin's song \\"What'll I Do\\". When Moore sang \\"An Orange Grove in California\\", orange blossom perfume was wafted through the theater.New World Records, Follies, Scandals & Other Diversions: From Ziegfeld to the Shuberts, New World NW 215, liner notes. In 1932 she appeared on Broadway in the short-lived operetta The DuBarry by Karl Mill√∂cker. =Opera= After training in France, Moore made her operatic debut at the Metropolitan Opera in New York City on February 7, 1928, singing the role of Mim√¨ in Giacomo Puccini's La boh√®me. She debuted at the Op√©ra-Comique in Paris on September 29, 1928 in the same role, which she also performed in a Royal Command Performance at Covent Garden in London on June 6, 1935. During her sixteen seasons with the Metropolitan Opera, she sang in several Italian and French operas as well as the title roles in Tosca, Manon, and Louise. Louise was her favorite opera and is widely considered to have been her greatest role. In the 1930s and 1940s she gave concert performances throughout the United States and Europe, performing a repertoire of operatic selections and other songs in German, French, Italian, Spanish, and English. During World War II, she was active in the USO, entertaining American troops abroad.Frank H. McClung Museum, . University of Tennessee, Knoxville. In 1945 she sang Mimi to Nino Martini's Rodolfo in La boh√®me for the inaugural performance of the San Antonio Grand Opera Festival. She also performed during and after WWII in support of Allied Forces. From the personal memoire of Lt. Gen. John C. H. Lee, on 24 July 1945: \\"After an early dinner drove in convoy to the Paris Opera House for the gala performance entitled \\"Pacifique 45\\" given by the French for the benefit of the families of French war veterans. The program laid particular emphasis on the war in Japan and included the showing of two films - \\"Fighting Lady\\" and \\"Iwo Jima\\" and the rendition of several songs and the French and American national anthems by Grace Moore. Seated in the box of honor were General Alphonse Juin, the French Minister of Information Jacques Soustelle, and a number of important American and French officers. It seemed to be a great success and was particularly appreciated by the crowd of some 20,000 gathered in the square outside the Opera House.\\" =Film= Historical marker noting Moore's birthplace in Del Rio, Tennessee Attracted to Hollywood in the early years of talking pictures, Moore had her first screen role as Jenny Lind in the 1930 film A Lady's Morals, produced for MGM by Irving Thalberg and directed by Sidney Franklin.New York Times, \\"A Lady's Morals a.k.a Jenny Lind\\" and Mordant Hall, \\"The Swedish Nightingale \\", New York Times, November 8, 1930. Later that same year she starred with the Metropolitan Opera singer Lawrence Tibbett in New Moon, also produced by MGM, the first screen version of Sigmund Romberg's operetta The New Moon. After a hiatus of several years, Moore returned to Hollywood under contract to Columbia Pictures, for whom she made six films. In the 1934 film One Night of Love, her first film for Columbia, she portrayed a small-town girl who aspires to sing opera. For that role she was nominated for the Academy Award for Best Actress in 1935. She starred in 1936 as Empress Elisabeth of Austria in Josef von Sternberg's production The King Steps Out. By this time, she was so popular that MGM was able to insist on equal billing for Moore in a projected film with Maurice Chevalier, who had always enjoyed solo star billing up until then. Chevalier felt so deeply about this blow to his status that he quit Hollywood and the film was never made.With Love, the Autobiography of Maurice Chevalier (Cassell, 1960), P214. A memorable highlight of When You're in Love (1937) was a comic scene in which Moore donned flannel shirt and trousers and joined a 5-man band for a flamboyant rendition of Cab Calloway's \\"Minnie the Moocher\\", complete with gestures and \\"hi-de-ho's\\", but with the lyrics slightly altered to conform with Hollywood sensibilities.Frank S. Nugent, \\"'When You're in Love' Opens at the Music Hall\\", New York Times, February 19, 1937. Also, she performed the popular Madama Butterfly duet \\"Vogliatemi bene\\" with American tenor Frank Forest in the 1937 film I'll Take Romance. The last film that Moore made was Louise (1939), an abridged version of Gustave Charpentier's opera of the same name, with spoken dialog in place of some of the original opera's music. The composer participated in the production, authorizing the cuts and changes to the libretto, coaching Moore, and advising director Abel Gance. This production also featured two renowned French singers: dramatic tenor Georges Thill and basse cantante Andr√© Pernet.Bel Canto Society, Controversies She was widely criticized in December 1938 when she curtsied to the Duchess of Windsor, in Cannes. Upon her return to the United States after six months and ten days in Europe (\\"to save money in income tax\\"), Moore defended her curtsy, saying: > She would have been a royal duchess long ago if she had not been an > American. After all, she gave happiness and the courage of his convictions > to one man, which is more than most women can do. She deserves a curtsy for > that alone.\\"People.\\" Time. January 16, 1939. According to Joe Laurie Jr., vaudeville performer and historian, Grace Moore would not perform on vaudeville bills that had black performers. Honors In 1935 Moore received the gold medal award of the Society of Arts and Sciences for \\"conspicuous achievement in raising the standard of cinema entertainment.\\" In 1936 King Christian X of Denmark awarded her his country's medal of 'Ingenito et Arti.' In 1937, she was commissioned as a colonel (an honorary position) on the staff of the governor of Tennessee, and was also made a life member of the Tennessee State Society of Washington, D.C. She was decorated as a chevalier of the French L√©gion d'honneur in 1939. Moore was also a member of the Peabody Awards Board of Jurors from 1940 to 1942. Personal life Moore married Valent√≠n Parera, a Spanish movie actor, in Cannes, on July 15, 1931. They had no children. During the 1930s they maintained homes in Hollywood, Cannes, and Connecticut. Death Grace Moore died in a plane crash near Copenhagen's airport on January 26, 1947, at the age of 48. Among the other plane crash victims was Prince Gustaf Adolf of Sweden, who was at the time second in line to the Swedish throne and who was the father of the present King of Sweden, King Carl XVI Gustaf. Moore is buried in Forest Hills Cemetery in Chattanooga. A collection of Moore's papers is housed at the University of Tennessee in Knoxville.

He has worked in jazz, free improvisation, minimalism, historicism, avant-garde, and experimental music. Early life and career Born in Goole, in East Yorkshire, England, Bryars studied philosophy at Sheffield University but became a jazz bassist during his three years as a philosophy student. The first musical work for which he is remembered was his role as bassist in the trio Joseph Holbrooke, alongside guitarist Derek Bailey and drummer Tony Oxley. The trio began by playing relatively traditional jazz- the trio toured with saxophonist Lee Konitz in 1966 - before moving into free improvisation. Bryars became dissatisfied with this when he saw a young bassist (later revealed to be Johnny Dyani) play in a manner that seemed to him to be artificial, and he abandoned improvisation, becoming interested in composition instead. In 1998 the trio reformed briefly, giving two live performances and making recordings. Bryars's first compositions owe much to the New York School of John Cage (with whom he briefly studied), Morton Feldman, Earle Brown and minimalism. One of his earliest pieces, The Sinking of the Titanic (1969), is an indeterminist work that allows the performers to take a number of sound sources related to the sinking of the RMS Titanic and make them into a piece of music. The first recording of this piece appeared on Brian Eno's Obscure Records in 1975. The 1994 recording was remixed by Aphex Twin as Raising the Titanic (later collected on the 26 Mixes for Cash album). In 2012, the centenary of the Titanic's sinking, he made a new extended version, with film projections by Bill Morrison and Laurie Olinder, that included his four children as a low- string ensemble (viola, 2 cellos, bass) and turntablist Philip Jeck, subsequently released on GB records (BCGBCD21) A well-known early work is Jesus' Blood Never Failed Me Yet (1971), which has as its basis a recorded loop of a vagrant singing a musical fragment that the old man had improvised. On top of that loop, rich harmonies played by a live ensemble are built, always increasing in density, before the whole thing gradually fades out. A new recording of this work was made in 1993 with Tom Waits singing along with the original recording of the vagrant during the final section. Bryars was a founding member of the Portsmouth Sinfonia, an orchestra whose membership consisted of performers who \\"embrace the full range of musical competence\\" ‚Äî and who played popular classical works. Its members included Brian Eno, whose Obscure Records label would subsequently release works by Bryars. In one of the label's first three releases, Eno's album Discreet Music, Bryars conducted and co-arranged Three Variations on the Canon in D Major by Johann Pachelbel, which constitutes the second half of the album. Bryars's later works have included A Man In A Room, Gambling (1992), which was written on commission from Artangel. Bryars's music is heard beneath monologues spoken by the Spanish artist Juan Mu√±oz, who talks about methods of cheating at card games. The ten short works were played on BBC Radio 3 without any introductory announcements, and Bryars has said that he hoped they would appear to the listener in a similar way to the shipping forecast, both mysterious and accepted without question. His cello concerto Farewell to Philosophy was recorded in 1996 by Julian Lloyd Webber. Bryars has written many other works, including five operas, and many instrumental pieces, among them four string quartets and several concertos. He has written several pieces for dance, including Biped (1999) for Merce Cunningham, as well as works for William Forsythe, Carolyn Carlson, Edouard Lock and David Dawson. In 1981‚Äì84 Bryars participated in the CIVIL warS, a vast, never-completed multimedia project by Robert Wilson, who also directed his first opera, Medea. He has also written a large body of vocal and choral music for groups such as the Hilliard Ensemble, the Latvian Radio Choir, the Estonian National Men's Choir, Red Byrd, Trio Mediaeval, Singer Pur, and The Crossing, whose recording of \\"The Fifth Century\\" won a Grammy in 2019. He has written a great deal for early music performers including six books of madrigals, several works for viol consort and a collection of 54 \\"laude\\" based on a 12th century manuscript. Bryars' When Harry Met Addie (a tribute to jazz singer Adelaide Hall and saxophonist Harry Carney) was premiered at the Duke Ellington Memorial Concert at the Queen Elizabeth Hall, London, on 1 May 1999. The piece was performed by the London Sinfonietta Big BandFordham, John, \\"Ellington Now\\", The Guardian, 4 May 1999. and commissioned by the baritone saxophonist/bass clarinettist John Surman. Cristina Zavalloni sang the soprano and the London Sinfonietta Big Band was conducted by Diego Masson¬∑ Bryars founded the music department at Leicester Polytechnic (now De Montfort University), and was Professor of Music there for several years. He left in 1994 to concentrate on composition and performance. He lives in England, and, for part of the year, on the west coast of Canada. Since 1986 Bryars has run The Gavin Bryars Ensemble with his preferred musicians, consisting chiefly of low strings. Now, in addition, this regularly includes his children (2 cellos, piano and double bass) He was born on the same day (16 January 1943) as another prominent English composer, Brian Ferneyhough. In his June 2008 appearance on Desert Island Discs author Peter Carey chose Jesus' Blood Never Failed Me Yet as his eighth and final record. Since 1974 Bryars has been a member of the Coll√®ge de 'Pataphysique and was elected Regent in 2001. In 2015 he was named Transcendent Satrap, the highest honour in the Coll√®ge, a position he shares with Marcel Duchamp, Man Ray, Eug√®ne Ionesco, Umberto Eco, and others. Personal life Bryars is married to Anna Tchernakova, a Russian filmmaker, and has a stepdaughter and son. Bryars has two daughters from his first marriage.

Green and starring Bette Davis in her first Oscar-winning role. The screenplay by Laird Doyle is based on his story Hard Luck Dame. Plot synopsis Don Bellows (Franchot Tone), a prominent architect, is engaged to the beautiful and wealthy Gail Armitage (Margaret Lindsay) when he meets down- and-out Joyce Heath (Bette Davis), who was once the most promising young actress on Broadway. Don feels deeply indebted to Joyce because her performance as Juliet inspired him to become an architect. While rehabilitating her, Don falls in love with the tempestuous actress. Joyce, convinced she destroys anything and anyone she touches, warns him she is a jinx. Compelled to save her, Don breaks his engagement to Gail and risks his fortune to back the actress in a Broadway show. Before opening night, he insists they marry, but Joyce resists his proposal, hiding the fact she is married to Gordon Heath (John Eldredge), an ineffectual but devoted man who was financially ruined by their marriage. Joyce goes to Gordon and begs him for a divorce. When he refuses, she causes an automobile accident that cripples him for life. Her own injuries keep her from opening in the show, which fails. Don is ruined, and when he learns that Joyce has deceived him, he accuses her of being a completely selfish woman, her only true jinx. Joyce briefly considers suicide, but eventually sees the truth in Don's accusation. She re-opens the show and, although she truly loves Don, sends him away to marry Gail. The show is a success, and Joyce, now dedicated to a responsible life, goes to visit Gordon and salvage her marriage.

Davidson as Reed Walsh (as William Davidson) Production Bette Davis initially turned down the script, but Warner Bros. studio production chief Hal B. Wallis convinced her she could make something special out of the character, who had been inspired by one of Davis' idols, actress Jeanne Eagels.Dangerous at Turner Classic Movies She was determined to look like an actress on the skids, and insisted Orry-Kelly design costumes appropriate for a woman who had seen better days. It was for this film Perc Westmore styled her hair in the bob cut she would favor for the rest of her life.Mother Goddam by Whitney Stine, with a running commentary by Bette Davis, Hawthorn Books, 1974, pp. 70-71 () leftFranchot Tone, who recently had completed Mutiny on the Bounty, was borrowed from Metro-Goldwyn- Mayer to bolster Davis' marquee value. Davis was immediately drawn to the actor, who was engaged to Joan Crawford at the time. Producer Harry Joe Brown later revealed he had walked in on Davis and Tone in a compromising position. Crawford apparently knew about the liaison, but didn't break the engagement. Most biographers believe this was the start of the alleged feud between the two actresses. Three songs by Harry Warren - \\"Forty-Second Street,\\" \\"The Little Things You Used to Do,\\" and \\"Sweet and Slow\\" - are heard on the soundtrack. The other song was \\"Bridal Chorus\\" by Richard Wagner. In 1941, the film was remade as Singapore Woman with Brenda Marshall in the lead role. It coincidentally utilized some of the sets from The Letter, the 1940 film starring Davis.Mother Goddam, p. 73 Davis won the Academy Award for Best Actress for her performance, but always felt it was a consolation prize for not having been nominated for Of Human Bondage the previous year.The Life of Bette Davis by Charles Higham, Macmillan Publishing Company (1981), p. 76 () In 2002, Steven Spielberg anonymously bought the Oscar Davis had won at auction at Sotheby's and returned it to the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences. The statuette had been part of the memorabilia displayed by the Planet Hollywood restaurant chain. Critical reception The New York Times wrote \\"That Bette Davis has been unable to match the grim standard she set as Mildred in Of Human Bondage is not to her discredit. In Dangerous, she tries again. Except for a few sequences where the tension is convincing as well as deadly she fails...Say this for Miss Davis: she seldom lets down.\\"The New York Times review Variety wrote \\"Laird's dialog is adult, intelligent and has a rhythmic beat. Davis' performance is fine on the whole, despite a few imperfect moments. When called upon to reach an intense dramatic pitch without hysterics, Davis is capable of turning the trick. Yet there are moments in Dangerous when a lighter acting mood would be opportune.\\"Variety review Writing for The Spectator in 1936, Graham Greene gave the film a mixed review. Characterizing the story as \\"poor, [and] the ending atrociously sentimental\\", and criticizing Margaret Lindsay's portrayal of Gail, Greene also praised Bette Davis for her portrayal of Joyce, and concluded that the film was \\"a picture to see for [Bette Davis'] sake\\"‚Äî\\"unusual, but only because of Miss Davis.\\" (reprinted in: ) Footnotes References *Baxter, John. 1970.

Primarily a stage actress, her career flourished in Berlin and Paris before she moved to London to work in films. Her signature role was Gemma Jones in Escape Me Never, a play written for her by Margaret Kennedy.Playbill bio 1943 accessed 12/13/2016 She played Gemma first in London and then in the Broadway debut, and in a film version for which she was nominated for the Academy Award for Best Actress. In 1943, Bergner returned to Broadway in the play The Two Mrs. Carrolls, for which she won the Distinguished Performance Medal from the Drama League. Life and career She was born Elisabeth Ettel in Drohobych, Austro-Hungarian Empire (present-day Ukraine) to Anna Rosa (n√©e Wagner) and Emil Ettel, a merchant. She grew up in a secular Jewish home. The Hebrew she heard in her childhood was associated with Yom Kippur and Pesach, and on her visits to Israel, she apologized for not knowing the language.Elisabeth Ettel background, books.google.ca; accessed March 6, 2015.Bergner profile, books.google.ca; accessed March 6, 2015.Profile, Haaretz.com; accessed March 6, 2015. She first acted on stage at age 14, and appeared in Innsbruck a year later. In Vienna at age 16, she toured Austrian and German provinces with a Shakespearean company. She worked as an artist's model, posing for sculptor Wilhelm Lehmbruck, who fell in love with her. She eventually moved to Munich and later Berlin. In 1923, she made her film debut in Der Evangelimann. With the rise of Nazism, Bergner moved to London with director Paul Czinner, and they married in 1933. Her stage work in London included The Boy David (1936) by J.M. Barrie, his last play, which he wrote especially for her, and Escape Me Never by Margaret Kennedy. Catherine the Great was banned in Germany because of the government's racial policies, according to Time on 26 March 1934. She was nominated for an Academy Award for Best Actress for the film version of Escape Me Never (1935). She repeated her stage role of Rosalind, opposite Laurence Olivier's Orlando, in the 1936 film As You Like It, the first sound film version of Shakespeare's play, and the first sound film of any Shakespeare play filmed in England. Bergner previously played the role on the German stage, and several critics found that her accent got in the way of their enjoyment of the film, which was not a success. She returned intermittently to the stage, for instance in the title role of John Webster's The Duchess of Malfi in 1946. Bergner temporarily returned to Germany in 1954, where she acted in movies and on the stage; the Berlin district of Steglitz named a city park after her. In 1973, she starred in Der Fu√üg√§nger (English title: The Pedestrian), which was nominated for an Academy Award and which won the Golden Globe for Best Foreign-Language Foreign Film of 1974. In 1980, Austria awarded her the Cross of Merit for Science and Art, and in 1982, she won the Eleonora Duse Prize Asolo. Death She later moved to London, where she died aged 88 from cancer. She was cremated at Golders Green Crematorium on 15 May 1986. Her ashes lie in the West Cloister and have an oval memorial tablet.Profile, jwa.org; accessed March 6, 2015. All About Eve According to The New York Times obituary for writer Mary Orr, Bergner told Orr about an experience that provided her with the inspiration for the short story that gave birth to the character of Eve Harrington. ‚ÄúThe Wisdom of Eve\\" appeared in Cosmopolitan in 1946. The play based on that story was the basis for Joseph L. Mankiewicz's All About Eve. The episode occurred when Bergner was performing in the play The Two Mrs. Carrolls.

The genre's popularity had a broad peak from the mid-1960s through the mid-1990s; after that point it declined, in the face of changing cultural norms, increased competition from formats available at all times, and heavier regulations. In the last two decades of the genre's existence, Saturday-morning cartoons were primarily created and aired to meet educational television mandates, or E/I. Minor television networks, in addition to the non-commercial PBS in some markets, continue to air animated programming on Saturday while partially meeting those mandates. In the United States, the generally accepted times for these and other children's programs to air on Saturday mornings were from 8:00 a.m. to noon Eastern Time. Until the late 1970s, American networks also had a schedule of children's programming on Sunday mornings, though most programs at this time were repeats of Saturday morning shows that were already out of production. In some markets, some shows were pre-empted in favor of syndicated or other types of local programming. Saturday morning cartoons were largely discontinued in Canada by 2002. In the United States, The CW continued to air non-E/I cartoons as late as 2014; among the \\"Big Three\\" traditional major networks, the last non-E/I cartoon (Kim Possible) last aired in 2006. Cable television networks have since then revived the practice of debuting their most popular animated programming on Saturday mornings on a sporadic basis. History =Early cartoons= Although the Saturday-morning timeslot had always featured a great deal of children's programming beginning in the early 1950s, the idea of commissioning new animated series for broadcast on Saturday mornings caught on in the mid-1960s, when the networks realized that they could concentrate kids' viewing on that one morning to appeal to advertisers. Furthermore, limited animation, such as that produced by such studios as Filmation Associates, DePatie-Freleng Enterprises, Total Television, Jay Ward Productions and Hanna-Barbera Productions, was economical enough to produce in sufficient quantity to fill the four-hour time slot, as compared to live- action programming. While production times and costs were undeniably higher with animated programming, the cost of talent was far less (voice actors became known for their ability to hold several characters at once, sometimes even on the same show) and networks could rerun children's animated programming more frequently than most live-action series, negating the financial disadvantages. The experiment proved successful, and the time slot was filled with profitable programming. Until the late 1960s, a number of Saturday-morning cartoons were reruns of animated series originally made for prime time during a brief flurry of such series a few years earlier. These included Hanna-Barbera's The Flintstones, Top Cat, The Jetsons and Jonny Quest, Ross Bagdasarian, Sr.'s The Alvin Show, and Bob Clampett's Beany and Cecil. Some Saturday morning programs consisted of telecasts of older cartoons originally made for movie theaters, such as the Looney Tunes and Merrie Melodies cartoons produced by Warner Bros. Cartoons, the Tom and Jerry cartoons produced by Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer and directed by William Hanna and Joseph Barbera for that studio prior to establishing their own company; the Mighty Mouse and Heckle and Jeckle cartoons produced by Paul Terry's Terrytoons, and Walter Lantz's Woody Woodpecker cartoons. During the 1960s and 1970s, it was not uncommon to have animated shorts produced with both film and television in mind (DePatie-Freleng was particularly associated with this business model), so that by selling the shorts to theaters, the studios could afford a higher budget than would otherwise be available from television alone, which at the time was still a free medium for the end-user. Some of these legacy characters later appeared in \\"new\\" versions by other producers (Tom and Jerry by Hanna and Barbera for their own company, and later by Filmation; Mighty Mouse by Filmation and later by Ralph Bakshi; The Pink Panther by Hanna-Barbera with Friz Freleng as a consultant). The remainder of the networks' Saturday-morning schedules were filled by reruns of black-and- white live-action series made in the 1950s, usually with a western background (The Lone Ranger, The Roy Rogers Show, Sky King, Fury, Rin-Tin-Tin, My Friend Flicka, etc.) and occasional first-run live-action series such as The Magic Land of Allakazam, the later color episodes of Howdy Doody, The Shari Lewis Show, Shenanigans, and Watch Mr. Wizard. Independent stations (TV stations not affiliated with networks) often did not show cartoons on Saturday mornings, instead running feature films (usually B-Westerns or low-budget series movies such as The Bowery Boys or Bomba the Jungle Boy), chapters of \\"cliffhanger\\" serial films, comedy short subjects originally made for movie theatres (Laurel and Hardy, The Three Stooges, and Our Gang/The Little Rascals), older live- action syndicated series like The Adventures of Superman, The Cisco Kid, Ramar of the Jungle, The Abbott and Costello Show, The Adventures of Robin Hood, Hopalong Cassidy, Flash Gordon, and Sheena, Queen of the Jungle, and regional sports shows, often wrestling or bowling programs. =1960s‚Äì1980s= 1960s The mid-1960s brought a boom in superhero cartoon series, some adapted from comic books, (Superman, Aquaman, Spider-Man, The Fantastic Four), and others original (Space Ghost, The Herculoids, Birdman and the Galaxy Trio, etc.). Also included were parodies of the superhero genre (Underdog, The Super 6, and George of the Jungle, among others). Another development was the popular music-based cartoon, featuring both real-life groups (The Beatles, The Jackson 5ive, and The Osmonds) as well as anonymous studio musicians (The Archies, Josie and the Pussycats). Live-action series continued to some extent with Sid and Marty Krofft's H.R. Pufnstuf and Sigmund and the Sea Monsters, Hanna-Barbera's The Banana Splits, Stan Burns and Mike Marmer's Lancelot Link, Secret Chimp, ABC's Curiosity Shop (produced by Chuck Jones), Don Kirshner's widely popular The Monkees, and the British-made slapstick comedy Here Come the Double Deckers. 1970s With the 1970s came a wave of animated versions of popular live-action prime time series, mainly with the voices of the original casts, including The Brady Bunch (The Brady Kids), Star Trek (Star Trek: The Animated Series), Emergency! (Emergency+4), Gilligan's Island (The New Adventures of Gilligan and later Gilligan's Planet in the 1980s), Happy Days (The Fonz and the Happy Days Gang), Laverne & Shirley (Laverne & Shirley in the Army), Mork & Mindy (Mork & Mindy/Laverne & Shirley/Fonz Hour), The Partridge Family (Partridge Family 2200 A.D.; the cast was also semi- regulars on Goober and the Ghost Chasers), and The Dukes of Hazzard (The Dukes). Less literally adapted was The Oddball Couple, which turned Neil Simon's mismatched roommates into a sloppy dog and a fastidious cat. Many of these animated spin-offs featured storylines and settings that would not be feasible in most live-action series (such as trips around the world and/or into space). The ties between the animated spin-offs and their live-action origins varied widely, depending on how much input the original cast and crew were willing to contribute (and how much the animation companies were willing to pay for that talent); in retrospect, animated versions of TV series are generally not treated as canon. Other adaptations of familiar characters and properties included Tarzan (Tarzan, Lord of the Jungle), Planet of the Apes (Return to the Planet of the Apes), Lassie (Lassie's Rescue Rangers) and Godzilla. At this same time, the great success of Scooby-Doo spawned numerous imitations, combining Archies-style teen characters and funny animals with light-weight mystery stories (Speed Buggy, Jabberjaw, etc.) Comedian Bill Cosby successfully blended educational elements with both comedy and music in the popular, long-running Fat Albert and the Cosby Kids. Filmation, primarily a cartoon producer, also turned out several live-action Saturday morning series in the 1970s, including Shazam! (with animated sequences) and Isis, Jason of Star Command, The Ghost Busters (not related to the later movie series, but a vehicle for former F Troop stars Larry Storch and Forrest Tucker) and Uncle Croc's Block. 1980s A Hanna-Barbera adaptation of the Belgian comic strip The Smurfs became a huge success in the 1980s, bringing with it other series with fairy tale-like settings (My Little Pony, Monchichis, The Biskitts, Trollkins, Snorks, etc.) Most of the genres made popular in previous generations (funny animals, superheroes, teen mysteries, science fiction and live-action adaptations) continued to appear as well, with the exception of the musical band cartoons (only one of note, the syndicated Jem and the Holograms, emerged in the 1980s). CBS and the producing team of Lee Mendelson and Bill Melendez, acclaimed for their Emmy-winning prime time specials adapted from Charles M. Schulz's comic strip Peanuts, brought Schulz's characters to Saturday mornings in The Charlie Brown and Snoopy Show; later in the 1980s, the successful Garfield comic strip and TV specials were adapted into the long-running Garfield and Friends, also on CBS. Other adaptations of familiar characters and properties included The Lone Ranger, Star Wars (Star Wars: Droids and Star Wars: Ewoks) and Zorro (The New Adventures of Zorro). During the mid-1980s through the early 1990s, series featuring younger and junior versions of existing characters were introduced, such as Muppet Babies, A Pup Named Scooby-Doo, and The Flintstone Kids. =Watchgroup backlash= Parents' lobby groups such as Action for Children's Television appeared in the late 1960s. They voiced concerns about the presentation of commercialism, violence, anti-social attitudes and stereotypes in Saturday morning cartoons. By the 1970s, these groups exercised enough influence that the television networks felt compelled to lay down more stringent content rules for the animation houses. By 1978, the Federal Trade Commission was openly considering a ban on all advertising during television programming targeting preschoolers, and severe restrictions on other children's program advertising, which would have effectively killed off the format; the commission ultimately dropped the proposal. The networks were encouraged to create educational spots that endeavored to use animation and/or live-action for enriching content. The Schoolhouse Rock! series on ABC became a television classic; ABC also had several other short-form animated featurettes, including Time for Timer and The Bod Squad, that had long runs. Just as notable were CBS's news segments for children, In the News and NBC's Ask NBC News and One to Grow On, which featured skits of everyday problems with advice from the stars of NBC primetime programs. =Decline= The decline of the timeslot somewhat began in the early 1990s for a variety of reasons, including: * Creative declines and stagnation at the major television animation studios; by the late 1980s, major Saturday morning producers such as Hanna-Barbera and Filmation had already recycled a limited number of common tropes and poorly developed stock characters numerous times over the previous two decades. * The rise of first-run syndicated animated programs, which usually had a greater artistic freedom and looser standards than those that were mandated by a network. These programs included G.I. Joe, The Transformers, Voltron, ThunderCats, He-Man and the Masters of the Universe, Ducktales, the first two seasons of Tiny Toon Adventures, and the first three seasons of Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles. * Increasing regulation of children's programming content, including the Federal Communications Commission's introduction of the E/I mandate in 1990 and later made more explicit in 1996. This required all broadcast networks to air \\"educational and informational\\" children's programs for at least three hours a week. Concurrent with this, the Federal Trade Commission outlawed the advertising of both premium-rate telephone numbers and tie-in merchandise during children's hours. Both of these factors limited creative options and cut off large revenue sources for children's programs on network television, and would overrun Saturday morning cartoons. * The rise of cable television networks such as the Disney Channel, Nickelodeon and Cartoon Network, which provided appealing animated entertainment throughout the week at nearly all hours, making Saturday morning timeslots far less important to viewers and advertisers. Cable channels had the additional advantage of being beyond FCC content regulations and did not have to abide by educational and advertising regulations; within a year of the E/I mandate being imposed, Nickelodeon shot ahead of all of the broadcast networks in Saturday morning viewership ratings. Currently, there are at least 10 channels specializing in children's programming. Cable television was also better positioned to rerun children's programming as another source of revenue in an increasingly fractured marketplace. * The increased availability of home video services (both hard-copy and later through the Internet in the form of video on demand), which, just like cable, allowed children to watch their favorite cartoons at any given time. * An increase in children's participation in Saturday activities outside the home. * The gradual legalization of no- fault divorce in the United States over the course of the 1970s and 1980s, which prompted a spike in divorces, and a desire for parents to make more productive use of their time with their children. Visitation periods for the secondary custodial parent often occurred on Saturday mornings and afternoons, changing the routines of these children from a steady schedule every weekend. * The strongly continuous growth of home video game systems made by Atari, Nintendo, Sega and others. The decline of Saturday morning cartoons coincided with a rise in adult-oriented animation and a wave of new, creator-driven animation studios, which experienced a revival (much of it on prime time television) in the 1990s as the Saturday morning cartoons were in decline, as did animated feature films (see, for example, the Disney Renaissance). Fueled by the continued requirement for educational programming, networks continued to carry some cartoons well into the 2000s; by this point, these consisted either of re-purposed reruns from cable or outsourced blocks of cartoons imported from outside the United States. As the popularity of these blocks continued to decline and no hit shows emerged from them, by the early 2010s cartoons began an outright phaseout, with the major networks opting to fill their educational mandates by commissioning live-action, mostly documentary/human interest series that were far less labor-intensive and expensive to produce (and, more importantly for the networks, less restrictive in regard to commercials). Some of the space formerly filled by Saturday morning cartoons would be occupied by paid programming and expanded coverage of college football, both of which greatly expanded as the result of separate government rulings in 1984. =State of Saturday morning cartoons since the 1990s= A 1996 Federal Communications Commission mandate, issued in the wake of the Children's Television Act, requires that stations program a minimum of three hours of children's educational/informational (\\"E/I\\") programming per week. To help their affiliates comply with the regulations, broadcast networks began to reorganize their efforts to adhere to the mandates, so their affiliates would not bear the burden of scheduling the shows themselves on their own time, thus eliminating the risk of having network product preempted by the mandates. This almost always meant that the educational programming was placed during the Saturday morning cartoon block. NBC abandoned its original Saturday morning cartoon lineup in 1992, replacing it with a Saturday morning edition of Today and adding an all live-action teen-oriented block, TNBC, which featured Saved by the Bell, California Dreams and other teen sitcoms. Even though the educational content was minimal to non-existent, NBC labeled all the live-action shows with an E/I rating and provided the legal fiction of a blanket educational summary boilerplate provided to stations to place in their quarterly educational effort reports for the FCC. Cartoons returned to the network in the fall of 2002, after cable network Discovery Kids (now Discovery Family) won the rights to the timeslot in an auction, beating out other children's television companies (notably Nickelodeon, which already programmed CBS's Saturday morning block as Nick Jr. on CBS). CBS followed NBC's lead in 1997 by producing CBS News Saturday Morning for the first two hours of its lineup and an all live-action block of children's programming. The experiment lasted a few months, and CBS brought back its animated series CBS Storybreak. In the 1990s, Japanese television shows targeted towards children and teenagers were introduced to American television, including live- action tokusatsu superhero shows such as Power Rangers (Super Sentai) and VR Troopers (Metal Hero), and anime shows such as Pok√©mon, Dragon Ball, Sailor Moon, Digimon and Yu-Gi-Oh! This led to a transition in the Saturday morning slot from traditional American Saturday-morning cartoons towards Japanese anime, which have dominated the Saturday morning timeslot since the 1990s. Yu- Gi-Oh in particular was the most popular Saturday-morning cartoon during the 2000s. In 2004, ABC was the last of the broadcast networks to add a Saturday morning edition of its morning news program (in their case, Good Morning America Weekend) in the first hour of its lineup, mainly due to internal affiliate criticism of the lack of network coverage for the February 2003 Space Shuttle Columbia disaster which occurred on a Saturday morning, forcing them to take coverage from other video wire services. Prior to that, and particularly in the early 1990s, it was not uncommon for affiliates to preempt part or all of ABC's cartoon lineup with local programming. Fox carried little or no E/I programming, leaving the responsibility of scheduling the E/I shows to the affiliates themselves (although the network did eventually add daily reruns of The Magic School Bus to meet the E/I mandates from 1998 to 2001). Following the closure of its 4Kids TV block in 2008, Fox would not carry any children's programming at all for five years until the launch of Xploration Station. The WB was far more accommodating; for several years, the network aired the history-themed Histeria! five days a week, leaving only a half-hour of E/I programs up to the local affiliates to program. Several channels, while not offering original animated series, do air reruns of older Saturday morning cartoons. Boomerang, a spin-off channel of Cartoon Network, specialized primarily in reruns of Saturday morning cartoons from the 1960s and 1970s (the majority of which come from Hanna-Barbera, which, like Boomerang, is owned by Time Warner). In the 2010s, the channel's focus shifted toward airing reruns of cancelled animated series from the 1990s and 2000s (many of which were never intended for the Saturday morning programming block), and as of 2014, all earlier cartoons are relegated to graveyard slots. Hub Network owned the broadcast rights to rerun several of Fox Kids' most popular programs (this was a byproduct of former Fox Kids head Margaret Loesch working as head of the Hub Network at the time); the majority of that programming was dropped or relegated to early morning time slots when Loesch left the network and the channel was relaunched as Discovery Family in 2014. A handful of digital subchannels also make use of Saturday morning cartoon reruns, including Luken Communications's PBJ and Ion Media Networks' Qubo. In 2011, the major networks began to phase out weekend-morning educational programming aimed towards preteen audiences, in favor of live-action reality and docuseries outsourced to other producers. Litton Entertainment took over programming the Saturday morning children's blocks from ABC, CBS, The CW, and NBC in 2011, 2013, 2014, and 2016, respectively. These programs are ostensibly aimed at teenagers and families, and networks have legally declared these new programs to be oriented towards viewers between the ages of 13 and 16. This distinction is important from a legal basis, as it removes the requirement for the programs to comply with the advertising limits imposed by the Children's Television Act. By network =ABC= By the mid-1990s, broadcast networks were now becoming units of larger entertainment companies. ABC was bought by The Walt Disney Company in 1996, which began airing all Disney-produced programming by 1997 and cancelled programs produced by companies other than Disney (with the notable exceptions of two shows The Bugs Bunny and Tweety Show, which continued to air until Warner Bros. discontinued the show in 2000) and Science Court (which was produced by Burns & Burns) also ran until 2000. After being purchased by Disney, ABC's Saturday morning cartoons became part of a block called Disney's One Saturday Morning before switching to a block of live- action and animated programs under the banner ABC Kids in 2002. Many of the block's shows were produced by Disney and also aired on the Disney Channel and/or Toon Disney. At one point, ABC Kids had only two animated shows on its schedule, while the remainder of the lineup consisted of live-action entertainment shows. By late 2008, most shows that were part of the ABC Kids block (except for Power Rangers) were reruns of older episodes that originally aired a few years earlier; this remained the case for the next three years, with no episodes added into rotation (thus, for instance, the first season of Hannah Montana was still running on ABC Kids in constant repeats, even though several further seasons had aired on Disney Channel by the time the block ended). The Disney Channel (which, like ABC, is owned by The Walt Disney Company) launched a Saturday morning block of its popular animated programming, initially named Toonin' Saturdays, in June 2011. On August 27, 2011, ABC ended the ABC Kids block. ABC was the first network to outsource its E/I liabilities and Saturday morning program block to Litton; Litton's ABC block is known as the Weekend Adventure.The Disney Channel quietly ended its Saturday morning cartoon block in 2014, then brought it back in 2017 as \\"Get Animated!\\" =CBS= In 1999, CBS was purchased by Viacom, bringing it under the same ownership as popular children's network Nickelodeon. CBS in turn ran programming from Nickelodeon and Nick Jr. from 2000 to 2006, nearly a year after Viacom split into two separate companies (Nickelodeon went to a newly created company under the Viacom name and CBS became the flagship property of the CBS Corporation). The two parties ended the Nickelodeon/Nick Jr.-branded block, which was replaced by the DIC Entertainment (now Cookie Jar Group) and produced KOL Secret Slumber Party in September 2006. The block was rebranded as KEWLopolis, featuring an increased amount of animated series, in September 2007. On September 19, 2009, KEWLopolis was re-branded as Cookie Jar TV, with its target audience shifted toward preschoolers. Cookie Jar TV ended its run on September 21, 2013, at which point Litton also took over programming CBS' E/I liabilities and Saturday morning programming. Litton's CBS block is known as the CBS Dream Team. This is the second time CBS has dropped animated children's programming from its lineup; the network had previously gone with an all-live-action programming lineup for the 1997-98 season when the E/I rules took effect, but reverted to animated programming the following season. The Dream Team block was also unusual among the other Litton blocks, as it included Litton's only scripted program (the block carried the federally subsidized police procedural The Inspectors from 2016 to 2019). =Fox= From 1990 to 2002, Fox ran the Fox Kids block, which featured both animated and live-action series in the after school hours on weekday afternoons from 3:00 p.m. to 5:00 p.m. (out-competing with syndicated afternoon children's programs on independent stations and affiliates of smaller networks). Among its notable series included animated series such as Taz-Mania, Batman: The Animated Series, X-Men: The Animated Series, Eek! The Cat, Bobby's World, Spider-Man: The Animated Series, and Animaniacs, live action shows like Power Rangers (the American adaptation of Super Sentai), Goosebumps, and Big Bad Beetleborgs, and Japanese anime series such as Digimon and Transformers: Robots in Disguise. Fox sold its children's division as part of its 2001 sale of Fox Family Channel (now Freeform) to The Walt Disney Company; the network then leased its remaining Saturday morning block to 4Kids Entertainment in 2002. The 4Kids-produced block, which by that point had become 4Kids TV, ended its run on December 27, 2008, Fox opted to drop children's programming altogether rather than lease the block to another company, becoming the third broadcast network (after Pax TV and UPN) to completely abandon children's programming, and replaced 4Kids TV with a two- hour infomercial block called Weekend Marketplace; as with 4Kids TV and its predecessors, Fox has allowed several stations the option to decline to carry the block and lease it to another station in the market, especially those stations which had never carried Fox Kids following the affiliation changes resulting from Fox's 1994 affiliation agreement with New World Communications. Fox's owned-and-operated stations and affiliates instead hold the responsibility of carrying children's programming (generally through programs purchased off the syndication market). On September 13, 2014, Fox's owned-and- operated stations (among some of their other affiliates, such as those owned by Tribune Company) picked up a new block entitled Xploration Station from Steve Rotfeld Productions. The three-hour block features E/I programs focused on science and space. =The CW= Origins Kids' WB debuted on The WB on September 9, 1995, as a block on weekday mornings, weekday afternoons and Saturday mornings. During the run of the weekday morning blocks, the network aired the animated series Histeria! to meet E/I content quotas for the network's affiliates. The Kids' WB weekday morning block ended in 2001, while the weekday afternoon block was discontinued on December 30, 2005 with The WB retaining the two afternoon hours to run a lineup of off- network syndicated reruns. The CW begins airing children's programming Kids' WB, now reduced to just the Saturday morning block that was expanded to five hours from four with the removal of the weekday afternoon lineup, moved to The CW (which is part-owned by The WB's former parent Time Warner) on September 23, 2006 (CW owned-and-operated station WUPA in Atlanta debuted the block the following day, as it opted to carry the block on Sundays). The Kids' WB block ended its run on May 17, 2008, and was replaced on May 24, 2008 by the 4Kids Entertainment-produced The CW4Kids (4Kids already produced Fox's 4Kids TV block at that time, which would not end for another seven months due to a dispute with the network over distribution on Fox stations and compensation for the time lease). The CW4Kids was renamed Toonzai on August 14, 2010 (with the former brand being retained as a sub- brand to fulfill branding requirements imposed by 4Kids), Toonzai was replaced by Vortexx, produced under a time lease agreement with Saban Brands (which had acquired some of 4Kids' assets, including certain programs, in an auction earlier in the year) on August 25, 2012. Vortexx ended its run on September 27, 2014, at which point the CW turned over its E/I liability and Saturday morning programming to Litton as well. Litton's CW block is known as One Magnificent Morning and at five hours in length, it is two hours longer than the blocks that Litton programs for ABC and CBS. =NBC= NBC entered into a partnership with digital cable and satellite network Discovery Kids to provide original programming from the channel on NBC's Saturday morning lineup in 2002, Discovery Kids on NBC ran on the network from September 14, 2002 to September 2, 2006. NBC replaced that block with Qubo, a three-hour \\"edutainment\\" block that debuted on September 9, 2006 (with accompanying blocks on co-owned Spanish network Telemundo on weekend mornings and on Ion Television once weekly), as part of a programming partnership between parent company NBCUniversal, Ion Media Networks, Scholastic Press, Nelvana and Classic Media, that resulted in the creation of a companion digital multicast network on Ion Television's stations; the Qubo blocks on NBC and Telemundo ended on June 30, 2012, leaving only the Ion block and standalone Qubo Channel. On July 7, 2012, NBC launched a new Saturday morning block aimed at preschool-aged children, NBC Kids, under a time lease agreement with co-owned cable network Sprout (which NBC, through corporate parent Comcast, also owned a minority interest before purchasing it outright in 2012). NBC Kids, which was the only and final Saturday morning programming block to air animated programming, ended its run on September 25, 2016. On February 24, 2016, NBC announced a new E/I block produced by Litton Entertainment, The More You Know‚Äîa brand extension of NBC's public service announcement brand of the same name, and it launched on October 8, 2016, resulting in NBC removing all cartoons from its Saturday morning lineups for the first time since September 1992. =ThisTV= On November 1, 2008, ThisTV launched airing a daily children's program block called Cookie Jar Toons, which was programmed by Cookie Jar Group. The block featured mainly scripted animated and live action series; Cookie Jar-produced programs that did not count towards E/I quotas aired under the sub-block This is for Kids. Cookie Jar Toons/This is for Kids was discontinued on October 31, 2013, effectively removing Saturday children's programming from the network; after Tribune Broadcasting assumed part- ownership of ThisTV from Weigel Broadcasting the following day, Tribune replaced the block with a three-hour Sunday morning lineup of exclusively E/I-compliant programs from various syndication distributors. On May 2, 2017, Sinclair Broadcasting Group announced that it would introduce a new children's programming block named KidsClick, which airs on mainly CW and MyNetworkTV affiliates, and nationally on This TV, beginning on July 1, 2017. The block was transferred from This TV to TBD nationally starting on July 1, 2018, ahead of the collapse of the attempted acquisition of Tribune Media by Sinclair Broadcast Group. At the time of its closure, it aired no E/I programming. KidsClick aired for the last time on March 31, 2019, after being on the air for just 20 months. =DIC Kids Network/Cookie Jar Kids Network= In 2003, DIC Entertainment launched a syndicated children's programming block titled the DIC Kids Network (branded as The Incredible World of DIC on- screen), which aired select animated series from the DIC Entertainment catalog (and later some third-party programming) on Fox, UPN and The WB (Later The CW and MyNetworkTV) affiliated stations, alongside independent stations to allow these stations to meet required E/I programming quotas. The block was distributed by Tribune Entertainment and later by Ascent Media. With the purchase of DIC Entertainment by Cookie Jar Entertainment in 2008, the block was later relaunched as the Cookie Jar Kids Network in 2009 and various additional programs from the Cookie Jar catalog were added to the lineup. The block ended on September 18, 2011. =PBS Kids= PBS has run daytime children's programming targeted at children between the ages of 4 and 12 since the network debuted on October 5, 1970. Its afternoon and Saturday morning children's programming was folded into a daily block called PTV (which aired weekdays from 2:00 p.m. to 5:00 p.m. and Saturdays from 9:00 a.m. to Noon local time). On September 6, 1999, the block was re-branded as PBS Kids and spun off into a 24-hour cable channel using the same name, which was turned into a joint venture with Comcast, HIT Entertainment, and Sesame Workshop in 2005, becoming PBS Kids Sprout. The PBS Kids cable channel was funded by DirecTV. Then, PBS Kids was divided into two sub-blocks and they were: PBS Kids Go! and the PBS Kids Preschool Block. An additional three-hour weekend morning block for preschool-aged children that was produced in conjunction with the Canadian production company Nelvana called the PBS Kids Bookworm Bunch debuted on September 30, 2000 and lasted until 2004. PBS Kids Go! debuted in 2004 and ended in 2013. The network continues to offer Saturday morning programming as of 2015, though as with most PBS programming, local member stations retain the right to refuse it outright for other programming such as instructional/DIY/cooking programming, carrying it on Sundays instead, or placing it on a subchannel. Also, other PBS member stations maintain full- time or half-time subchannels with self-programmed and slotted PBS Kids content which may share channel space with other networks such as Create or a local state political proceedings coverage network. =Retro TV= Retro Television Network's Saturday morning lineup consisted of classic cartoons from the 1960s through the 1990s, most of which were produced by Filmation licensed via DreamWorks Classics. Due to corporate consolidation which led to the DreamWorks library being owned by NBCUniversal in 2016, this lineup was eventually pulled for low-cost barter E/I content and other newer cartoons unable to find distribution otherwise. As of 2019, Retro carries The Houndcats and The Barkleys, two DePatie-Freleng Enterprises cartoons from the 1970s, on its Saturday morning lineup in addition to its E/I liabilities. =TeleXitos= TeleXitos airs both cartoons and 3-hour children's programming; however, only two non-E/I programming airs in the early morning and afternoon hours such as He-Man and the Masters of the Universe and She-Ra: Princess of Power. Like Retro Television Network and MundoMax, it does not air commercials aimed at children. It is the only Spanish-language subchannel to air cartoons on Saturdays.

Other supporting cast were William Faversham, Frances Dee, Cedric Hardwicke, Billie Burke, Alison Skipworth, Nigel Bruce, and Alan Mowbray. The film is based on the 1899 play of the same name by Langdon Mitchell, which in turn was based on William Makepeace Thackeray's 1848 novel Vanity Fair. The play was made famous in the late 1890s by actress Minnie Maddern Fiske. The screenplay was written by Francis Edward Faragoh. The film was considered a landmark in cinema as the first feature film to use the newly developed three-strip Technicolor production throughout, opening the way for a growing number of color films to be made in Britain and the United States in the years leading up to World War II. In 2019, the film was selected by the Library of Congress for preservation in the National Film Registry for being \\"culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant\\". The film recounts the tale of a lower-class girl who insinuates herself into an upper-class family, only to see her life and the lives of those around her destroyed. Plot Becky Sharp (Miriam Hopkins), a socially ambitious English young lady, manages to survive during the background years of Napoleon's defeat at Waterloo. Becky climbs the British social ladder, overcoming poverty and class distinctions, through her best friend Amelia Sedley (Frances Dee), praising any rich man who would listen. In her efforts to advance herself, she manages to connect with a number of gentlemen: the Marquis of Steyne (Cedric Hardwicke), Joseph Sedley (Nigel Bruce), Rawdon Crawley (Alan Mowbray), and George Osborne (G. P. Huntley Jr), the husband of Amelia. She rises to the top of British society but becomes the scourge of the social circle, offending influential ladies such as Lady Bareacres (Billie Burke). Sharp falls into the humiliation of singing for her meals in a beer hall, but she never stays down for long. At the end, she cons her last man and finally lands Amelia's brother, Joseph.

After producing La Cucaracha, Becky Sharp, and Dancing Pirate (1936), the Whitneys and David O. Selznick formed Selznick International Pictures. Two Selznick International films, A Star Is Born and Nothing Sacred (both 1937), were produced by Selznick, copyrighted by Pioneer Pictures, and released through United Artists rather than RKO. Lowell Sherman, the original director, had fallen ill while working on Night Life of the Gods before starting Becky Sharp, but had continued to work on the project; he died of double pneumonia four weeks into production. After Sherman's death, Rouben Mamoulian was brought in to finish the film. Mamoulian did not use any of the footage shot by Sherman, deciding instead to reshoot the entire film. =Color development= Becky Sharp was the first feature film to use the three-strip Technicolor process, which created a separate film register for each of the three primary colors, for the entirety of the film.Technicolor's earlier processes did not include a blue register, just green and red. Earlier live action films to use the new Technicolor process for part of the film include the final musical number in the feature The Cat and the Fiddle released by MGM in February 1934, and in short sequences filmed for other movies made during 1934, including The House of Rothschild (Twentieth Century Pictures/United Artists) with George Arliss and Kid Millions (Samuel Goldwyn/United Artists) with Eddie Cantor. Warner Brothers released two Leon Errol shorts, Service with a Smile (July 28, 1934) and Good Morning, Eve! (September 22, 1934), and RKO Pictures released the short La Cucaracha (August 31, 1934). Reception Writing for The Spectator, Graham Greene raved that \\"colour is everything here\\" and characterizing its use in the film as \\"a triumph\\". Although Greene complained that the Technicolor \\"plays havoc with the women's faces\\", leveled criticism at Hopkins for her \\"indecisive acting\\", and noted that he had found the film's climax in Bath to be \\"absurd\\" and \\"silly\\", he described these minor complaints as \\"ungrateful\\" and his overall impression was that the film gave \\"delight to the eye\\".

This version had been printed (poorly) on two-color Cinecolor stock which did not accurately reproduce the colors of the original film. The smaller film stock also resulted in a grainier, inferior image. In the 1980s, the UCLA Film and Television Archive restored the film, under the supervision of archivist Robert Gitt. Rouben Mamoulian appeared at the premiere of the restored print at the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences theatre in Beverly Hills.

When the woman chooses one of the men to marry, the other, jealous, sends his rival off into a dangerous situation during wartime. The film stars Fredric March, Merle Oberon, and Herbert Marshall. The movie was adapted by Lillian Hellman and Mordaunt Shairp from the play by Guy Bolton. It was directed by Sidney Franklin, produced by Samuel Goldwyn, and released by United Artists. A silent film version of the same play, also produced by Goldwyn, was released in 1925 and is now a lost film. It won the Academy Award for Best Art Direction, and was nominated for Best Actress in a Leading Role (Merle Oberon) and Best Sound, Recording (Thomas T. Moulton). Plot Kitty Vane, Alan Trent, and Gerald Shannon have been inseparable friends since childhood. Both Alan and Gerald are in love with Kitty, who in turn has been infatuated with Alan her entire life. Gerald and Alan are drafted into World War I. They return home for ten days, during which time Alan proposes to Kitty and she joyously accepts. Despite his own love for Kitty, Gerald gives the couple his blessing. However, the newly engaged couple's happiness is cut short when Gerald and Alan are ordered back into service the very next day. Kitty and Alan search for somebody to marry them, but nobody is available. They decide they do not need to officially marry, and agree to spend the night together before Alan must return to the war. Alan and Kitty book a room in an inn. Kitty's cousin Lawrence sees Alan taking champagne and flowers up the room and works out that Alan has a woman in his room, unaware that it is Kitty. The next day, Lawrence teases Alan about the previous night. Gerald misunderstands and believes Alan has cheated on Kitty. When Gerald confronts him, Alan does not reveal he in fact spent the evening with Kitty, so as to protect her reputation. Gerald, furious for Kitty's sake, refuses to grant Alan leave so he can return home and marry Kitty properly. Instead, Gerald inadvertently pressures Alan to join a dangerous mission. Alan nobley volunteers. Months later and Gerald returns home to Kitty. They both mourn the death of Alan, believed to be killed in an explosion. Together they realise Gerald's misunderstanding and conclude that they are both, in a way, to be blamed for Alan's death. Both consumed with grief, they end up growing closer and developing feelings for one another. Meanwhile, it is revealed that Alan did not die. He lost his eyesight and was cared for in a German hospital, adopting the name of Roger Crane so that his family could not locate him. A doctor, George Barton, finds a photograph of Alan, Kitty and Gerald and realises that Alan has changed his name to escape his past. George allows \\"Roger\\" to leave. Alan plans to return to Kitty, but has a change of mind at the last minute when he believes people will pity Kitty and that she will only care for him out of duty. He leaves town and stays in an inn. He becomes friendly with the innkeeper's children, Betty, Joe and Ginger. Inspired by his friendship with them, he begins to write a series of successful children's books, and is able to move into his own home with a private secretary. George Barton visits Alan, still living as \\"Roger\\", and sees in the paper a photograph of Kitty and Gerald with the announcement that they are to be married. Recognising them as the couple from Alan's photograph and realising that Alan is still in love with Kitty, George contacts them. Gerald at first does not recognise the name Roger Crane, but works out who he really is. Gerald and Kitty go to visit Alan, who attempts to conceal his blindness from them. At first, they do not realise he cannot see, causing Kitty to believe Alan has distanced himself from her and no longer loves her. She wishes to part as friends and holds her hand out to him, but he cannot see and she believes he has rejected her. Gerald, however, realises the truth and encourages Kitty to go back into the house. Alan, hearing footsteps, believes his secretary is in the room and begins talking to her, causing Kitty to realise Alan is blind. She does not care and hurries over to Alan, where they finally profess their love for each other. Gerald leaves them to reunite.

History  OASIS was founded under the name \\"SGML Open\\" in 1993. It began as a trade association of SGML tool vendors to cooperatively promote the adoption of the Standard Generalized Markup Language (SGML) through mainly educational activities, though some amount of technical activity was also pursued including an update of the CALS Table Model specification and specifications for fragment interchange and entity management. In 1998, with the movement of the high tech industry to XML, \\"SGML Open\\" changed its emphasis from SGML to XML, and changed its name to OASIS Open to be inclusive of XML and reflect an expanded scope of technical work and standards. The focus of the consortium's activities also moved from promoting adoption (as XML was getting much attention on its own) to developing technical specifications. In July 2000 a new technical committee process was approved. With the adoption of the process the manner in which technical committees were created, operated, and progressed their work was regularized. At the adoption of the process there were five technical committees; by 2004 there were nearly 70. During 1999, OASIS was approached by UN/CEFACT, the committee of the United Nations dealing with standards for business, to jointly develop a new set of specifications for electronic business. The joint initiative, called \\"ebXML\\" and which first met in November 1999, was chartered for a three-year period. At the final meeting under the original charter, in Vienna, UN/CEFACT and OASIS agreed to divide the remaining work between the two organizations and to coordinate the completion of the work through a coordinating committee. In 2004 OASIS submitted its completed ebXML specifications to ISO TC154 where they were approved as ISO 15000. The consortium has its headquarters in Burlington, Massachusetts, shared with other companies. On September 4, 2014, the consortium moved from 25 Corporate Drive Suite 103 to 35 Corporate Dr Suite 150, still on the same loop route.

Members  Adhesion to the consortium requires some fees to be paid, which must be renewed annually, depending on the membership category adherents want to access. Among the adherents are members from American Bar Association, Collabora, Dell, EclecticIQ, General Motors, IBM, ISO/IEC, KDE e.V., Microsoft, Novell, Oracle, Redhat, The Document Foundation, universities, government agencies, individuals and employees from other less- known companies.  Member sections  Member sections are special interest groups within the consortium that focus on specific topics. These sections keep their own distinguishable identity and have full autonomy to define their work programme and agenda. THe integration of the member section in the standardization process is organized via the technical committees. Active member sections are for example: * Legal XML * IDTrust Member sections may be completed when they have achieved their objectives. The standards that they promoted are then maintained by the relevant technical committees directly within OASIS. For example: * AMQP * WS-I  Patent disclosure controversy  Like many bodies producing open standards e.g. ECMA, OASIS added a Reasonable and non-discriminatory licensing (RAND) clause to its policy in February 2005. That amendment required participants to disclose intent to apply for software patents for technologies under consideration in the standard. Contrary to the W3C, which requires participants to offer royalty-free licenses to anyone using the resulting standard, OASIS offers a similar Royalty Free on Limited Terms mode, along with a Royalty Free on RAND Terms mode and a RAND (reasonable and non-discriminatory) mode for its committees. Compared to W3C, OASIS is less restrictive regarding obligation to companies to grant a royalty-free license to the patents they own. Controversy has rapidly arisen because this licensing was added silently and allows publication of standards which could require licensing fee payments to patent holders. This situation could effectively eliminate the possibility of free/open source implementations of these standards. Further, contributors could initially offer royalty-free use of their patent, later imposing per-unit fees, after the standard has been accepted. On April 11, 2005, The New York Times reported IBM committed for free, all of its patents to the OASIS group. Larry Rosen, a software law expert and the leader of the reaction which rose up when OASIS quietly included a RAND clause in its policy, welcomed the initiative and supposed OASIS will not continue using that policy as other companies involved would follow. History proved him wrong, as that RAND policy has still not been removed and other commercial companies have not published such a free statement towards OASIS. Patrick Gannon, president and CEO of OASIS from 2001 to 2008, minimized the risk that a company could take advantage of a standard to request royalties when it has been established: \\"If it's an option nobody uses, then what's the harm?\\". Sam Hiser, former marketing lead of the now defunct OpenOffice.org, explained that such patents towards an open standard are counterproductive and inappropriate. He also argued that IBM and Microsoft were shifting their standardization efforts from the W3C to OASIS, in a way to leverage probably their patents portfolio in the future. Hiser also attributed this RAND change to the OASIS policy to Microsoft. The RAND term could indeed theoretically allow any company involved to leverage their patent in the future. But that amendment was probably added in a way to attract more companies to the consortium, and encourage contributions from potential participants. Big actors like Microsoft could have indeed applied pressure and made a sine-qua-non condition to access the consortium, and possibly jeopardize/boycott the standard if such a clause was not present.  Criticism  Doug Mahugh ‚Äî while working for Microsoft (a promoter of Office Open XML, a Microsoft document format competing with OASIS's ISO/IEC 26300, i.e. ODF v1.0) as a Senior Product Manager specializing in Office client interoperability ‚Äî claimed that \\"many countries have expressed frustration about the pace of OASIS's responses to defect reports that have been submitted on ISO/IEC 26300 and the inability for SC 34 members to participate in the maintenance of ODF.\\" However, Rob Weir, co-chair of the OASIS ODF Technical Committee noted that at the time, \\"the ODF TC had received zero defect reports from any ISO/IEC national body other than Japan\\". He added that the submitter of the original Japanese defect report, Murata Mokoto, was satisfied with the preparation of the errata. He also self-published a blog post blaming Microsoft of involving people to improve and modify the accuracy of ODF and OpenXML Wikipedia articles, trying to make ODF sound risky to adopt.

History The family originated from the Utub federation. Emir The Emir of Kuwait is the head of state. He is nominated by a family council headed by prominent members of the family. The National Assembly has the constitutional right to approve and disapprove of an Emir's appointment under Article 4 of the Constitution of Kuwait, therefore the parliament has the authority to remove an Emir from his post. The parliament effectively removed Saad al-Sabah from his post in 2006 due to his illness. Crown Prince The crown prince has to be a senior member of the House. He is nominated by a family council headed by prominent members of the family. The appointment of a crown prince requires approval by an absolute majority of the members of the Kuwaiti parliament, the National Assembly.

The reigning emir must appoint an heir apparent within one year of his accession to the throne; the nomination needs approval by the majority of members of Kuwait's parliament, the National Assembly. If the new crown prince fails to win approval from the National Assembly, the Emir submits three eligible members of the family for consideration, and the National Assembly selects one to be the crown prince. The Crown Prince has to be a senior member of the House of Sabah. The position of Emir is also traditionally alternated between the two main branches of the House of Sabah, the Al-Ahmed and Al-Salem branches. The Prime Minister is appointed by the Emir, however the appointment of the prime minister requires approval from the majority of members of the National Assembly parliament. Chieftain Sheikhs of the House of Sabah have been leading the Military of Kuwait since the early establishment of defense infantry and cavalry forces. Since the forming of the first cabinet on 17 January 1962, all three of the defense ministry, interior ministry and ministry of foreign affairs of Kuwait have been led by members of the House of Sabah. By government protocol, defense, interior and foreign affairs ministers are deputy prime ministers of Kuwait; unlike the defense protocol minister of the Kuwait National Guard.

Diplomatic history can be different from international relations in that the former can concern itself with the foreign policy of one state while the latter deals with relations between two or more states. Diplomatic history tends to be more concerned with the history of diplomacy, but international relations concern more with current events and creating a model intended to shed explanatory light on international politics.Matusumoto, Saho \\"Diplomatic History\\" pages 314-316 in Kelly Boyd, ed., The Encyclopedia of Historians and Historical Writing (1999) p. 314. History Historiography =Ranke= Thucydides was highly concerned with the relations among states. However the modern form of diplomatic history was codified in the 19th century by Leopold von Ranke, as the leading German historian of the 19th century. Ranke wrote largely on the history of Early Modern Europe, using the diplomatic archives of the European powers (particularly the Venetians) to construct a detailed understanding of the history of Europe wie es eigentlich gewesen (\\"as it actually happened.\\"). Ranke saw diplomatic history as the most important kind of history to write because of his idea of the \\"Primacy of Foreign Affairs\\" (Primat der Aussenpolitik), arguing that the concerns of international relations drive the internal development of the state. Ranke's understanding of diplomatic history relied on the large number of official documents produced by modern western governments as sources, which he argued should be examined in an objective and neutral spirit. =20th century scholars= In the early 20th centuries, work by prominent diplomatic historians such as Charles Webster, Harold Temperley, Alfred Pribram, R.H. Lord and B.E. Schmitt were mostly concerned with the events such as the Napoleonic Wars, the Congress of Vienna and the origins of the Franco-German War. A notable event in diplomatic history occurred in 1910 when the French government start to publish all of the archives relating to the war of 1870. The Bolsheviks in Russia published key secret papers from the Allies in 1918. Ranke's understanding of the dominance of foreign policy, and hence an emphasis on diplomatic history, remained the dominant paradigm in historical writing through the first half of the twentieth century. This emphasis, combined with the effects of the War Guilt Clause in the Treaty of Versailles (1919) which ended the First World War, led to a huge amount of historical writing on the subject of the origins of the war of 1914, with the involved governments printing huge, carefully edited, collections of documents and numerous historians writing multi-volume histories of the origins of the war.Covered in depth in William L. Langer, The diplomacy of imperialism: 1890-1902 (2nd ed. 1951) and A.J.P. Taylor, Struggle for Mastery in Europe 1848-1918 (Oxford UP, 1954) In the interwar period, most diplomatic historians tended to blame all of the Great Powers of 1914 for the First World War, arguing that the war was in effect everybody's responsibility. In general, the early works in this vein fit fairly comfortably into Ranke's emphasis on Aussenpolitik. Historian Muriel Chamberlain notes that after the First World War: : diplomatic history replaced constitutional history as the flagship of historical investigation, at once the most important, most exact and most sophisticated of historical studies.Muriel E Chamberlain, Pax Britannica'? British Foreign Policy 1789-1914 (1988) p 1 She adds that after 1945, the trend reversed, allowing political, intellectual and social history to displace diplomatic history. For the first half of the 20th century, most diplomatic history working within the narrow confines of the Primat der Aussenpolitik approach was very narrowly concerned with foreign-policy making elites with little reference to broader historical forces. The most notable exceptions to this tendency were A. J. P. Taylor and William Medlicott in Britain, Pierre Renouvin in France, and William L. Langer in the United States, who examined economic and domestic political forces. =Causes of World War Two= J. K Paasikivi (in the middle), the 7th President of the Republic of Finland, was remembered as a main architect of Finland's foreign policy, especially with the Soviet Union, which was at that time the war enemy of Finland. Sir Winston Churchill's multi-volume The Second World War, especially the first volume The Gathering Storm (1948) set the framework and the interpretation for much later historiography. His interpretation, echoing his own position before the war, that World War II was caused by the mad ambitions of Adolf Hitler; Churchill damned the cowardly and weak-willed British and French leaders who used appeasement in a futile effort to avoid the war. Churchill did not consider the argument that the alternative to appeasement was a premature war that Germany would win in 1938. The British historian A. J. P. Taylor's 1961 book The Origins of the Second World War challenged Churchill's viewpoint and argued that Hitler had no master-plan for conquering the world. Instead he was an ordinary statesman ‚Äì-an opportunistic leader seizing whatever chances he had for expansionism. The fact that a world war started over Poland in 1939 was due to diplomatic miscalculation by all the countries concerned, instead of being a case of German aggression. British historians such as D.C. Watt, Paul Kennedy, George Peden and David Dilks argued that appeasement was not an aberration, and that it was an old British tradition which in this case flowed from numerous structural, economic and military factors. Historians such as Christopher Thorne and Harry Hinsley abandoned the previous focus on individual leaders to discuss the broader societal influences such as public opinion and narrower ones like intelligence on diplomatic relations. In recent years the debates regarding the 1930s have continued, but new approaches are in use, such as an analysis in terms of Britain's national identity.Patrick Finney, \\"The romance of decline: The historiography of appeasement and British national identity.\\" Electronic Journal of International History 1 (2000) Online.Donald C. Watt, \\"The historiography of appeasement.\\" in Alan Sked and Chris Cook, eds. Crisis and controversy: Essays in honour of AJP Taylor (1976) pp 100+. =French approaches= A group of French historians centered around Pierre Renouvin (1893-1974) and his prot√©g√©s Jean-Baptiste Duroselle and Maurice Baumont started a new type of international history in the 1950s that included taking into account what Renouvin called ' (profound forces) such as the influence of domestic politics on French foreign policy. However, Renouvin and his followers still followed the concept of ' with Renouvin arguing that French society under the Third Republic was ‚Äúsorely lacking in initiative and dynamism‚Äù and Baumont arguing that French politicians had allowed \\"personal interests\\" to override \\"any sense of the general interest\\". In 1979, Duroselle's book La D√©cadence offered a total condemnation of the entire Third Republic as weak, cowardly and degenerate.Peter Jackson, ‚ÄúPost-War Politics and the Historiography of French Strategy and Diplomacy Before the Second World War\\" History Compass, Volume 4/5, 2006 pp 870-95S. W. Helprin, Some Twentieth-Century Historians (1961) pp 143-70 =Fischer debate on World War One= At the same time, in 1961 when the German historian Fritz Fischer published Griff nach der Weltmacht, which established that Germany had caused the First World War led to the fierce \\"Fischer Controversy\\" that tore apart the West German historical profession.Matusumoto, Saho \\"Diplomatic History\\" pages 314-316 from The Encyclopedia of Historians and Historical Writing page 315. One result of Fischer's book was the rise in the Primat der Innenpolitik (Primacy of Domestic Politics) approach. As a result of the rise of the Primat der Innenpolitik school, diplomatic historians increasing started to pay attention to domestic politics. In the 1970s, the conservative German historian Andreas Hillgruber, together with his close associate Klaus Hildebrand, was involved in a very acrimonious debate with the leftish German historian Hans-Ulrich Wehler over the merits of the Primat der Aussenpolitik (\\"primacy of foreign politics\\") and Primat der Innenpolitik (\\"primacy of domestic politics\\") schools.Kershaw, Ian The Nazi Dictatorship, London, Arnold, 2000, pp. 9-11. Hillgruber and Hildebrand made a case for the traditional Primat der Aussenpolitik approach to diplomatic history with the stress on examining the records of the relevant foreign ministry and studies of the foreign policy decision-making elite.Kershaw, Ian The Nazi Dictatorship, London, Arnold, 2000, pp. 9-10. Wehler, who favored the Primat der Innenpolitik approach, for his part contended that diplomatic history should be treated as a sub-branch of social history, calling for theoretically-based research, and argued that the real focus should be on the study of the society in question.Kershaw (2000), pp. 9-10. Moreover, under the influence of the Primat der Innenpolitik approach, diplomatic historians in the 1960s, 70s and 80s start to borrow models from the social sciences. =Mason-Overy debate on internal pressures inside Nazi Germany= A notable example of the Primat der Innenpolitik approach was the claim by the British Marxist historian Timothy Mason who claimed that the launch of World War II in 1939 was best understood as a ‚Äúbarbaric variant of social imperialism‚Äù.Kaillis, Aristotle Fascist Ideology, London: Routledge, 2000 page 7 Mason argued that ‚ÄúNazi Germany was always bent at some time upon a major war of expansion‚Äù.Kaillis, Aristotle Fascist Ideology, London: Routledge, 2000 page 165 However, Mason argued that the timing of such a war was determined by domestic political pressures, especially as relating to a failing economy, and had nothing to do with what Hitler wanted. In Mason's view in the period between 1936‚Äì41, it was the state of the German economy, and not Hitler's \\"will\\" or \\"intentions\\" that was the most important determinate on German decision-making on foreign policy.Kershaw, Ian The Nazi Dictatorship London : Arnold 2000 page 88. Mason argued that the Nazi leaders were deeply haunted by the November Revolution of 1918, and was most unwilling to see any fall in working class living standards out of the fear that it might provoke another November Revolution. According to Mason, by 1939, the ‚Äúoverheating‚Äù of the German economy caused by rearmament, the failure of various rearmament plans produced by the shortages of skilled workers, industrial unrest caused by the breakdown of German social policies, and the sharp drop in living standards for the German working class forced Hitler into going to war at a time and place not of his choosing.Kaillis, Aristotle Fascist Ideology, London: Routledge, 2000 pages 165-166 Mason contended that when faced with the deep socio-economic crisis the Nazi leadership had decided to embark upon a ruthless ‚Äúsmash and grab‚Äù foreign policy of seizing territory in Eastern Europe which could be pitilessly plundered to support living standards in Germany.Kaillis, Aristotle Fascist Ideology, London: Routledge, 2000 page 166 Mason's theory of a \\"Flight into war\\" being imposed on Hitler generated much controversy, and in the 1980s he conducted a series of debates with economic historian Richard Overy over this matter. Overy maintained the decision to attack Poland was not caused by structural economic problems, but rather was the result of Hitler wanting a localized war at that particular time in history. For Overy, a major problem with the Mason thesis was that it rested on the assumption that in a way unrecorded by the records, that information was passed on to Hitler about the Reich's economic problems.Mason, Tim & Overy, R.J. ‚ÄúDebate: Germany, \`domestic crisis‚Äô and the war in 1939‚Äù from The Origins of The Second World War edited by Patrick Finney, Edward Arnold: London, United Kingdom, 1997 page 102 Overy argued that there was a major difference between economic pressures inducted by the problems of the Four Year Plan, and economic motives to seize raw materials, industry and foreign reserve of neighboring states as a way of accelerating the Four Year Plan.Overy, Richard ‚ÄúGermany, ‚ÄòDomestic Crisis‚Äô and War in 1939‚Äù from The Third Reich edited by Christian Leitz, Blackwell: Oxford, 1999 pages 117-118 Moreover, Overy asserted that the repressive capacity of the German state as a way of dealing with domestic unhappiness was somewhat downplayed by Mason. =Japanese-American relations= In addition, because World War II was a global war, diplomatic historians start to focus on Japanese-American relations to understand why Japan had attacked the United States in 1941. This in turn led diplomatic historians to start to abandon the previous Euro- centric approach in favor of a more global approach.Saho Matusumoto, \\"Diplomatic History\\" in Kelly Boyd, ed., The Encyclopedia of Historians and Historical Writing (1999) pp 314-165 A sign of the changing times was the rise to prominence of such diplomatic historians such as the Japanese historian Chihiro Hosoya, the British historian Ian Nish, and the American historian Akira Iriye, which was the first time that Asian specialists became noted diplomatic historians. =Vietnam war and revisionism= The Cold War and decolonization greatly added the tendency to a more global diplomatic history. The Vietnam War led to the rise of a revisionist school in the United States, which led many American historians such as Gabriel Kolko and William Appleman Williams to reject traditional diplomatic history in favor of a Primat der Innenpolitik approach that saw a widespread examination of the influence of American domestic politics together with various social, economic and cultural forces on foreign-policy making. In general, the American Cold War revisionists tended to focus on American foreign policy decision-making with respect to the genesis of the Cold War in the 1940s and on how the United States became involved in Vietnam in the 1960s. Starting in the 1960s, a ferocious debate has taken place within Cold War historiography between the advocates of the ‚Äúorthodox‚Äù school which saw the Cold War as a case of Soviet aggression such as Vojtech Mastny against the proponents of the ‚Äúrevisionist‚Äù school which saw the Cold War as a case of American aggression. Latterly, a third school known as \\"neo-orthodox\\" whose most prominent member is the American historian John Lewis Gaddis has emerged, which holds through the United States borne some responsibility for the Cold War, the lion's share of the responsibility goes to the Soviet Union. =Recent trends= In Europe diplomatic history fell out of favor in the late Cold War era. Since the collapse of communism in 1989‚Äì91, however, there has been a renaissance, led especially by historians of the early modern era, in the history of diplomacy. The new approach differs from previous perspectives by the wholesale incorporation of perspectives from political science, sociology, the history of mentalities, and cultural history. In the U.S. since the 1980s, the discipline of diplomatic history has become more relevant to and better integrated with the mainstream of the academic history profession. It has taken the lead in internationalization of American historical studies. Since it explores the interaction of domestic and international forces, the field has become increasingly important for its study of culture and identity and the exploration of political ideologies as applied to foreign affairs. There have been major influences from other new approaches such as Orientalism and globalism, as well as gender and racial history.Thomas W. Zeiler, ‚ÄúThe Diplomatic History Bandwagon: A State of the Field,‚Äù Journal of American History (March 2009), v 95#4 pp 1053-73 The history of human rights has become important as well.Micheline R. Ishay, The history of human rights: From ancient times to the globalization era (2008) excerpt. Despite all these innovations, however, the core endeavor of diplomatic history remains the study of the state interacting with other states, which is also a key to its broadening appeal, since considerations of America's superpower status is essential to understanding the world internationally. In the early 1980s, historian Jeffrey Kimball surveyed the ideological preferences of 109 active diplomatic historians in the United States as well as 54 active military historians. He reports that: :Of historians in the field of diplomatic history, 7% are Socialist, 19% are Other, 53% are Liberal, 11% are None and 10% Conservative. Of military historians, 0% are Socialist, 8% are Other, 35% are Liberal, 18% are None and 40% are Conservative.Jeffrey Kimball, \\"The Influence of Ideology on Interpretive Disagreement: A Report on a Survey of Diplomatic, Military and Peace Historians on the Causes of 20th Century U. S. Wars,\\" The History Teacher (May, 1984) 17#3 pp. 355-384 in JSTOR Historical studies In Europe, diplomatic history fell out of favor in the late Cold War era. Since the collapse of communism, there has been a renaissance, led especially by historians of the early modern era, in the history of diplomacy. The new approach differs from previous perspectives by the wholesale incorporation of perspectives from political science, sociology, the history of mentalities, and cultural history.Matusumoto, Saho \\"Diplomatic History\\" pages 314-316 from The Encyclopedia of Historians and Historical Writing page 315 In the U.S. since 1980, the discipline of diplomatic history has become more relevant to and integrated with the mainstream of the historiographic profession, having been in the forefront of the internationalization of American historical studies. As a field that explores the meeting of domestic and international forces, the study of US foreign relations has become increasingly important for its examination of both the study of culture and identity and the exploration of political ideologies. Particularly shaped by the influence of studies of Orientalism and globalism, gender studies, race, and considerations of national identity, diplomatic history was often at the cutting edge of historical research. Despite such innovations, however, the core endeavor of diplomatic history remains the study of the state, which is also a key to its broadening appeal, since considerations of US state power are essential to understanding the world internationally.Zeiler (2009) Prominent diplomatic historians * Henry Brooks Adams, (1838‚Äì1918), US 1800‚Äì1816 * Henry Adams, U.S. * Charles A.

He served in the state legislatures of Virginia and Kentucky before being elected to the U.S. Senate and appointed United States Attorney General during the second term of President Thomas Jefferson. He is the progenitor of Kentucky's Breckinridge political family and the namesake of Breckinridge County, Kentucky. Breckinridge's father was a local politician, and his mother was a member of the Preston political family. Breckinridge attended the William and Mary College intermittently between 1780 and 1784; his attendance was interrupted by the Revolutionary War and his election to the Virginia House of Delegates. One of the youngest members of that body, his political activities acquainted him with many prominent politicians. In 1785, he married \\"Polly\\" Cabell, a member of the Cabell political family. Despite making a comfortable living through a combination of legal and agricultural endeavors, letters from relatives in Kentucky convinced him to move to the western frontier. He established \\"Cabell's Dale\\", his plantation, near Lexington, Kentucky, in 1793. Breckinridge was appointed as the state's attorney general soon after arriving. In November 1797, he resigned and was elected to the Kentucky House of Representatives the next month. As a legislator, he secured passage of a more humane criminal code that abolished the death penalty for all offenses except first-degree murder. On a 1798 trip to Virginia, an intermediary gave him Thomas Jefferson's Kentucky Resolutions, which denounced the Alien and Sedition Acts. At Jefferson's request, Breckinridge assumed credit for the modified resolutions he shepherded through the Kentucky General Assembly; Jefferson's authorship was not discovered until after Breckinridge's death. He opposed calling a state constitutional convention in 1799 but was elected as a delegate. Due to his influence, the state's government remained comparatively aristocratic, maintaining protections for slavery and limiting the power of the electorate. Called the father of the resultant constitution, he emerged from the convention as the acknowledged leader of the state's Democratic- Republican Party and was elected Speaker of the Kentucky House of Representatives in 1799 and 1800. Elected to the U.S. Senate in 1800, Breckinridge functioned as Jefferson's floor leader, guiding administration bills through the chamber that was narrowly controlled by his party. Residents of the western frontier called for his nomination as vice president in 1804, but Jefferson appointed him as U.S. Attorney General in 1805 instead. He was the first cabinet-level official from the West but had little impact before his death from tuberculosis on December 14, 1806. Early life and family John Breckinridge's grandfather, Alexander Breckenridge, immigrated from Ireland to Bucks County, Pennsylvania, around 1728, while the Breckinridge family originated in Ayrshire, Scotland, before migrating to Ulster (possibly County Antrim or County Londonderry) probably in the late 17th century.Davis notes that John Breckinridge changed the spelling of the family name for unknown reasons during his time in the Virginia House of Delegates between 1781 and 1784. See Davis, p. 5. In 1740, the family moved to Augusta County, Virginia, near the city of Staunton and this is where Alexander died in 1743. John Breckinridge was born there on December 2, 1760, the second of six children of Robert Breckenridge and his second wife, Lettice (Preston) Breckenridge.Klotter in The Breckinridges of Kentucky, p. 8. His mother was the daughter of John Preston of Virginia's Preston political family.\\"John Breckinridge\\". Dictionary of American Biography. Robert Breckinridge had two children by a previous marriage, and it was through one of these half-brothers that John Breckinridge was uncle to future Congressman James D. Breckinridge.The paternity of James D. Breckinridge is disputed; see The Breckinridges of Kentucky, p. 8. A veteran of the French and Indian War, Robert Breckinridge served first as Augusta County's under-sheriff, then sheriff, then justice of the peace. Soon after John Breckinridge's birth, the family moved to Botetourt County where Robert Breckinridge became a constable and justice of the peace, as well as serving in the local militia. He died in 1773, leaving 12-year-old John of land, one slave, and half-ownership of another slave.Klotter in The Breckiridges of Kentucky, p. 9. According to his biographer, Lowell H. Harrison, Breckinridge may have attended school, including Augusta Academy (now Washington and Lee University), but any records containing this information have been lost. After his father's death, the younger Breckinridge helped support the family by selling whiskey, brandy, and hemp.Harrison in \\"A Young Virginian\\", p. 21. He learned surveying from his uncle, William Preston, and between 1774 and 1779, he was employed as a recorder in the land office of Fincastle. Preston sought opportunities for his nephew to attend private schools alongside his sons, but such schools were prone to intermittent operation, and Breckinridge's other responsibilities interfered with his attendance.Harrison in John Breckinridge: Jeffersonian Republican, p. 5. Preston also nominated Breckinridge as deputy surveyor of Montgomery County, a position he accepted after passing the requisite exam on February 1, 1780.Harrison in John Breckinridge: Jeffersonian Republican, p. 6. Later that year, he joined his cousin, future Kentucky Senator John Brown, at William and Mary College (now College of William & Mary).Harrison in \\"A Young Virginian\\", p. 22. The instructors who influenced him most were Reverend James Madison and George Wythe. The Revolutionary War forced William and Mary to close in 1781, as its buildings were used as barracks for British, French, and American troops as each nation successively controlled the college and surrounding area.Harrison in John Breckinridge: Jeffersonian Republican, p. 7. Although William C. Davis records that Breckinridge had previously served as an ensign in the Botetourt County militia, Harrison notes that the most reliable records of Virginians' military service do not indicate his participation in the Revolutionary War, but less reliable sources mention him as a subaltern in the Virginia militia.Davis, p. 4.Harrison in John Breckinridge: Jeffersonian Republican, p. 20. If he enlisted, Harrison speculates that he served in one or two short 1780 militia campaigns supporting Nathanael Greene's army in southwest Virginia.Harrison in John Breckinridge: Jeffersonian Republican, p. 9. =Early political career= Although he had not sought the office and was not old enough to serve, Breckinridge was elected to represent Botetourt County in the Virginia House of Delegates in late 1780. Legend says he was twice refused his seat because of his age, but his constituents reelected him each time, and he was seated the third time, but official records do not support this.Harrison in John Breckinridge: Jeffersonian Republican, p. 10. His legislative colleagues included Patrick Henry, Benjamin Harrison, John Tyler, John Taylor of Caroline, George Nicholas, Daniel Boone, and Benjamin Logan.Klotter in The Breckinridges of Kentucky, pp. 9‚Äì10.Harrison in \\"A Young Virginian\\", p. 24. Prevented by British soldiers from meeting at Williamsburg, the House convened May 7, 1781, in Richmond, but failed to achieve a quorum. Because of British General Charles Cornwallis' May 10 advance on that city, the legislators adjourned to Charlottesville on May 24. Breckinridge arrived in Charlottesville on May 28; a quorum was present to conduct legislative business through June 3. The next morning, Jack Jouett rode into the city, warning the legislators that 250 light cavalrymen under Banastre Tarleton were approaching. Legislators quickly adjourned to Staunton and fled for their horses. Days later, they completed the session's business there. Breckinridge stayed at his mother's house between sessions, rejoining the legislature in Richmond in November 1781. Much of the session consisted of adopting resolutions of thanks for individuals who had made that city safe by defeating Cornwallis at Yorktown.Harrison in John Breckinridge: Jeffersonian Republican, p. 11. Financial difficulties prevented Breckinridge's return to college.Klotter in The Breckinridges of Kentucky. He did not seek reelection in 1782; instead, he spent a year earning money by surveying, and was reelected to the House of Delegates in 1783, joining his legislative colleagues in May. He also joined the Constitutional Society of Virginia; fellow society members included future U.S. presidents James Madison and James Monroe.Klotter in The Breckinridges of Kentucky, p. 11. The House adjourned June 28, 1783, and Breckinridge returned to William and Mary, studying through the end of the year, excepting the legislative session in November and December.Harrison in \\"A Young Virginian\\", p. 25. With the war over, he urged that no economic or political penalties be imposed on former Loyalists. In contrast to his later political views, he desired a stronger central government than provided for in the Articles of Confederation; he argued that the national government could not survive unless it could tax its citizens, a power it did not have under the Articles.Harrison in \\"John Breckinridge: Western Statesman\\", p. 138. Financial problems caused Breckinridge to leave William and Mary after the spring semester in 1784.Harrison in \\"A Young Virginian\\", p. 23. Because of his studies earlier in the year, he had no time to campaign for reelection to the House of Delegates, so he asked his brother Joseph and his cousin John Preston to campaign on his behalf.Harrison, in \\"A Young Virginian\\", p. 26. Initially, his prospects seemed favorable, but he was beaten by future Virginia Congressman George Hancock. After the defeat, voters from Montgomery County - where Breckinridge had previously been a surveyor - chose him to represent them in the House. He was appointed to the prestigious committees on Propositions and Grievances, Courts of Justice, Religion, and Investigation of the Land Offices. His fellow committee members included Henry Tazewell, Carter Henry Harrison, Edward Carrington, Spencer Roane, John Marshall, Richard Bland Lee, and Wilson Cary Nicholas.Harrison in John Breckinridge: Jeffersonian Republican, p. 13. Inspired by his legislative service, he spent the summer between legislative sessions studying to become a lawyer.Harrison in \\"A Young Virginian\\", p. 27. The legislative session focused on domestic issues like whether Virginia should establish a tax to benefit religion in the state.Harrison in John Breckinridge: Jeffersonian Republican, p. 14. Breckinridge was not associated with any denomination, and his writings indicate that he was opposed to such a tax.Harrison in John Breckinridge: Jeffersonian Republican, p. 15. Instead, he and James Madison secured approval of a religious liberty bill first proposed by Thomas Jefferson over five years earlier. The legislature rose on January 7, 1785, and Breckinridge was admitted to the bar later that year, beginning practice in Charlottesville.\\"Breckinridge, John\\", Biographical Directory of the United States Congress. =Marriage and children= Mary Hopkins (\\"Polly\\") Cabell Breckinridge On June 28, 1785, Breckinridge married Mary Hopkins (\\"Polly\\") Cabell, daughter of Joseph Cabell, a member of the Cabell political family. As a dowry, he received a 400-acre (1.6-km2) plantation in Albemarle County dubbed \\"The Glebe\\". Nine children were born to the John and Polly Breckinridge - Letitia Preston (b. 1786), Joseph \\"Cabell\\" (b. 1787), Mary Hopkins (b. 1790), Robert (b. 1793), Mary Ann (b. 1795), John (b. 1797), Robert Jefferson (b. 1800), William Lewis (b. 1803), and James Monroe (b. 1806).Klotter in The Breckinridges of Kentucky, pp. 11, 33. Polly, Cabell, and Letitia all fell ill but survived a smallpox epidemic in 1793; however, Mary Hopkins and Robert died.Klotter in The Breckinridges of Kentucky, p. 32. Cabell would later serve as Speaker of the Kentucky House of Representatives and Kentucky's Secretary of State.Klotter in The Breckinridges of Kentucky, p. 40. He was the father of U.S. Vice President John C. Breckinridge.Klotter in The Kentucky Encyclopedia, p. 116. The younger John Breckinridge attended Princeton Theological Seminary, served as chaplain of the U.S. House of Representatives, and was president of Oglethorpe College (now Oglethorpe University) in Georgia. Robert Jefferson was appointed superintendent of public instruction under Governor William Owsley and became known as the father of Kentucky's public education system. William Lewis became a prominent Presbyterian minister, serving as moderator of the Presbyterian General Assembly in 1859 and later as president of Centre College in Danville, Kentucky, and Oakland College in Yale, Mississippi. In 1804, Letitia married Alfred W. Grayson, son of Virginia Senator William Grayson.Klotter in The Breckinridges of Kentucky, p. 33. Alfred Grayson died in 1808, and in 1816, Letitia married Peter Buell Porter, who would later serve as Secretary of War under President John Quincy Adams. The Glebe's profits were barely enough for Breckinridge's growing family.Harrison in \\"A Young Virginian\\", p. 28. His legal career provided enough money for some comforts but required long hours and difficult work.Harrison in \\"A Young Virginian\\", p. 30. Patrick Henry regularly represented clients opposite Breckinridge, and John Marshall both referred clients to him and asked him to represent his own clients in his absence. Though still interested in politics, Breckinridge refused to campaign for the people's support.Harrison in \\"A Young Virginian\\", p. 31. He believed changes were needed to the Articles of Confederation and agreed with much of the proposed U.S. constitution, but he did not support equal representation of the states in the Senate nor the federal judiciary.Harrison in John Breckinridge: Jeffersonian Republican, p. 38. Heeding the advice of his brother James and his friend, Archibald Stuart, he did not seek election as a delegate to Virginia's ratification convention. Relocation to Kentucky Breckinridge's half-brothers, Andrew and Robert, moved to Kentucky in 1781, and his brother William followed in 1783.Harrison in \\"A Virginian Moves to Kentucky\\", pp. 202‚Äì203. By 1785, Andrew and Robert were trustees of Louisville.Klotter in The Breckinridges of Kentucky, p. 12. Their letters described Kentucky's abundant land and plentiful legal business, in contrast to the crowded bar and scarce unclaimed land in Virginia. By 1788, Breckinridge was convinced that Kentucky offered him more opportunity, and the next year, he traveled west to seek land on which to construct an estate.Harrison in \\"John Breckinridge of Kentucky\\", p. 205.Harrison in \\"A Virginian Moves to Kentucky\\", p. 203. Although inaccurate reports of his death reached Virginia, he arrived safely in Kentucky on April 15, 1789, and returned to Virginia in June.Harrison in \\"A Virginian Moves to Kentucky\\", p. 205. The following year, he paid 360 pounds sterling for along the North Elkhorn Creek about from present-day Lexington, Kentucky. The land, purchased from his only sister Betsy's father-in-law, lay adjacent to land owned by his sister, and in 1792, he purchased an adjacent , bringing his total holdings in Kentucky to .Harrison in \\"John Breckinridge of Kentucky\\", p. 206. After the purchase, he instructed William Russell, a friend already living in Kentucky, to find tenants to lease and improve the land.Harrison in \\"A Virginian Moves to Kentucky\\", p. 206. In February 1792, Breckinridge, a Democratic-Republican, was elected to the U.S. House of Representatives over token opposition.Harrison in \\"A Young Virginian\\", p. 32. On the date of the election, he wrote to Archibald Stuart, \\"The People appearing willing to elect, I could have no objection to serve them one Winter in Congress.\\"Harrison in \\"A Virginian Moves to Kentucky\\", p. 209. Despite this, he left for Kentucky in March 1793 and resigned without serving a day in Congress, which convened on March 4.Harrison in \\"A Young Virginian\\", p. 34. He chose the longer but safer route to Kentucky, joining a group of flatboats at Brownsville, Pennsylvania, for the trip down the Monongahela and Ohio rivers to Limestone (now Maysville, Kentucky).Harrison in \\"A Virginian Moves to Kentucky\\", pp. 210‚Äì211. His family, along with 25 slaves, arrived in April and established their plantation, Cabell's Dale.Harrison in \\"John Breckinridge of Kentucky\\", p. 210. By the time of Breckinridge's move, he owned in Kentucky. Domestic life in Kentucky When he arrived in Kentucky, much of Breckinridge's land was occupied by tenant farmers whose leases had not yet expired. He planted rye and wheat on of unleased land and sent 11 slaves and an overseer to clear land for the fall planting. Eventually, his crops at Cabell's Dale included corn, wheat, rye, barley, hay, grass seed, and hemp, but he refused to grow tobacco, a major cash crop, which he found too vulnerable to over-cultivation. He also bred thoroughbred horses, planted an orchard, and practiced law. He engaged in land speculation, particularly in the Northwest Territory, and at various times owned interests in iron and salt works, but these ventures were never very successful.Harrison in \\"John Breckinridge: Western Statesman\\", p. 142. As his plantation became more productive, Breckinridge became interested in ways to sell his excess goods.Harrison in \\"John Breckinridge of Kentucky\\", p. 208. On August 26, 1793, he became a charter member of the Democratic Society of Kentucky, which lobbied the federal government to secure unrestricted use of the Mississippi River from Spain.Harrison and Klotter, p. 73. Breckinridge was elected chairman, Robert Todd and John Bradford were chosen as vice-chairmen, and Thomas Todd and Thomas Bodley were elected as clerks.Harrison in John Breckinridge: Jeffersonian Republican, p. 54. Breckinridge authored a tract entitled Remonstrance of the Citizens West of the Mountains to the President and Congress of the United States and may have also written To the Inhabitants of the United States West of the Allegany (sic) and Apalachian (sic) Mountains. He pledged funding to French minister Edmond-Charles Gen√™t's proposed military operation against Spain, but Gen√™t was recalled before it could be executed.Klotter in The Breckinridges of Kentucky, p. 18. Although alarmed that frontier settlers might initiate war with Spain, President George Washington made no immediate attempt to obtain use of the Mississippi, which the society maintained was \\"the natural right of the citizens of this Commonwealth\\". The resistance of the eastern states, particularly Federalist politicians, caused Breckinridge to reconsider his support of a strong central government.Klotter in The Breckinridges of Kentucky, p. 19. Breckinridge was also concerned with easing overland transport of goods to Virginia. In mid-1795, he, Robert Barr, Elijah Craig, and Harry Toulmin formed a committee to raise funds for a road connecting the Cumberland Gap to central Kentucky. Breckinridge was disappointed with the quality of the route, which was finished in late 1796, concluding that the individual maintaining it was keeping most of the tolls instead of using them for the road's upkeep. Breckinridge was also interested in education. Before moving to Kentucky, he accumulated a substantial library of histories, biographies, law and government texts, and classical literature. Frequently, he allowed aspiring lawyers and students access to the library, which was one of the most extensive in the west.Klotter in The Breckinridges of Kentucky, p. 15. He also provided funding for a municipal library in Lexington. His lobbying for a college to be established in Lexington bore fruit with the opening of Transylvania Seminary (now Transylvania University) in 1788. He was elected to the seminary's board of trustees on October 9, 1793, and supported hiring Harry Toulmin as president in February 1794 and consolidating the seminary with Kentucky Academy in 1796.Harrison in John Breckinridge: Jeffersonian Republican, pp. 64‚Äì65. Conservatives on the board and in the Kentucky General Assembly forced Toulmin - a liberal Unitarian - to resign in 1796, and Breckinridge's enthusiasm for his trusteeship waned. He attended board meetings less frequently and resigned in late 1797.Harrison in John Breckinridge: Jeffersonian Republican, p. 65. Kentucky Attorney General Kentucky needed qualified governmental leaders, and on December 19, 1793, Kentucky Governor Isaac Shelby appointed Breckinridge attorney general.Harrison in John Breckinridge: Jeffersonian Republican, pp. 59, 61. Three weeks after accepting, he was offered the post of District Attorney for the Federal District of Kentucky, but he declined.Harrison in John Breckinridge: Jeffersonian Republican, p. 62. Secretary of State Edmund Randolph directed Shelby to prevent French agents in Kentucky from organizing an expedition against Spanish Louisiana.Harrison in John Breckinridge: Jeffersonian Republican, p. 59. On Breckinridge's advice, Shelby responded that he lacked the authority to interfere. Lack of funding prevented the expedition, but Shelby's noncommittal response helped prompt passage of the Neutrality Act of 1794 which outlawed participation by U.S. citizens in such expeditions.Harrison in John Breckinridge: Jeffersonian Republican, p. 60. Humphrey Marshall defeated Breckinridge for a Senate seat in 1794. In November 1794, the Democratic-Republicans nominated Breckinridge to succeed John Edwards in the U.S. Senate.Harrison and Klotter, p. 75. Federalists were generally unpopular in Kentucky, but the signing of Pinckney's Treaty - which temporarily secured Kentucky's use of the Mississippi River - and Anthony Wayne's expedition against the Indians in the Northwest Territory prompted a surge of support for the federal government in Kentucky.Harrison in John Breckinridge: Jeffersonian Republican, p. 63. The election's first ballot reflected this, as Federalist candidate Humphrey Marshall received 18 votes to Breckinridge's 16, John Fowler's 8, and 7 votes for the incumbent Edwards. On the runoff ballot, Marshall was elected over Breckinridge by a vote of 28‚Äì22. Harrison posits that Marshall's incumbency in the General Assembly may have aided his election but notes that Marshall downplayed its significance. In May 1796, Kentucky's gubernatorial electors convened to choose Shelby's successor. Their votes were split among four candidates; frontiersman Benjamin Logan received 21 votes, Baptist minister James Garrard received 17, Thomas Todd received 14, and Breckinridge's cousin, Senator John Brown, received 1. The Kentucky Constitution did not specify whether a plurality or a majority was required for election, but the electors held a runoff vote. Most of Todd's supporters voted for Garrard, and he won the election. Breckinridge claimed he had no authority to intervene but declared that, as a private citizen, he believed Logan should be governor. The state senate was authorized to settle disputed elections, but they, too, refused to intervene. Breckinridge resigned as attorney general on November 30, 1797; the extension of the attorney general's duties to include representing the state in federal district court as well as the Kentucky Court of Appeals, and reluctance to serve under Garrard after publicly declaring he had no right to his office may have contributed to the decision.Harrison in John Breckinridge: Jeffersonian Republican, pp. 62, 72. A month later, he declared his candidacy to fill a vacancy in the Fayette County delegation to the Kentucky House of Representatives.Harrison in John Breckinridge: Jeffersonian Republican, p. 72. Of the 1,323 votes cast, he garnered 594 (45%), the most of any of the six candidates in the race. Kentucky House of Representatives Breckinridge pressed to reform the state's criminal code, which was based on the English system and imposed the death penalty for over 200 different crimes.Harrison and Klotter, p. 83. Inspired by Thomas Jefferson's failed attempt to reform Virginia's code, he first asked the Lexington Democratic Society to study ways to make punishments more proportional to crimes in November 1793. By 1796, he was drafting a new code based on the principles that criminals should be rehabilitated, victims should be compensated for their injury, the public should be reimbursed for the cost of prosecuting the criminal, and the punishment's severity should serve as a deterrent for would-be offenders. In January 1798, he introduced his proposed code in the General Assembly. A month later, the Assembly reformed the code, abolishing the death penalty for every crime except first-degree murder. =Kentucky Resolutions= In August, Breckinridge traveled to Virginia's Sweet Springs to improve his health.Harrison in John Breckinridge: Jeffersonian Republican, p. 74. He visited family and friends while there, but the exact dates and locations he visited are not known.Harrison in John Breckinridge: Jeffersonian Republican. At some point, he obtained a draft of resolutions written by Vice President Thomas Jefferson denouncing the recently-enacted Alien and Sedition Acts. Jefferson wished to keep his authorship secret, and Breckinridge accepted credit for them during his life. In 1814, John Taylor revealed Jefferson's authorship; Breckinridge's grandson, John C. Breckinridge, wrote Jefferson for confirmation of Taylor's claims. Cautioning that the passage of time and his failing memory might cause him to inaccurately recount the details, Jefferson responded that he, Breckinridge, Wilson Nicholas, and possibly James Madison met at Monticello, at a date Jefferson could not recall, to discuss the need for resolutions denouncing the Alien and Sedition Acts.Harrison in John Breckinridge: Jeffersonian Republican, pp. 75‚Äì76. They decided that Jefferson would pen the resolutions and that Breckinridge would introduce them in the Kentucky legislature upon his return to that state. Thomas Jefferson composed the original Kentucky Resolutions. Letters between Nicholas and Jefferson indicate a different series of events.Harrison in John Breckinridge: Jeffersonian Republican, p. 76. In a letter dated October 4, 1798, Nicholas informed Jefferson that he had given \\"a copy of the resolutions you sent me\\" to Breckinridge, who would introduce them in Kentucky. The letter also indicated that this was a deviation from the original plan to deliver the draft to a legislator in North Carolina for introduction in the legislature there.Schachner, p. 613. Nicholas felt that recipient was too closely associated with Jefferson, risking his being discovered as the resolutions' author. According to Nicholas, Breckinridge wanted to discuss the draft with Jefferson, but Nicholas advised against the meeting, fearing it could implicate Jefferson. A subsequent letter from Jefferson expressed his approval of Nicholas' actions. Lowell Harrison notes that after Breckinridge left Virginia, his contacts with Jefferson were few until his election to the Senate in 1801. Harrison considered it unlikely that Jefferson was mistaken about a meeting between the two to discuss a matter as important as the resolutions, positing that Jefferson may have met separately with Breckinridge and Nicholas to discuss the resolutions, and that the meeting with Breckinridge was kept secret from Nicholas.Harrison in John Breckinridge: Jeffersonian Republican, p. 77. Because of the uncertainty surrounding Breckinridge's activities in Virginia in 1798, the extent of his influence on Jefferson's original draft of the resolutions is unknown. In Garrard's November 5, 1798, State of the Commonwealth address, he encouraged the General Assembly to declare its views on the Alien and Sedition Acts.Harrison in John Breckinridge: Jeffersonian Republican, p. 78. Breckinridge was chosen as chairman of a three-person committee to carry out the governor's charge. The resolutions that the committee brought to the floor on November 10 became known as the Kentucky Resolutions.Klotter in The Breckinridges of Kentucky, p. 20. The first seven were exactly as Jefferson had written them, but Breckinridge modified the last two, eliminating Jefferson's suggestion of nullifying the unpopular acts.Harrison and Klotter, p. 82. During the debate on the House floor, Breckinridge endorsed nullification if Congress would not repeal the acts after a majority of states declared their opposition to them. Federalist William Murray led opposition to the resolutions in the House but was the only dissenting vote on five of the nine; John Pope led similarly unsuccessful Federalist opposition in the Senate. Upon concurrence of both houses, Garrard signed the resolutions. Federalist state legislatures, primarily those north of the Potomac River, sent the Kentucky General Assembly negative responses to the resolutions. Nicholas convinced Jefferson that Kentucky should adopt a second set of resolutions affirming the first, lest the lack of a reply be seen acquiescence.Schachner, p. 627. Jefferson refused to compose these resolutions, maintaining that there were sufficiently talented individuals in Kentucky to compose them and fearing still that he would be discovered as the author of the first set. Breckinridge, chosen Speaker of the Kentucky House of Representatives at the outset of the 1799 session, took on the task, drafting resolutions reasserting the original principles and endorsing nullification.Although some historians have questioned Breckinridge's authorship of the second set of resolutions, Jefferson biographer Nathan Schachner noted that original drafts of those resolutions, in Breckinridge's handwriting, are among his papers housed at the Library of Congress. See Schachner, p. 628. The resolutions unanimously passed the House. The Federalist minority in the Senate opposed them, especially the endorsement of nullification, but that chamber also adopted the resolutions as written. Breckinridge's presumed authorship of the original resolutions and his subsequent defense of them caused his popularity to soar in Kentucky. =Kentucky Constitution of 1799= Some Kentucky citizens were already displeased with parts of the state's constitution, and the disputed gubernatorial election of 1796 had added to the enthusiasm of those calling for a constitutional convention to revise it. Breckinridge opposed such a call, fearing changes would imperil his wealth and power.Harrison and Klotter, p. 76. John Breckinridge asked, \\"Where is the difference whether I am robbed of my horse by a highway-man, or of my slave by a set of people called a Convention? ‚Ä¶ If they can by one experiment emancipate our slaves; the same principle pursued, will enable them at a second experiment to extinguish our land titles; both are held by rights equally sound.\\"Friend, Craig Thompson. 2010. Kentucke's Frontiers. Indiana University Press, p. 208. The desire for a convention was so strong, even in aristocratic Fayette County, that Breckinridge's position nearly cost him his seat in the legislature.Harrison in John Breckinridge: Jeffersonian Republican, p. 100. Seeking election to a full term in May 1798, he was the seventh-highest vote-getter, securing the last of Fayette County's seats in the legislature by only eight votes.Klotter in The Breckinridges of Kentucky, pp. 19‚Äì20. Despite the efforts of conservatives like Breckinridge and George Nicholas, in late 1798, the General Assembly called a convention for July 22, 1799. Delegates to the convention were to be elected in May 1799, and the conservatives immediately began organizing slates of candidates that would represent their interests. Popular because of his role in securing adoption of the Kentucky Resolutions, Breckinridge was among the six conservative candidates promoted in Fayette County, all of whom were elected.Harrison in John Breckinridge: Jeffersonian Republican, p. 101. Out of the fifty-eight men who arrived in Frankfort in late July as convention delegates, fifty-seven owned slaves and fifty held substantial property.Friend, p. 209. Between the election and the convention, Breckinridge and Judge Caleb Wallace worked with Nicholas (who did not seek election as a delegate) to draft resolutions that Breckinridge would introduce at the convention in an attempt to steer the proceedings toward conservative positions.Harrison and Klotter, p. 77. The largest group of delegates at the convention - about 18 in number - were aristocrats who advocated protection of their wealth and status, including instituting voice voting in the legislature (which left legislators vulnerable to intimidation), safeguarding legal slavery, and limiting the power of the electorate. A smaller group led by Green Clay and Robert Johnson consisted mostly of planters who opposed most limits on the power of the legislature, which they believed was superior to the executive and judicial branches. A third group, led by future governor John Adair, agreed with the notion of legislative supremacy, but opposed limits on other branches of the government. The smallest group was the most populist and was led by John Bailey. The conservative faction strengthened the previous constitution's slavery protections by denying suffrage to free blacks and mulattoes. Legislative apportionment based on population, the addition of a lieutenant governor, and voice voting of the legislature - all issues advocated by Breckinridge - were also adopted.Harrison and Klotter, p. 78. He was unable to preserve the electoral college that elected the governor and state senators, but the direct election of these officers was balanced by a provision that county sheriffs and judges be appointed by the governor and confirmed by the Senate.Klotter in The Breckinridges of Kentucky, p. 27.Harrison in \\"John Breckinridge: Western Statesman\\", p. 141. Attempts to make judicial decisions subject to legislative approval were defeated after Breckinridge defended the extant judicial system. He was also the architect of the constitution's provisions for amendment, which made changing the document difficult, but not entirely impossible. Because of his leading role in the convention, Breckinridge was regarded as the father of the resultant constitution, which was ratified in 1799, and emerged from the convention as the leader of his party. He was reelected as Speaker of the House in 1800. U.S. Senator On November 20, 1800, the Kentucky General Assembly elected Breckinridge to the U.S. Senate by a vote of 68‚Äì13 over John Adair.Harrison in John Breckinridge: Jeffersonian Republican, p. 110. He was eligible for the special congressional session called for March 4, 1801, but his summons to the session remained undelivered at the Lexington post office until March 5, and he consequently missed the entire session. When he left for Washington, D.C., late in the year, he left several of his pending legal cases in the hands of rising attorney Henry Clay, who would later become U.S. Secretary of State.Klotter in The Breckinridges of Kentucky, p. 28. Although Democratic- Republicans held a narrow majority in the Senate, the Federalist senators were both experienced and devoted their cause. Breckinridge acted as floor leader for the Democratic-Republicans and newly elected president, Thomas Jefferson. His proposed repeal of the Federalist-supported Judicial Act of 1801, which had increased the number of federal courts and judges, was particularly controversial.Klotter in The Kentucky Encyclopedia, p. 117. On January 4, 1802, he presented caseload data to argue that the new courts and judges were unnecessary. Federalist leader Gouverneur Morris countered that the proposal was unconstitutional; once established, courts were inviolate, he maintained.Harrison in John Breckinridge: Jeffersonian Republican, p. 142. On January 20, Federalist Jonathan Dayton moved to return the bill to a committee to consider amendments.Harrison in \\"John Breckinridge: Western Statesman\\", p. 143.Harrison in John Breckinridge: Jeffersonian Republican, p. 144. South Carolina's John E. Colhoun, a Democratic-Republican, voted with the Federalists, and the result was a 15‚Äì15 tie. Empowered to break the tie, Jefferson's vice president, Aaron Burr, voted with the Federalists. The five- man committee consisted of three Federalists, enough to prevent the bill's return to the floor, but when Vermont Senator Stephen R. Bradley, who had traveled home because of a family illness, returned to the chamber, the Democratic-Republicans regained a majority and introduced a successful discharge petition.Schachner, p. 703. In one last attempt to derail the legislation in debate, Federalists argued that the judiciary would strike down the repeal as unconstitutional; Breckinridge denied the notion that the courts had the power to invalidate an act of Congress. On February 3, the Senate repealed the act by a vote of 16‚Äì15, with the House concurring a month later. =Louisiana Purchase= Breckinridge advocated internal improvements and formed a coalition of legislators from South Carolina, Georgia, Tennessee and Kentucky to support a system of roads connecting the Southern coastal states with the western frontier, but the routes they proposed proved impossible to construct with the technology available at the time.Harrison in \\"John Breckinridge of Kentucky\\", p. 209. Spanish revocation of Kentucky's right of deposit at New Orleans - in violation of Pinckney's Treaty - further frustrated and angered frontier residents.Harrison and Klotter, p. 84. Although many desired war with Spain, Jefferson believed a diplomatic resolution was possible and urged restraint.Harrison in \\"John Breckinridge: Western Statesman\\", p. 144. Federalists, seeking to divide the Democratic- Republicans and curry favor with the West, abandoned their usual advocacy of peace. Pennsylvania Federalist James Ross introduced a measure allocating $5 million and raising 50,000 militiamen to seize the Louisiana Territory from Spain. Cognizant of Jefferson's desire for more time, Breckinridge offered a substitute resolution on February 23, 1803, allocating 80,000 troops and unlimited funds for the potential invasion of New Orleans, but he left their use at the discretion of the president. Breckinridge's resolution was adopted after a heated debate. The Louisiana Purchase, superimposed on a map of the modern United States Before an invasion became necessary, U.S. ambassadors learned that Spain had ceded Louisiana to France via the Third Treaty of San Ildefonso, and France offered to sell the territory to the U.S. Robert R. Livingston and James Monroe, U.S. ministers to France, agreed to the purchase, even though they had not been given the authority to do so. Jefferson was pleased with the purchase, but feared he had no constitutional authority to effect it. In an August 12, 1803 letter to Breckinridge, Jefferson discussed his constitutional misgivings about the Louisiana Purchase and proposed that Breckinridge introduce a simple constitutional amendment in the Senate: \\"Louisiana, as ceded by France to the U.S., is made a part of the U.S.\\"Harrison and Klotter, p. 85. Breckinridge ignored the proposed amendment and immediately formed a coalition of western senators to approve the purchase. After the purchase was approved, Jefferson drafted a system of governing the newly acquired territory.Peterson, p. 780. Fearing that the Federalists would oppose any system he had devised, he delivered his draft to Breckinridge and asked him to introduce it in the Senate as his own.Peterson, p. 781. To maintain the ruse, Breckinridge moved that a committee be formed to recommend a plan for governing Louisiana Territory.Peterson, p. 782. Working through the committee, he brought Jefferson's plan to the Senate floor with its essentials intact. Because the plan provided for the taxation of Louisiana residents without giving them representation in Congress, Federalists and some Democratic-Republicans opposed it. Nevertheless, it passed by a vote of 26‚Äì6.Harrison in \\"John Breckinridge: Western Statesman\\", p. 145. =Consideration for the vice presidency= By July 1803, citizens of the western states, desiring more representation in the federal government and intent on breaking the pattern of nominating a Virginians and New Yorkers for most important federal offices, were advocating Breckinridge's nomination as vice president in the 1804 presidential election.Klotter in The Breckinridges of Kentucky, p. 31. Thomas Jefferson was expected to be reelected, but most Democratic-Republicans had grown disenchanted with Vice President Aaron Burr; he would not be Jefferson's running mate.Harrison in \\"John Breckinridge and the Vice-Presidency\\", p. 155. Breckinridge's service as Senate floor leader made him a natural choice. George Clinton was nominated for vice president in 1804 instead of Breckinridge. The Democratic-Republican congressional caucus convened February 25, 1804.Harrison in \\"John Breckinridge and the Vice- Presidency\\", p. 158. Contrary to previous conventions, the proceedings were open and formal. Afraid that taking vice presidential nominations from the floor would precipitate divisive oratory, chairman Stephen Bradley called for open balloting for the nomination. New York's George Clinton received a majority with 67 votes; Breckinridge garnered 20 votes, mostly from western delegates, and the remaining votes were scattered among 4 other candidates. Historian James C. Klotter concluded that the solons felt a ticket composed of Jefferson, a Virginian, and Breckinridge, a former Virginian, made little political sense. Breckinridge acceded to the choice; some reports hold that he asked his colleagues not to vote for him at all. Before the caucus adjourned, a thirteen-man committee was formed to promote the election of the Democratic- Republican ticket; Breckinridge represented Kentucky on the committee. Westerners expressed dissent over Clinton's nomination instead of their preferred candidate.Harrison in \\"John Breckinridge and the Vice-Presidency\\", p. 159. The June 29, 1804, edition of Philadelphia's Independent Gazetteer carried an editorial, signed \\"True American\\", that denounced the Virginia-New York coalition, attacked Clinton as too old, and called for electors to vote for Breckinridge for vice president. Potential electors in western states pledged to carry out \\"True American\\"'s proposal.Harrison in \\"John Breckinridge and the Vice-Presidency\\", p. 160. Allan B. Magruder attempted to warn Breckinridge in advance of the editorial's publication, but his letter - dated June 23, 1804 - did not reach Breckinridge until July 1.Harrison in John Breckinridge: Jeffersonian Republican, p. 176. On July 5, Breckinridge published a response in the Kentucky Palladium denouncing the proposal and encouraging electors to vote for the Democratic-Republican slate as nominated. He requested that all newspapers that had printed the \\"True American\\" editorial also print his response. In the same edition that carried Breckinridge's response, Daniel Bradford, editor of the Kentucky Gazette, penned an editorial revealing Breckinridge's close friend, William Stevenson, as the author of the \\"True American\\" article and noting that Breckinridge had waited nearly a week to publish a response, and claiming the delay was intended to allow him to gauge public sentiment before denouncing Stevenson's proposal.Harrison in John Breckinridge: Jeffersonian Republican, p. 177. Bradford had been at odds with Breckinridge since the 1799 constitutional convention, and his dislike intensified when Breckinridge refused to use his influence to gain appointments for Bradford's relatives - John Bradford and James Bradford - as Public Printer of the United States and Secretary of Louisiana Territory, respectively.Harrison in \\"John Breckinridge and the Vice- Presidency\\", p. 162. Bradford's claims were quickly endorsed by anonymous editorial writers in newspapers across the west.Harrison in \\"John Breckinridge and the Vice-Presidency\\", p. 161. Stevenson swore under oath that Breckinridge had no part in composing the \\"True American\\" article. Breckinridge publicly stated that Bradford's brother, Charles, had shown him a draft of the \\"True American\\" editorial prior to its publication and asked his opinion of it; Breckinridge advised him not to publish it, and Bradford temporarily obliged. An illness, Breckinridge said, had confined him to his home at the time of the editorial's publication, and he was not aware that the Independent Gazetteer had printed it until he attended the court at Frankfort days later; he immediately returned home and composed his rebuttal. In light of this evidence, few still maintained the credibility of the reports in the Kentucky Gazette by the time of the election.Harrison in \\"John Breckinridge: Western Statesman\\", p. 148. Every Kentucky elector voted for both Jefferson and Clinton. =Other Senate matters= After the Louisiana Purchase, Breckinridge focused on securing a vote to present the Twelfth Amendment to the states for ratification.Harrison in John Breckinridge: Jeffersonian Republican, p. 171. He did not agree with all the changes effected by the amendment, the primary purpose of which was to direct presidential electors to vote separately for president and vice president; he supported abolishing the electoral college, electing both officials by popular vote.Harrison in John Breckinridge: Jeffersonian Republican, pp. 171‚Äì172. Democratic-Republicans wanted the amendment adopted before the 1804 election to avoid Jefferson's being saddled with a hostile vice president again, and Breckinridge announced his support for the amendment in late October. With several members of his party absent, he would not be able to secure the two-thirds majority needed to send the amendment to the states for ratification. Recognizing this fact, Federalists pushed for an immediate vote, putting Breckinridge in the position of trying to delay a vote on a measure both he and his constituents supported. Debate began on November 23 after several Democratic-Republicans had returned. South Carolina Federalist Pierce Butler contended that the amendment would allow large states to pick the president; James Jackson, a Democratic-Republican from Georgia, countered by taunting, \\"Never will there be a Federal President or Vice-President again elected, to the end of time.\\" Federalists moved adjournment at 6:00 p.m. on December 2, but Breckinridge, determined to hold a vote that night, blocked the move and took the floor for the first time in days.Harrison in John Breckinridge: Jeffersonian Republican, p. 172. By 10:00 p.m., senators clamored for a vote, and the measure was approved 22‚Äì10. State legislatures quickly acted on the amendment, and by September 23, 1804, it was declared in force for the upcoming election. Other business in the session included creating a special fund that would allow Jefferson to recover the , which had been captured off the coast of northern Africa, and the repeal of the Bankruptcy Act of 1800; Breckinridge supported the passage of both measures.Harrison in John Breckinridge: Jeffersonian Republican, pp. 173‚Äì174. He feared that passage of an act making permanent the pay raises for executive administrative personnel first enacted in 1799 would hurt his party in the upcoming elections, especially in the House, but the act passed and there was no significant backlash at the polls.Harrison in John Breckinridge: Jeffersonian Republican, p. 173. Robert Wright's measure adjourning Congress to Baltimore, Maryland, in protest of legislators' poor accommodations in Washington, D.C., was defeated by a vote of 9‚Äì19, but Breckinridge considered the issue of moving the U.S. capital worthy of further study.Harrison in John Breckinridge: Jeffersonian Republican, p. 174. Breckinridge supported the successful impeachment of federal judge John Pickering and also served on the Senate committee that prepared the rules governing the impeachment of Supreme Court Justice Samuel Chase.Harrison in John Breckinridge: Jeffersonian Republican, pp. 173, 178. The latter impeachment was widely seen as politically motivated, and some Democratic-Republicans joined the Federalist minority in voting for acquittal.Harrison in John Breckinridge: Jeffersonian Republican, p. 180. Majorities were obtained on only three of the eight articles of impeachment, and each of those fell at least three votes short of the required two-thirds majority. Breckinridge and three other Democratic- Republicans voted to convict on every article except the fifth, on which every senator sided with Chase. U.S. Attorney General When U.S. Attorney General Levi Lincoln resigned in December 1804, Jefferson and Treasury Secretary Albert Gallatin sought a replacement.Harrison in \\"Attorney General John Breckinridge\\", p. 320. Virginia's John Thomson Mason, Gallatin's first choice, declined the appointment.Harrison in \\"Attorney General John Breckinridge\\", p. 321. U.S. Navy Secretary Robert Smith desired the office, and Jefferson agreed to appoint him, contingent upon finding a suitable replacement for Smith as Secretary of the Navy.Langeluttig, p. 260. Jefferson appointed Massachusetts Congressman Jacob Crowninshield to replace Smith, and both appointments were confirmed by the Senate March 3, 1805. Crowninshield refused his appointment, however, and Smith was forced to remain as Secretary of the Navy. Jefferson then offered the position to Breckinridge, Gallatin's second choice. Breckinridge resigned from the Senate on August 7, 1805 to accept the appointment. He was the first U.S. cabinet-level official from west of the Allegheny Mountains, and his appointment boosted Jefferson's popularity in the west. Lowell Harrison called the appointment a mistake by Jefferson, not because Breckinridge lacked any qualifications, but because Jefferson was not able to replace his leadership in the Senate.Harrison in \\"John Breckinridge: Western Statesman\\", p. 149. He noted that after Breckinridge's departure from the chamber, the Federalist minority experienced a revival of influence under the leadership of Connecticut's Uriah Tracy.Harrison in \\"John Breckinridge: Western Statesman\\", p. 150. Stopping to visit with friends en route to Washington, D.C., Breckinridge arrived on December 7, 1805. His nomination was confirmed by the Senate on December 20.Harrison in \\"Attorney General John Breckinridge\\", p. 322. He was influential in Jefferson's infrequent cabinet meetings, where he served as the lone voice of the west. His most notable advisory opinion - that no local government in the Territory of Orleans had the power to tax federal property there - was upheld in the Supreme Court by Chief Justice John Marshall in McCulloch v. Maryland. He was sworn in to represent the federal government before the Supreme Court when it convened - about a week late because of the illness of several justices - on February 12, 1806.Harrison in \\"Attorney General John Breckinridge\\", p. 323. He was spared the awkwardness of practicing before a judge he had voted to impeach because Samuel Chase was absent for the Court's entire six-week term.Harrison in John Breckinridge: Jeffersonian Republican, p. 190. The court heard only six cases during the term; most of them were cases Breckinridge had inherited from his predecessor, and Harrison wrote that none were of lasting importance. Cases such as Maley v. Shattuck involved international maritime law - an area with which Breckinridge was not familiar - and arose from the Napoleonic Wars, which complicated neutral American trade with both Great Britain and France. During the term, Breckinridge lost four cases, won one, and the justices sent one back for retrial in a lower court. Death and legacy Breckinridge returned to Cabell's Dale in early 1806 and fell ill in June. In July, he visited Kentucky's Olympian Springs, hoping it would aid his recovery, but it did not.Klotter in The Breckinridges of Kentucky, p. 34. Doctors disagreed on the cause of his illness, with diagnoses ranging from typhus fever to stomach ailments. He attempted to return to Washington, D.C., on October 22, but while his horse was being prepared for the journey, he collapsed in pain and had to be helped back inside.Harrison in John Breckinridge: Jeffersonian Republican, p. 198. Friends and relatives hoped for a recovery that never came, and he died on December 14, 1806. The cause of death was eventually determined to be tuberculosis. According to family tradition, Polly Breckinridge was so distraught over her husband's death that she went blind from her incessant crying.Klotter in The Breckinridges of Kentucky, p. 39. Breckinridge was first buried at Cabell's Dale on December 16 but was later reinterred in Lexington Cemetery. At the time of his death, Breckinridge owned over of land, and his net worth was estimated at more than $20,000.Harrison in John Breckinridge: Jeffersonian Republican, p. 132. With a workforce of nearly 70 slaves, he was one of the largest slaveholders in the state.Klotter in The Breckinridges of Kentucky, p. 24. The breeding of horses and mules at Cabell's Dale had become more profitable than selling the excess crops raised there.Harrison in John Breckinridge: Jeffersonian Republican, p. 124. His daughter, Mary Ann, and her husband, David Castleman, inherited the horse and mule breeding operations, which eventually became the thoroughbred stable of Castleton Lyons.\\"History\\".

For the hedonist, constant pleasure-seeking may not yield the most actual pleasure or happiness in the long run‚Äîor even in the short run, when consciously pursuing pleasure interferes with experiencing it. The utilitarian philosopher Henry Sidgwick was first to note in The Methods of Ethics that the paradox of hedonism is that pleasure cannot be acquired directly. Variations on this theme appear in the realms of ethics, philosophy, psychology, and economics. Overview It is often said that we fail to attain pleasures if we deliberately seek them. This has been described variously, by many: * John Stuart Mill, the utilitarian philosopher, in his autobiography: > But I now thought that this end [one's happiness] was only to be attained by > not making it the direct end. Those only are happy (I thought) who have > their minds fixed on some object other than their own happiness[....] Aiming > thus at something else, they find happiness along the way[....] Ask yourself > whether you are happy, and you cease to be so.John Stuart Mill, > Autobiography in The Harvard Classics, Vol. 25, Charles Eliot Norton, ed. > (New York: P. F. Collier & Son Company, 1909 (p. 94) * Viktor Frankl in Man's Search for Meaning: > Happiness cannot be pursued; it must ensue, and it only does so as the > unintended side effect of one's personal dedication to a cause greater than > oneself or as the by-product of one's surrender to a person other than > oneself. > The more a man tries to demonstrate his sexual potency or a woman her > ability to experience orgasm, the less they are able to succeed. Pleasure > is, and must remain, a side-effect or by-product, and is destroyed and > spoiled to the degree to which it is made a goal in itself.Viktor Frankl. > Man's Search for Meaning. * Philosopher Friedrich Nietzsche in The Antichrist (1895) and The Will to Power (1901): > What is good? Everything that heightens the feeling of power in man, the > will to power, power itself. > What is bad? Everything that is born of weakness. > What is happiness? The feeling that power increases‚Äîthat a resistance is > overcome.The Antichrist, ¬ß 2 > [...] it is significantly enlightening to substitute for the individual > 'happiness' (for which every living being is supposed to strive) power [...] > joy is only a symptom of the feeling of attained power [...] (one does not > strive for joy [...] joy accompanies; joy does not move)The Will to Power, ¬ß > 688 * Psychologist Alfred Adler in The Neurotic Constitution (1912): > Nietzsche's \\"will to power\\" and \\"will to seem\\" embrace many of our views, > which again resemble in some respects the views of F√©r√© and the older > writers, according to whom the sensation of pleasure originates in a feeling > of power, that of pain in a feeling of feebleness. * Poet and satirist Edward Young: > The love of praise, howe'er concealed by art, > Reigns more or less supreme in every heart; > The Proud to gain it, toils on toils endure; > The modest shun it, but to make it sure!Geoffrey Brennan.

If, for whatever reason, one does equate happiness with pleasure, then the paradox of hedonism arises. When one aims solely towards pleasure itself, one's aim is frustrated. Henry Sidgwick comments on such frustration after a discussion of self-love in the above-mentioned work: > I should not, however, infer from this that the pursuit of pleasure is > necessarily self-defeating and futile; but merely that the principle of > Egoistic Hedonism, when applied with a due knowledge of the laws of human > nature, is practically self-limiting; i.e., that a rational method of > attaining the end at which it aims requires that we should to some extent > put it out of sight and not directly aim at it.Henry Sidgwick. The Methods > of Ethics. BookSurge Publishing (1 March 2001) (p. 3) While not addressing the paradox directly, Aristotle commented on the futility of pursuing pleasure. Human beings are actors whose endeavors bring about consequences, and among these is pleasure. Aristotle then argues as follows: > How, then, is it that no one is continuously pleased? Is it that we grow > weary? Certainly all human things are incapable of continuous activity. > Therefore pleasure also is not continuous; for it accompanies > activity.Aristotle. Nicomachean Ethics, Book X, page 4 Sooner or later, finite beings will be unable to acquire and expend the resources necessary to maintain their sole goal of pleasure; thus, they find themselves in the company of misery. Evolutionary theory explains that humans evolved through natural selection and follow genetic imperatives that seek to maximize reproduction, not happiness. As a result of these selection pressures, the extent of human happiness is limited biologically. David Pearce argues in his treatise The Hedonistic Imperative that humans might be able to use genetic engineering, nanotechnology, and neuroscience to eliminate suffering in all human life and allow for peak levels of happiness and pleasure that are currently unimaginable.

Hedonism Utilitarianism Philosophical paradoxes ","title":"Paradox of hedonism"},{"id":"177885","text":"Esotropia is a form of strabismus in which one or both eyes turns inward. The condition can be constantly present, or occur intermittently, and can give the affected individual a \\"cross-eyed\\" appearance. It is the opposite of exotropia and usually involves more severe axis deviation than esophoria. Esotropia is sometimes erroneously called \\"lazy eye\\", which describes the condition of amblyopia‚Äîa reduction in vision of one or both eyes that is not the result of any pathology of the eye and cannot be resolved by the use of corrective lenses. Amblyopia can, however, arise as a result of esotropia occurring in childhood: In order to relieve symptoms of diplopia or double vision, the child's brain will ignore or \\"suppress\\" the image from the esotropic eye, which when allowed to continue untreated will lead to the development of amblyopia. Treatment options for esotropia include glasses to correct refractive errors (see accommodative esotropia below), the use of prisms and/or orthoptic exercises and/or eye muscle surgery. The term is from Greek eso meaning \\"inward\\" and trope meaning \\"a turning\\". Types = Concomitant esotropia = Concomitant esotropia ‚Äì that is, an inward squint that does not vary with the direction of gaze ‚Äì mostly sets in before 12 months of age (this constitutes 40% of all strabismus cases) or at the age of three or four. Most patients with \\"early-onset\\" concomitant esotropia are emmetropic, whereas most of the \\"later-onset\\" patients are hyperopic. It is the most frequent type of natural strabismus not only in humans, but also in monkeys. Concomitant esotropia can itself be subdivided into esotropias that are ether constant, or intermittent. ; Constant esotropia : A constant esotropia, as the name implies, is present all the time. ; Intermittent esotropia : Intermittent esotropias, again as the name implies, are not always present. In very rare cases, they may only occur in repeated cycles of 'one day on, one day off' (Cyclic Esotropia). However, the vast majority of intermittent esotropias are accommodative in origin. A patient can have a constant esotropia for reading, but an intermittent esotropia for distance (but rarely vice versa). = Accommodative esotropia = Child exhibiting uncorrected accommodative esotropia Child exhibiting corrected accommodative esotropia Accommodative esotropia (also called refractive esotropia) is an inward turning of the eyes due to efforts of accommodation. It is often seen in patients with moderate amounts of hyperopia. The person with hyperopia, in an attempt to \\"accommodate\\" or focus the eyes, converges the eyes as well, as convergence is associated with activation of the accommodation reflex. The over-convergence associated with the extra accommodation required to overcome a hyperopic refractive error can precipitate a loss of binocular control and lead to the development of esotropia. The chances of an esotropia developing in a hyperopic child will depend to some degree on the amount of hyperopia present. Where the degree of error is small, the child will typically be able to maintain control because the amount of over-accommodation required to produce clear vision is also small. Where the degree of hyperopia is large, the child may not be able to produce clear vision no matter how much extra-accommodation is exerted and thus no incentive exists for the over-accommodation and convergence that can give rise to the onset of esotropia. However, where the degree of error is small enough to allow the child to generate clear vision by over-accommodation, but large enough to disrupt their binocular control, esotropia will result. Only about 20% of children with hyperopia greater than +3.5 diopters develop strabismus. Where the esotropia is solely a consequence of uncorrected hyperopic refractive error, providing the child with the correct glasses and ensuring that these are worn all the time, is often enough to control the deviation. In such cases, known as 'fully accommodative esotropias,' the esotropia will only be seen when the child removes their glasses. Many adults with childhood esotropias of this type make use of contact lenses to control their 'squint.' Some undergo refractive surgery for this purpose. A second type of accommodative esotropia also exists, known as 'convergence excess esotropia.' In this condition the child exerts excessive accommodative convergence relative to their accommodation. Thus, in such cases, even when all underlying hyperopic refractive errors have been corrected, the child will continue to squint when looking at very small objects or reading small print. Even though they are exerting a normal amount of accommodative or 'focusing' effort, the amount of convergence associated with this effort is excessive, thus giving rise to esotropia. In such cases an additional hyperopic correction is often prescribed in the form of bifocal lenses, to reduce the degree of accommodation, and hence convergence, being exerted. Many children will gradually learn to control their esotropias, sometimes with the help of orthoptic exercises. However, others will eventually require extra-ocular muscle surgery to resolve their problems. = Congenital esotropia = Congenital esotropia, or infantile esotropia, is a specific sub-type of primary concomitant esotropia. It is a constant esotropia of large and consistent size with onset between birth and six months of age. It is not associated with hyperopia, so the exertion of accommodative effort will not significantly affect the angle of deviation. It is, however, associated with other ocular dysfunctions including oblique muscle over- actions, Dissociated Vertical Deviation (DVD), Manifest Latent Nystagmus, and defective abduction, which develops as a consequence of the tendency of those with infantile esotropia to 'cross fixate.' Cross fixation involves the use of the right eye to look to the left and the left eye to look to the right; a visual pattern that will be 'natural' for the person with the large angle esotropia whose eye is already deviated towards the opposing side. The origin of the condition is unknown, and its early onset means that the affected individual's potential for developing binocular vision is limited. The appropriate treatment approach remains a matter of some debate. Some ophthalmologists favour an early surgical approach as offering the best prospect of binocularity whilst others remain unconvinced that the prospects of achieving this result are good enough to justify the increased complexity and risk associated with operating on those under the age of one year. = Incomitant esotropia = Incomitant esotropias are conditions in which the esotropia varies in size with direction of gaze. They can occur in both childhood and adulthood, and arise as a result of neurological, mechanical or myogenic problems. These problems may directly affect the extra-ocular muscles themselves, and may also result from conditions affecting the nerve or blood supply to these muscles or the bony orbital structures surrounding them. Examples of conditions giving rise to an esotropia might include a VIth cranial nerve (or Abducens) palsy, Duane's syndrome or orbital injury. Diagnosis = Classification =  Right, left or alternating  Someone with esotropia will squint with either the right or the left eye but never with both eyes simultaneously. In a left esotropia, the left eye 'squints,' and in a right esotropia the right eye 'squints.' In an alternating esotropia, the patient is able to alternate fixation between their right and left eye so that at one moment the right eye fixates and the left eye turns inward, and at the next the left eye fixates and the right turns inward. This alteration between the left and right eye is mostly spontaneous, but may be voluntary in some cases. Where a patient tends to consistently fixate with one eye and squint with the other, the eye that squints is likely to develop some amblyopia. Someone whose squint alternates is very unlikely to develop amblyopia because both eyes will receive equal visual stimulation. It is possible to encourage alternation through the use of occlusion or patching of the 'dominant' or 'fixating' eye to promote the use of the other. Esotropia is a highly prevalent congenital condition.  Concomitant versus incomitant  Esotropias can be concomitant, where the size of the deviation does not vary with direction of gaze‚Äîor incomitant, where the direction of gaze does affect the size, or indeed presence, of the esotropia. The majority of esotropias are concomitant and begin early in childhood, typically between the ages of 2 to 4 years. Incomitant esotropias occur both in childhood and adulthood as a result of neurological, mechanical or myogenic problems affecting the muscles controlling eye movements.  Primary, secondary or consecutive  Concomitant esotropias can arise as an initial problem, in which case they are designated as \\"primary,\\" as a consequence of loss or impairment of vision, in which case they are designated as \\"secondary,\\" or following overcorrection of an initial exotropia in which case they are described as being \\"consecutive\\". The vast majority of esotropias are primary.  Treatment  The prognosis for each patient with esotropia will depend upon the origin and classification of their condition. However, in general, management will take the following course: # Identify and treat any underlying systemic condition. # Prescribe any glasses required and allow the patient time to 'settle into' them. # Use occlusion to treat any amblyopia present and encourage alternation. # Where appropriate, orthoptic exercises (sometimes referred to as Vision Therapy) can be used to attempt to restore binocularity. # Where appropriate, prismatic correction can be used, either temporarily or permanently, to relieve symptoms of double vision. # In specific cases, and primarily in adult patients, botulinum toxin can be used either as a permanent therapeutic approach, or as a temporary measure to prevent contracture of muscles prior to surgery # Where necessary, extra-ocular muscle surgery, like strabismus surgery, which is a surgery where the doctors physically move the muscle that is making the eye contract.

(Portrait of Paquius Proculo) In the study of history as an academic discipline, a primary source (also called an original source) is an artifact, document, diary, manuscript, autobiography, recording, or any other source of information that was created at the time under study. It serves as an original source of information about the topic. Similar definitions can be used in library science, and other areas of scholarship, although different fields have somewhat different definitions. In journalism, a primary source can be a person with direct knowledge of a situation, or a document written by such a person. Primary sources are distinguished from secondary sources, which cite, comment on, or build upon primary sources. Generally, accounts written after the fact with the benefit (and possible distortions) of hindsight are secondary.\\"Primary, secondary and tertiary sources\\". University Libraries, University of Maryland. A secondary source may also be a primary source depending on how it is used.\\"Primary and secondary sources \\". Ithaca College Library. For example, a memoir would be considered a primary source in research concerning its author or about their friends characterized within it, but the same memoir would be a secondary source if it were used to examine the culture in which its author lived. \\"Primary\\" and \\"secondary\\" should be understood as relative terms, with sources categorized according to specific historical contexts and what is being studied. Significance of source classification =History= From a letter of Philip II, King of Spain, 16th century In scholarly writing, an important objective of classifying sources is to determine their independence and reliability. In contexts such as historical writing, it is almost always advisable to use primary sources and that \\"if none are available, it is only with great caution that [the author] may proceed to make use of secondary sources.\\" Sreedharan believes that primary sources have the most direct connection to the past and that they \\"speak for themselves\\" in ways that cannot be captured through the filter of secondary sources. =Other fields= In scholarly writing, the objective of classifying sources is to determine the independence and reliability of sources. Though the terms primary source and secondary source originated in historiography as a way to trace the history of historical ideas, they have been applied to many other fields. For example, these ideas may be used to trace the history of scientific theories, literary elements, and other information that is passed from one author to another. In scientific literature, a primary source is the original publication of a scientist's new data, results, and theories. In political history, primary sources are documents such as official reports, speeches, pamphlets, posters, or letters by participants, official election returns, and eyewitness accounts. In the history of ideas or intellectual history, the main primary sources are books, essays, and letters written by intellectuals; these intellectuals may include historians, whose books and essays are therefore considered primary sources for the intellectual historian, though they are secondary sources in their own topical fields. In religious history, the primary sources are religious texts and descriptions of religious ceremonies and rituals. A study of cultural history could include fictional sources such as novels or plays. In a broader sense primary sources also include artifacts like photographs, newsreels, coins, paintings or buildings created at the time. Historians may also take archaeological artifacts and oral reports and interviews into consideration. Written sources may be divided into three types. *Narrative sources or literary sources tell a story or message. They are not limited to fictional sources (which can be sources of information for contemporary attitudes) but include diaries, films, biographies, leading philosophical works, and scientific works. *Diplomatic sources include charters and other legal documents which usually follow a set format. *Social documents are records created by organizations, such as registers of births and tax records. In historiography, when the study of history is subject to historical scrutiny, a secondary source becomes a primary source. For a biography of a historian, that historian's publications would be primary sources. Documentary films can be considered a secondary source or primary source, depending on how much the filmmaker modifies the original sources. The Lafayette College Library provides a synopsis of primary sources in several areas of study: > \\"The definition of a primary source varies depending upon the academic > discipline and the context in which it is used. > *In the humanities, a primary source could be defined as something that was > created either during the time period being studied or afterward by > individuals reflecting on their involvement in the events of that time. *In > the social sciences, the definition of a primary source would be expanded to > include numerical data that has been gathered to analyze relationships > between people, events, and their environment. *In the natural sciences, a > primary source could be defined as a report of original findings or ideas. > These sources often appear in the form of research articles with sections on > methods and results.\\"\\"Primary Sources: what are they?\\" . Lafayette College > Library. Finding primary sources Although many primary sources remain in private hands, others are located in archives, libraries, museums, historical societies, and special collections. These can be public or private. Some are affiliated with universities and colleges, while others are government entities. Materials relating to one area might be located in many different institutions. These can be distant from the original source of the document. For example, the Huntington Library in California houses many documents from the United Kingdom. In the US, digital copies of primary sources can be retrieved from a number of places. The Library of Congress maintains several digital collections where they can be retrieved. Some examples are American Memory and Chronicling America. The National Archives and Records Administration also has digital collections in Digital Vaults. The Digital Public Library of America searches across the digitized primary source collections of many libraries, archives, and museums. The Internet Archive also has primary source materials in many formats. In the UK, the National Archives provides a consolidated search of its own catalog and a wide variety of other archives listed on the Access to Archives index. Digital copies of various classes of documents at the National Archives (including wills) are available from DocumentsOnline. Most of the available documents relate to England and Wales. Some digital copies of primary sources are available from the National Archives of Scotland. Many County Record Offices collections are included in Access to Archives, while others have their own online catalogs. Many County Record Offices will supply digital copies of documents. In other regions, Europeana has digitized materials from across Europe while the World Digital Library and Flickr Commons have items from all over the world. Trove has primary sources from Australia. Most primary source materials are not digitized and may only be represented online with a record or finding aid. Both digitized and not digitized materials can be found through catalogs such as WorldCat, the Library of Congress catalog, the National Archives catalog, and so on. Using primary sources History as an academic discipline is based on primary sources, as evaluated by the community of scholars, who report their findings in books, articles, and papers. Arthur Marwick says \\"Primary sources are absolutely fundamental to history.\\"Marwick, Arthur. \\"Primary Sources: Handle with Care\\". In Sources and Methods for Family and Community Historians: A Handbook edited by Michael Drake and Ruth Finnegan. Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1997. Ideally, a historian will use all available primary sources that were created by the people involved at the time being studied. In practice, some sources have been destroyed, while others are not available for research. Perhaps the only eyewitness reports of an event may be memoirs, autobiographies, or oral interviews that were taken years later. Sometimes the only evidence relating to an event or person in the distant past was written or copied decades or centuries later. Manuscripts that are sources for classical texts can be copies of documents or fragments of copies of documents. This is a common problem in classical studies, where sometimes only a summary of a book or letter has survived. Potential difficulties with primary sources have the result that history is usually taught in schools using secondary sources. Historians studying the modern period with the intention of publishing an academic article prefer to go back to available primary sources and to seek new (in other words, forgotten or lost) ones. Primary sources, whether accurate or not, offer new input into historical questions and most modern history revolves around heavy use of archives and special collections for the purpose of finding useful primary sources. A work on history is not likely to be taken seriously as a scholarship if it only cites secondary sources, as it does not indicate that original research has been done. However, primary sources ‚Äì particularly those from before the 20th century ‚Äì may have hidden challenges. \\"Primary sources, in fact, are usually fragmentary, ambiguous, and very difficult to analyze and interpret.\\" Obsolete meanings of familiar words and social context are among the traps that await the newcomer to historical studies. For this reason, the interpretation of primary texts is typically taught as part of an advanced college or postgraduate history course, although advanced self-study or informal training is also possible. Strengths and weaknesses In many fields and contexts, such as historical writing, it is almost always advisable to use primary sources if possible, and \\"if none are available, it is only with great caution that [the author] may proceed to make use of secondary sources.\\" In addition, primary sources avoid the problem inherent in secondary sources in which each new author may distort and put a new spin on the findings of prior cited authors. However, a primary source is not necessarily more of an authority or better than a secondary source. There can be bias and tacit unconscious views that twist historical information. The errors may be corrected in secondary sources, which are often subjected to peer review, can be well documented, and are often written by historians working in institutions where methodological accuracy is important to the future of the author's career and reputation. Historians consider the accuracy and objectiveness of the primary sources that they are using and historians subject both primary and secondary sources to a high level of scrutiny. A primary source such as a journal entry (or the online version, a blog), at best, may only reflect one individual's opinion on events, which may or may not be truthful, accurate, or complete. Participants and eyewitnesses may misunderstand events or distort their reports, deliberately or not, to enhance their own image or importance. Such effects can increase over time, as people create a narrative that may not be accurate.Barbara W. Sommer and Mary Kay Quinlan, The Oral History Manual (2002) For any source, primary or secondary, it is important for the researcher to evaluate the amount and direction of bias.Library of Congress, \\" Analysis of Primary Sources\\" online 2007 As an example, a government report may be an accurate and unbiased description of events, but it may be censored or altered for propaganda or cover-up purposes. The facts can be distorted to present the opposing sides in a negative light. Barristers are taught that evidence in a court case may be truthful but may still be distorted to support or oppose the position of one of the parties. Classifying sources Many sources can be considered either primary or secondary, depending on the context in which they are examined. Moreover, the distinction between primary and secondary sources is subjective and contextual, so that precise definitions are difficult to make. A book review, when it contains the opinion of the reviewer about the book rather than a summary of the book, becomes a primary source. If a historical text discusses old documents to derive a new historical conclusion, it is considered to be a primary source for the new conclusion. Examples in which a source can be both primary and secondary include an obituary or a survey of several volumes of a journal counting the frequency of articles on a certain topic. Whether a source is regarded as primary or secondary in a given context may change, depending upon the present state of knowledge within the field. For example, if a document refers to the contents of a previous but undiscovered letter, that document may be considered \\"primary\\", since it is the closest known thing to an original source; but if the letter is later found, it may then be considered \\"secondary\\". In some instances, the reason for identifying a text as the \\"primary source\\" may devolve from the fact that no copy of the original source material exists, or that it is the oldest extant source for the information cited. Forgeries Historians must occasionally contend with forged documents that purport to be primary sources. These forgeries have usually been constructed with a fraudulent purpose, such as promulgating legal rights, supporting false pedigrees, or promoting particular interpretations of historic events. The investigation of documents to determine their authenticity is called diplomatics. For centuries, Popes used the forged Donation of Constantine to bolster the Papacy's secular power. Among the earliest forgeries are false Anglo-Saxon charters, a number of 11th- and 12th- century forgeries produced by monasteries and abbeys to support a claim to land where the original document had been lost or never existed. One particularly unusual forgery of a primary source was perpetrated by Sir Edward Dering, who placed false monumental brasses in a parish church.Everyone has Roots: An Introduction to English Genealogy by Anthony J. Camp, published by Genealogical Pub. Co., 1978 In 1986, Hugh Trevor-Roper authenticated the Hitler Diaries, which were later proved to be forgeries. Recently, forged documents have been placed within the UK National Archives in the hope of establishing a false provenance. However, historians dealing with recent centuries rarely encounter forgeries of any importance.Oscar Handlin and Arthur Meier Schlesinger, Harvard Guide to American History (1954) See also ;Examples *Monograph ;Others *Archival research *Historiography *Source criticism *Source literature *Source text *Historical document *Secondary source *Tertiary source *Original research *UNISIST model *Scientific journalism *Scholarly method References Bibliography Wood Gray (1991) [1964].

He is very often referred to as the Mad Hatter, though this term was never used by Carroll. The phrase \\"mad as a hatter\\" pre-dates Carroll's works. The Hatter and the March Hare are referred to as \\"both mad\\" by the Cheshire Cat, in Alice's Adventures in Wonderland in the sixth chapter titled \\"Pig and Pepper\\". Fictional character biography =Alice's Adventures in Wonderland= The March Hare and the Hatter put the Dormouse's head in a teapot, by Sir John Tenniel. The Hatter character, alongside all the other fictional beings, first appears in Lewis Carroll's 1865 novel Alice's Adventures in Wonderland. In it, the Hatter explains to Alice that he and the March Hare are always having tea because when he tried to sing for the foul-tempered Queen of Hearts, she sentenced him to death for \\"murdering the time\\", but he escapes decapitation. In retaliation, Time (referred to as \\"he\\" by the Hatter) halts himself in respect to the Hatter, keeping him stuck at 6:00 pm (or 18:00) forever. When Alice arrives at the tea party, the Hatter is characterised by switching places on the table at any given time, making short, personal remarks, asking unanswerable riddles and reciting nonsensical poetry, all of which eventually drives Alice away. The Hatter appears again as a witness at the Knave of Hearts' trial, where the Queen appears to recognise him as the singer she sentenced to death, and the King of Hearts also cautions him not to be nervous or he will have him \\"executed on the spot\\". =Through the Looking-Glass= The character also appears briefly in Carroll's 1871 Through the Looking- Glass, the sequel to Alice's Adventures in Wonderland, under the name \\"Hatta\\" ‚Äì alongside the March Hare under the name \\"Haigha\\", which is pronounced \\"hare\\". Sir John Tenniel's illustration depicts Hatta as sipping from a teacup as he did in the original novel. Alice does not comment on whether Hatta is the Hatter of her earlier dream. Characterization The Hatter enjoying a cup of tea and bread-and-butter, by Sir John Tenniel. =Etymology= Mercury was used in the manufacturing of felt hats during the 19th century, causing a high rate of mercury poisoning among those working in the hat industry. Mercury poisoning causes neurological damage, including slurred speech, memory loss, and tremors, which led to the phrase \\"mad as a hatter\\". In the Victorian age, many workers in the textile industry, including hatters, sometimes developed illnesses affecting the nervous system, such as central nervous system (CNS) tuberculosis, which is portrayed in novels like Alton Locke by Charles Kingsley and North and South by Elizabeth Gaskell, which Lewis Carroll had read. Many such workers were sent to Pauper Lunatic Asylums, which were supervised by Lunacy Commissioners such as Samuel Gaskell and Robert Wilfred Skeffington Lutwidge, Carroll's uncle. Carroll was familiar with the conditions at asylums and visited at least one, the Surrey County Asylum, himself, which treated patients with so-called non-restraint methods and occupied them, amongst others, in gardening, farming and hat-making. Besides staging theatre plays, dances and other amusements, such asylums also held tea-parties. =Appearance= Although, during the trial of the Knave of Hearts, the King of Hearts remarks upon the Hatter's headgear, Carroll does not describe the exact style of hat he wears. The character's signature top hat comes from John Tenniel's illustrations for the first edition, in which the character wears a large top hat with a hatband reading \\"In this style 10/6\\". This is further elaborated on in The Nursery \\"Alice\\", a shortened version of Alice's Adventures in Wonderland, adapted by the author himself for young children. Here it is stated that the character is wearing a hat on his head with a price tag containing the numbers 10 and 6, giving the price in pre-decimal British money as ten shillings and six pence (or half a guinea). =Personality= Illustration of the March Hare, one of the Hatter's tea party friends, by Sir John Tenniel. The Hatter and his tea party friend, the March Hare, are initially referred to as \\"both mad\\" by the distinctive Cheshire Cat. The first mention of both characters occurs in the sixth chapter of Carroll's Alice's Adventures in Wonderland, titled \\"Pig and Pepper\\", in a conversation between the child protagonist Alice and the Cheshire Cat, when she asks \\"what sort of people live about here?\\" to which the cat replies \\"in that direction lives a Hatter, and in that direction, lives a March Hare. Visit either you like: they're both mad!\\" Both then subsequently make their actual debuts in the seventh chapter of the same book, which is titled \\"A Mad Tea-Party\\". Hat making was the main trade in Stockport where Carroll grew up, and it was not unusual then for hatters to appear disturbed or confused; many died early as a result of mercury poisoning. However, the Hatter does not exhibit the symptoms of mercury poisoning, which include excessive timidity, diffidence, increasing shyness, loss of self-confidence, anxiety, and a desire to remain unobserved and unobtrusive.Hauth, Waldron (24 December 1983). \\"Did the Mad Hatter have mercury poisoning?\\". National Center for Biotechnology Information. Retrieved 5 January 2011. =Resemblance to Theophilus Carter= It has often been claimed that the Hatter's character may have been inspired by Theophilus Carter, an eccentric furniture dealer.Millikan, Lauren (5 March 2011). \\"The Mad Hatter\\". Carleton University. Retrieved 14 June 2015. Carter was supposedly at one time a servitor at Christ Church, one of the University of Oxford's colleges. This is not substantiated by university records. He later owned a furniture shop, and became known as the \\"Mad Hatter\\" from his habit of standing in the door of his shop wearing a top hat. Sir John Tenniel is reported to have come to Oxford especially to sketch him for his illustrations. There is no evidence for this claim, however, in either Carroll's letters or diaries.Maters, Kristin (27 January 2014). \\"Who Really Inspired Lewis Carroll's 'Alice' Characters?\\". Books Tell You Why. Retrieved 14 June 2015. Riddle In the chapter \\"A Mad Tea Party\\", the Hatter asks a much-noted riddle: \\"Why is a raven like a writing desk?\\" When Alice gives up trying to figure out why, the Hatter admits \\"I haven't the slightest idea!\\". Carroll originally intended the riddle to be without an answer, but after many requests from readers, he and others‚Äîincluding puzzle expert Sam Loyd‚Äîsuggested possible answers; in his preface to the 1896 edition of Alice's Adventures in Wonderland, Carroll wrote: Loyd proposed a number of alternative solutions to the riddle, including \\"because Poe wrote on both\\" (alluding to Poe's 1845 narrative poem The Raven) and \\"because the notes for which they are noted are not noted for being musical notes\\". The April 2017 edition of Bandersnatch, the Newsletter of the Lewis Carroll Society [Issue 172, , Apr 2017], published the following solution, proposed by puzzle expert Rick Hosburn: \\"Why is a Raven like a Writing-desk?\\" \\"Because one is a crow with a bill, while the other is a bureau with a quill!\\" The RSPB, in its definition of Raven, states: \\"The raven [...] is all black with a large bill, and long wings.\\" American author Stephen King provides an alternative answer to the Hatter's riddle in his 1977 horror novel The Shining. Snowbound and isolated \\"ten thousand feet high\\" in the Rocky Mountains, five-year-old Danny hears whispers of the malign \\"voice of the [Overlook] hotel\\" inside his head, including this bit of mockery: \\"Why is a raven like a writing desk? The higher the fewer, of course! Have another cup of tea!\\" In other media The Hatter has been featured in nearly every adaptation of Alice in Wonderland to date; he is usually the male lead despite being a supporting character. The character has been portrayed in film by Norman Whitten, Edward Everett Horton, Sir Robert Helpmann, Martin Short, Peter Cook, Anthony Newley, Ed Wynn, Andrew-Lee Potts, and Johnny Depp. In music videos, the Hatter has been portrayed by Tom Petty, Dero Goi, and Steven Tyler. He has also been portrayed on stage by Nikki Snelson and Katherine Shindle, and on television by John Robert Hoffman, Pip Donaghy and Sebastian Stan. In ballet adaptations, Steven McRae also portrayed him as a mad 'Tapper'. In March 2019, Chelsy Meiss became the first female soloist to play the Mad Hatter for the National Ballet of Canada. =Batman= The Mad Hatter (also referred to as \\"Jervis Tetch\\") is a supervillain and enemy of the Batman in DC comic books, making his first appearance in the October 1948 (#49) release of Batman. He is portrayed as a brilliant neurotechnician with considerable knowledge in how to dominate and control the human mind. He has also appeared in the Batman television series, animated series and various video games. Jervis Tetch is also a recurring bad guy in the TV series Gotham (TV series). In the series his sister is called Alice. =Disney= In the 1951 Walt Disney animated feature Alice in Wonderland, the Hatter appears as a short, hyperactive man with grey hair, a large nose and a comical voice. He was voiced by Ed Wynn in 1951, and by Corey Burton in his later appearances (Bonkers, House of Mouse). Alice stumbles upon the Hatter and the March Hare having an \\"un-birthday\\" party for themselves. The Hatter asks her the infamous riddle \\"why is a raven like a writing desk?\\", but when she tries to answer the Hatter and the March Hare think she is \\"stark raving mad\\" and the Hatter completely forgot that he even asked her the riddle. Throughout the course of the film, the Hatter pulls numerous items out of his hat, such as cake and smaller hats. His personality is that of a child, angry one second, happy the next. The Hatter and March Hare make a cameo appearance in a painting in the Tea Party Garden in the Kingdom Hearts video game and the Hatter is also a greetable character at the Disneyland Resort, Walt Disney World Resort, Tokyo Disney Resort, Disneyland Paris Resort and Hong Kong Disneyland. This version of the character was also a semi-regular on the Disney Afternoon series Bonkers and one of the guests in House of Mouse, where he even made a cameo appearance in one of the featured cartoon shorts.  2010 film  The Hatter appears in Tim Burton's 2010 version of Alice in Wonderland portrayed by Johnny Depp and given the name Tarrant Hightopp. In the film, the Hatter takes Alice toward the White Queen's castle and relates the terror of the Red Queen's reign while commenting that Alice is not the same as she once was. The Hatter subsequently helps Alice avoid capture by the Red Queen's guards by allowing himself to be seized instead. He is later saved from execution by the Cheshire Cat and calls for rebellion against the Red Queen. Near the end of the film, the Hatter unsuccessfully suggests to Alice that she could stay in Wonderland and consummate his feelings for her. Critical reception to Johnny Depp's portrayal of the Hatter was generally positive. David Edelstein of New York Magazine remarked that while the elements of the character suggested by Depp don't entirely come together, \\"Depp brings an infectious summer-stock zest to everything he does.\\" Bill Goodykoontz of The Arizona Republic said that \\"Depp is exactly what you'd expect, which is a good thing. Gap-toothed and leering, at times he looks like Madonna after sticking a fork in a toaster. How he finds his characters is anybody's guess, a sort of thrift-store warehouse of eccentricities, it seems like. But it works.\\" Owen Gleiberman of Entertainment Weekly had a more mixed opinion and commented that Depp as the Hatter is \\"a fantastic image, but once Depp opens his mouth, what comes out is a noisome Scottish brogue that makes everything he says sound more or less the same. The character offers no captivatingly skewed bat-house psychology. There isn't much to him, really‚Äîhe's just a smiling Johnny one-note with a secret hip-hop dance move‚Äîand so we start to react to him the way that Alice does to everything else: by wondering when he's going to stop making nonsense.\\" Kenneth Turan of Los Angeles Times stated that \\"there's no denying Depp's gifts and abilities, but this performance feels both indulgent and something we've all seen before.\\" =Wonderland: A New Alice= Frank Wildhorn composed the music to and co-wrote the music to Wonderland. In this adaption the Hatter is portrayed as a female, the villain of the story, and Alice's alter-ego and is a mad woman who longs to be Queen. She was played by Nikki Snelson in the original Tampa, Florida production, and then by Kate Shindle in the Tampa/Houston Tour, and the production on Broadway. =SyFy's Alice= This Hatter (Andrew-Lee Potts) is portrayed as a smuggler who starts off working as a double agent for the Queen of Hearts and the Wonderland Resistance in the story; over the course of the story, he begins to side more and more with the Resistance, and ends up falling in love with Alice as he helps her along the way. =American McGee's Alice= In the videogame American McGee's Alice, The Mad Hatter is portrayed as psychotic, literally gone \\"mad\\" and obsessed with time and clockworks, and considers himself to be a genius. He invents mechanical devices, often evidently using the bodies of living organisms for the base of his inventions, as he plans to do to all of Wonderland's inhabitants. He appears in Alice: Madness Returns in the same appearance, although this time, he requests Alice's help in retrieving his lost limbs from his former compatriots the March Hare and Dormouse. =Alice's Warped Wonderland= The Mad Hatter appeared in the Sunsoft's 2006 mobile game . The Mad Hatter is portrayed as a middle-school age boy in oversized clothes and a large hat that covers his whole head. Unlike most Wonderland residents, he acts rather bratty and rude to Ariko (the \\"Alice\\" of the game). In one of the bad endings, Mad Hatter is killed by a twisted Cheshire Cat. =The Looking Glass Wars= A spin-off of the traditional Alice in Wonderland story, Frank Beddor's The Looking Glass Wars features a character named Hatter Madigan, a member of an elite group of bodyguards known in Wonderland as the \\"Millinery\\" after the business of selling women's hats. He acts as the bodyguard of the rightful Queen, and as guide/guardian to the protagonist, Alyss Heart. =Alice in the Country of Hearts= The Japanese manga Alice in the Country of Hearts has been translated into English. The Hatter role is played by Blood Dupre, a crime boss and leader of a street gang called The Hatters, which controls one of the four territories of Wonderland. =Charisma Label= Sir John Tenniel's drawing of the Hatter, combined with a montage of other images from Alice in Wonderland, were used as a logo by Charisma Records from 1972 onwards. =Pandora Hearts= The Mad Hatter in Pandora Hearts manga series is a chain (creature from the Abyss) that was contracted by Xerxes Break. The hatter basically looks like a large top hat with flowery decorations (similar to Break's top hat) and a tattered cape. When summoned, it can destroy all chains and objects from the Abyss within a large area. T =Futurama= The TV series Futurama has a robot named Mad Hatterbot who is based on the Hatter. Seen only in the HAL Institute (an asylum for criminally insane robots) the Mad Hatterbot only says one line: \\"Change places!\\", which all in the room comply with when spoken. The price tag on his hat reads \\"5/3\\", a simplified form of the fraction 10/6. A minor character, he has been in the episodes \\"Insane in the Mainframe\\" and \\"Follow the Reader\\" as well as the film Futurama: Bender's Game. =Once Upon a Time= In Once Upon a Time, the Mad Hatter is presented as possessing the unique ability to cross dimensions through his hat, and has a daughter, Grace, who lost her mother as a result of a past deal with the Evil Queen. When the Queen offers him enough wealth to set his daughter up for life, he agrees to help her travel to Wonderland, but when it is revealed that the goal was for the Queen to retrieve her captured father, the Hatter is left trapped in Wonderland instead, as the portal will only allow two people to pass through it in either direction. Trapped in Wonderland, he was then driven mad as he attempted to find another way back to his world to reunite with his daughter. Season 1 Trapped in the Land Without Magic, the Mad Hatter- now known as 'Jefferson' as he lives in a mansion just on the outskirts of Storeybrooke- is one of the few who remembers his original life due to his insanity. His daughter has also been brought into Storeybrooke, but he has avoided making contact with her due to her new memories meaning that she would not recognise him. Unable to harness magic in this world, he attempts to recruit Emma to make a hat for him, but she is unable to harness her power, although Jefferson's knowledge of the curse gives Emma further proof that Henry is telling the truth. Regina later recruits Jefferson to help her create a curse to use on Emma, but Regina's efforts backfire and give Emma clear proof that the curse is real. Season 2 With the curse broken, Jefferson is eventually convinced to reunite with his daughter. =Ever After High= In the Netflix episode \\"Spring Unsprung\\", the Mad Hatter makes an appearance as Madeline Hatter's father. In the 47-minute special, he runs the Mad Hatter's Tea Shoppe in the town of Bookend, not far from Maddie's school Ever After High. He also runs a shop by the same name in Wonderland, but it was abandoned after the Evil Queen (Raven Queen's mother) cast a curse upon the land. =Shrek: The Musical= The Mad Hatter plays a small role as a fairytale creature (replacing the Gnome) and has two lines in songs including \\"They ridiculed my hat\\" and \\"I smell like sauerkraut\\". =The Man who became a Rabbit= A Burton's inspired Mad Hatter appears in \\"The Man who became a Rabbit\\" Music Video, an Indian version of Alice in Wonderland by Val√©rian MacRabbit and Lalkrishnan. Mad Hatter becomes Mac Hatter and gives one riddle to the main character : \\"Spread blood on the birthday cake\\".\\"The Man who became a Rabbit\\", Lalkrishnan / Val√©rian MacRabbit, The Freak Parade (2018) See also * The White Rabbit * The Mouse Notes References Sources  External links * Literary characters introduced in 1865 Hat makers Male characters in film Male characters in literature Male characters in television Lewis Carroll characters Once Upon a Time (TV series) characters Charisma Records Fictional eccentrics ","title":"Hatter (Alice's Adventures in Wonderland)"},{"id":"177907","text":"Harold Adams Innis (1894 ‚Äì 1952) was a Canadian professor of political economy at the University of Toronto and the author of seminal works on media, communication theory, and Canadian economic history. He helped develop the staples thesis, which holds that Canada's culture, political history, and economy have been decisively influenced by the exploitation and export of a series of \\"staples\\" such as fur, fishing, lumber, wheat, mined metals, and coal. The staple thesis dominated economic history in Canada from the 1930s to 1960s, and continues to be a fundamental part of the Canadian political economic tradition.Easterbrook, W.T. and Watkins, M.H. (1984) \\"The Staple Approach.\\" In Approaches to Canadian Economic History. Ottawa: Carleton Library Series, Carleton University Press, pp. 1‚Äì98. Innis's writings on communication explore the role of media in shaping the culture and development of civilizations.Babe, Robert E. (2000) \\"The Communication Thought of Harold Adams Innis.\\" In Canadian Communication Thought: Ten Foundational Writers. Toronto: University of Toronto Press, pp. 51‚Äì88. He argued, for example, that a balance between oral and written forms of communication contributed to the flourishing of Greek civilization in the 5th century BC.Heyer, Paul. (2003) Harold Innis. Lanham, MD: Rowman & Littlefield Publishers Inc., p. 66. He warned, however, that Western civilization is now imperiled by powerful, advertising-driven media obsessed by \\"present-mindedness\\" and the \\"continuous, systematic, ruthless destruction of elements of permanence essential to cultural activity.\\"Innis, Harold. (1952) Changing Concepts of Time. Toronto: University of Toronto Press, p. 15. His intellectual bond with Eric A. Havelock formed the foundations of the Toronto School of communication theory, which provided a source of inspiration for future members of the school: Marshall McLuhan and Edmund Snow Carpenter. Innis laid the basis for scholarship that looked at the social sciences from a distinctly Canadian point of view. As the head of the University of Toronto's political economy department, he worked to build up a cadre of Canadian scholars so that universities would not continue to rely as heavily on British or American- trained professors unfamiliar with Canada's history and culture. He was successful in establishing sources of financing for Canadian scholarly research.Watson, Alexander John. (2006) Marginal Man: The Dark Vision of Harold Innis. Toronto: University of Toronto Press, pp. 14‚Äì23. As the Cold War grew hotter after 1947, Innis grew increasingly hostile to the United States. He warned repeatedly that Canada was becoming a subservient colony to its much more powerful southern neighbor. \\"We are indeed fighting for our lives,\\" he warned, pointing especially to the \\"pernicious influence of American advertising.... We can only survive by taking persistent action at strategic points against American imperialism in all its attractive guises.\\" His views influenced some younger scholars, including Donald Creighton. Innis also tried to defend universities from political and economic pressures. He believed that independent universities, as centres of critical thought, were essential to the survival of Western civilization.Innis, Harold. (1951) \\"A Plea for Time.\\" In The Bias of Communication. Toronto: University of Toronto Press, pp. 83‚Äì89. His intellectual disciple and university colleague, Marshall McLuhan, lamented Innis's premature death as a disastrous loss for human understanding. McLuhan wrote: \\"I am pleased to think of my own book The Gutenberg Galaxy as a footnote to the observations of Innis on the subject of the psychic and social consequences, first of writing then of printing.\\"McLuhan, Marshall. (2005) Marshall McLuhan Unbound. Corte Madera, CA : Gingko Press v. 8, p. 8. This is a reprint of McLuhan's introduction to the 1964 edition of Innis's book The Bias of Communication first published in 1951. Rural roots =Early life= The one-room schoolhouse in Otterville, officially known as S.S.#1 South Norwich. The photo was taken around 1906. Innis is the boy with the cap, fifth from the right, back row. Innis would later teach for a few months at the school. Innis was born on November 5, 1894, on a small livestock and dairy farm near the community of Otterville in southwestern Ontario's Oxford County. As a boy he loved the rhythms and routines of farm life and he never forgot his rural origins.Creighton, Donald. Harold Adams Innis: Portrait of a Scholar. University of Toronto Press, pp. 8‚Äì9. His mother, Mary Adams Innis, had named him Herald, hoping he would become a minister in the strict evangelical Baptist faith that she and her husband William shared. At the time, the Baptist church was an important part of life in rural areas. It gave isolated families a sense of community and embodied the values of individualism and independence. Its far-flung congregations were not ruled by a centralized, bureaucratic authority.Watson, pp. 50‚Äì51. Innis became an agnostic in later life, but never lost his interest in religion.Babe, Robert. Canadian Communication Thought: Ten Foundational Writers, University of Toronto Press, p. 51. According to his friend and biographer Donald Creighton, Innis's character was moulded by the church: > The strict sense of values and the feeling of devotion to a cause, which > became so characteristic of him in later life, were derived, in part at > least, from the instruction imparted so zealously and unquestioningly inside > the severely unadorned walls of the Baptist Church at Otterville.Creighton, > p. 19. Innis attended the one-room schoolhouse in Otterville and the community's high school. He travelled by train to Woodstock, Ontario, to complete his secondary education at a Baptist-run college. He intended to become a public-school teacher and passed the entrance examinations for teacher training, but decided to take a year off to earn the money he would need to support himself at an Ontario teachers' college. At age 18, therefore, he returned to the one-room schoolhouse at Otterville to teach for one term until the local school board could recruit a fully qualified teacher. The experience made him realize that the life of a teacher in a small, rural school was not for him.Creighton, pp. 18‚Äì19. =University studies= The original home of McMaster University at 273 Bloor Street West, Toronto In October 1913, Innis started classes at McMaster University (then in Toronto). McMaster was a natural choice for him because it was a Baptist university and many students who attended Woodstock College went there. McMaster's liberal arts professors encouraged critical thinking and debate.Watson, pp. 64‚Äì68. Innis was especially influenced by , the university's one-man philosophy department. Ten Broeke posed an essay question that Innis pondered for the rest of his life: \\"Why do we attend to the things to which we attend?\\"Watson, p. 326. Innis refers to the question in the preface to The Bias of Communication, his book of essays on consciousness and communication. Before his final undergraduate year at McMaster, Innis spent a summer teaching at the Northern Star School in the frontier farming community of Landonville near Vermilion, Alberta. The experience gave him a sense of the vastness of Canada. He also learned about Western grievances over high interest rates and steep transportation costs.Creighton pp. 26‚Äì27. In his final undergraduate year, Innis focused on history and economics. He kept in mind a remark made by history lecturer W. S. Wallace that the economic interpretation of history was not the only possible one but that it went the deepest.Creighton p. 28. =First World War service= Harold Innis in uniform After graduating from McMaster, Innis felt that his Christian principles compelled him to enlist in the Canadian Expeditionary Force. He was sent to France in the fall of 1916 to fight in the First World War.Creighton, p. 31. Creighton wrote that Innis believed if German aggression went unpunished, it would be fatal to Christian hope for the world. Innis wrote to his sister: \\"If I had no faith in Christianity, I don't think I would go.\\" Trench warfare with its \\"mud and lice and rats\\" had a devastating effect on him.Quoted from a later Innis letter by Creighton, p. 107. Innis's role as an artillery signaller gave him firsthand experience of life (and death) on the front lines as he participated in the successful Canadian attack on Vimy Ridge.Creighton, pp. 34‚Äì35. Signallers, or spotters, watched where each artillery shell landed, then sent back aiming corrections so that the next shells could hit their targets more accurately. On July 7, 1917, Innis received a serious shrapnel wound in his right thigh that required eight months of hospital treatment in England.Watson, p. 70. Innis's war was over. His biographer, John Watson, notes the physical wound took seven years to heal, but the psychological damage lasted a lifetime. Innis suffered recurring bouts of depression and nervous exhaustion because of his military service. Watson also notes that the Great War influenced Innis's intellectual outlook. It strengthened his Canadian nationalism; sharpened his opinion of what he thought were the destructive effects of technology, including the communications media that were used so effectively to \\"sell\\" the war; and led him, for the first time, to doubt his Baptist faith.Watson, pp. 68‚Äì117. Graduate studies =McMaster and Chicago= Harold Innis completed a Master of Arts degree at McMaster, graduating in April 1918. His thesis, called The Returned Soldier, \\"was a detailed description of the public policy measures that were necessary, not only to provide a supportive milieu to help veterans get over the effects of the war, but also to move on with national reconstruction.\\"Watson, p. 93. Watson notes that 240,000 young Canadians died in the war, while 600,000 were wounded. The war was a devastating blow to Innis's generation. George Herbert Mead Innis did his postgraduate work at the University of Chicago and was awarded his PhD, with a dissertation on the history of Canadian Pacific Railway, in August 1920.Watson, p. 94 His two years at Chicago had a profound influence on his later work. His interest in economics deepened and he decided to become a professional economist. The economics faculty at Chicago questioned abstract and universalist neoclassical theories, then in vogue, arguing that general rules for economic policy should be derived from specific case studies.Watson, p. 111. Innis was influenced by the university's two eminent communications scholars, George Herbert Mead and Robert E. Park. Although he did not attend any of those famous professors' classes, Innis did absorb their idea that communication involved much more than the transmission of information. James W. Carey writes that Mead and Park \\"characterized communication as the entire process whereby a culture is brought into existence, maintained in time, and sedimented into institutions.\\"Carey, J. W. (1992). \\"Space, Time and Communications: A Tribute to Harold Innis.\\" In Communication as Culture: Essays on Media and Society. New York: Routledge, p. 144. While at Chicago, Innis was exposed to the ideas of Thorstein Veblen, the iconoclastic thinker who drew on his deep knowledge of philosophy and economics to write scathing critiques of contemporary thought and culture. Veblen had left Chicago years before, but his ideas were still strongly felt there. Years later, in an essay on Veblen, Innis praised him for waging war against \\"standardized static economics.\\"In his 1929 essay, Innis concluded: \\"Veblen has waged a constructive warfare of emancipation against the tendency toward standardized static economics which becomes so dangerous on a continent with ever increasing numbers of students clamouring for textbooks on final economic theory.\\" (The essay was republished in Innis, Essays in Canadian Economic History, pp. 17‚Äì26.) Innis got his first taste of university teaching at Chicago, where he delivered several introductory economics courses. One of his students was Mary Quayle, the woman he would marry in May 1921 when he was 26 and she 22.Heyer, Paul. (2003) Harold Innis. Lanham, Md: Rowman and Littlefield Publishers Inc.. p. 5 & pp. 113‚Äì15. Together they had four children, Donald (1924), Mary (1927), Hugh (1930), and Anne (1933).Watson, p. 119. Mary Quayle Innis was herself a notable economist and writer. Her book, An Economic History of Canada, was published in 1935.Watson, p. 103. Her novel, Stand on a Rainbow appeared in 1943.Thomas, Clara. (1946) Canadian Novelists: 1920 ‚Äì 1945, Toronto: Longmans, Green and Company, p. 67. Her other books include Mrs. Simcoe's Diary (1965), The Clear Spirit: Canadian Women and Their Times (1966) and Unfold the Years (1949), a history of the Young Women's Christian Association. She also edited Harold Innis's posthumous Essays in Canadian Economic History (1956) and a 1972 reissue of his Empire and Communications. Donald Quayle Innis became a geography professor at the State University of New York, Mary married a surgeon and did graduate work in French literature, Hugh Innis became a professor at Ryerson University where he taught communications and economics, Anne Innis Dagg did doctoral work in biology and became an advisor for the independent studies program at the University of Waterloo and published books on zoology, feminism, and Canadian women's history.http://cjc- online.ca/index.php/journal/article/viewFile/1391/1472 =History of the CPR= Donald Alexander Smith drives the last spike of the Canadian Pacific Railway at Craigellachie, BC‚ÄîNovember 7, 1885 Harold Innis wrote his PhD thesis on the history of the Canadian Pacific Railway (CPR). The completion of Canada's first transcontinental railway in 1885 had been a defining moment in Canadian history. Innis's thesis, eventually published as a book in 1923, can be seen as an early attempt to document the railway's significance from an economic historian's point of view. It uses voluminous statistics to underpin its arguments. Innis maintains that the difficult and expensive construction project was sustained by fears of American annexation of the Canadian West.Heyer pp. 6‚Äì7. Innis argues that \\"the history of the Canadian Pacific Railroad is primarily the history of the spread of Western civilization over the northern half of the North American continent.\\"Innis, Harold. (1971) A History of the Canadian Pacific Railway. Revised ed. Toronto: University of Toronto Press, p. 287. As Robert Babe notes, the railway brought industrialization, transporting coal and building supplies to manufacturing sites. It was also a kind of communications medium that contributed to the spread of European civilization. Babe writes that, for Innis, the CPR's equipment \\"comprised a massive, energy-consuming, fast-moving, powerful, capital-intensive 'sign' dropped into the very midst of indigenous peoples, whose entire way of life was disrupted, and eventually shattered as a result.Babe, p. 62. Communications scholar Arthur Kroker argues that Innis's study of the Canadian Pacific Railway was only the first in which he attempted to demonstrate that \\"technology is not something external to Canadian being; but on the contrary, is the necessary condition and lasting consequence of Canadian existence.\\"Kroker, Arthur. (1984) Technology and the Canadian Mind: Innis/McLuhan/Grant. Montreal: New World Perspectives, p. 94. It also reflected Innis's lifelong interest in the exercise of economic and political power. His CPR history ends, for example, with a recounting of Western grievances against economic policies, such as high freight rates and the steep import tariffs designed to protect fledgling Canadian manufacturers. Westerners complained that the National Policy funnelled money from Prairie farmers into the pockets of the Eastern business establishment. \\"Western Canada,\\" Innis wrote, \\"has paid for the development of Canadian nationality, and it would appear that it must continue to pay. The acquisitiveness of Eastern Canada shows little sign of abatement.\\"Innis, pp. 290‚Äì94. Staples thesis Harold Innis is considered the leading founder of a Canadian school of economic thought known as the staples theory. It holds that Canada's culture, political history and economy have been decisively shaped by the exploitation and export of a series of \\"staples\\" such as fur, fish, wood, wheat, mined metals and fossil fuels. Innis theorized that the reliance on exporting natural resources made Canada dependent on more industrially advanced countries and resulted in periodic disruptions to economic life as the international demand for staples rose and fell; as the staple itself became increasingly scarce; and, as technological change resulted in shifts from one staple to others. Innis pointed out, for example, that as furs became scarce and trade in that staple declined, it became necessary to develop and export other staples such as wheat, potash and especially lumber. The export of the new staples was made possible through improved transportation networks that included first canals and later railways. =\\"Dirt\\" research= In 1920, Innis joined the department of political economy at the University of Toronto. He was assigned to teach courses in commerce, economic history and economic theory. He decided to focus his scholarly research on Canadian economic history, a hugely neglected subject, and he settled on the fur trade as his first area of study. Furs had brought French and English traders to Canada, motivating them to travel west along the continent's interlocking lake and river systems to the Pacific coast. Innis realized that he had to search out archival documents to understand the history of the fur trade and also travel the country himself gathering masses of firsthand information and accumulating what he called \\"dirt\\" experience.Creighton, pp. 49‚Äì60. The reference to \\"dirt\\" experience appears in Watson, p. 41. Thus, Innis travelled extensively beginning in the summer of 1924 when he and a friend paddled an canvas-covered canoe hundreds of miles down the Peace River to Lake Athabasca; then down the Slave River to Great Slave Lake. They completed their journey down the Mackenzie, Canada's longest river, to the Arctic Ocean on a small Hudson's Bay Company tug.Creighton, pp. 61‚Äì64. During his travels, Innis supplemented his fur research by gathering information on other staple products such as lumber, pulp and paper, minerals, grain and fish. He travelled so extensively that by the early 1940s, he had visited every part of Canada except for the Western Arctic and the east side of Hudson Bay.Berger, Carl. (1976). The Writing of Canadian History: Aspects of English-Canadian Historical Writing: 1900‚Äì1970. Toronto: Oxford University Press. pp. 89‚Äì90. Everywhere that Innis went, his methods were the same: he interviewed people connected with the production of staple products and listened to their stories.Watson, p. 124. =Fur trade in Canada= North American beaver, castor canadensis. Innis argued that it is impossible to understand Canadian history without some knowledge of the beaver's life and habits. Harold Innis's interest in the relationship between empires and colonies was developed in his classic study, The Fur Trade in Canada: An Introduction to Canadian Economic History (1930). The book chronicles the trade in beaver fur from the early 16th century to the 1920s. Instead of focusing on the \\"heroic\\" European adventurers who explored the Canadian wilderness as conventional histories had done, Innis documents how the interplay of geography, technology and economic forces shaped both the fur trade and Canada's political and economic destiny.Berger, Carl. (1976) The Writing of Canadian History. Toronto: Oxford University Press, pp. 94‚Äì95. He argues that the fur trade largely determined Canada's boundaries, and he comes to the conclusion that the country \\"emerged not in spite of geography but because of it.\\"Innis, Harold. (1956) The Fur Trade in Canada: An Introduction to Canadian Economic History. Revised Edition. Toronto: University of Toronto Press, pp. 383‚Äì402. In line with that observation, Innis notably proposes that European settlement of the Saint Lawrence River Valley followed the economic and social patterns of indigenous peoples, making for a Canadian historical and cultural continuity that predates and postdates European settlement. Unlike many historians who see Canadian history as beginning with the arrival of Europeans, Innis emphasizes the cultural and economic contributions of First Nations peoples.Dickason, Olive; McNab, David. (2009) Canada's First Nations: A History of Founding Peoples from Earliest Times. Fourth Edition. Don Mills, Ontario: Oxford University Press, p.ix. \\"We have not yet realized,\\" he writes, \\"that the Indian and his culture was fundamental to the growth of Canadian institutions.\\"Innis (Fur Trade), p. 392. The Innisian perspective on the development of Canadian political, economic and social institutions was an early form of neo-institutionalism, which became an accepted part of the Canadian political science tradition well before American and European counterparts. The Fur Trade in Canada concludes by arguing that Canadian economic history can best be understood by examining how one staple product gave way to another‚Äîfurs to timber, for example, and the later importance of wheat and minerals.Berger, pp. 95‚Äì96. Reliance on staples made Canada economically dependent on more industrially advanced countries and the \\"cyclonic\\" shifts from one staple to another caused frequent disruptions in the country's economic life.Neill, Robin. (1972) A New Theory of Value: The Canadian Economics of H.A. Innis. Toronto: University of Toronto Press, pp. 45‚Äì46. The Fur Trade in Canada also describes the cultural interactions among three groups of people: the Europeans in fashionable metropolitan centres who regarded beaver hats as luxury items; the European colonial settlers who saw beaver fur as a staple that could be exported to pay for essential manufactured goods from the home country, and First Nations peoples who traded furs for industrial goods such as metal pots, knives, guns and liquor.Watson, pp. 152‚Äì53. Innis describes the central role First Nations peoples played in the development of the fur trade. Without their skilled hunting techniques, knowledge of the territory and advanced tools such as snowshoes, toboggans and birch-bark canoes, the fur trade would not have existed.Innis (Fur Trade), p. 10-15 However, dependence on European technologies disrupted First Nations societies. \\"The new technology with its radical innovations,\\" Innis writes, \\"brought about such a rapid shift in the prevailing Indian culture as to lead to wholesale destruction of the peoples concerned by warfare and disease.\\"Innis (Fur Trade), p. 388. Historian Carl Berger argues that by placing First Nations culture at the centre of his analysis of the fur trade, Innis \\"was the first to explain adequately the disintegration of native society under the thrust of European capitalism.\\"Berger, p. 100. =Cod fishery= After the publication of his book on the fur trade, Innis turned to a study of an earlier staple, the cod fished for centuries off the eastern coasts of North America, especially the Grand Banks of Newfoundland. The result was The Cod Fisheries: The History of an International Economy published in 1940, 10 years after the fur trade study. Innis tells the detailed history of competing empires in the exploitation of a teeming natural resource, a history that ranges over 500 years. While his study of the fur trade focused on the continental interior with its interlocking rivers and lakes, The Cod Fisheries looks outward at global trade and empire, showing the far-reaching effects of one staple product both on imperial centres and on marginal colonies such as Newfoundland, Nova Scotia, and New England. Communications theories Innis's study of the effects of interconnected lakes and rivers on Canadian development and European empire sparked his interest in the complex economic and cultural relationships between transportation systems and communications.Innis, Harold. (2007 edition) Empire and Communications. Toronto: Dundurn Press, pp. 23‚Äì24. Also see, Patterson, Graeme. (1990) History and Communications: Harold Innis, Marshall McLuhan, the Interpretation of History. Toronto: University of Toronto Press, pp. 32‚Äì33. During the 1940s, Innis also began studying pulp and paper, an industry of central importance to the Canadian economy. The research provided an additional crossover point from his work on staple products to his communications studies.Watson, p. 248. Biographer Paul Heyer writes that Innis \\"followed pulp and paper through its subsequent stages: newspapers and journalism, books and advertising. In other words, from looking at a natural resource-based industry he turned his attention to a cultural industry in which information, and ultimately knowledge, was a commodity that circulated, had value, and empowered those who controlled it.\\"Heyer, p. 30. A Greek copy of Plato's Symposium from a papyrus roll. Innis argued that Plato's dialogues combined the vitality of the spoken word with the power of writing, a perfect balance between time and space. One of Innis's primary contributions to communications studies was to apply the dimensions of time and space to various media. He divided media into time-binding and space-binding types. Time-binding media are durable and include clay or stone tablets. Space- binding media are more ephemeral and include modern media such as radio, television, and mass circulation newspapers.Innis (Empire), p. 27. Innis examined the rise and fall of ancient empires as a way of tracing the effects of communications media. He looked at media that led to the growth of an empire; those that sustained it during its periods of success, and then, the communications changes that hastened an empire's collapse. He tried to show that media 'biases' toward time or space affected the complex interrelationships needed to sustain an empire. The interrelationships included the partnership between the knowledge (and ideas) necessary to create and maintain an empire and the power (or force) required to expand and defend it. For Innis, the interplay between knowledge and power was always a crucial factor in understanding empire.Watson, p. 313. Innis argued that a balance between the spoken word and writing contributed to the flourishing of Ancient Greece in the time of Plato.Innis (Empire), pp. 78‚Äì79. The balance between the time-biased medium of speech and the space-biased medium of writing was eventually upset, Innis argued, as the oral tradition gave way to the dominance of writing. The torch of empire then passed from Greece to Rome.Innis (Empire), p. 104. See also, Heyer, pp. 49‚Äì50. Innis's analysis of the effects of communications on the rise and fall of empires led him to warn grimly that Western civilization was now facing its own profound crisis. The development of powerful communications media such as mass-circulation newspapers had shifted the balance decisively in favour of space and power, over time, continuity and knowledge. The balance required for cultural survival had been upset by what Innis saw as \\"mechanized\\" communications media used to transmit information quickly over long distances. The new media had contributed to an obsession with \\"present-mindedness\\", wiping out concerns about past or future.Innis, Harold. (1951) The Bias of Communication. Toronto: University of Toronto Press, p. 87. Innis wrote, > The overwhelming pressure of mechanization evident in the newspaper and the > magazine, has led to the creation of vast monopolies of communication. Their > entrenched positions involve a continuous, systematic, ruthless destruction > of elements of permanence essential to cultural activity. Western civilization could be saved, Innis argued, only by recovering the balance between space and time. For him, that meant reinvigorating the oral tradition within universities while freeing institutions of higher learning from political and commercial pressures. In his essay, A Plea for Time, he suggested that genuine dialogue within universities could produce the critical thinking necessary to restore the balance between power and knowledge. Then, universities could muster the courage to attack the monopolies that always imperil civilization.Innis (Bias), pp. 61‚Äì91. The comment about universities mustering their courage appears in \\"The upside of ivory towers\\" by Rick Salutin. Globe and Mail, September 7, 2007. Although Innis remains appreciated and respected for the grand and unique nature of his later efforts regarding communications theories, he was not without critics. Particularly, the fragmentary and mosaic writing style exemplified in Empire and Communications has been criticized as ambiguous, aggressively nonlinear, and lacking connections between levels of analysis.Stamps, J. (1991) Negative Dialogues: a study of Harold Innis and Marshall McLuhan in the light of the negative dialects of Theodor Adorno and Walter Benjamin. Ottawa: Canada National Library, p. 6 Biographers have suggested that the style may have been a result of Innis's illness late in his career.Heyer, Paul. (1988) Communications and History: Theories of Media, Knowledge and Civilization. Westport: Greenwood Press, p. 114 Academic and public career =Influence in the 1930s= Aside from his work on The Cod Fisheries, Innis wrote extensively in the 1930s about other staple products such as minerals and wheat as well as Canada's immense economic problems in the Great Depression. During the summers of 1932 and 1933, he travelled to the West to see the effects of the Depression for himself.Creighton, p. 84. The next year, in an essay entitled, The Canadian Economy and the Depression, Innis outlined the plight of \\"a country susceptible to the slightest ground-swell of international disturbance\\" but beset by regional differences that made it difficult to devise effective solutions. He described a prairie economy dependent on the export of wheat but afflicted by severe drought, on the one hand, and the increased political power of Canada's growing cities, sheltered from direct reliance on the staples trade, on the other. The result was political conflict and a breakdown in federal‚Äìprovincial relations. \\"We lack vital information on which to base prospective policies to meet this situation,\\" Innis warned, because of \\"the weak position of the social sciences in Canada.\\"Innis, Harold. (1956) Essays in Canadian Economic History, edited by Mary Q. Innis. Toronto: University of Toronto Press. pp. 123‚Äì40. Radio, a new medium, drew a scathing rebuke from Harold Innis for promoting \\"small talk\\" and \\"bores.\\" Innis believed that both radio and mass circulation newspapers encouraged stereotypical thinking. Innis's reputation as a public intellectual was growing steadily and, in 1934, Premier Angus Lewis Macdonald invited him to serve on a Royal Commission to examine Nova Scotia's economic problems. The next year, he helped establish The Canadian Journal of Economics and Political Science. In 1936, he was appointed a full University of Toronto professor and a year later, became the head of the university's Department of Political Economy.Creighton, pp. 85‚Äì95. Innis was appointed president of the Canadian Political Science Association in 1938. His inaugural address, The Penetrative Powers of the Price System, must have baffled his listeners as he ranged over centuries of economic history jumping abruptly from one topic to the next linking monetary developments to patterns of trade and settlement.Heyer, p. 20. The address was an ambitious attempt to show the disruptive effects of new technologies culminating in the modern shift from an industrial system based on coal and iron to the newest sources of industrial power, electricity, oil, and steel. Innis also tried to show the commercial effects of mass circulation newspapers, made possible by expanded newsprint production, and of the new medium of radio, which \\"threatens to circumvent the walls imposed by tariffs and to reach across boundaries frequently denied to other media of communication.\\" Both media, Innis argued, stimulated the demand for consumer goods and both promoted nationalism.Innis, Essays, pp. 252‚Äì72. Innis was also a central participant in an international project that produced 25 scholarly volumes between 1936 and 1945. It was a series called The Relations of Canada and the United States overseen by James T. Shotwell, director of the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace. Innis edited and wrote prefaces for the volumes contributed by Canadian scholars. His own study of the cod fisheries also appeared as part of the series. His work with Shotwell enabled Innis to gain access to Carnegie money to further Canadian academic research. As John Watson points out, \\"the project offered one of the few sources of research funds in rather lean times.\\"Watson, p. 201. =Politics and the Great Depression= R. B. Bennett was the Conservative Prime Minister of Canada from 1930 to 1935, during the depths of the Great Depression. Although Innis advocated staying out of politics, he did correspond with Bennett urging him to strengthen the law against business monopolies. The era of the \\"Dirty Thirties\\" with its mass unemployment, poverty and despair gave rise to new Canadian political movements. In Alberta, for example, the radio evangelist William \\"Bible Bill\\" Aberhart led his populist Social Credit party to victory in 1935. Three years earlier in Calgary, Alberta, social reformers had founded a new political party, the Co-operative Commonwealth Federation (CCF). It advocated democratic socialism and a mixed economy with public ownership of key industries. Frank Underhill, one of Innis's colleagues at the University of Toronto was a founding member of the CCF. Innis and Underhill had both been members of an earlier group at the university that declared itself \\"dissatisfied with the policies of the two major [political] parties in Canada\\" and that aimed at \\"forming a definite body of progressive opinion.\\" In 1931, Innis presented a paper to the group on \\"Economic Conditions in Canada\\", but he later recoiled from participating in party politics, denouncing partisans like Underhill as \\"hot gospellers.\\"Havelock, Eric. (1982) Harold Innis: A Memoir. Toronto: Harold Innis Foundation, pp. 14‚Äì15. The reference to \\"hot gospellers\\" can be found in the Creighton biography, p. 93. Innis maintained that scholars had no place in active politics and that they should instead devote themselves, first to research on public problems, and then to the production of knowledge based on critical thought. He saw the university, with its emphasis on dialogue, open-mindedness and skepticism, as an institution that could foster such thinking and research. \\"The university could provide an environment,\\" he wrote, \\"as free as possible from the biases of the various institutions that form the state, so that its intellectuals could continue to seek out and explore other perspectives.\\"Quoted in \\"The Public Role of the Intellectual,\\" by Liora Salter and Cheryl Dahl. In Harold Innis in the New Century. (1999) Montreal: McGill-Queen's University Press, p. 119. Although sympathetic to the plight of western farmers and urban, unemployed workers, Innis did not embrace socialism. Eric Havelock, a left-leaning colleague explained many years later that Innis distrusted political \\"solutions\\" imported from elsewhere, especially those based on Marxist analysis with its emphasis on class conflict. He worried, too, that as Canada's ties with Britain weakened, the country would fall under the spell of American ideas instead of developing its own based on Canada's unique circumstances. Havelock added: > He has been called the radical conservative of his day ‚Äî not a bad > designation of a complex mind, clear sighted, cautious, perhaps at bottom > pessimistic in areas where thinkers we would label 'progressive' felt less > difficulty in taking a stand; never content to select only one or two > elements in a complicated equation in order to build a quick-order policy or > program; far ranging enough in intellect to take in the whole sum of the > factors, and comprehend their often contradictory effects.Havelock, pp. > 22‚Äì23. =Late career and death= In the 1940s, Harold Innis reached the height of his influence in both academic circles and Canadian society. In 1941, he helped establish the American-based Economic History Association and its Journal of Economic History. He later became the association's second president. Innis played a central role in founding two important sources for the funding of academic research: the Canadian Social Science Research Council (1940) and the Humanities Research Council of Canada (1944).Watson, p. 223. In 1944, the University of New Brunswick awarded Innis an honorary degree, as did his alma mater, McMaster University. Universit√© Laval, the University of Manitoba and the University of Glasgow would also confer honorary degrees in 1947‚Äì48.Watson, pp. 223‚Äì24. In 1945, Innis spent nearly a month in the Soviet Union where he had been invited to attend the 220th anniversary celebrations marking the founding of the country's Academy of Sciences.Watson, pp. 223‚Äì224. Later, in his essay Reflections on Russia, he mused about the differences between the Soviet \\"producer\\" economy and the West's \\"consumer\\" ethos: > [A]n economy which emphasizes consumer's goods is characterized by > communication industries largely dependent on advertising and by constant > efforts to reach the largest number of readers or listeners; an economy > emphasizing producer's goods is characterized by communications industries > largely dependent on government support. As a result of this contrast, a > common public opinion in Russia and the West is hard to achieve.Quoted in > Heyer, p. 33. Innis's trip to Moscow and Leningrad came shortly before US‚ÄìSoviet rivalry led to the hostility of the Cold War. Innis lamented the rise in international tensions.Creighton, p. 122. He saw the Soviet Empire as a stabilizing counterbalance to the American Empire's emphasis on commercialism, the individual and constant change. For Innis, Russia was a society within the Western tradition, not an alien civilization. He abhorred the nuclear arms race and saw it as the triumph of force over knowledge, a modern form of the medieval Inquisition. \\"The Middle Ages burned its heretics,\\" he wrote, \\"and the modern age threatens them with atom bombs.\\"Innis, (Bias) p. 139. In 1946, Innis was elected president of the Royal Society of Canada, the country's senior body of scientists and scholars. The same year, he served on the Manitoba Royal Commission on Adult Education and published Political Economy in the Modern State, a collection of his speeches and essays that reflected both his staples research and his new work in communications. In 1947, Innis was appointed the University of Toronto's dean of graduate studies. In 1948, he delivered lectures at the University of London and Nottingham University. He also gave the prestigious Beit lectures at Oxford, later published in his book Empire and Communications. In 1949, Innis was appointed as a commissioner on the federal government's Royal Commission on Transportation, a position that involved extensive travel at a time when his health was starting to fail.Watson, pp. 224‚Äì25. See also Creighton, pp. 136‚Äì40. The last decade of his career, during which he worked on his communications studies, was an unhappy time for Innis. He was academically isolated because his colleagues in economics could not fathom how the new work related to his pioneering research in staples theory. Biographer John Watson writes that \\"the almost complete lack of positive response to the communications works, contributed to his sense of overwork and depression.\\"Watson, pp. 250‚Äì55. Innis died of prostate cancer in November 8, 1952, a few days after his 58th birthday. In commemoration, Innis College at the University of Toronto and Innis Library at McMaster University were named in his honour. Following his premature death, Innis' significance increasingly deepened as scholars in several academic disciplines continued to build upon his writings. Marshall Poe's general media theory that proposes two sub-theories were inspired by Innis. Douglas C. North expanded on of Innis' \\"vent for surplus\\" theory of economic development by applying it to regional development in the United States and underdeveloped countries. In addition, James W. Carey adopted Innis as a \\"reference point in his conception of two models of communication.\\" Innis and McLuhan Marshall McLuhan was a colleague of Innis's at the University of Toronto. As a young English professor, McLuhan was flattered when he learned that Innis had put his book The Mechanical Bride on the reading list of the fourth-year economics course.Preface by H. Marshall McLuhan in Havelock, p. 10. Also see Watson, p. 405. McLuhan built on Innis's idea that in studying the effects of communications media, technological form mattered more than content. Biographer Paul Heyer writes that Innis's concept of the \\"bias\\" of a particular medium of communication can be seen as a \\"less flamboyant precursor to McLuhan's legendary phrase 'the medium is the message.'\\"Heyer, p. 61. Innis, for example, tried to show how printed media such as books or newspapers were \\"biased\\" toward control over space and secular power, while engraved media such as stone or clay tablets were \\"biased\\" in favour of continuity in time and metaphysical or religious knowledge.Innis, (Empire) p. 7. McLuhan focused on what may be called a medium's \\"sensory bias\\" arguing, for example, that books and newspapers appealed to the rationality of the eye, while radio played to the irrationality of the ear.McLuhan, Marshall. (2003) Understanding Media: The Extensions of Man. Corte Madera, California: Gingko Press. The differences in the Innisian and McLuhanesque approaches were summarized by the late James W. Carey: > Both McLuhan and Innis assume the centrality of communication technology; > where they differ is in the principal kinds of effects they see deriving > from this technology. Whereas Innis sees communication technology > principally affecting social organization and culture, McLuhan sees its > principal effect on sensory organization and thought. McLuhan has much to > say about perception and thought but little to say about institutions; Innis > says much about institutions and little about perception and thought.Carey, > James W. \\"Harold Adams Innis and Marshall McLuhan\\" in McLuhan Pro and Con > (1969) Baltimore: Pelican Books, p. 281. Graeme Patterson strongly disagrees > with that view by arguing that Innis paid an extraordinary amount of > attention to perception and thought, while McLuhan examined institutions. > Both Innis and McLuhan, Patterson argues, were preoccupied with language, > one of humanity's basic institutions. See Patterson, pp. 36‚Äì37. Biographer John Watson notes that Innis's work was profoundly political while McLuhan's was not. He writes that \\"the mechanization of knowledge, not the relative sensual bias of media, is the key to Innis's work. That also underlies the politicization of Innis's position vis-a-vis that of McLuhan.\\" Watson adds that Innis believed very different media could produce similar effects. \\"For Innis, the yellow press of the United States and the Nazi loudspeaker had the same form of negative effect: they reduced men from thinking beings to mere automatons in a chain of command.\\" Watson argues that while McLuhan separated media according to their sensory bias, Innis examined a different set of interrelationships, the \\"dialectic of power and knowledge\\" in specific historical circumstances. For Watson, Innis's work is therefore more flexible and less deterministic than McLuhan's.Watson, pp. 410‚Äì11. As scholars and teachers, Innis and McLuhan shared a similar dilemma since both argued that book culture tended to produce fixed points of view and homogeneity of thought; yet both produced many books. In his introduction to the 1964 reprint of The Bias of Communication, McLuhan marvelled at Innis's technique of juxtaposing \\"his insights in a mosaic structure of seemingly unrelated and disproportioned sentences and aphorisms.\\" McLuhan argued that although that made reading Innis's dense prose difficult (\\"a pattern of insights that are not packaged for the consumer palate\\"), Innis's method approximated \\"the natural form of conversation or dialogue rather than of written discourse.\\" Best of all, it yielded \\"insight\\" and \\"pattern recognition\\" rather than the \\"classified knowledge\\" so overvalued by print- trained scholars. \\"How exciting it was to encounter a writer whose every phrase invited prolonged meditation and exploration,\\" McLuhan added.McLuhan, Marshall. (2005) Marshall McLuhan Unbound. Corte Madera, CA : Gingko Press, v.8, pp. 5‚Äì8. McLuhan's own books with their reliance on aphorisms, puns, quips, \\"probes\\" and oddly juxtaposed observations also employ that mosaic technique. Innis's theories of political economy, media and society remain highly relevant: he had a profound influence on critical media theory and communications and, in conjunction with McLuhan, offered groundbreaking Canadian perspectives on the function of communication technologies as key agents in social and historical change. Together, their works advanced a theory of history in which communication is central to social change and transformation.Carey, (McLuhan Pro and Con), p. 271. Selected works *Innis, Harold.

Its current leader is Walid Jumblatt, who has led the party since 1977. Origins The party was founded on 5 January 1949, and registered on 17 March the same year, under notification N¬∞789. The founders comprised six individuals, all of different backgrounds. The most notable of these was Kamal Jumblatt (Walid Jumblatt's father). The others were Farid Jubran, Albert Adeeb, Abdallah Alayli, Fouad Rizk, and George Hanna. The PSP held in Beirut the first conference for the Socialist Arab Parties in Lebanon, Syria, Egypt and Iraq in 1951. From 1951 through 1972 the party had between 9 and 23 deputies in parliament. The PSP in the Lebanese Civil War (1975‚Äì1990) Under Kamal Jumblatt's leadership, the PSP was a major element in the Lebanese National Movement (LNM) which supported Lebanon's Arab identity and sympathised with the Palestinians. Despite Jumblatt's initial reluctance to engage in paramilitarism, it built its own powerful military wing, the People's Liberation Army (PLA) which proved to be one of the strongest private armies in the Lebanese Civil War of 1975 to 1990. It conquered much of Mount Lebanon and the Chouf District. Its main adversaries were the Kataeb Regulatory Forces militia, and later the Lebanese Forces militia (which absorbed the Kataeb). The PSP suffered a major setback in 1977, when Kamal Jumblatt was assassinated. His son Walid succeeded him as leader of the party. From the Israeli withdrawal from the Chouf in 1983 to the end of the civil war, the PSP ran a highly effective civil administration, the Civil Administration of the Mountain, in the area under its control. Tolls levied at PSP/PLA militia checkpoints provided a major source of income for the administration, which succeeded in providing a high standard of social and public services. The PSP played an important role in the so-called Mountain War under the lead of Walid Jumblatt: after the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) retreated from the Chouf District, important battles took place there between the PSP/PLA and the Lebanese Forces militia. Both the Lebanese Forces and the PSP/PLA were accused of committing massacres and atrocities against one another as tit-for-tat (revenge killings). This was a sad hallmark of the Lebanese Civil War because the innocent people were the ones who paid the highest price. The post-war years Since the restoration of constitutional rule in 1989 PSP was the major ally of Syria in Lebanon and its leader Walid Jumblatt was in close relations with the Syrian Army and intelligence generals in Lebanon, namely Ghazi Kanaan and also with the Syrian Vice President Abdul Halim Khaddam. PSP participated in a number of governments, but, after the Syria Accountability Act and the UN Resolution 1559 and the change of the balance of powers in the region after the occupation of Iraq, joined the opposition and took up a position opposed to the role of Syria in Lebanon's politics. Unlike some opponents of the Syrian presence, he did not oppose the presence of the Syrian army per se, but contended that the Syrian intelligence services were exerting undue influence. Following the passage of United Nations Security Council Resolution 1559, calling for a Syrian withdrawal from Lebanon, Jumblatt was particularly prominent in the opposition. However, he was opposed to the demand that Hezbollah be disarmed, and insisted on maintaining relations with the Shia Islamist party. Later, he has drifted into sharp opposition towards the group, and has decided to support their disarmament, claiming that Syria and Iran are trying to take over Lebanon through Hezbollah. After the assassination of Rafic Hariri in February 2005, Jumblatt joined the anti-Syria camp despite his long support to Syria. Being part of the March 14 Alliance, the PSP won 16 seats in the general elections held in 2005. Marwan Hamade called for dismantling of the communications system of Hezbollah on 5 May 2008, which created a huge response from Hezbollah and its allies. Clashes took place on 7 May 2008, as Hezbollah occupied Beirut. The conflict ended after Meer Talal Ereslan (A Druze leader) interfered and put an end for the fights. In late January 2011, Jumblatt declared that he does not support the disarming of Hezbollah. Currently PSP sits in opposition to the government of Hassan Diab. With the onset of the Syrian civil war, Jumblatt and the PSP clearly showed their support for the Syrian opposition, and urged the Syrian Druze community to stand against the Assad government, and join the rebels.

A local-authority 20-storey tower block in alt= Public housing is a form of housing tenure in which the property is usually owned by a government authority, either central or local. Social housing is any rental housing that may be owned and managed by the state, by non-profit organizations, or by a combination of the two, usually with the aim of providing affordable housing. Social housing is generally rationed through some form of means-testing or through administrative measures of housing need. One can regard social housing as a potential remedy for housing inequality. Private housing is a form of housing tenure in which the property is owned by a private developer or by non-profit organizations. Although the common goal of public housing is to provide affordable housing, the details, terminology, definitions of poverty, and other criteria for allocation vary within different contexts.  History  Boundary Street 1890; three years later, the London County Council began slum clearance.alt= Social housing had existed sporadically prior to modern developments. The oldest still in use is the 16th century Fuggerei in Augsburg, Bavaria. The origins of modern municipal housing lie in the dramatic urban population increase caused by the Industrial Revolution of the 19th century. In the large cities of the period, many social commentators, such as Octavia Hill and Charles Booth reported on the squalor, sickness and immorality that arose. Henry Mayhew, visiting Bethnal Green, wrote in The Morning Chronicle: Some philanthropists began to provide housing in tenement blocks, and some factory owners built entire villages for their workers, such as Saltaire in 1853 and Port Sunlight in 1888. It was in 1885, after the report from a Royal Commission in England, that the state first took an interest. This led to the Housing of the Working Classes Act of 1885, which empowered Local Government Boards to shut down unhealthy properties and encouraged them to improve the housing in their areas. The City of London Corporation built tenements in the Farringdon Road in 1865. The world's first large-scale housing project was built in London to replace one of the capital's most notorious slums ‚Äì the Old Nichol. Nearly 6,000 individuals were crammed into the packed streets, where one child in four died before his or her first birthday. Arthur Morrison wrote the influential A Child of the Jago, an account of the life of a child in the slum, which sparked a public outcry. Construction of the Boundary Estate was begun in 1890 by the Metropolitan Board of Works and completed by the then-recently formed London County Council in 1900. The success of this project spurred many local councils to embark on similar construction schemes in the early 20th century. The Arts and Crafts movement and Ebenezer Howard's garden city ideas led to the leafy London County Council cottage estates such as firstly Totterdown Fields and later Wormholt and Old Oak. The First World War indirectly provided a new impetus, when the poor physical health and condition of many urban recruits to the British Army was noted with alarm. In 1916, 41% of conscripts were unfit to serve. This led to a campaign known as Homes fit for heroes and in 1919 the Government first compelled councils to provide housing, helping them to do so through the provision of subsidies, under the Housing Act 1919. Public housing projects were tried out in some European countries and the United States in the 1930s, but only became widespread globally after the Second World War.  Americas  = Brazil = alt= (\\"My House, My Life\\"), the Brazilian federal government's social housing program, was launched in March 2009 with a budget of R$36 billion (US$18 billion) to build one million homes. The second stage of the program, included within the government Growth Acceleration Program (PAC, ) was announced in March 2010. This stage foresaw the construction of a further two million homes. All funds for properties were provided by the Brazilian public bank, . The bank financed development and provided mortgages for qualifying families. , 4.5 million homes were built and distributed to the population. The project has been criticized for its placement and quality of the houses. Houses are built far from the city centre to reduce housing costs which consequently reduces access to the labor market; a study of randomly selected houses of the MCMV project in Rio de Janeiro showed a reduced likelihood of being formally employed in job-seekers but income was not affected in those who were already employed. = Canada = alt= in alt= In Canada, public housing is usually a block of purpose-built subsidized housing operated by a government agency, often simply referred to as community housing, with easier-to-manage townhouses. Canada, especially Toronto, still maintains large high-rise clustered developments in working-class neighborhoods, a system that has fallen into disfavour in both the United States and the United Kingdom. However, Toronto Community Housing, the second largest public housing agency in North America, has a variety of buildings and communities ranging from individual houses to townhouse communities and mid- rise and high-rise apartments in both working-class and middle-class neighborhoods that house a significant number of low-income Canadians. Following the decentralisation of public housing to local municipalities, Social Housing Services Corporation (SHSC) was created in the Province of Ontario in 2002 to provide group services for social housing providers (public housing, non-profit housing and co-operative housing). It is a non-profit corporation which provides Ontario housing providers and service managers with bulk purchasing, insurance, investment and information services that add significant value to their operations. Recently, there has been a move toward the integration of public housing with market housing and other uses. Revitalization plans for properties such as in the notorious Downtown Eastside of Vancouver, and Regent Park, Lawrence Heights and Alexandra Park in Toronto, aim to provide better accommodations for low-income residents, and connect them to the greater community. In Toronto, for instance, the aims of the reconstruction plans of Regent Park are to better integrate it into the traditional grid of streets, improve leisure and cultural amenities, and construct mixed-income buildings. However, the residents of these communities have had little effective input in the plans and have had mixed reactions to the construction. In 2014, Vancouver, long considered one of the least affordable cities in the world, changed the definition of social housing to mean rental housing in which a minimum of 30 percent of dwelling units are occupied by households that cannot pay market rents, due to lack of income. = Mexico = alt= At the end of the Second World War, enriched by US investments and an oil boom, Mexico had its first demographic boom, in which the primary destination for rural immigrants was Mexico City. , a famous architect at time, was charged to build its first large-scale public housing project. Built for the (the National Pensions office, today ISSSTE), the (or ) (1947‚Äì50) and the (or ) (1951‚Äì52), both in the , introduced formal ideas from Le Corbusier's into the urban fabric. His later project, the built in 1960‚Äì65, was meant to develop one of the poorest parts of the city, , which was becoming a slum. Unfortunately, after a while, instead of giving the residences to the previous residents of , corruption took place and most of the dwellings were handed to state employees. During the earthquake of 1985, both the and complexes suffered major damage, with some buildings collapsing. Today most of the has been demolished. Mexico has had experience with housing projects since 's regime (1877‚Äì1880, 1884‚Äì1911). One of those still remains and is the of in in Mexico City, that was a project for a paper factory workers. = United States = John F. Hylan Houses in the Bushwick section of Brooklyn, New York City.alt= The alt= In the nineteenth and early twentieth centuries, government involvement in housing for the poor was chiefly in the introduction of building standards. Atlanta, Georgia's Techwood Homes, dedicated in 1935, were the nation's first public housing project. Most housing communities were developed from the 1930s onward and initial public housing was largely slum clearance, with the requirement insisted upon by private builders that for every unit of public housing constructed, a unit of private housing would be demolished. This also eased concerns of the establishment by eliminating or altering neighborhoods commonly considered a source of disease, and reflected progressive-era sanitation initiatives. Moreover, public housing, along with the Federal Highway Program, demolished the older, substandard housing of communities of color across the United States. However, the advent of makeshift tent communities during the Great Depression caused concern in the Administration. The Federal public housing program was created by the 1937 Act, in which operations were \\"sustained primarily by tenant rents.\\"As a result, public housing in its earliest decades was usually much more working-class and middle-class and white than it was by the 1970s. Many Americans associate large, multi-story towers with public housing, but early projects were actually low-rise, though Le Corbusier superblocks caught on before World War II. A unique US public housing initiative was the development of subsidized middle-class housing during the late New Deal (1940‚Äì42) under the auspices of the Mutual Ownership Defense Housing Division of the Federal Works Agency under the direction of Colonel Lawrence Westbrook. These eight projects were purchased by the residents after the Second World War and as of 2009 seven of the projects continue to operate as mutual housing corporations owned by their residents. These projects are among the very few definitive success stories in the history of the US public housing effort. Public housing was only built with the blessing of the local government, and projects were almost never built on suburban greenfields, but through regeneration of older neighborhoods. The destruction of tenements and eviction of their low-income residents consistently created problems in nearby neighborhoods with \\"soft\\" real estate markets. Houses, apartments or other residential units are usually subsidized on a rent-geared-to-income (RGI) basis. Some communities have now embraced a mixed income, with both assisted and market rents, when allocating homes as they become available. A significant change in the program took place in 1969, with the passage of the Brooke Amendement. Rents now became set at 25% of a tenant's income with the result that the program began serving the \\"poorest tenants.\\" The federal Housing and Urban Development (HUD) department's 1993 HOPE VI program addressed concerns of distressed properties and blighted superblocks with revitalization and funding projects for the renewal of public housing to decrease its density and allow for tenants with mixed income levels. Projects continue to have a reputation for violence, drug use, and prostitution, especially in New Orleans, New York City, Philadelphia, Los Angeles, Chicago, and Washington, D.C. as well as others leading to the passage of a 1996 federal \\"one strike you're out\\" law, enabling the eviction of tenants convicted of crimes, especially drug-related, or merely as a result of being tried for some crimes.Application of First Strike Policy Is Questioned By ANGELA CAPUTO, New York Times, 3 September 2011 Other attempts to solve these problems include the 19741974 Housing and Community Development Act Section 8 Housing Program, which encourages the private sector to construct affordable homes, and subsidized public housing. This assistance can be \\"project-based\\", subsidizing properties, or \\"tenant-based\\", which provides tenants with a voucher, accepted by some landlords.

Retrieved 11 April 2014. An is a type of housing where land is developed into lots, often by a private developer, and where single-family homes are built. More recently, non-single-family units, such as condominiums and townhouses are being built which also fall into this category. (In Puerto Rico, a condominium is a housing unit located in a high-rise building. It is popularly called an (English: 'apartment'), whether or not its resident owns the unit or lives it as a renter.) Public housing, on the other hand, are housing units built with government funding, primarily through programs of the US Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) and the US Department of Agriculture (USDA).Public Housing Projects in PR Retrieved 3 November 2009. These have traditionally consisted multi-family dwellings in housing complexes called a or a (and more recently a ), and where all exterior grounds consist of shared areas. Increasingly, however, public housing developments are being built that consist of other than the traditional multi-family dwellings with all exterior grounds consisting of shared outside area, for example, public housing may consist of single family garden apartments units. Finally, a home that is located in neither an nor of a public housing development is said to be located in (and to be a part of) a .

Asia  = China = An \\"Old Public House\\" in Pengpu Xincun, Shanghai. A low-rent house in Ningnan County, Sichuan. The public-owned housing system was established when the Communist Party of China started the planned economy in the 1950s as part of its Great Leap Forward. The system was funded by the central government's budget and were administered and distributed by state- owned enterprises. The occupants of the public housing were usually the employees of the enterprises and their family, who were subject to pay rent at a very low price. The size and the type of room the households received were dependent on their job title or administrative level. The central government found it difficult to upkeep the public housing due to the low rent it received; the distribution policy that was intended to be \\"equalitarianism\\" was actually corrupt. The Chinese government commercialized the housing market after the economic reform started in 1978 by Deng Xiaoping. The public houses that were constructed before that the economic reforms were categorized as \\"Old Public Houses\\" (). \\"Old Public Houses\\" were, in principle, not supposed to be privately sold, but the household could sell it after purchasing the ownership of the building (not the property), and such transactions were subject to be review by local housing authorities and the State-owned Assets Supervision and Administration Commission. However, an informal filing system and unclear policies resulted in problems of corruption and family dispute. In the recent years, the government provides public housing through various sources, such as new housing, abandoned properties, and old flats which are rented at a low price and called \\"Lian Zu Fang\\" (literally 'low-rent house' or 'low-rent housing', ). Additional housing is built by providing free land and exemption from fees to estate developers, the resulting houses are called \\"Jing Ji Shi Yong Fang\\" (literally 'the economically applicable housing', ). The concept of the low-cost rental housing can be traced to a 1998 policy statement, but did not truly take off until 2006 due to limited funding and administrative problems. The provision of more affordable housing is one of the key components of China's Twelfth Five-year Plan, which targets the construction of 36 million homes by 2015. That program's costs will be split between the private and public sector and are estimated at five trillion yuan by China International Capital Corporation.Sun Jianfang (24 October 2011) Will Housing Projects Boost GDP?

Nearly half of Hong Kong's 3.3 million population lives in public housing. The two main public housing providers are the Housing Authority and the Housing Society. =Indonesia= Indonesia has undertaken One Million Houses program for low-income people. The program has been implementing since 2015 to achieve an ambitious target of building 10 million houses. The proportion of the housing is 70 percent for low-income people and 30 percent for non-low-income people. This program is a joint movement between the Central Government, regional governments, real estate developers and the community. The program is targeted to reach one million housing units annually. In 2015, about 700,000 homes were built, increasing to approximately 800,000 in 2016 and around 904,000 by the end of 2017. = Japan = is the Japanese word for a large cluster of apartment buildings or houses of a particular style and design, typically built as public housing by government authorities. The Japan Housing Corporation (JHC), now known as the Urban Renaissance Agency (UR), was founded in 1955. During the 1950s, 1960s, and 1970s, the JHC built many in suburban areas to offset the increasing housing demand during the post-World War II economic boom. It introduced the Japanese salaryman to a life around the nuclear family in contrast with the multi- generation homes before the war. The rent payment for a is much cheaper than that of an apartment or a mortgage, but for a public the prospective tenant must usually participate in a lottery to be assigned an open apartment. Residents in UR danchi do not have to pay key money or contract renewal fees, making the residences cheaper than comparable housing even if the monthly rents are equivalent. = Singapore = In Singapore, the public housing program, particularly the planning and development of new public housing and the allocation of rental units and resale of existing ownership units, is managed by the Housing and Development Board. Day-to-day management of public housing communities has been delegated to Town Councils headed by the local members of parliament. In 2018, 78.7% of Singaporeans live in public residential developments, ranging from studio units to executive condominiums provided by the HDB, a major factor in Singapore having one of the highest home-ownership rates - over 90% of the resident population - in the world.  Europe  = European Union = According to a 2018 discussion paper of the European Commission, in 2015, 11.3% of the EU-population lived in households that spent 40% or more of their disposable income on housing. In January 2019, the former European Commission President, Romano Prodi, declared that \\"public investment in social infrastructure during the Eurocrisis reached a 20-year low. Current investment in social infrastructure in the EU is estimated at 170 billion euros per year. The minimum infrastructure investment gap in these sectors is estimated at 100 to 150 billion euros, representing a total gap of at least 1.5 trillion euros between 2018 and 2030.\\" Housing projects in Europe can be found in urban areas, as well as in suburban areas. Especially in central and eastern Europe. The EU was moving to support more affordable, energy-efficient and accessible housing with the financial contribution of the CEB and of the EIB through its European Fund for Strategic Investments. Public funding was planned to be directed primarily on affordable housing and secondly in the education and lifelong learning, health and long-term care sectors. = Austria = , classical public housing in alt= Public housing was an important issue right from the foundation of the Republic of German-Austria in 1918. The population was faced with a great deal of uncertainty particularly as regards food and fuel. This led to a significant number of less affluent people to move to the periphery of towns, often building makeshift homes to be closer to where they could grow food. They were called ('settlers'). As the political situation became stabilised with foundation of the First Austrian Republic in September 1919, the movement started creating formal organizations like the Austrian Association for Settlements and Small Gardens. The electoral victory of the Social Democratic Party of Austria in the elections for the Viennese (city parliament) gave rise to Red Vienna. Part of their programme was the provision of decent homes for the Viennese working class who made up the core of their supporters. Hence the German word (plural: ) for \\"municipality building\\". In Austria, it refers to residential buildings erected by a municipality, usually to provide public housing. These have been an important part of the architecture and culture of Vienna since the 1920s. = Belgium = Social housing is a responsibility of the regions in Belgium. The regions don't directly own the houses, semi-private social housing corporations do. The government regulates and mostly finances this corporations. Below a certain income limit, people are eligible for social housing. Because there is a major shortage of social housing in Belgium, other priority conditions are often imposed, such as having children to care for. Social housing accounts for approximately 6.5% of the Belgian housing market. This is much lower than neighbouring countries such as the Netherlands and France. As of 2018 Flanders, Wallonia and Brussels are responsible for 280.687 social houses, 212.794 people are on the waiting list. For the people on the waiting list there are other possibilities such as subsidies and sociale rental agencies in Flanders. = Denmark = In Denmark, public housing is called and is owned and administered by approximately 700 self-governing, democratic and non-profit organizations by and for the tenants themselves. Many of the public housing organizations in Denmark are rooted in the early history of the labor unions and currently forms about 20% of the total housing stock with about 7,500 departments countrywide. A membership of a housing organization is usually required to obtain a rental and they are granted with regard to length of membership. Although the buildings are owned and administered by self-governing and economically independent organizations, the State of Denmark is strongly regulating public housing in the country. By law, the municipalities have access to 25% of the rentals, usually reserving them for the poor, the unemployed, the disabled or mentally ill or any other group dependent on social benefits from the municipality. Over the years, these regulations have created many 'especially vulnerable residential areas' ‚Äì so called \\"ghettos\\" ‚Äì within the country. Danish public housing has never had any income restrictions, but in recent years new state regulations has made it mandatory for several of them to favor fully employed renters and disfavor unemployed or part-time employed people. This is a relatively new effort by the state to counter the ghettoisation, which is now an officially recognized problem countrywide. As in Sweden, state and municipal policies carried out throughout the first decade of the 21st century, has led to an increased privatization of public housing. In many areas, residents have been offered to buy their own flats, thereby effectively changing the status of the property. The privatization of public housing was initiated as part of an ideological program by the right wing governments of the early 21st century and was launched a few years after the closure of the former Ministry of Housing Affairs in 2001.The Ministry of Housing and Urban Affairs had been in operation for more than 50 years, from 1947‚Äì2001. The former ministry was re- opened as Ministry of Housing, Urban and Rural Affairs in October 2011, when a new coalition government led by social-democrats was formed. = Finland = The earliest public housing project in Finland was in Helsinki. In 1909, four wooden houses designed by the architect were built on (formerly ) for the city's workers. The residents were mainly working-class families with several children. The apartments had an average of five people per room, sometimes up to eight. The tiny apartments were equipped with running water, a pantry and an attic cupboard. Every apartment had its own toilet in the cellar. Electric lighting was installed in 1918. The homes and lives of worker families in Helsinki from 1909 to 1985 are presented in a museum near the amusement park. = France = Public housing of the in the alt= After World War II, the population increased at a rate previously unknown, the rural exodus increased, while war damage had reduced the number of houses in many cities. Rental prices dramatically rose, and the government made a law in 1948 to block them, effectively ending the economic benefits of housing investment. Rents were gradually deregulated until debate in the 1980s led to the current rental law of 1989 theoretically balancing landlord and tenant relations. However, there was a major homelessness crisis in the winter of 1953‚Äì4 and the necessary laws were gradually mobilized producing high levels of construction almost continuously from the 1960s. Social landlords were a major source of expertise as well as construction actors with links to national and local bodies. The construction industry was at the time inadequate so political support was needed It is incorrect to refer to French social housing as public housing. The origins of French social housing lie in the private sector, with the first State aid provided to limited-profit companies by the in 1793. The originally socialist idea was promoted by some French employers in the 2nd half of the 19th century. Public housing companies followed before World War I. There are still different social housing movements, public, private and some cooperative. Social landlord organizations all have similar regulation and similar access to government loans but there are significant differencesMuch is found in the (the Building and Housing Code), Book IV (with social housing allocation and funding elsewhere in the Code). The government launched a series of major construction plans, including the creation of new towns () and new suburbs with HLM (, \\"low-rent housing\\"). The state had the funds and the legal means to acquire the land and could provide some advantages to the companies that then built its huge housing complexes of hundreds of apartments. Quality was also effectively regulated, resulting in decent or even top quality housing for the standard of the 1950s and 1960s. The construction of HLMs were subject to much political debate. Much smaller developments are now the norm. This housing is now generally referred to as , a slightly wider sphere than just housing. France still retains this system, a recent law making it an obligation for every town to have at least 20% HLM. Nowadays HLM represents roughly half of the rental market (46% in 2006). Social housing is not all for disadvantaged people who are just one of the target groups. Part of the funding can be provided by employer-employee groups to provide housing for local employees. The 20% target can include intermediate housing for better off groups, although its object is to produce social mix. Gentrification and the very basis of social housing allocation are divisive issues as well as the extent of local control of housing. This housing has always been a multi-actor activity and recent local government reorganization continues to change the political landscape. While they succeeded in giving lower-income families a place to live in the drive to provide popular housing, this system also led to the creation of suburban ghettos, with a problem of disrepair. There has been a long-term problem of gradual impoverishment of social tenants There, deprived strata of the population, mostly of immigrant origin and suffering massive under-employment, might in the past have been left to simmer away from the more affluent urban centres, sometimes becoming rife with social tensions and violence. This affects a minority of social housing but has a high profile and still produces serious tension. Tackling this problem at its roots is all but simple, and social mix policies can break up populations seen as difficult by redevelopment. This has not had the hoped for results. It has also been sought to resolve the problem of access to the system by disadvantaged people by a new system where certain groups can apply to court to be housed if refused, the \\"right to housing\\". This tends to intensify the controversy over social housing allocation, who should be housed. The French tradition of 'universal' social housing allocation ‚Äì housing for everyone is called into question by EU competition law restricting subsidy except for the disadvantaged. In any event, the system is certainly effective in producing construction, although not with the excesses seen in the recent credit crunch elsewhere. = Germany = Between 1925 and 1930 Germany was the site of innovative and extensive municipal public housing projects, mostly in Berlin, Hamburg, Cologne and Frankfurt. These housing estates (), were made necessary by the dreadful living conditions of pre-war urban tenements. The right to healthy housing was written into the 1919 Weimar Constitution, but few homes were built until the economy stabilised in 1925. The new German housing estates were low-rise, no more than five stories, and in suburban settings. Residents were provided access to light, air, and sun. The size, shape, orientation and architectural style of Germany's public housing were informed by the recent experience of the Viennese, the Dutch, the anti-urban Garden City Movement in Britain, the new industrialized mass-production and pre-fabrication building techniques, the novel use of steel and glass, and by the progressive-liberal policies of the Social Democrats. In 1930 in the industrial city of , the ('Houses with Balcony Access') were designed by Bauhaus director for a housing cooperative that wanted apartments it could let for no more than a quarter of the occupant's income. Working on a tight budget inspired money and space saving innovations, such as using balcony walkways for access to the apartments rather than having internal corridors and clever use of the internal space in the apartments.Wohnungsgenossenschaft Dessau.

In the late 1920s the principles of equal access to ('light, air and sun') and the social effects of a state-guaranteed (\\"minimum subsistence level\\") became a matter of lively popular debate all over Germany. One indirect result of this publicity was the American housing movement: a young Catherine Bauer attended one of May's conferences in 1930, and wrote her influential book Modern Housing (1934) based on research done in Frankfurt and with Dutch architect . Increasing pressure from the rising Nazis brought this era to an end in 1933. A majority of the German public housing experts had social democrat or communist sympathies and were forced out of the country. In East Germany, the communist administration built monolithic apartment blocks and estates. Most new residential buildings from the 1960s onward were built in this style, as it was a quick and relatively cheap way to solve the country's severe housing shortage, which had been caused by wartime bombing raids and the large influx of German refugees from further east. = Hungary = Panelh√°z in Budapest-Kispest. (short form: ) is the name of a type of block of flats (panel buildings) in Hungary. It was the main housing type built in the Socialist era. From 1959 to 1990 788,000 panel flats were built in Hungary. About 2 million people, about one fifth of the country's total population, live in these flats. The Hungarian government and local municipalities began a renovation program during the 2000s. In the program they have insulated these buildings, replaced the old doors and windows with multi-layer thermo glass, renewed the heating system and colored the buildings in a more pleasant way. = Ireland = In Ireland, public housing and halting sites (sites used by semi-nomadic Traveller communities) have been built by local authorities and are known as Local Authority Accommodation. Dublin Corporation and the former Dublin County Council provided the lion's share of Irish local authority housing, with County Longford having the largest ratio of local authority to private housing in the state. The government has promoted tenant purchase on favourable terms, and many former social housing areas are now completely or almost completely privately owned. Housing associations now play a significant role in social housing provision. As the Irish state's ability to borrow is diminished government policy favours an increased role for private financing of housing associations instead of capital grants for local authorities. = Netherlands = In the Netherlands, the rent for the cheaper rental homes is kept low through governmental oversight and regulation. These types of homes are known as . In practice this is accomplished by non-profit private housing foundations or associations (). Due to frequent mergers the number of these organizations dropped to around 430 by 2009. They manage 2.4 million dwellings. The majority of the low-rent apartments in the Netherlands are owned by such organisations. Since the policy changed in 1995 the social housing organizations have become financially independent, focusing on their role as social entrepreneurs. In most Dutch municipalities there came to exist a certain minimum capacity of social housing throughout the last decades. In many cities such as Amsterdam, The Hague, Rotterdam and Utrecht the percentage of social housing approaches or even passes 50 percent. The public (financial) supervision is done by the central fund for housing (). The Dutch housing policy is based on a concept of universal access to affordable housing for all and the prevention of segregation. = Romania = Government built housing in alt= The skyline of many Romanian cities became dominated by standardized apartment blocks under the former communist government's policy of tower bloc construction. Beginning in 1974, systematization consisted largely of the demolition and reconstruction of existing villages, towns, and cities, in whole or in part, with the stated goal of turning Romania into a \\"multilaterally developed socialist society\\". In 2012, 2.7 million flats date from the communist period, accounting for 37% of total housing in Romania and for about 70% in cities and towns. Subsequent to post-communist privatization, the homeownership rate in this form of housing reached of 99.9%.NIS, 2010 Statistical Yearbook 2010: Time Series 1990‚Äì2009 (National Institute of Statistics: Bucharest) http://www.insse.ro/cms/rw/pages/anuarstatistic2010.en.do The new Home Owner Associations (HOAs) were challenged internally by the cumulative effect of defaulting contributions, lack of affordability and the established practice of casual resident service in HOAs, which often triggered mismanagement. On the other hand, HOAs were challenged from outside by non-effective mechanisms to address their internal problems, such as non-existent fast court procedures against defaulting, poor financial assistance to socially disadvantaged households and a private sector unprepared to take on condominium management. = Spain = Public housing, winner of an environmental design award, in , Spain. Spaniards' reluctance to home rental, and government spending cuts in the 1980s, reduced rented public housing in Spain to a minimum. Rented public houses were relatively common in the Franco era (1939‚Äì75). With the advent of democracy and the 1978 Constitution, the management of social housing depended mostly on the autonomous regions. This resulted in a wide variety of laws, which make the issue highly dependent on the region. In spite of this, a scheme for (VPO) has been widely used, consisting of local councils allowing for building contractors and developers to build in public sites or with public loans on condition that a certain percentage of apartments remain subsidized and under control of the local authorities. This is known as ('privately developed'), as opposed to the ('publicly developed'), in which the whole property is owned and managed by a government authority. A new plan () was put forward by the government, aiming to make near a million homes available for public housing, relying both on new construction and refurbishment of unused houses. Major parts of Spanish cities have been expanded in the last 20 years with projects heavily dependent on public and collective housing projects, which has stressed its importance inside the main architecture schools, that have answered the challenge with the development of several specialized courses and formation plans, such as the Madrid UPM - ETH Zurich combined MCH Master in Collective Housing. = Sweden = Tower block buildings in Swedish public housing is called , and consists mostly of flats owned by the local council. Unlike its counterparts in Great Britain, for instance, the Swedish Public Housing has never had any income restrictions. Instead, for large parts of the period between 1920‚Äì1990 (for instance, during the era of Million Programme), the public housing companies such as were the major operators in housing projects as well as in projects aiming to acquire old and worn down buildings. Although not carrying out house-building nor acquisition projects in recent times, the policies lead to a ubiquitous presence of publicly-owned buildings throughout the cities of Sweden, including attractive urban areas, with a rather wide range of income among the tenants. Policies carried out in the Swedish cities throughout the first decade of the 21st century have led to the tenants of public housing having bought the publicly owned buildings in which they live, which in turn has led to a significant decrease of publicly owned buildings in attractive urban areas, subsequently leading to an increased development of processes related to gentrification. = Slovakia = S√≠dlisko III in Pre≈°ov, Slovakia. Forms of housing projects may vary in Slovakia. In the former Czechoslovakia (now Czech Republic and Slovakia) during the communist era in Czechoslovakia, a construction of large housing estates (Slovak: s√≠dlisko, Czech: s√≠dli≈°tƒõ) was an important part of building plans in the former Czechoslovakia. The government wanted to provide large quantities of fast and affordable housing and to slash costs by employing uniform designs over the whole country. They also sought to foster a \\"collectivist nature\\" in people. People living in these housing projects can either usually own their apartments or rent them, usually through a private landlord. There's usually a mix of social classes in these housing projects. = United Kingdom = Salford, Lancashire, England. Park Hill in Sheffield, Yorkshire, England. In the United Kingdom public housing is often referred to by the British public as \\"council housing\\" and \\"council estates\\", based on the historical role of district and borough councils in running public housing. Mass council house building began in about 1920 in order to replace older and dilapidated properties. This followed the 1919 'Addison' Act and the provison of central state subsidies; some local authority or municipal housing was provided before 1914. Housing was a major policy area under Wilson's Labour government, 1964 to 1970, with an accelerated pace of new building, as there was still a great deal of unfit housing needing replacement. Tower blocks, first built in the 1950s, featured prominently in this era. The proportion of council housing rose from 42% to 50% of the nation's housing total,A Short History of the Labour Party by Alastair J. Reid and Henry Pelling while the number of council homes built increased steadily, from 119,000 in 1964 to 133,000 in 1965 and to 142,000 in 1966. Allowing for demolitions, 1.3 million new homes were built between 1965 and 1970.Thorpe, Andrew. (2001) A History of the British Labour Party, Palgrave, To encourage home ownership, the government introduced the Option Mortgage Scheme (1968), which made low-income house buyers eligible for subsidies (equivalent to tax relief on mortgage interest payments).Housing policy: an introduction by Paul N. Balchin and Maureen Rhoden This scheme had the effect of reducing housing costs for buyers on low incomes.Capitalism and public policy in the UK by Tom Burden and Mike Campbell Since the 1970s, non- profit housing associations have been operating an increasing share of social housing properties in the United Kingdom. From 1996 they have also been known as Registered Social Landlords (RSLs), and public housing has been referred to as \\"social housing\\" to encompass both councils and RSLs. Despite being non- profit based, RSLs generally charge higher rents than councils. However, the Westminster Government introduced a \\"rent re-structuring\\" policy for housing associations in England in 2002, which aimed to bring council and RSL rents into line in England by 2012. Local planning departments may require private- sector developers to offer \\"affordable housing\\" as a condition of planning permission (section 106 agreement). This accounts for another ¬£700m of Government funding each year for tenants in part of the United Kingdom. As of 2012, Housing Associations are now also referred to as \\"Private Registered Providers of Social Housing\\" (PRPs). Haringey, North London. Local authorities have been discouraged from building council housing since 1979 following the election of Conservative leader Margaret Thatcher as prime minister. The Parker Morris standard was abolished for those that were built, resulting in smaller room sizes and fewer facilities. The Right to Buy was introduced, resulting in the move of some of the best stock from public tenanted to private owner occupation. Since the year 2000, \\"choice-based lettings\\" (CBL) have been introduced to help ensure social housing was occupied speedily as tenants moved. This can still favour the local over the non-local prospective tenant. In a number of local authority areas, due to the shortage of council housing, three out of four properties may be designated for priority cases (those living in poor overcrowded conditions, with medical or welfare needs, or needing family support) or homeless applicants in order to meet the councils' legal obligations to rehouse people in need. The percentage of properties set aside for vulnerable groups will vary dependent on the demand for council housing in the area. All local authorities have a Housing Strategy to ensure that council houses are let fairly and fulfil the council's legal obligations; deal with people in need; and contribute to sustainability of housing estates, neighbourhood regeneration, and social inclusion. The 1997‚Äì2010 Labour Government wished to move council housing away from local authority management. At first, this was through Large Scale Voluntary Transfers (LSVT) of stock from councils to Housing Associations (HAs). Not all council property could be transferred, as in some local authorities, their housing stock was in poor condition and had a capital value less than the remaining debts from construction costs‚Äîin effect, the council stock was in negative equity. In some local authority areas, the tenants rejected the transfer option. The Labour Government introduced a \\"third way\\": the Arms Length Management Organisation (ALMO), where the housing stock stays with the Local Authority but is managed by a not-for-profit organisation at arm's length from the Local Authority. It also introduced the Decent Homes programme, a capital fund to bring social housing up to a modern physical standard. To use this fund, the manager, whether ALMO or HA, had to achieve a 2 or 3 star rating from its inspection by the Audit Commission. This was intended to drive up management standards. Council landlords cannot access this funding, another incentive to transfer management of council housing to an ALMO or HA. Governments since the early 1990s have also encouraged \\"mixed tenure\\" in regeneration areas and on \\"new-build\\" housing estates, offering a range of ownership and rental options, with a view to engineering social harmony through including \\"social housing\\" and \\"affordable housing\\" options. A recent research reportThe Promotion of 'Mixed Tenure': In Search of the Evidence Base Paper by Dr. Rebecca Tunstall on tenure mixing has argued that the evidence base for tenure mixing remains thin. Social housing occupants may be stigmatised and forced to use a poor door that is separate and less convenient than the door the unsubsidised occupants use and social housing may be less desirably situated. Most UK social housing tenants have the right to swap homes with another tenant even if their landlords are different. This is called a \\"mutual exchange\\". = Former Soviet Union = In the Soviet Union, most of the houses built after World War II were usually 3‚Äì5 stories high, with small apartments. In these boroughs, the goal was saving space and creating as many apartments as possible. Construction starting in the 1970s favored 9- and 16-story concrete panel municipal housing in major cities, 7‚Äì12 stories in smaller urban areas. These housing projects are still used in some countries, especially in countries in central and eastern Europe, and most of them are slowly being renovated.  Oceania  = Australia = Inner-City Sydney Sydney suburb of Waterloo, two of eleven such towers in three different estates spread across the Inner-City Sydney suburbs of Waterloo, Redfern and Surry Hills. Public housing in Australia is provided by departments of state governments, with funding provided by both the state and federal government. There are over 300,000 public housing dwellings in Australia, consisting of low-density housing on master-planned estates located in suburban areas, and also inner-city high-rise apartments in Melbourne and Sydney. In recent decades, rooming and relief housing for the homeless has been privatised, and in recent years this housing has been sold off to avoid maintenance costs and capitalise on sales in a booming property market. In Melbourne, public housing stocks have been in decline for some time, sparking the recent Bendigo street housing campaign in which homeless people are being housed by the community campaign in homes left empty by the state government. = New Zealand = Unlike many other countries, much New Zealand state housing of the 20th century was in the form of detached single-family houses similar to private housing. This is a 1947 development in Oranga, Auckland. Private companies (such as the New Zealand Company) which fostered early organised European settlement in New Zealand constructed immigration barracks to serve as temporary accommodation for their new arrivals. For example: The Workers' Dwellings Act of 1905 resulted in the Government of New Zealand commissioning the building of 646 houses. In 1937 the First Labour Government launched a major public-housing system‚Äîit became known as \\"state housing\\"‚Äîfor citizens unable to afford private rents. Most state housing built between 1937 and the mid-1950s consisted of detached two-to-three-bedroom cottage-style houses; only 1.5% of state houses in 1949 formed part of apartment blocks, all of them in Auckland or in greater Wellington. After World War II ended in 1945, most local authorities also started providing social housing, mainly for elderly people with low incomes.

Though most famous for Christian burials, either in separate catacombs or mixed together, Jews and also adherents of a variety of pagan Roman religions were buried in catacombs, beginning in the 2nd century AD,Toynbee: 39‚Äì40. occasioned by the ancient Roman ban on burials within a city, and also as a response to overcrowding and shortage of land. The most extensive and perhaps the best known is the Christian Catacomb of Callixtus located near the Park of the Caffarella, but there are other sites, both Christian and not, scattered around the city, some of which are now engulfed in the modern urban sprawl. The Christian catacombs are extremely important for the history of Early Christian art, as they contain the great majority of examples from before about 400 AD, in fresco and sculpture, as well as gold glass medallions (these, like most bodies, have been removed). The Jewish catacombs are similarly important for the study of Jewish culture at this early period. Good Shepherd fresco from the Catacombs of San Callisto.  Etymology  The word catacombs comes from the Latin root word catatumbas meaning either ‚Äúamong the tombs‚Äù or, according to other translations from the original Late Latin, ‚Äúnext to the quarry‚Äù. The later translation stems from the first excavations done to create the catacombs system, which was conducted outside of Rome near the quarry.‚ÄúCatacombs of Rome ‚Äì Useful Information ‚Äì Rome & Vatican Museums‚Äù. Rome Museum, www.rome- museum.com/catacombs-of-rome.php.  Precursors  Carved Roman Sarcophagus The Etruscan civilization, which dominated a territory including the area which now includes Rome from perhaps 900 to 100 BC, like many other European peoples, had buried its dead in excavated underground chambers, such as the Tomb of the Capitals, and less complex tumuli. In contrast, the original Roman custom had been cremation of the human body, after which the burnt remains were kept in a pot, urn or ash-chest, often deposited in a columbarium or dovecote. From about the 2nd century AD, inhumation (burial of unburnt human remains) became customary, either in graves or, for those who could afford them, in sarcophagi, often elaborately carved. By the 4th century, burial had overtaken cremation as the usual practice, and the construction of tombs had grown greater and spread throughout the empire. Jews and Christians preferred burial due to the idea of preserving the dead body for resurrection. Considerable tracts of the ancient roads leading out of Rome and other Roman cities were, like the Via Appia to this day, had monumental tombs running alongside them. These would inevitably cost a fortune to construct, whereas clearly in digging out of the catacombs would be less expensive. Despite widespread popular modern ideas, these tunnels were probably not used for regular worship as first, but simply for burial. However, extending pre- existing Roman customs, for memorial services and celebrations of the anniversaries of Christian martyrs took place there. There are sixty known subterranean burial chambers in Rome. They were built outside the walls along main Roman roads, like the Via Appia, the Via Ostiense, the Via Labicana, the Via Tiburtina, and the Via Nomentana. Names of the catacombs ‚Äì like St Calixtus and St Sebastian, which is alongside Via Appia ‚Äì refer to martyrs that may have been buried there. However, about 80% of the excavations used for Christian burials date to after the time of the persecutions. F. van der Meer, Early Christian Art, Faber and Faber, 1967, p. 19  Discoveries  Through research, it has been found that the population‚Äôs diet consisted of freshwater fish. Sample D9-W-XVI-8, considered to be a two-year-old child, shows that children in Ancient Rome were breastfed and this child, in particular, had not yet been weaned off its mother. This results from the fact that the Œ¥15N values had not begun to decline. Fish had intertwined secular and religious aspects in Roman society. For one thing, its was a staple of the daily diet. It also had a variety of significance for Christians, for whom it was not only a common food, as for other Romans, but featured as a symbol in Christian iconography and was consumed at meals held to commemorate the dead. Christian catacombs Roman law forbade burial places within city limits and so all burial places, including the catacombs, were located outside the walls of the city. The first large-scale catacombs in the vicinity of Rome were dug from the 2nd century onwards. They were carved in tufa, a type of volcanic rock which is relatively soft to dig into but subsequently hardens, Christian catacombs existed as a burial ground for early Christians accompanied by inscriptions and early wall art. Although catacombs were of Jewish origin in the first century, by the end of the sixth century there were over 60 Christian catacombs. These catacombs served as a connector for various Christian communities through the underlying concepts of socio-economic status shown within the art. Additionally, the art showed a story of how Christians in the first couple of centuries viewed the world and their idealistic view of how it should be. An earlier catacomb wall art, depicting Adam and Eve from the Old Testament. Christian art in the catacombs is split into three categories: iconographic, stylistic, and technical. From the first to the sixth century, the art in Roman Christian catacombs progressively went into phases as well: an early phase, an Old Testament phase, and a New Testament phase. Excavators (fossors), no doubt slaves, built vast systems of galleries and passages on top of each other. They lie below the surface in an area of more than . Narrow steps that descend as many as four stories join the levels. Passages are about . Burial niches (loculi) were carved into walls. They are high and long. Bodies were placed in chambers in stone sarcophagi in their clothes and bound in linen. Then the chamber was sealed with a slab bearing the name, age and the day of death. The fresco decorations provide the main surviving evidence for Early Christian art, and initially show typically Roman styles used for decorating homes ‚Äì with secular iconography adapted to a religious function. The catacomb of Saint Agnes is a small church. Some families were able to construct cubicula which would house various loculi and the architectural elements of the space would offer a support for decoration. Another excellent place for artistic programs were the arcosolia.  History of Original Tunnelling  The complex system of tunnels that would later be known as the catacombs were first excavated by the Etruscan people that lived in the region predating the Romans. These tunnels were first excavated in the process of mining for various rock resources such as limestone and sandstone. These quarries became the basis for later excavation, first by the Romans for rock resources and then by the Christians and Jews for burial sites and mass graves. Decline and rediscovery The fish and loaves fresco, Catacombs of San Callisto In 380, Christianity became a state religion. At first, many still desired to be buried in chambers alongside the martyrs. However, the practice of catacomb burial declined slowly, and the dead were increasingly buried in church cemeteries. In the 6th century catacombs were used only for martyrs‚Äô memorial services, though some paintings were added as late as the 7th century, for example a Saint Stephen in the Catacomb of Commodilla. Apparently Ostrogoths, Vandals and Lombards that sacked Rome also violated the catacombs, presumably looking for valuables. By the 10th century catacombs were practically abandoned, and holy relics were transferred to above-ground basilicas. In the intervening centuries they remained forgotten until they were accidentally rediscovered in 1578, after which Antonio Bosio spent decades exploring and researching them for his Roma Sotterranea (1632). Archeologist Giovanni Battista de Rossi (1822‚Äì1894) published the first extensive professional studies about catacombs. In 1956 and 1959 Italian authorities found more catacombs near Rome. The catacombs have become an important monument of the early Christian church. Today Responsibility for the Christian catacombs lies with the Holy See, which has set up active official organizations for this purpose: the Pontifical Commission of Sacred Archaeology (Pontificia Commissione di Archeologia Sacra) directs excavations and restoration works, while study of the catacombs is directed in particular by the Pontifical Academy of Archaeology. The administration of some sites is entrusted on a day-to-day basis to local clergy or religious orders who have an activity on or adjacent to the site. The supervision of the Catacombs of St. Callixtus by the Salesian Fathers is well known. In the last years, with the growth of the internet, updated information is often available online, with indication of current street address, opening hours, fees, availability of guides in the different languages, size of groups permitted and public transport. Like other historical sites in Italy, the catacombs are often not accessible at certain times of the day or on certain days of the week and may require online prebooking. Typology Roman catacombs are made up of underground passages (ambulacra), in the walls of which horizontal niches (loculi) were dug. These loculi, generally laid out in sequences (pilae) one above the other from floor or waist level, could each contain one or more bodies. A loculus large enough to contain two bodies was referred to as a bisomus. Another type of burial, typical of Roman catacombs, was the arcosolium, consisting of a curved niche, enclosed under a carved horizontal marble slab. Cubicula (burial rooms containing loculi all for one family) and cryptae (chapels decorated with frescoes) are also commonly found in catacomb passages. When space began to run out, other graves were also dug in the floor of the corridors ‚Äì these graves are called formae. List of catacombs in Rome The Roman catacombs, of which there are forty in the suburbs or former suburbs, were built along the consular roads out of Rome, such as the Via Appia, the Via Ostiensis, the Via Labicana, the Via Tiburtina, and the Via Nomentana. With the exception of the Via Ostiensis (Italian: Via Ostiense), these ancient Latin terms are also the current Italian names for these roads. =Catacombs of Marcellinus and Peter= These catacombs are situated on the ancient Via Labicana, today Via Casilina in Rome, Italy, near the church of Santi Marcellino e Pietro ad Duas Lauros. Their name refers to the Christian martyrs Marcellinus and Peter who, according to tradition, were buried here, near the body of St. Tiburtius. =Catacombs of Domitilla= Catacombs of Domitilla Close to the Catacombs of San Callisto are the large and impressive Catacombs of DomitillaCatacombs of Domitilla (named after Saint Domitilla), spread over of caves. In the beginning of 2009, at the request of the Vatican, the Divine Word Missionaries, a Roman Catholic Society of priests and Brothers, assumed responsibility as administrator of St. Domitilla Catacombs.Divine Word Missionaries =Catacombs of Commodilla= Bearded Christ, from catacombs of Commodilla These catacombs, on the Via Ostiensis, contain one of the earliest images of a bearded Christ. They originally held the relics of Saints Felix and Adauctus. Excavations on the Commodilla were conducted by Franciscan archaeologist Bellarmino Bagatti (1933‚Äì34). =Catacombs of Generosa= Located on the Campana Road, these catacombs are said to have been the resting place, perhaps temporarily, of Simplicius, Faustinus and Beatrix, Christian Martyrs who died in Rome during the Diocletian persecution (302 or 303).Comitato Catacombe di Generosa =Catacombs of Praetextatus= These are found along the via Appia, and were built at the end of 2nd century. They consist of a vast underground burial area, at first in pagan then in Christian use, housing various tombs of Christian martyrs. In the oldest parts of the complex may be found the \\"cubiculum of the coronation\\", with a rare depiction for that period of Christ being crowned with thorns, and a 4th-century painting of Susanna and the old men in the allegorical guise of a lamb and wolves. =Catacombs of Priscilla= The Catacomb of Priscilla, situated at the Via Salaria across from the Villa Ada, probably derives its name from the name of the landowner on whose land they were built. They are looked after by the Benedictine nuns of Priscilla. =Catacombs of San Callisto= The Crypt of the Popes, Catacomb of Callixtus A fresco of a baptism from the Catacombs of San Callisto Sited along the Appian way, these catacombs were built after AD 150, with some private Christian hypogea and a funeral area directly dependent on the Catholic Church. It takes its name from the deacon Saint Callixtus, proposed by Pope Zephyrinus in the administration of the same cemetery ‚Äì on his accession as pope, he enlarged the complex, that quite soon became the official one for the Roman Church. The arcades, where more than fifty martyrs and sixteen pontiffs were buried, form part of a complex graveyard that occupies fifteen hectares and is almost long. =Catacombs of San Lorenzo= Built into the hill beside San Lorenzo fuori le Mura, these catacombs are said to have been the final resting place of St. Lawrence. The church was built by Pope Sixtus III and later remodeled into the present nave. Sixtus also redecorated the shrine in the catacomb and was buried there.Sacred Destinations ‚Äì San Lorenzo =Catacombs of San Pancrazio= Established underneath the San Pacrazio basilica which was built by Pope Symmachus on the place where the body of the young martyr Saint Pancras, or Pancratius, had been buried. In the 17th century, it was given to the Discalced Carmelites, who completely remodeled it. The catacombs house fragments of sculpture and pagan and early Christian inscriptions. =Catacombs of San Sebastiano= Panoramic view of the catacomb of Saint Sebastian. Catacombs of San Sebastiano ‚Äì entrance. One of the smallest Christian cemeteries, this has always been one of the most accessible catacombs and is thus one of the least preserved (of the four original floors, the first is almost completely gone). On the left hand end of the right hand wall of the nave of the primitive basilica, rebuilt in 1933 on ancient remains, arches to end the middle of the nave of the actual church, built in the 13th century, are visible, along with the outside of the apse of the Chapel of the Relics; whole and fragmentary collected sarcophagi (mostly of 4th century date) were found in excavations. Interior picture of the catacomb of Saint Sebastian from 1894. Via a staircase down, one finds the arcades where varied cubicula (including the cubiculum of Giona's fine four stage cycle of paintings, dating to the end of the 4th century). One then arrives at the restored crypt of S. Sebastiano, with a table altar on the site of the ancient one (some remains of the original's base still survive) and a bust of Saint Sebastian attributed to Bernini. From here one reaches a platform, under which is a sandstone cavity ad catacumbas which once may have been named \\"ad catacumbas\\", thus giving this and all other tombs of this type their name. 3 mausolea of the second half of the 2nd century (but also in later use) open off the platform. The first one on the right, decorated on the outside with paintings of funereal banquets and the miracle of the calling out of Cerasa's demons, on the inside contains paintings (including a ceiling painting of a Gorgon's head) and inhumation burials and has a surviving inscription reading \\"Marcus Clodius Hermes\\", the name of its owner. The second, called by some \\"tomb of the Innocentiores\\" (a burial club which owned it), has a refined stucco ceiling, Latin inscriptions in Greek characters, and a graffito with the initials of the Greek words for \\"Jesus Christ, Son of God, Saviour\\". On the left is the mausoleum of Ascia, with an exterior wall painting of vine shoots rising from kantharoi up trompe-l'≈ìil pillars. A room called the \\"Triglia\\" rises from the platform, roughly in the middle of the basilica and cut into from above by the present basilica. This covered room was used for funereal banquets; the plastered walls have hundreds of graffiti by the devotees at these banquets, carved in the second half of the 3rd to the beginnings of the 4th century, with appeals to the apostles Peter and Paul. From the \\"Trigilia\\" one passed into an ancient ambulatory, which turns around into an apse: here is a collection of epitaphs and a model of all the mausolei, of the \\"Triglia\\" and of the Constantinian basilica. From here one descends into the \\"Platonica\\", a construction at the rear of the basilica that was long believed to have been the temporary resting place for Peter and Paul, but was in fact (as proved by excavation) a tomb for the martyr Quirinus, bishop of Sescia in Pannonia, whose remains were brought here in the 5th century. To the right of the \\"Platonica\\" is the chapel of Honorius III, adapted as the vestibule of the mausoleum, with interesting 13th-century paintings of Peter and Paul, the Crucifixion, saints, the Massacre of the Innocents, Madonna and Child, and other subjects. On the left is an apsidal mausoleum with an altar built against the apse: on the left wall a surviving graffito reading \\"domus Petri\\" either hints at Peter having been buried here or testifies to the belief at the time the graffito was written that Peter was buried here. =Catacombs of San Valentino= These catacombs were dedicated to Saint Valentine. In the 13th century, the martyr's relics were transferred to Basilica of Saint Praxedes. =Catacombs of Sant'Agnese= Built for the conservation and veneration of the remains of Saint Agnes of Rome. Agnes' bones are now conserved in the church of Sant'Agnese fuori le mura in Rome, built over the catacomb. Her skull is preserved in a side chapel in the church of Sant'Agnese in Agone in Rome's Piazza Navona. =Catacombs of via Anapo= On the via Salaria, the Catacombs of via Anapo are datable to the end of the 3rd or the beginning of the 4th century, and contain diverse frescoes of biblical subjects. =Jewish catacombs= There are six known Jewish catacombs in Rome, two of which are open to the public: Vigna Randanini and Villa Torlonia. The Jewish catacombs were discovered in 1918, and archaeological excavations continued for twelve years. The structure has two entrances, one on via Syracuse and the other inside Villa Torlonia. The catacombs extend for more than , and date back to the period between the 2nd and 3rd centuries, and possibly remained in use until the 5th century. There are almost a century of epitaphs, but these do not show any examples of a particular relief, beyond some rare frescoes showing the classic Jewish religious symbols. Jewish Catacombs are distinguished from their Christian counterparts by various signs as well as the fact that Jewish people did not visit the dead in the Catacombs. Parts of the Old Testament and the symbol of a candlestick with seven-branches have been spotted on the walls of Jewish Catacombs. Due to high levels of humidity and temperature, bone preservation has been negatively affected in the catacombs. Scientists are unable to identify the sex of the dead due to the lack of preservation in the bones. The other catacombs are not open to the public because of the instability of their structure and the presence of radon. Gallery of paintings from the catacombs of Rome In the Catacombs of Rome, there are many different pieces of artwork. Most artworks are religious in nature some depicting important Christian rites such as baptism, or religious scenes and stories such as the story of \\"The Three Hebrews and the Fiery Furnace\\" or biblical figures such as Adam and Eve.

It was ported to the Dreamcast worldwide shortly after with some gameplay changes and updated graphics and audio. The game places the player in control of a weaponized mech that can hover across large stages and fire at enemies all around them. The player must reach the end of each stage and defeat the boss, while avoiding hazards scattered across the map such as enemy mechs and gun turrets. The initial ideas for Bangai-O came from Treasure programmer Mitsuru Yaida who wanted to challenge himself by programming an extreme number of bullets on the screen at once. Journalists agree that Yaida was most likely inspired by the 1984 Japanese computer game Hover Attack. The team developed the game with a focus on creating enjoyable gameplay, and opted for simple graphical effects to preserve the game's speed. Bangai-O was released on the Nintendo 64 and was limited to a run of 10,000 copies because of publisher Entertainment Software Publishing's belief it had niche appeal. The team replaced most of the graphics and audio, changed some gameplay elements, and re-released it on the Dreamcast three months later, a version later released internationally. Bangai-O received positive reviews from game journalists. Many critics compared it to shoot 'em ups and action games of the past, praising its retro gameplay and aesthetics. They also commended the level design for keeping the game interesting throughout. Some reviews, especially those for the Dreamcast version, were more critical of the graphics and believed the game's value was primarily in its nostalgic gameplay. The game received two sequels: Bangai-O Spirits (2008) for the Nintendo DS and Bangai-O HD: Missile Fury (2011) for the Xbox 360.  Gameplay  A player in the center hovers through a stage while avoiding enemy shots (Nintendo 64 version) Bangai-O is a 2D side-scrolling multidirectional shooter. The player controls a weaponized mech that is piloted by the two main characters, Riki and his sister Mami. The story follows Riki and Mami in their efforts to stop criminals from smuggling fruit contraband to finance their evil deeds. The player can fly freely around each of the game's 44 stages, and must find and destroy the boss in each stage to advance. The mech can shoot in eight directions, and the type of ammo is dependent on which character is piloting. The two pilots can be interchanged instantaneously, Riki fires homing missiles and Mami shoots reflecting projectiles which bounce off walls. The stages are populated with destroyable buildings and obstacles, as well as some walls that are opened by switches. There are also hazards such as gun turrets and enemy mechs which fire projectiles at the player. The player has a health meter but no brief invulnerability period after being hit, so can die instantly if hit with a barrage of fire. Destroyed enemies and objects yield fruit which replenishes a meter that is used to power the \\"scatter bomb\\" attack. This attack can be charged to release up to 100 shots scattered in all directions at once. Hitting all 100 shots on enemies will open a small portal to a shop where the player can get upgrades such as improved shot damage. The Dreamcast version of Bangai-O, released after the initial Nintendo 64 version, features significant differences in gameplay which results in a more streamlined experience. In the Dreamcast version, the bullets are stronger, and destroying objects and enemies refills the bomb attack meter instead of fruit which now only add to the player's score. The bomb attack also can no longer be charged to a specific number of missiles, but is dependent on the player's proximity to enemy projectiles. In the Dreamcast version, up to 400 missiles can be shot at once in comparison to 100 on the Nintendo 64. Also, the shop is removed. Instead, the game includes power-ups that can be found among environment wreckage. There are also other minor differences such as scoring differences and more structure and enemy types.  Development  Hover Attack (1984) is believed to be the inspiration for Bangai-O. The idea for Bangai-O came from Treasure employee Mitsuru Yaida (commonly known by the pseudonym \\"Yaiman\\"). He remembered playing an older shooting game that amazed him with the sheer number of bullets that could be rendered on the screen at once. Even though Yaiman and other staff behind the game have not identified the game, industry analysts agree that the game is almost certainly Hover Attack (1984) for Japanese computers. Yaiman began thinking about the programming challenges involved in detecting when the bullets collide with other objects, and started work on a prototype. He later received permission from company president Masato Maegawa to pull in other staff and work towards producing a full game. Yaiman served as the main programmer and \\"General Manager\\". About ten people worked on Bangai-O. Treasure developed the game with a focus on creating addictive and fast gameplay, with less focus on graphics. They opted for large and fast 2D graphical effects and anime artwork to preserve their style. One of the artists on the team, Koichi Kimura, had just finished working on Guardian Heroes (1996), another 2D game. With more powerful development hardware available, he wanted to challenge himself the possibilities and limits of 2D graphics. The story is based on typical Japanese Yakuza revenge plays.  Release  Treasure announced Bangai-O for the Nintendo 64 in June 1999. It was released on September 3 the same year. Because of the game's niche appeal, the publisher Entertainment Software Publishing (ESP) only shipped 10,000 copies. The Dreamcast version was first released in Japan on December 9, 1999. This version had improved graphics and audio over the Nintendo 64 original. Many of the sprites were reworked, background animations were added, and the game now featured CD-quality music. By February 2000, publishers were researching the possibility of localizing the Dreamcast version for Western audiences. At the Electronic Entertainment Expo (E3) in May that year, IGN reported that a company had begun localizing the game, and had given it English menus and renamed it Bangai-O from its obscure Japanese title, Bakuretsu Muteki Bangaioh. In December, industry newcomer Conspiracy Entertainment announced they were localizing Bangai-O along with another Dreamcast game, Record of Lodoss War (2000). The Dreamcast version was planned for release on February 27, 2001, but was eventually released on March 21.  Reception  Bangai-O received positive reviews for its initial Nintendo 64 release. Critics enjoyed the manic and unique gameplay that they believed was characteristic of Treasure's video games. Most compared it to older shoot 'em ups and action games. GameFan called it a mix between the free-floating gameplay of Sub Terrania (1994) and the rotating shooting action of Omega Boost (1999). They appreciated it as one of the few shooters on the Nintendo 64, and compared its aesthetic missile shooting style to Macross. Peter Barthalow (IGN) wrote that the game was \\"in typical Treasure fashion...an addictive and original hodgepodge of genres and game mechanics that defy easy explanation.\\" Journalists commended the variety in the game's design that kept it feeling fresh throughout. Anoop Gantayat (IGN) wrote that the level design made good use of each character's shooting mode. Barthalow and Martin Kitts (N64 Magazine) both praised the level design for forcing the player to change their tactics level to level. Barthalow called the building elements for the levels \\"versatile\\", and went on to say some levels were puzzles, others had racing aspects, and others were \\"insane blastfests.\\" Gantayat argued that Bangai-O is \\"a game that you either love, or just don't understand yet.\\" Bangai-O was praised for its retro gameplay and aesthetics. Kitts and the staff at GameFan wrote that it looked and played like a Super NES game and pointed out how some effects were reminiscent of the 16-bit system's Mode 7 rotation effects. GameFan explained further that it looked like a Super NES game with less slowdown, a higher resolution, and more color. Rick Mears (GameFan) wrote that it felt like Robotron (1982) with its unique control style, and called it an \\"old school 2D treat.\\" Although the game was not in 3D like most other games at the time, critics felt the 2D graphics were satisfactory enough. Gantayat pointed out the scatter bomb attack that fills the screen with bullets \\"a momentous occasion...one of the main parts of the Bangai-O experience.\\" Mears praised the game for not slowing down when rendering scenes like this. Reviews for the Dreamcast version carried the same sentiments as the Nintendo 64 version in regards to the frantic and unique gameplay. Gantayat (IGN) and staff at GameFan preferred this new version because of the updated graphics, new CD-quality soundtrack, and more streamlined gameplay. With this release, journalists were more critical of the graphics and audio, commenting more heavily on the game's appeal primarily as a nostalgic shooter. The staff at Computer and Video Games wrote that it was a fun in a nostalgic way, but will not hold a player's attention for very long. A critic at GameSpy wrote that the graphics were bland and lacked polish, and the focus was on the gameplay. They argued that Bangai-O is a game designed for \\"hardcore\\" gamers and commented: \\"Are games coming out today missing something from the glory days of twitch gameplay...Or am I just too jaded by the 3-D graphics, complex mission objectives, and controls of most modern games.\\" In a brief but critical review, Dreamcast Magazine (UK) argued that it was a nearly direct port of the Nintendo 64 version, and called it \\"unimaginative.\\"  Sequels  Bangai-O received two sequels. The first, Bangai-O Spirits, was released for the Nintendo DS in 2008, and the second, Bangai-O HD: Missile Fury, was released exclusively on the Xbox 360 via Xbox Live Arcade in 2011. The games feature most of the same core gameplay ideas as the first game, but evolve on them with more weapons and gameplay elements. Both games included level editors, and the latter features multiplayer modes.

Kitengela begun as The Kitengela group ranch, made up of 18,292 ha and 214 registered members which was subdivided in 1988 in efforts by the Government to encourage private land ownership in pastoral systems, with the aim of intensifying and commercializing livestock production. After subdivision of the group ranch, land fragmentation and sales have continued at a steady and escalating pace. The human population within the Kitengela area has more than doubled in the last 10 years, from 6548 in 1989 to 17,347 in 1999 to 58,167 in 2009. There is also a town named Kitengela in the area. Close to Nairobi National Park is also the Kitengela Game Conservation Area populated with buffalo, Masai giraffe, eastern black rhino, Common eland, impala, Grant's and Thomson's gazelle, common waterbuck and Defassa waterbuck, hippopotamus, common warthog, olive baboon, monkeys and the attendant carnivores ‚Äì lion, spotted hyena, cheetah, side-striped and black-backed jackals, African golden wolves, bat- eared fox and smaller carnivores. The diversity of species is decreasing in the Kitengela area adjacent to the Nairobi National Park, where land-uses not compatible with wildlife are increasing.  Kitengela town  Kajiado County (blue) within Nairobi Metro (green) Kitengela is a town in Kajiado County just south of Nairobi and is part of the Nairobi Metropolitan Area. Kitengela is one of the fastest growing urban areas of Kenya according to census data of 2019, having tripled in population inflows since 2009. It has an urban population of 154,436 people. Kitengela is close to Athi River town in Machakos County in the former Eastern Province, while Kitengela belongs to Kajiado County in the former Rift Valley Province. Kitengela is growing quickly and is expanding with a huge influx of middle class Nairobians who have built lovely gated communities and businesses in an unprecedented construction boom, thanks to the affordable land compared to Nairobi city as well as availability of 5 cement companies and growing infrastructural amenities. Residents describe Kitengela as \\"having the best of both worlds,\\" given its close proximity to Nairobi but easy-going slow paced rural feel, as well as the friendly, collaborative nature of the resident population. Kitengela is famous for \\"nyama choma\\" (roast meat) - a Kenyan delicacy. The town has a wide variety of restaurants that serve this delicacy. Some of the most famous ones include the famous Yukos, Enkare, Arusha Meat Den and numerous more. Kitengela has a wide variety of financial institutions and saccos (savings and credit cooperatives) that have flooded the town to finance the construction boom as well as cater to the soaring middle class population. It also has seen a boom in posh hotels, clubs and other entertainment facilities. In recent times Kitengela has developed a reputation for new, unique cutting-edge entertainment facilities such as a 5 star club nestled in an aeroplane have sprung up in the town - a first for Kenya. As Kitengela's middle class population has boomed, so has its wide variety of high end schools and universities to cater to the children of the middle classes. Some of the schools include Kitengela International Schools, Acacia Crest, Chuna Preparatory, Orchard Schools, Nova Pioneer Kitengela and numerous more. Some of the universities and colleges include KCA University Kitengela campus, Kitengela Institute of Management Studies, KGA East University, East African University, RAF International University among others. Kitengela's gated communities for the middle classes include Chuna, Milimani, Royal Gates, New Valley, Muigai Prestige, New World Gardens, Safaricom 1 & 2 estates, Police Sacco Estate, EPZ estate, Fountain View, Riverside, Upper Valley, Kenpipe Gardens and many more. These estates have seen an unprecedented boom due to the fact that most of them are controlled, not allowing unsightly flats or small businesses/kiosks within their gated walls. Chuna Estate, Royal Finesse and Royal Gates are considered among the best organised of them but many more are coming up each year. With the construction and completion of Isinya pipeline road, as well as the ongoing construction of the Mlolongo to Waiyaki Way expressway, as well as Konza City Metropolis nearby, Kitengela is poised to experience even more growth and development. Kitengela is served by Jomo Kenyatta International Airport, Athi River SGR station as well as a future commuter rail station that is currently under construction that will connect commuters to Nairobi CBD.

The chemical equation for this reaction is :CaCO3 \\\\+ heat ‚Üí CaO + CO2 This reaction takes place at (at which temperature the partial pressure of CO2 is 1 atmosphere), but a temperature around 1000 ¬∞C (1800 ¬∞F; at which temperature the partial pressure of CO2 is 3.8 atmospheresCRC Handbook of Chemistry and Physics, 54th Ed, p F-76) is usually used to make the reaction proceed quickly.Parkes, G.D. and Mellor, J.W. (1939). Mellor's Modern Inorganic Chemistry London: Longmans, Green and Co. Excessive temperature is avoided because it produces unreactive, \\"dead- burned\\" lime. Slaked lime (calcium hydroxide) can be formed by mixing quicklime with water. Early lime use Because it is so readily made by heating limestone, lime must have been known from the earliest times, and all the early civilizations used it in building mortars and as a stabilizer in mud renders and floors.Hewlett, P. C. (Ed.) (1998). Lea's Chemistry of Cement and Concrete: 4th Ed, Arnold, , Chapter 1 Knowledge of its value in agriculture is also ancient, but agricultural use only became widely possible when the use of coal made it cheapPlatt, Colin (1978). Medieval England, BCA, , pp. 116‚Äì7 in the coalfields in the late 13th century, and an account of agricultural use was given in 1523.Sir Anthony Fitzherbert, Boke of Husbandrye, 1523 The earliest descriptions of lime kilns differ little from those used for small- scale manufacture a century ago. Because land transportation of minerals like limestone and coal was difficult in the pre-industrial era, they were distributed by sea, and lime was most often manufactured at small coastal ports. Many preserved kilns are still to be seen on quaysides around the coasts of Britain. Types of kiln Permanent lime kilns fall into two broad categories: \\"flare kilns\\" also known as \\"intermittent\\" or \\"periodic\\" kilns; and \\"draw kilns\\" also known as \\"perpetual\\" or \\"running\\" kilns. In a flare kiln, a bottom layer of coal was built up and the kiln above filled solely with chalk. The fire was alight for several days, and then the entire kiln was emptied of the lime. In a draw kiln, usually a stone structure, the chalk or limestone was layered with wood, coal or coke and lit. As it burnt through, lime was extracted from the bottom of the kiln, through the draw hole. Further layers of stone and fuel were added to the top. Early kilns Cross section of typical early kiln The common feature of early kilns was an egg-cup shaped burning chamber, with an air inlet at the base (the \\"eye\\"), constructed of brick. Limestone was crushed (often by hand) to fairly uniform lumps ‚Äì fine stone was rejected. Successive dome-shaped layers of limestone and wood or coal were built up in the kiln on grate bars across the eye. When loading was complete, the kiln was kindled at the bottom, and the fire gradually spread upwards through the charge. When burnt through, the lime was cooled and raked out through the base. Fine ash dropped out and was rejected with the \\"riddlings\\". Only lump stone could be used, because the charge needed to \\"breathe\\" during firing. This also limited the size of kilns and explains why kilns were all much the same size. Above a certain diameter, the half-burned charge would be likely to collapse under its own weight, extinguishing the fire. So kilns always made 25‚Äì30 tonnes of lime in a batch. Typically the kiln took a day to load, three days to fire, two days to cool and a day to unload, so a one-week turnaround was normal. The degree of burning was controlled by trial and error from batch to batch by varying the amount of fuel used. Because there were large temperature differences between the center of the charge and the material close to the wall, a mixture of underburned (i.e. high loss on ignition), well-burned and dead-burned lime was normally produced. Typical fuel efficiency was low, with 0.5 tonnes or more of coal being used per tonne of finished lime (15 MJ/kg). Lime production was sometimes carried out on an industrial scale. One example at Annery in North Devon, England, near Great Torrington, was made up of three kilns grouped together in an 'L' shape and was situated beside the Torrington canal and the River Torridge to bring in the limestone and coal, and to transport away the calcined lime in the days before properly metalled roads existed.Griffith, R. S. Ll. (1971). Annery Kiln, Weare Gifford. Grenville College project. Supervisor Mr. B. D. Hughes. Sets of seven kilns were common. A loading gang and an unloading gang would work the kilns in rotation through the week. A rarely used kiln was known as a \\"lazy kiln\\".Hood, James (1928). Kilmarnock Water and Craufurdland Kilm Glenf Ramb Soc. Annals. 1919 ‚Äì 1930. P. 126. =Great Britain= The large kiln at Crindledykes near Haydon Bridge, Northumbria, was one of more than 300 in the county. It was unique to the area in having four draw arches to a single pot. As production was cut back, the two side arches were blocked up, but were restored in 1989 by English Heritage. The development of the national rail network made the local small-scale kilns increasingly unprofitable, and they gradually died out through the 19th century. They were replaced by larger industrial plants. At the same time, new uses for lime in the chemical, steel and sugar industries led to large-scale plants. These also saw the development of more efficient kilns. A lime kiln erected at Dudley, West Midlands (formerly Worcestershire) in 1842 survives as part of the Black Country Living Museum which opened in 1976, although the kilns were last used during the 1920s. It is now among the last in a region which was dominated by coalmining and limestone mining for generations until the 1960s.

The town, now called Walkerville, was set on an isolated part of the Victorian coastline and exported the lime by ship. When this became unprofitable in 1926 the kilns were shut down. The present-day area, though having no town amenities as such, markets itself as a tourist destination. The ruins of the lime kilns can still be seen today.

The key to development in efficiency was the invention of continuous kilns, avoiding the wasteful heat- up and cool-down cycles of the batch kilns. The first were simple shaft kilns, similar in construction to blast furnaces. These are counter-current shaft kilns. Modern variants include regenerative and annular kilns. Output is usually in the range 100‚Äì500 tonnes per day. Counter-current shaft kilns The fuel is injected part-way up the shaft, producing maximum temperature at this point. The fresh feed fed in at the top is first dried then heated to 800 ¬∞C, where de-carbonation begins, and proceeds progressively faster as the temperature rises. Below the burner, the hot lime transfers heat to, and is cooled by, the combustion air. A mechanical grate withdraws the lime at the bottom. A fan draws the gases through the kiln, and the level in the kiln is kept constant by adding feed through an airlock. As with batch kilns, only large, graded stone can be used, in order to ensure uniform gas- flows through the charge. The degree of burning can be adjusted by changing the rate of withdrawal of lime. Heat consumption as low as 4 MJ/kg is possible, but 4.5 to 5 MJ/kg is more typical. Due to temperature peak at the burners up to 1200 ¬∞C in a shaft kiln conditions are ideal to produce medium and hard burned lime. Gas flows in two cycles of operation of regenerative shaft kilns Regenerative kilns These typically consist of a pair of shafts, operated alternately. First, when shaft A is the \\"primary\\" and B the \\"secondary\\" shaft, the combustion air is added from the top of shaft A, while fuel somewhat below via burner lances. The flame is top-bottom. The hot gases pass downward, cross to shaft B via the so-called \\"channel\\" and pass upward to exhaust of shaft B. At same time in both shafts cooling air is added from the bottom to cool the lime and to make exhaust of gases via the bottom of the kiln impossible via maintaining always a positive pressure. The combustion air and cooling air leave the kiln jointly via exhaust on top of shaft B, preheating the stone. The direction of flow is reversed periodically (typically 5‚Äì10 times per hour) shaft A and B changing the role of \\"primary\\" and \\"secondary\\" shaft. The kiln has three zones: preheating zone on the top, burning zone in the middle, and cooling zone close to the bottom. The cycling produces a long burning zone of constant, relatively low temperature (around 950 ¬∞C) that is ideal for the production of high quality soft burned reactive lime. With exhaust gas temperatures as low as 120 ¬∞C and lime temperature at kiln outlet in 80 ¬∞C range the heat loss of the regenerative kiln is minimal, fuel consumption is as low as 3.6 MJ/kg. Due to these features the regenerative kilns are today mainstream technology under conditions of substantial fuel costs. Regenerative kilns are built with 150 to 800 t/day output, 300 to 450 being typical. Gas flows in an annular shaft kiln Annular kilns These contain a concentric internal cylinder. This gathers pre-heated air from the cooling zone, which is then used to pressurize the middle annular zone of the kiln. Air spreading outward from the pressurized zone causes counter-current flow upwards, and co-current flow downwards. This again produces a long, relatively cool calcining zone. Fuel consumption is in 4 to 4.5 MJ/kg range and the lime is typically medium burned. Rotary kiln with preheater: hot gas flows =Rotary kilns= Rotary kilns started to be used for lime manufacture at the start of the 20th century and now account for a large proportion of new installations if energy costs are less important. The early use of simple rotary kilns had the advantages that a much wider range of limestone size could be used, from fines upwards, and undesirable elements such as sulfur can be removed. On the other hand, fuel consumption was relatively high because of poor heat exchange compared with shaft kilns, leading to excessive heat loss in exhaust gases. Old fashioned \\"long\\" rotary kilns operate at 7 to 10 MJ/kg. Modern installations partially overcome this disadvantage by adding a preheater, which has the same good solids/gas contact as a shaft kiln, but fuel consumption is still somewhat higher, typically in range of 4.5 to 6 MJ/kg. In the design shown, a circle of shafts (typically 8‚Äì15) is arranged around the kiln riser duct. Hot limestone is discharged from the shafts in sequence, by the action of a hydraulic \\"pusher plate\\". Kilns of 1000 tonnes per day output are typical. The rotary kiln is the most flexible of any lime kilns able to produce soft, medium, or hard burned as well as dead-burned lime or dolime. =Gas cleaning= All the above kiln designs produce exhaust gas that carries an appreciable amount of dust. Lime dust is particularly corrosive. Equipment is installed to trap this dust, typically in the form of electrostatic precipitators or bag filters. The dust usually contains a high concentration of elements such as alkali metals, halogens and sulfur. Carbon dioxide emissions The lime industry is a significant carbon dioxide emitter. The manufacture of one tonne of calcium oxide involves decomposing calcium carbonate, with the formation of 785 kg of CO2 in some applications, such as when used as mortar; this CO2 is later re-absorbed as the mortar goes off. If the heat supplied to form the lime (3.75 MJ/kg in an efficient kiln) is obtained by burning fossil fuel it will release CO2: in the case of coal fuel 295 kg/t; in the case of natural gas fuel 206 kg/t. The electric power consumption of an efficient plant is around 20 kWh per tonne of lime. This additional input is the equivalent of around 20 kg CO2 per ton if the electricity is coal-generated. Thus, total emission may be around 1 tonne of CO2 for every tonne of lime even in efficient industrial plants, but is typically 1.3 t/t.EU Emissions Trading Scheme National Archives Gov UK However, if the source of heat energy used in its manufacture is a fully renewable power source, such as solar, wind, hydro or even nuclear; there may be no net emission of CO2 from the calcination process. Less energy is required in production per weight than portland cement, primarily because a lower temperature is required.

Some examples of the music played for the dancers have survived. These include \\"George Green's College Hornpipe\\", collected from the Little Downham Melodeon player. Molly dancing also occurred throughout north Manchester and Salford on and around May Day (last recorded incidence in Salford ). Though (at least by this date) there was no dancing as such, just children dressing up (the boys dressed as girls, and wearing rouge), who would then journey from house to house asking for small amounts of cash. This tradition was recorded in the works of the Opies, who wrote of journeying across Manchester one May Day in the 1950s and seeing many children taking part in this, and the related tradition (for girls) of May Queen celebrations. Molly dancing in Manchester was subject of a BBC Radio 4 Making History programme, and elicited a wide response from readers who remembered taking part.http://www.bbc.co.uk/radio4/history/making_history/makhist10_prog5d.shtml The tradition died out rapidly in the late 1950s, in large part because of post-war slum clearance programmes, which resulted in the widespread demolition of housing, and the break-up of communities throughout Manchester. Traditions Molly dancing is most associated with Plough Monday, the first Monday after Epiphany. Tradition has it that as a way of filling the gap between Christmas and the start of the spring ploughing season, the ploughboys would tour around the village landowners, offering to dance for money. Those who refused would be penalised in various ways (see Trick or treat) including having a furrow ploughed across the offender's lawn. The dancers, wishing to gain employment from those same landowners shortly afterwards, would attempt to conceal their identities by blacking their faces with soot and dressing up in a modified version of their Sunday best, typically black garments adorned with coloured scarves and other fripperies. It was originally an all-male tradition but with one of the members--the Molly--dressed up as a woman. Pig Dyke Molly, in their distinctive black-and-white costumes, performing a broom dance at Whittlesea Straw Bear The modern tradition Molly dancing was revived by the Cambridge Morris Men in 1977 to coincide with the revival of the Balsham Ploughboys. The Cambridge Men still dance Molly during the day on Plough Monday. The Morris dance revival of the 1970s led to the creation of many new sides, which nowadays usually involve both men and women. In recent years, Molly dancing has enjoyed a popular revival both in East Anglia and the East Midlands, one of the best-known teams being the Ouse Washes Molly Dancers. The largest regular assemblage of Molly dancers is at the Whittlesea Straw Bear Festival, established 1980, which is held in Whittlesey, Cambridgeshire, every January. Modern Molly dancing demonstrates the clearest distinction between \\"re-enactment of tradition\\" and \\"modern interpretation of tradition\\" of modern morris dancing. Elaine Bradtke wrote a PhD thesis on the inherent post-modernism of the Seven Champions, one of the first and best examples of modern Molly dance. Many other teams have developed Molly, inspired by the unhistorical but very effective military formations of Seven Champions (e.g. Ouse Washes, Gog Magog, Handsome Molly in New Jersey, Countess Isabella's Automata) whilst others have taken it in new directions, equally unhistorical but at their best equally effective in very different ways; e.g. Norwich Shitwitches (now renamed Kit Witches) and Pig Dyke Molly. To this day Deptford Fowlers' Troop perform Molly dances, as well as parading Jack in the Green. They take their name from a century-old troop depicted in a photograph of 1906.

It was the capital of the Kingdom of Zimbabwe during the country's Late Iron Age. Construction on the city began in the 11th century and continued until it was abandoned in the 15th century. The edifices were erected by the ancestral Shona. The stone city spans an area of which, at its peak, could have housed up to 18,000 people. It is recognised as a World Heritage site by UNESCO. Great Zimbabwe is believed to have served as a royal palace for the local monarch. As such, it would have been used as the seat of political power. Among the edifice's most prominent features were its walls, some of which were over five metres high. They were constructed without mortar (dry stone). Eventually, the city was abandoned and fell into ruin. The earliest known written mention of the Great Zimbabwe ruins was in 1531 by Vicente Pegado, captain of the Portuguese garrison of Sofala, on the coast of modern-day Mozambique, who recorded it as Symbaoe. The first confirmed visits by Europeans were in the late 19th century, with investigations of the site starting in 1871. Later, studies of the monument were controversial in the archaeological world, with political pressure being put upon archaeologists by the government of Rhodesia to deny its construction by native African people. Great Zimbabwe has since been adopted as a national monument by the Zimbabwean government, and the modern independent state was named after it. The word great distinguishes the site from the many hundreds of small ruins, now known as \\"zimbabwes\\", spread across the Zimbabwe Highveld.M. Sibanda, H. Moyana et al. 1992. The African Heritage. History for Junior Secondary Schools. Book 1. Zimbabwe Publishing House. There are 200 such sites in southern Africa, such as Bumbusi in Zimbabwe and Manyikeni in Mozambique, with monumental, mortarless walls; Great Zimbabwe is the largest of these. Name The conical tower inside the Great Enclosure at Great Zimbabwe Zimbabwe is the Shona name of the ruins, first recorded in 1531 by Vicente Pegado, Captain of the Portuguese Garrison of Sofala. Pegado noted that \\"The natives of the country call these edifices Symbaoe, which according to their language signifies 'court'\\". The name contains dzimba, the Shona term for \\"houses\\". There are two theories for the etymology of the name. The first proposes that the word is derived from Dzimba-dza-mabwe, translated from the Karanga dialect of Shona as \\"large houses of stone\\" (dzimba = plural of imba, \\"house\\"; mabwe = plural of bwe, \\"stone\\").. See also A second suggests that Zimbabwe is a contracted form of dzimba-hwe, which means \\"venerated houses\\" in the Zezuru dialect of Shona, as usually applied to the houses or graves of chiefs.Garlake (1973) 13 Description Enclosure. Some remains of the valley complex can be seen in front of it. =Settlement= The majority of scholars believe that it was built by members of the Gokomere culture, who were the ancestors of the modern Shona in Zimbabwe. The Great Zimbabwe area was settled by the fourth century AD. Between the fourth and the seventh centuries, communities of the Gokomere or Ziwa cultures farmed the valley, and mined and worked iron, but built no stone structures.Pikirayi (2001) p129 These are the earliest Iron Age settlements in the area identified from archaeological diggings.Summers (1970) p163 =Construction and growth= Construction of the stone buildings started in the 11th century and continued for over 300 years. The ruins at Great Zimbabwe are some of the oldest and largest structures located in Southern Africa, and are the second oldest after nearby Mapungubwe in South Africa. Its most formidable edifice, commonly referred to as the Great Enclosure, has walls as high as extending approximately , making it the largest ancient structure south of the Sahara Desert. David Beach believes that the city and its state, the Kingdom of Zimbabwe, flourished from 1200 to 1500, although a somewhat earlier date for its demise is implied by a description transmitted in the early 1500s to Jo√£o de Barros. Its growth has been linked to the decline of Mapungubwe from around 1300, due to climatic change or the greater availability of gold in the hinterland of Great Zimbabwe. Aerial view of Great Enclosure and Valley Complex, looking west Traditional estimates are that Great Zimbabwe had as many as 18,000 inhabitants at its peak. However, a more recent survey concluded that the population likely never exceeded 10,000. The ruins that survive are built entirely of stone; they span . =Features of the ruins= Aerial view looking southeast, Hill Complex in foreground View west from the Eastern Enclosure of the Hill Complex, showing the granite boulder that resembles the Zimbabwe Bird and the balcony. Detail of the wall with lichen, 1975. In 1531, Vicente Pegado, Captain of the Portuguese Garrison of Sofala, described Zimbabwe thus: The ruins form three distinct architectural groups. They are known as the Hill Complex, the Valley Complex and the Great Enclosure. The Hill Complex is the oldest, and was occupied from the ninth to thirteenth centuries. The Great Enclosure was occupied from the thirteenth to fifteenth centuries, and the Valley Complex from the fourteenth to sixteenth centuries. Notable features of the Hill Complex include the Eastern Enclosure, in which it is thought the Zimbabwe Birds stood, a high balcony enclosure overlooking the Eastern Enclosure, and a huge boulder in a shape similar to that of the Zimbabwe Bird.Garlake (1973) 27 The Great Enclosure is composed of an inner wall, encircling a series of structures and a younger outer wall. The Conical Tower, in diameter and high, was constructed between the two walls.Garlake (1973) 29 The Valley Complex is divided into the Upper and Lower Valley Ruins, with different periods of occupation. There are different archaeological interpretations of these groupings. It has been suggested that the complexes represent the work of successive kings: some of the new rulers founded a new residence. The focus of power moved from the Hill Complex in the twelfth century, to the Great Enclosure, the Upper Valley and finally the Lower Valley in the early sixteenth century. The alternative \\"structuralist\\" interpretation holds that the different complexes had different functions: the Hill Complex as a temple, the Valley complex was for the citizens, and the Great Enclosure was used by the king. Structures that were more elaborate were probably built for the kings, although it has been argued that the dating of finds in the complexes does not support this interpretation. =Notable artefacts= Copy of Zimbabwe Bird soapstone sculpture The most important artefacts recovered from the Monument are the eight Zimbabwe Birds. These were carved from a micaceous schist (soapstone) on the tops of monoliths the height of a person.Garlake (2002) 158 Slots in a platform in the Eastern Enclosure of the Hill Complex appear designed to hold the monoliths with the Zimbabwe birds, but as they were not found in situ it cannot be determined which monolith and bird were where.Garlake (1973) 119 Other artefacts include soapstone figurines (one of which is in the British Museum), pottery, iron gongs, elaborately worked ivory, iron and copper wire, iron hoes, bronze spearheads, copper ingots and crucibles, and gold beads, bracelets, pendants and sheaths.Garlake (2002) 159‚Äì162Summers (1970) p166 Glass beads and porcelain from China and Persia among other foreign artefacts were also found, attesting the international trade linkages of the Kingdom. In the extensive stone ruins of the great city, which still remain today, include eight, monolithic birds carved in soapstone. It is thought that they represent the bateleur eagle- a good omen, protective spirit and messenger of the gods in Shona culture. =Trade= Archaeological evidence suggests that Great Zimbabwe became a centre for trading, with artefacts suggesting that the city formed part of a trade network linked to KilwaGarlake (2002) 184‚Äì185 and extending as far as China. Copper coins found at Kilwa Kisiwani appear to be of the same pure ore found on the Swahili coast.http://www.artsrn.ualberta.ca/amcdouga/Hist446/readings/kilwa_sutton.pdf This international trade was mainly in gold and ivory; some estimates indicate that more than 20 million ounces of gold were extracted from the ground. That international commerce was in addition to the local agricultural trade, in which cattle were especially important. The large cattle herd that supplied the city moved seasonally and was managed by the court. Chinese pottery shards, coins from Arabia, glass beads and other non-local items have been excavated at Zimbabwe. Despite these strong international trade links, there is no evidence to suggest exchange of architectural concepts between Great Zimbabwe and centres such as Kilwa.Garlake (2002) 185 =Decline= Causes for the decline and ultimate abandonment of the site around 1450 have been suggested as due to a decline in trade compared to sites further north, the exhaustion of the gold mines, political instability and famine and water shortages induced by climatic change. The Mutapa state arose in the fifteenth century from the northward expansion of the Great Zimbabwe tradition, having been founded by Nyatsimba Mutota from Great Zimbabwe after he was sent to find new sources of salt in the north; (this supports the belief that Great Zimbabwe's decline was due to a shortage of resources). Great Zimbabwe also predates the Khami and Nyanga cultures. History of research and origins of the ruins Great Zimbabwe appears on Abraham Ortelius' 1570 map Africae Tabula Nova, rendered \\"Simbaoe\\". =From Portuguese traders to Karl Mauch= The first European visit may have been made by the Portuguese traveler Ant√≥nio Fernandes in 1513-1515, who crossed twice and reported in detail the region of present-day Zimbabwe (including the Shona kingdoms) and also fortified centers in stone without mortar. However, passing en route a few kilometres north and about south of the site, he did not make a reference to Great Zimbabwe. Rhodesiana: The Pioneer HeadOliver, Roland & Anthony Atmore (1975). Medieval Africa 1250‚Äì1800. Cambridge: Cambridge University Press. p. 738 Portuguese traders heard about the remains of the ancient city in the early 16th century, and records survive of interviews and notes made by some of them, linking Great Zimbabwe to gold production and long-distance trade. Two of those accounts mention an inscription above the entrance to Great Zimbabwe, written in characters not known to the Arab merchants who had seen it. In 1506, the explorer Diogo de Alc√°√ßova described the edifices in a letter to the then King of Portugal, writing that they were part of the larger kingdom of Ucalanga (presumably Karanga, a dialect of the Shona people spoken mainly in Masvingo and Midlands provinces of Zimbabwe). Jo√£o de Barros left another such description of Great Zimbabwe in 1538, as recounted to him by Moorish traders who had visited the area and possessed knowledge of the hinterland. He indicates that the edifices were locally known as Symbaoe, which meant \\"royal court\\" in the vernacular. As to the actual identity of the builders of Great Zimbabwe, de Barros writes: Additionally, with regard to the purpose of the Great Zimbabwe ruins, de Barros asserted that: \\"in the opinion of the Moors who saw it [Great Zimbabwe] it is very ancient and was built to keep possessions of the mines, which are very old, and no gold has been extracted from them for years, because of the wars... it would seem that some prince who has possession of these mines ordered it to be built as a sign thereof, which he afterwards lost in the course of time and through their being so remote from his kingdom...\\". De Barros further remarked that Symbaoe \\"is guarded by a nobleman, who has charge of it, after the manner of a chief alcaide, and they call this officer Symbacayo . . . and there are always some of Benomotapa's wives therein of whom Symbacayo takes care.\\" Thus, Great Zimbabwe appears to have still been inhabited as recently as the early 16th century. =Karl Mauch and the Queen of Sheba= The ruins were rediscovered during a hunting trip in 1867 by Adam Render, a German-American hunter, prospector and trader in southern Africa, who in 1871 showed the ruins to Karl Mauch, a German explorer and geographer of Africa. Karl Mauch recorded the ruins 3 September 1871, and immediately speculated about a possible Biblical association with King Solomon and the Queen of Sheba, an explanation which had been suggested by earlier writers such as the Portuguese Jo√£o dos Santos. Mauch went so far as to favour a legend that the structures were built to replicate the palace of the Queen of Sheba in Jerusalem, and claimed a wooden lintel at the site must be Lebanese cedar, brought by Phoenicians.Pikirayi (2001) p9 The Sheba legend, as promoted by Mauch, became so pervasive in the white settler community as to cause the later scholar James Theodore Bent to say, =Carl Peters and Theodore Bent= The Valley Complex Carl Peters collected a ceramic ushabti in 1905. Flinders Petrie examined it and identified a cartouche on its chest as belonging to the 18th Dynasty Egyptian Pharaoh Thutmose III and suggested that it was a statuette of the king and cited it as proof of commercial ties between rulers in the area and the ancient Egyptians during the New Kingdom (c. 1550 BC‚Äì1077 BC), if not a relic of an old Egyptian station near the local gold mines. Johann Heinrich Sch√§fer later appraised the statuette, and argued that it belonged to a well-known group of forgeries. After having received the ushabti, Felix von Luschan suggested that it was of more recent origin than the New Kingdom. He asserted that the figurine instead appeared to date to the subsequent Ptolemaic era (c. 323 BC‚Äì30 BC), when Alexandria-based Greek merchants would export Egyptian antiquities and pseudo-antiquities to southern Africa. J. Theodore Bent undertook a season at Zimbabwe with Cecil Rhodes's patronage and funding from the Royal Geographical Society and the British Association for the Advancement of Science. This, and other excavations undertaken for Rhodes, resulted in a book publication that introduced the ruins to English readers. Bent had no formal archaeological training, but had travelled very widely in Arabia, Greece and Asia Minor. He was aided by the expert cartographer and surveyor Robert M.W. Swan (1858-1904), who also visited and surveyed a host of related stone ruins nearby. Bent stated in the first edition of his book The Ruined Cities of Mashonaland (1892) that the ruins revealed either the Phoenicians or the Arabs as builders, and he favoured the possibility of great antiquity for the fortress. By the third edition of his book (1902) he was more specific, with his primary theory being \\"a Semitic race and of Arabian origin\\" of \\"strongly commercial\\" traders living within a client African city. Other theories on the origin of the ruins, among both white settlers and academics, took a common view that the original buildings were probably not made by local Bantu peoples. Bent indulged these theories alongside his Arab theory, to the point where his more tenuous theories had become somewhat discredited by the 1910s. Exterior wall of the Great Enclosure. Picture taken by David Randall-MacIver in 1906. =The Lemba= The construction of Great Zimbabwe is also claimed by the Lemba. Members of this ethnic group speak the Bantu languages spoken by their geographic neighbours and resemble them physically, but they have some religious practices and beliefs similar to those in Judaism and Islam, which they claim were transmitted by oral tradition. They have a tradition of ancient Jewish or South Arabian descent through their male line. Genetic Y-DNA analyses in the 2000s have established a partially Middle-Eastern origin for a portion of the male Lemba population. More recent research argues that DNA studies do not support claims for a specifically Jewish genetic heritage. The Lemba claim was also reported by a William Bolts (in 1777, to the Austrian Habsburg authorities), and by an A.A. Anderson (writing about his travels north of the Limpopo River in the 19th century). Both explorers were told that the stone edifices and the gold mines were constructed by a people known as the BaLemba. However, archaeological evidence and recent scholarship support the construction of Great Zimbabwe (and the origin of its culture) by the Shona and Venda peoples.Ndoro, W., and Pwiti, G. (1997). Marketing the past: The Shona village at Great Zimbabwe. Conservation and Management of Archaeological Sites 2(3): 3‚Äì8.Beach, D. N. (1994). A Zimbabwean past: Shona dynastic histories and oral traditions. =David Randall-MacIver and medieval origin= The first scientific archaeological excavations at the site were undertaken by David Randall-MacIver for the British Association in 1905‚Äì1906. In Medieval Rhodesia, he wrote of the existence in the site of objects that were of Bantu origin. More importantly he suggested a wholly medieval date for the walled fortifications and temple. This claim was not immediately accepted, partly due to the relatively short and undermanned period of excavation he was able to undertake. =Gertrude Caton-Thompson= The Hill Complex In mid 1929 Gertrude Caton-Thompson concluded, after a twelve-day visit of a three-person team and the digging of several trenches, that the site was indeed created by Bantu. She had first sunk three test pits into what had been refuse heaps on the upper terraces of the hill complex, producing a mix of unremarkable pottery and ironwork. She then moved to the Conical Tower, and tried to dig under the tower, arguing that the ground there would be undisturbed, but nothing was revealed. Some further test trenches were then put down outside the lower Great Enclosure and in the Valley Ruins, which unearthed domestic ironwork, glass beads, and a gold bracelet. Caton-Thompson immediately announced her Bantu origin theory to a meeting of the British Association in Johannesburg. Caton-Thompson's claim was not immediately favoured, although it had strong support among some scientific archaeologists due to her modern methods. Her most important contribution was in helping to confirm the theory of a medieval origin for the masonry work of circa the 14th-15th century. By 1931, she had modified her Bantu theory somewhat, allowing for a possible Arabian influence for the towers through the imitation of buildings or art seen at the coastal Arabian trading cities. =Post-1945 research= Since the 1950s, there has been consensus among archaeologists as to the African origins of Great Zimbabwe. Artefacts and radiocarbon dating indicate settlement in at least the fifth century, with continuous settlement of Great Zimbabwe between the twelfth and fifteenth centuriesGarlake (2002) 146 and the bulk of the finds from the fifteenth century. The radiocarbon evidence is a suite of 28 measurements, for which all but the first four, from the early days of the use of that method and now viewed as inaccurate, support the twelfth to fifteenth centuries chronology. In the 1970s, a beam that produced some of the anomalous dates in 1952 was reanalysed and gave a fourteenth- century date.Garlake (1982) 34 Dated finds such as Chinese, Persian and Syrian artefacts also support the twelfth and fifteenth century dates.Garlake (1982) 10 =Gokomere= Archaeologists generally agree that the builders probably spoke one of the Shona languages, based upon evidence of pottery,Summers (1970) p195 oral traditionsSummers (1970) p164 and anthropology and were probably descended from the Gokomere culture. The Gokomere culture, an eastern Bantu subgroup, existed in the area from around 200 AD and flourished from 500 AD to about 800 AD. Archaeological evidence indicates that it constitutes an early phase of the Great Zimbabwe culture.Summers (1970) p35 The Gokomere culture likely gave rise to both the modern Mashona people, an ethnic cluster comprising distinct sub-ethnic groups such as the local Karanga clan and the Rozwi culture, which originated as several Shona states.Isichei, Elizabeth Allo, A History of African Societies to 1870 Cambridge University Press, 1997, page 435 Gokomere peoples were probably also related to certain nearby early Bantu groups like the Mapungubwe civilisation of neighbouring North eastern South Africa, which is believed to have been an early Venda-speaking culture, and to the nearby Sotho. =Recent research= Passageway in the Great Enclosure More recent archaeological work has been carried out by Peter Garlake, who has produced the comprehensive descriptions of the site,Garlake (2002)Garlake (1973)Garlake (1982) David BeachBeach, David N. (1990) \\"Publishing the Past: Progress in the ‚ÄòDocuments from the Portuguese‚Äô Series\\". Zambezia, Vol. 17, No. 2, 1990, pp. 175‚Äì183.Beach, David N.

Continuity and change: an archaeological study of farming communities in northern Zimbabwe AD 500‚Äì1700. Studies in African Archaeology, No.13, Department of Archaeology, Uppsala University, Uppsala:. Today, the most recent consensus appears to attribute the construction of Great Zimbabwe to the Shona people.Ndoro, W., and Pwiti, G. (1997). Marketing the past: The Shona village at Great Zimbabwe. Conservation and Management of Archaeological Sites 2(3): 3‚Äì8.Beach, D. N. (1994). A Zimbabwean past: Shona dynastic histories and oral traditions. Some evidence also suggests an early influence from the probably Venda-speaking peoples of the Mapungubwe civilization. =Damage to the ruins= Damage to the ruins has taken place throughout the last century. The removal of gold and artefacts in amateurist diggings by early colonial antiquarians caused widespread damage, notably diggings by Richard Nicklin Hall. More extensive damage was caused by the mining of some of the ruins for gold. Reconstruction attempts since 1980 caused further damage, leading to alienation of the local communities from the site. Political implications A closeup of Great Zimbabwe ruins, 2006 Martin Hall writes that the history of Iron Age research south of the Zambezi shows the prevalent influence of colonial ideologies, both in the earliest speculations about the nature of the African past and in the adaptations that have been made to contemporary archaeological methodologies. Preben Kaarsholm writes that both colonial and black nationalist groups invoked Great Zimbabwe's past to support their vision of the country's present, through the media of popular history and of fiction. Examples of such popular history include Alexander Wilmot's Monomotapa (Rhodesia) and Ken Mufuka's Dzimbahwe: Life and Politics in the Golden Age; examples from fiction include Wilbur Smith's The Sunbird and Stanlake Samkange's Year of the Uprising. When white colonialists like Cecil Rhodes first saw the ruins, they saw them as a sign of the great riches that the area would yield to its new masters. Pikirayi and Kaarsholm suggest that this presentation of Great Zimbabwe was partly intended to encourage settlement and investment in the area.Pikirayi (2001) p11 Gertrude Caton-Thompson recognised that the builders were indigenous Africans, but she characterised the site as the \\"product of an infantile mind\\" built by a subjugated society.Garlake (2002) 23Ucko (1995) 37 The official line in Rhodesia during the 1960s and 1970s was that the structures were built by non- blacks. Archaeologists who disputed the official statement were censored by the government.Garlake (2002) 24 According to Paul Sinclair, interviewed for None But Ourselves: This suppression of archaeology culminated in the departure from the country of prominent archaeologists of Great Zimbabwe, including Peter Garlake, Senior Inspector of Monuments for Rhodesia, and Roger Summers of the National Museum. The Zimbabwe Bird, depicted on Zimbabwe's flag To black nationalist groups, Great Zimbabwe became an important symbol of achievement by Africans: reclaiming its history was a major aim for those seeking majority rule. In 1980 the new internationally recognised independent country was renamed for the site, and its famous soapstone bird carvings were retained from the Rhodesian flag and Coat of Arms as a national symbol and depicted in the new Zimbabwean flag. After the creation of the modern state of Zimbabwe in 1980, Great Zimbabwe has been employed to mirror and legitimise shifting policies of the ruling regime. At first it was argued that it represented a form of pre-colonial \\"African socialism\\" and later the focus shifted to stressing the natural evolution of an accumulation of wealth and power within a ruling elite.Garlake (2002) 23‚Äì25 An example of the former is Ken Mufuka's booklet, although the work has been heavily criticised. A tower of the Great Zimbabwe is also depicted on the coat of arms of Zimbabwe. Some of the carvings had been taken from Great Zimbabwe around 1890 and sold to Cecil Rhodes, who was intrigued and had copies made which he gave to friends. Most of the carvings have now been returned to Zimbabwe, but one remains at Rhodes' old home, Groote Schuur, in Cape Town. The Great Zimbabwe University In the early 21st century, the government of Zimbabwe endorsed the creation of a university in the vicinity of the ruins. This university is an arts and culture based university which draws from the rich history of the monuments. It was created to preserve the rich history of this country which was facing a dark future due to globalisation. The university main site is near the monuments with other campuses in the City centre and Mashava. The campuses include Herbet Chitepo Law School, Robert Mugabe School of Education, Gary Magadzire School of Agriculture and Natural Science, Simon Muzenda School of Arts, and Munhumutapa School of Commerce.

In the first five books of the Foundation series, Hari Seldon made only one in- the-flesh appearance, in the first part of the first book (Foundation), although he did appear at other times in pre-recorded messages to reveal a \\"Seldon Crisis\\". After writing five books in chronological order, Asimov retroactively added two books to expand on the genesis of psychohistory. The two prequels‚ÄîPrelude to Foundation and Forward the Foundation‚Äîdescribe Seldon's life in considerable detail. He is also the central character of the Second Foundation Trilogy written after Asimov's death (Foundation's Fear by Gregory Benford, Foundation and Chaos by Greg Bear, and Foundation's Triumph by David Brin), which are set after Asimov's two prequels.  Fictional biography  Galactic Empire First Minister and psychohistorian Hari Seldon was born in the 10th month of the 11,988th year of the Galactic Era (GE) (-79 Foundation Era (FE)) and died 12,069 GE (1 FE).According to the Encyclopedia Galactica (Asimov's fictitious encyclopedia often cited in his future history novels), \\"It is thought that Seldon's birthdate, which some consider doubtful, may have been adjusted to match that of Cleon's\\" the last Galactic Emperor of the Entun Dynasty (Prelude to Foundation, p. 3).In Asimov's saga, the Galactic Era begins when the Galactic Empire is founded at an unknown date roughly 11,000 years in the future: The timeline can be deduced from some hints Asimov dropped in his other science fiction works, including the Robot and Empire series. He was born on the planet Helicon in the Arcturus sector where his father worked as a tobacco grower in a hydroponics plant. He shows incredible mathematical abilities at a very early age. He also learns martial arts on Helicon that later help him on Trantor, the principal art being Heliconian Twisting (a form seemingly equal parts Jiu Jitsu, Krav Maga, and Submission Wrestling). Helicon is said to be \\"less notable for its mathematics, and more for its martial arts\\" (Prelude to Foundation). Seldon is awarded a Ph.D. in mathematics for his work on turbulence at the University of Helicon. There he becomes an assistant professor specializing in the mathematical analysis of social structures. Seldon is the subject of a biography by Gaal Dornick. Seldon is Emperor Cleon I's second and last First Minister, the first being Eto Demerzel/R. Daneel Olivaw. He is deposed as First Minister after Cleon I's assassination.  Foundation  Using psychohistory, Seldon mathematically determines what he calls The Seldon Plan‚Äîa plan to determine the right time and place to set up a new society, one that would replace the collapsing Galactic Empire by sheer force of social pressure, but over only a thousand- year time span, rather than the ten-to-thirty-thousand-year time span that would normally have been required, and thus reduce the human suffering from living in a time of barbarism. The Foundation is placed on Terminus, a resource-poor planet entirely populated by scientists and their families. The planet‚Äîor so Seldon claimed‚Äîwas originally occupied to create the Encyclopedia Galactica, a vast compilation of the knowledge of a dying galactic empire. In reality, Terminus had a much larger role in his Plan, which he had to conceal from its inhabitants at first.  Prelude to Foundation  Seldon visits Trantor to attend the Decennial Mathematics Convention. He presents a paper which indicates that one could theoretically predict the Galactic Empire's future. He is able to show that Galactic society can be represented in a simulation simpler than itself (in a finite number of iterations before the onset of chaotic noise smears discerning sets of events). He does so using a technique invented that past century. At first, Seldon has no idea how this could be done in practice, and he is fairly confident that no one could actually fulfill the possibility. Shortly after his presentation, he becomes a lightning rod for political forces who want to use psychohistory for their own purposes. The rest of the novel tells of his flight, which lasts for approximately a year and which takes him through the complex and variegated world of Trantor. During his flight to escape the various political factions, he discovers how psychohistory can be made a practical science. It is in this novel that he meets his future wife Dors Venabili, future adopted son Raych Seldon, and future partner Yugo Amaryl.  Forward the Foundation  This novel is told as a sequence of short stories, as was the case with the original trilogy. They take place at intervals a decade or more apart, and tell the story of Hari's life, starting about ten years after Prelude and ending with his death. The stories contrast his increasingly successful professional life with his increasingly unsuccessful personal life. Seldon becomes involved in politics when Eto Demerzel becomes a target for a smear campaign conducted by Laskin Joranum. He eventually takes Demerzel's place as First Minister, despite his reluctance to divide his attention between government and the development of Psychohistory. His career comes to an end when Cleon I is assassinated by his gardener (a random event Seldon could not have predicted) and the seizure of power by a military junta. Seldon eventually causes the fall of the junta by dropping subtle false hints about what Psychohistory foresees, leading to the Junta making unpopular decisions. However, an agent of the Junta inside Seldon's team, having deduced that Dors is a robot, builds a device that ultimately kills her, leaving Seldon heartbroken. Years later, Seldon discovers that his granddaughter Wanda has telepathic abilities and begins searching for others like her but fails. Raych eventually decides to move his family to the planet Santanni, but Wanda chooses to remain with her elderly grandfather. However, just after they arrive a rebellion breaks out on the planet and Raych is killed in the fighting. His wife and child are lost when their ship disappears. Seldon eventually finds Stettin Palver, another telepath who becomes Wanda's husband and the pair are eventually instrumental in creating the Second Foundation. Seldon mentions two indigenous species of Helicon: the lamec and the greti. The first is a hardworking animal, while the latter is dangerous as indicated by the native Helicon saying \\"If you ride a greti, you find you can't get off; for then it will eat you.\\" The saying is similar to the age-old Chinese proverb \\"He who rides the tiger finds it difficult to dismount\\", and the words lamec and greti are anagrams of camel and tiger, respectively. In his old age, he gains the nickname Raven for his dire predictions of the future. Contemporary influence Historian Ian Morris has discussed the applicability and inspiration of Hari Seldon to statistics and prediction. Hari Seldon's name is cited in an article in The Economist discussing the use of statistics in epidemiology, the process through which societies change collective political thinking, and \\"a general computer model of society.\\" Seldon is also quite often named in research as a metaphorical literary reference point. There is speculation in Forbes that Seldon's psychohistory is being manifested in today's emergence of Big Data. In fact, the fictional character of Seldon has even been labeled as a \\"paradigmatic figure\\" in Big Data research. In 2019, the term Seldonian algorithm was chosen to honor the character in new artificial intelligence techniques intended to avoid undesirable behaviors in decision-making systems. People who credit to Hari Seldon for the career choices that they made include economist and New York Times columnist Paul Krugman and US politician Newt Gingrich. French politician Jean-Luc M√©lenchon also cites Seldon as one of his metapolitical sources of inspiration.

Today, he is mainly remembered as the author of the novel Auch Einer, in which he developed the concept of (the spite of objects), a comic theory that inanimate objects conspire against humans. Biography Born at Ludwigsburg as the son of a clergyman, Vischer was educated at T√ºbinger Stift, and began life in his father's profession. He became in aesthetics and German literature at his old university in 1835, was advanced to extraordinary professor two years later, and was appointed to full professor in 1844. Due to his outspoken inaugural address he was suspended for two years by the W√ºrttemberg government. In this enforced leisure he wrote the first two volumes of his Aesthetik, oder Wissenschaft des Sch√∂nen (1846), the fourth and last volume of which did not appear till 1857. Vischer threw himself heartily into the great German political movement of 1848-49, and shared the disappointment of patriotic democrats at its failure. In 1855 he became professor at Z√ºrich. In 1866, his fame being now established, he was invited back to Germany with a professorship at T√ºbingen combined with a post at the Polytechnikum of Stuttgart. He died at Gmunden on 14 September 1887.  Critical legacy  Vischer was not an original thinker, and his monumental , in spite of industry and learning, has not the higher qualities of success. He attempts the hopeless task of explaining art by the Hegelian dialectic. Starting with the definition of beauty as \\"the idea in the form of limited appearance,\\" he goes on to develop the various elements of art (the beautiful, sublime and comic), and the various forms of art (plastic art, music and poetry) by means of the Hegelian antitheses‚Äîform and content, objective and subjective, inner conflict and reconciliation. The shape of the work also is Hegelian, consisting of short highly technical paragraphs containing the main argument, followed by detailed explanations printed in different type. Still, Vischer had a thorough knowledge of every branch of art, except music. Much valuable material is buried in his volumes. In later life Vischer moved considerably away from Hegelianism, and adopted the conceptions of sensuous completeness and cosmic harmony as criteria of beauty; but he never found time to rewrite his great book. According to Chisholm, 'His own work as a literary artist is of high quality; vigorous, imaginative and thoughtful without academic technicality.' He would not abstain from grossly unfair remarks, e. g. in vol. 2 of Auch Einer: \\"In der l√§cherlichsten aller Kultursprachen hat Shakespeare geschrieben\\" about English (Shakespeare wrote in the most ridiculous of all civilized languages), or \\"√úbrigens war der Taugenichts Beyle ein Narr\\" on Stendhal (Besides, the good-for-nothing Beyle was a fool).

Biography He was born at Breslau, the son of a Prussian artillery officer. He was educated at the gymnasia in Mainz and Coburg, and subsequently at Rastenburg in East Prussia. In 1841 he entered the University of K√∂nigsberg as a law student, but was expelled for his outspoken liberal opinions. The academic authorities at Breslau and Leipzig were equally intolerant towards him, and it was only in Berlin that he found himself free to pursue his studies. During this period he issued Lieder der Gegenwart (‚ÄúSongs of the present,‚Äù 1842) and Zensurfl√ºchtlinge (‚ÄúRefugees from censoring,‚Äù 1843) - the poetical fruits of his political enthusiasm. He completed his studies in Berlin, and took the degree of doctor juris in K√∂nigsberg. His political views continued to stand in the way of his career, and Gottschall gave up the law to devote himself entirely to literature. He met with immediate success, and beginning as a dramaturge in K√∂nigsberg with Der Blinde von Alcala (1846) and Lord Byron in Italien (1847), he went on to Hamburg where he occupied a similar position. His political and social sympathies with the revolutionary movement of 1848 were shown in the dramas Wiener Immortellen (1848), Lambertine von M√©ricourt (1850), and Ferdinand von Schill (1851), as well as in his first collection of poems, Gedichte (1850), and in a lyric epic, Die G√∂ttin, ein hohes Lied vom Weibe (1853). In 1852 he married Marie, baroness von Seherr-Thoss, and for the next few years lived in Silesia. From this time on, his work became more serene in temper and style. An epic, Carlo Zeno, was followed by a very successful historical comedy (after the style of Scribe), Pitt und Fox (1854), and this by literary and historical studies, whose final titles were: Die deutsche National Litteratur des XIX. Jahrhunderts (1892) and Poetik: Die Dichtkunst und ihre Formen (1858). In 1862 he took over the editorship of a newspaper, but in 1864 moved to Leipzig. Gottschall was raised, in 1877, by the king of Prussia to the hereditary nobility with the prefix \\"von,\\" having been previously made a Geheimer Hofrat by the Grand Duke of Weimar. Down to 1887 Gottschall edited the Brockhaussche Bl√§tter f√ºr litterarische Unterhaltung and the monthly periodical Unsere Zeit. He died at Leipzig. Gottschall was also a noted chess player. The Deutschen Schachbund (DSB) was founded in Leipzig on 18 July 1877 by athletes and intellectuals such as Adolf Anderssen, Rudolf Gottschall, Hermann Zwanziger, Max Lange and Carl G√∂ring. When the next meeting took place on 15 July 1879 in Leipzig (the 1st DSB Congress), sixty-two clubs had become member of the German Chess Federation (DSB). Hofrat von Gottschall became Chairman and Zwanziger the General Secretary. Works Gottschall's prolific literary productions cover the fields of poetry, novel-writing and literary criticism. Among his volumes of lyric poetry are Sebastopol (1856), Janus (1873), Bunte Bl√ºten (1891). Among his epics, Carlo Zeno (1854), Maja (1864), dealing with an episode in the Indian Mutiny, and Merlins Wanderungen (1887). Pitt und Fox (1854) was never surpassed by his other lighter dramas, among which may be mentioned Die Welt des Schwindels and Der Spion von Rheinsberg. The tragedies, Mazeppa, Catharine Howard, Amy Robsart and Der Gotze von Venedig, were very successful; and the historical novels, Im Banne des schwarzen Adlers (1875; 4th ed., 1884), Die Erbschaft des Blutes (1881), Die Tochter R√ºbezahls (1889), and Verk√ºmmerte Existenzen (1892), enjoyed a high degree of popularity. His Die deutsche Nationalliteratur des 18. Jahrhunderts (1855), and Poetik (1858) commanded the respect of all students of literature. Of his many novels, the first, Im Baune des schwarzen Adlers (1876), is considered by many critics his best. Gottschall was active as an editor and compiler of anthologies. Gottschall's collected Dramatische Werke appeared in 12 vols. in 1880 (2nd ed., 1884); he also later published many volumes of collected essays and criticisms.

Ernst Wilhelm Theodor Herrmann Hengstenberg (20 October 1802, in Fr√∂ndenberg28 May 1869, in Berlin), was a German Lutheran churchman and neo-Lutheran theologian from an old and important Dortmund family. He was born at Fr√∂ndenberg, a Westphalian town, and was educated by his father Johann Heinrich Karl Hengstenberg, who was a famous minister of the Reformed Church and head of the Fr√∂ndenberg convent of canonesses (Fr√§uleinstift). His mother was Wilhelmine then Bergh. Entering the University of Bonn in 1819, Hengstenberg attended the lectures of Georg Wilhelm Freytag for Oriental languages and of Johann Karl Ludwig Gieseler for church history, but his energies were principally devoted to philosophy and philology, and his earliest publication was an edition of the Arabic Mu'allaqat of Imru' al-Qais, which gained for him a prize at his graduation in the philosophical faculty. This was followed in 1824 by a German translation of Aristotle's Metaphysics. Finding himself without the means to complete his theological studies under Johann August Wilhelm Neander and Friedrich August Tholuck in Berlin, he accepted a post at Basel as tutor in Oriental languages to Johann Jakob St√§helin (1797‚Äì1875), later a professor at the university. It was that he began to direct his attention to a study of the Bible, which led him to a conviction, not only of the divine character of evangelical religion, but also of the unapproachable adequacy of its expression in the Augsburg Confession. In 1824 he joined the philosophical faculty of the University of Berlin as a privatdozent, and in 1825 he became a licentiate in theology, his theses being remarkable for their evangelical fervour and for their emphatic protest against every form of \\"rationalism\\", especially in questions of Old Testament criticism. In 1826 he became professor extraordinarius in theology; and in July 1827 took on the editorship of the Evangelische Kirchenzeitung, a strictly orthodox journal, which in his hands acquired an almost unique reputation as a controversial organ. It did not become well known until in 1830 an anonymous article (by Ernst Ludwig von Gerlach) appeared, which openly charged Wilhelm Gesenius and Julius Wegscheider with infidelity and profanity, and on the ground of these accusations advocated the interposition of the civil power, thus giving rise to the prolonged Hallische Streit.

Barth is thought to be one of the greatest of the European explorers of Africa, as his scholarly preparation, ability to speak and write Arabic, learning African languages, and character meant that he carefully documented the details of the cultures he visited. He was among the first to comprehend the uses of oral history of peoples, and collected many. He established friendships with African rulers and scholars during his five years of travel (1850‚Äì1855). After the deaths of two European companions, he completed his travels with the aid of Africans. Afterwards, he wrote and published a five-volume account of his travels in both English and German. It has been invaluable for scholars of his time and since. Early life and education Heinrich Barth was born in Hamburg on 16 February 1821. He was the third child of Johann Christoph Heinrich Barth and his wife Charlotte Karoline n√©e Zadow. Johann had come from a relatively poor background but had built up a successful trading business. Both parents were orthodox Lutherans and they expected their children to conform to their strict ideas on morality and self- discipline. From the age of eleven Barth attended the prestigious high school, the Gelehrtenschule des Johanneums, in Hamburg. He was very studious but not popular with his classmates. He excelled at languages and taught himself some Arabic. Barth left school aged 18 in 1839 and immediately enrolled at the University of Berlin where he attended courses given by the geographer Karl Ritter, the classical scholar August B√∂ckh and the historian Jakob Grimm. After his first year he interrupted his studies and went on a tour of Italy visiting Venice, Florence, Rome, Naples and Sicily, returning to Germany in the middle of May 1841. In the vacation of the following year he visited the Rhineland and Switzerland. He defended his doctoral thesis on the trade relations of ancient Corinth in July 1844. Visit to North Africa and the Near East Barth formed a plan to undertake a grand tour of north Africa and the Middle East which his father agreed to fund. He left his parents' home at the end of January 1845 and first visited London where he spent two months learning Arabic, visiting the British Museum and securing the protection of the British consuls for his trip. While in London he met the Prussian ambassador to Britain, Christian von Bunsen, who would later play an important role in his trip to central Africa. He left London and travelled across France and Spain. On 7 August he caught a ferry from Gibraltar to Tangiers for his first visit to Africa. From Tangier, he made his way overland across North Africa. He also travelled through Egypt, ascending the Nile to Wadi Halfa and crossing the desert to the port of Berenice on the Red Sea. While in Egypt, he was attacked and wounded by robbers. Crossing the Sinai peninsula, he traversed Palestine, Syria, Asia Minor, Turkey and Greece, everywhere examining the remains of antiquity. He returned to his parents' home in Hamburg on 27 December 1847 after a trip of almost three years. For a time he was engaged there as Privatdozent. He described some of his travels in the first volume of his book, Wanderungen durch die K√ºstenl√§nder des Mittelmeeres, (Walks through the coastal states of the Mediterranean) which was published in 1849. The intended second volume never appeared. Expedition to the Sudan, the Sahara and Western Africa Route of Barth's journey through Africa between 1850 and 1855 Heinrich Barth approaching Timbuktu on September 7th 1853 as depicted by Martin Bernatz. Memorial tablet at the Barth-House in Agadez Christian Bunsen, the Prussian ambassador to Westminster, encouraged the appointment of scholars, including Barth and Adolf Overweg, a Prussian astronomer, to the expedition of James Richardson, an explorer of the Sahara. He had been selected by the British government to open up commercial relations with the states of the central and western Sudan. The party left Marseilles in late 1849, and departed from Tripoli early in 1850. They crossed the Sahara Desert with great difficulty. He arrived in the city of Agadez in October 1850 where he stayed for several days. Today a memorial tablet honours him as the first European to have ever entered the city. The deaths of Richardson (March 1851) and Overweg (September 1852), who died of unknown diseases, left Barth to carry on the scientific mission alone. Barth was the first European to visit Adamawa in 1851. When he returned to Tripoli in September 1855, his journey had extended over 24¬∞ of latitude and 20¬∞ of longitude, from Tripoli in the north to Adamawa and Cameroon in the south, and from Lake Chad and Bagirmi in the east to Timbuktu (September 1853) in the west ‚Äî upward of . He studied minutely the topography, history, civilizations, languages, and resources of the countries he visited. His success as an explorer and historian of Africa was based both on his patient character and his scholarly education. Barth was interested in the history and culture of the African peoples, rather than the possibilities of commercial exploitation. Due to his level of documentation, his journal has become an invaluable source for the study of 19th-century Sudanic Africa. Although Barth was not the first European visitor who paid attention to the local oral traditions, he was the first who seriously considered its methodology and use for historical research. Barth was the first true scholar to travel and study in West Africa. Earlier explorers such as Ren√© Cailli√©, Dixon Denham and Hugh Clapperton had no academic knowledge. Barth was fluent in Arabic and several African languages (Fulani, Hausa and Kanuri) and was able to investigate the history of some regions, particularly the Songhay Empire. He established close relations with a number of African scholars and rulers, from Umar I ibn Muhammad al-Amin in Bornu, through the Katsina and Sokoto regions to Timbuktu. There his friendship with Ahmad al-Bakkai al-Kunti led to his staying in his house; he also received protection from al-Kunti against an attempt to seize him. Heinrich Barth's house in Timbuktu (in 1908 before its collapse) After his return to London Barth wrote and published accounts of his travels simultaneously in English and German, under the title Reisen und Entdeckungen in Nord- und Centralafrika (Travels and Discoveries in North and Central Africa; 1857‚Äì1858, 5 volumes., approx. 3,500 pages). The volumes included coloured plates of pictures produced by Martin Bernatz based on Barth's original sketches. The work was considered one of the finest of its kind, being cited by Darwin. It is still used by historians of Africa, and remains an important scientific work on African cultures of the age. It also provided the first evidence by a European that the Sahara had once been a savanna.Barth 1857, vol. 1, chapter IX, pp. 196‚Äì199. On p. 199, Barth said, about a petroglyph depicting ancient hunters in the Sahara, that it \\" ‚Ä¶ bears testimony to a state of life very different from that which we are accustomed to see now in these regions, ‚Ä¶ \\" de Menocal, Peter B. ; Tierney, Jessica E. (2012) \\"Green Sahara: African humid periods paced by Earth's orbital changes\\", Nature Education Knowledge 3(10): 12. Available at: Nature Education: Knowledge Project Later life Honorary grave of Heinrich Barth in Berlin Barth returned from Great Britain to Germany, where he prepared a collection of Central African vocabularies (Gotha, 1862‚Äì1866). In 1858 he undertook another journey in Asia Minor, and in 1862 visited the Turkish provinces in Europe. He wrote an account of these travels that was published in Berlin in 1864. In the following year he was granted a professorship of geography (without chair or regular pay) at Berlin University and appointed president of the Geographical Society. His admission to the Prussian Academy of Sciences was denied, as it was claimed that he had achieved nothing for historiography and linguistics. They did not fully understand his achievements, which have been ratified by scholars over time. Barth died in Berlin on 25 November 1865 aged 44. His grave is preserved in the Protestant Friedhof III der Jerusalems- und Neuen Kirchengemeinde (Cemetery No. III of the congregations of Jerusalem's Church and New Church) in Berlin-Kreuzberg, south of Hallesches Tor.

Biography He was born at Petershagen, near Minden, where his father, Georg Christof Friedrich, was preacher. In his tenth year he entered the orphanage at Halle, from which he duly passed to the university, his studies being interrupted in October 1813 by a period of military service, during which he was enrolled as a volunteer in a regiment of chasseurs. On the conclusion of peace (1815) he returned to Halle, and, having in 1817 taken his degree in philosophy, he became assistant head (Conrector) of the Minden gymnasium, and in 1818 was appointed director of the gymnasium at Cleves. Here he published his earliest work (Historisch-kritischer Versuch √ºber die Entstehung u. die fr√ºhesten Schicksale der schriftlichen Evangelien), a treatise which had considerable influence on subsequent investigations as to the origin of the gospels. In 1819 Gieseler was appointed a professor ordinarius in theology in the newly founded University of Bonn, where, besides lecturing on church history, he made important contributions to the literature of that subject in Ernst Friedrich Karl Rosenm√ºller's Repertorium, KF St√§udlin and HG Tschirner's Archiv, and in various university \\"programs.\\" The first part of the first volume of his well-known Church History appeared in 1824. In 1831 he accepted a call to G√∂ttingen as successor to GJ Planck. He lectured on church history, the history of dogma, and dogmatic theology. In 1837 he was appointed a Consistorialrath, and shortly afterwards was created a knight of the Royal Guelphic Order. The fifth volume of the Kirchengeschichte, embracing the period subsequent to 1814, and Dogmengeschichte, sometimes regarded as a sixth volume of the Church History, were published posthumously in 1855 by ER Redepenning (1810‚Äì1883), followed finally by the fourth in 1857. Less vivid and picturesque in style than Karl Hase, lacking August Neander's deep and sympathetic insight into the more spiritual forces by which church life is pervaded, he excels these and all other contemporaries in the fulness and accuracy of his information. His Lehrbuch der Kirchengeschichte, with its copious references to original authorities, is of great value to the student: \\"Gieseler wished that each age should speak for itself, since only by this means can the peculiarity of its ideas be fully appreciated.\\" (Otto Pfleiderer, Development of Theology, p. 284).

Thomas served in the Mexican‚ÄìAmerican War and later chose to remain with the U.S. Army for the Civil War as a Southern Unionist, despite his heritage as a Virginian (whose home state would join the Confederate States of America). He won one of the first Union victories in the war, at Mill Springs in Kentucky, and served in important subordinate commands at Perryville and Stones River. His stout defense at the Battle of Chickamauga in 1863 saved the Union Army from being completely routed, earning him his most famous nickname, \\"the Rock of Chickamauga.\\" He followed soon after with a dramatic breakthrough on Missionary Ridge in the Battle of Chattanooga. In the Franklin‚ÄìNashville Campaign of 1864, he achieved one of the most decisive victories of the war, destroying the army of Confederate General John Bell Hood, his former student at West Point, at the Battle of Nashville. Thomas had a successful record in the Civil War, but he failed to achieve the historical acclaim of some of his contemporaries, such as Ulysses S. Grant and William T. Sherman. He developed a reputation as a slow, deliberate general who shunned self-promotion and who turned down advancements in position when he did not think they were justified. After the war, he did not write memoirs to advance his legacy. Early life and education Thomas was born at Newsom's Depot, Southampton County, Virginia, five miles (8 km) from the North Carolina border.Cleaves, p. 7. His father, John Thomas, of Welsh descent, and his mother, Elizabeth Rochelle Thomas, a descendant of French Huguenot immigrants, had six children. George had three sisters and two brothers. The family led an upper-class plantation lifestyle. By 1829, they owned and 24 slaves. John died in a farm accident when George was 13, leaving the family in financial difficulties.Einolf, pp. 14‚Äì15. George Thomas, his sisters, and his widowed mother were forced to flee from their home and hide in the nearby woods during Nat Turner's 1831 slave rebellion.Cleaves, pp. 6‚Äì7; Einolf, p. 20; O'Connor, p. 60. Benson Bobrick has suggested that while some repressive acts were enforced following the crushing of the revolt, Thomas took the lesson another way, seeing that slavery was so vile an institution that it had forced the slaves to act in violence. This was a major event in the formation of his views on slavery; that the idea of the contented slave in the care of a benevolent overlord was a sentimental myth.Bobrick, p. 14. Christopher Einolf, in contrast wrote \\"For George Thomas, the view that slavery was needed as a way of controlling blacks was supported by his personal experience of Nat Turner's Rebellion. ... Thomas left no written record of his opinion on slavery, but the fact that he owned slaves during much of his life indicates that he was not opposed to it.\\"Einolf, p. 19. Einolf's statement about owning slaves \\"during much of his life\\" is apparently derived from his family's ownership, his use of a family slave as a personal valet during \\"at least part of his military service\\", and the woman named Ellen whom his wife Francis bought in 1858 (p. 74). A traditional story is that Thomas taught as many as 15 of his family's slaves to read, violating a Virginia law that prohibited this,Cleaves, pp. 6‚Äì7; O'Connor, p. 60; Furgurson, p. 57, suggests that while this was illegal, it was not uncommon for slaves to be taught to read; biography of Thomas , by Kennedy Hickman. Einolf, p. 13, offers a contrary view: \\"It is unlikely, however, that Thomas taught his family's slaves how to read.... While Thomas did eventually come to support education and freedom for blacks, he did not do so until much later in life, when the events of the Civil War had changed his views on race.\\" He attributes (p. 12) the story to an interview conducted in 1890 by Oliver Otis Howard, who \\"wanted to explain Thomas's Unionism in terms of an antipathy toward slavery and so looked for early indications of sympathy toward African-Americans in Thomas's childhood.\\" and despite the wishes of his father.Copp√©e, p. 4. Thomas was appointed to the United States Military Academy at West Point, New York, in 1836 by Congressman John Y. Mason, who warned Thomas that no nominee from his district had ever graduated successfully. Entering at age 20, Thomas was known to his fellow cadets as \\"Old Tom\\" and he became instant friends with his roommates, William T. Sherman and Stewart Van Vliet. He made steady academic progress, was appointed a cadet officer in his second year, and graduated 12th in a class of 42 in 1840.Einolf, pp. 22‚Äì29. He was appointed a second lieutenant in Company D, 3rd U.S. Artillery.Eicher, p. 527; Einolf, p. 30. Antebellum military career Thomas's first assignment with his artillery regiment began in late 1840 at the primitive outpost of Fort Lauderdale, Florida, in the Seminole Wars, where his troops performed infantry duty. He led them in successful patrols and was appointed a brevet first lieutenant on November 6, 1841.Eicher, p. 527; Einolf, pp. 32‚Äì35. From 1842 until 1845, he served in posts at New Orleans, Fort Moultrie in Charleston Harbor, and Fort McHenry in Baltimore. With the Mexican‚ÄìAmerican War looming, his regiment was ordered to Texas in June 1845.Einolf, pp. 36‚Äì40. In Mexico, Thomas led a gun crew with distinction at the battles of Fort Brown, Resaca de la Palma, Monterrey, and Buena Vista, receiving three brevet promotions.Einolf, p. 55, and Cleaves, p. 43, refer to three brevet promotions. Eicher, p. 527, documents only two: brevet captain for Monterrey and brevet major for Buena Vista. Van Horne, p. 7, also lists only the two promotions. At Buena Vista, Gen. Zachary Taylor reported that \\"the services of the light artillery, always conspicuous, were more than unusually distinguished\\" during the battle. Brig. Gen. John E. Wool wrote about Thomas and another officer that \\"without our artillery we would not have maintained our position a single hour.\\" Thomas's battery commander wrote that Thomas's \\"coolness and firmness contributed not a little to the success of the day. Lieutenant Thomas more than sustained the reputation he has long enjoyed in his regiment as an accurate and scientific artillerist.\\"Einolf, p. 54. During the war, Thomas served closely with an artillery officer who would be a principal antagonist in the Civil War‚ÄîCaptain Braxton Bragg.Cleaves, pp. 24‚Äì42; Einolf, pp. 39‚Äì57. Thomas was reassigned to Florida in 1849‚Äì50. In 1851, he returned to West Point as a cavalry and artillery instructor, where he established a close professional and personal relationship with another Virginia officer, Lt. Col. Robert E. Lee, the Academy superintendent. His appointment there was based in part on a recommendation from Braxton Bragg. Concerned about the poor condition of the Academy's elderly horses, Thomas moderated the tendency of cadets to overwork them during cavalry drills and became known as \\"Slow Trot Thomas\\". Two of Thomas's students who received his recommendation for assignment to the cavalry, J.E.B. Stuart and Fitzhugh Lee, became prominent Confederate cavalry generals. Another Civil War connection was a cadet expelled for disciplinary reasons on Thomas's recommendation, John Schofield, who would excoriate Thomas in postbellum writings about his service as a corps commander under Thomas in the Franklin-Nashville Campaign. On November 17, 1852, Thomas married Frances Lucretia Kellogg, age 31, from Troy, New York. The couple remained at West Point until 1854. Thomas was promoted to captain on December 24, 1853.Cleaves, pp. 48‚Äì51; Einolf, pp. 60‚Äì66; Eicher, p. 527. Cleaves claims that Thomas was assigned to the Academy in 1853 on the recommendation of William S. Rosecrans. In the spring of 1854, Thomas's artillery regiment was transferred to California and he led two companies to San Francisco via the Isthmus of Panama, and then on a grueling overland march to Fort Yuma. On May 12, 1855, Thomas was appointed a major of the 2nd U.S. Cavalry (later re-designated the 5th U.S. Cavalry) by Jefferson Davis, then Secretary of War. Once again, Braxton Bragg had provided a recommendation for Thomas's advancement. There was a suspicion as the Civil War drew closer that Davis had been assembling and training a combat unit of elite U.S. Army officers who harbored Southern sympathies, and Thomas's appointment to this regiment implied that his colleagues assumed he would support his native state of Virginia in a future conflict.Einolf, pp. 72‚Äì73. Thomas resumed his close ties with the second-in- command of the regiment, Robert E. Lee, and the two officers traveled extensively together on detached service for court-martial duty. In October 1857, Major Thomas assumed acting command of the cavalry regiment, an assignment he would retain for 2¬Ω years. On August 26, 1860, during a clash with a Comanche warrior, Thomas was wounded by an arrow passing through the flesh near his chin area and sticking into his chest at Clear Fork, Brazos River, Texas. Thomas pulled the arrow out and, after a surgeon dressed the wound, continued to lead the expedition. This was the only combat wound that Thomas suffered throughout his long military career.Einolf, pp. 72‚Äì79; Cleaves, pp. 56‚Äì61. In November 1860, Thomas requested a one-year leave of absence. His antebellum career had been distinguished and productive, and he was one of the rare officers with field experience in all three combat arms‚Äîinfantry, cavalry, and artillery. On his way home to southern Virginia, he suffered a mishap in Lynchburg, Virginia, falling from a train platform and severely injuring his back. This accident led him to contemplate leaving military service and caused him pain for the rest of his life. Continuing to New York to visit with his wife's family, Thomas stopped in Washington, D.C., and conferred with general-in-chief Winfield Scott, advising Scott that Maj. Gen. David E. Twiggs, the commander of the Department of Texas, harbored secessionist sympathies and could not be trusted in his post.Einolf, pp. 78‚Äì81; Cleaves, pp. 62‚Äì63. American Civil War =Remaining with the Union= At the outbreak of the Civil War, 19 of the 36 officers in the 2nd U.S. Cavalry resigned, including three of Thomas's superiors‚ÄîAlbert Sidney Johnston, Robert E. Lee, and William J. Hardee.Einolf, pp. 93, 97. Many Southern-born officers were torn between loyalty to their states and loyalty to their country. Thomas struggled with the decision but opted to remain with the United States. His Northern-born wife probably helped influence his decision. In response, his family turned his picture against the wall, destroyed his letters, and never spoke to him again. (During the economic hard times in the South after the war, Thomas sent some money to his sisters, who angrily refused to accept it, declaring they had no brother.)Einolf, pp. 87‚Äì88. Nevertheless, Thomas stayed in the Union Army with some degree of suspicion surrounding him. On January 18, 1861, a few months before Fort Sumter, he had applied for a job as the commandant of cadets at the Virginia Military Institute.Einolf, p. 81. Any real tendency to the secessionist cause, however, could be refuted when he turned down Virginia Governor John Letcher's offer to become chief of ordnance for the Virginia Provisional Army.Einolf, p. 83; Cleaves, pp. 64‚Äì66. On June 18, his former student and fellow Virginian, Confederate Col. J.E.B. Stuart, wrote to his wife, \\"Old George H. Thomas is in command of the cavalry of the enemy. I would like to hang, hang him as a traitor to his native state.\\"Einolf, p. 99. Nevertheless, as the Civil War carried on, he won the affection of Union soldiers serving under him as a \\"soldier's soldier\\", who took to affectionately referring to Thomas as \\"Pap Thomas\\".Civil War letters by Sargeant Sherman Leland, 104th Illinois Infantry, Co.D., a unit which served under General Thomas during the Chattanooga Campaign. Mr. Leland noted this is the nickname fellow soldiers used to convey genuine respect and affection for the General. They also referred to General Sherman as \\"Uncle Billy\\" These letters are unpublished. =Kentucky= Thomas was promoted in rapid succession to be lieutenant colonel (on April 25, 1861, replacing Robert E. Lee) and colonel (May 3, replacing Albert Sidney Johnston) in the regular army, and brigadier general of volunteers (August 17).Einolf, pp. 97, 101; Eicher, p. 527. In the First Bull Run Campaign, he commanded a brigade under Maj. Gen. Robert Patterson in the Shenandoah Valley,Einolf, pp. 99‚Äì100. but all of his subsequent assignments were in the Western Theater. Reporting to Maj. Gen. Robert Anderson in Kentucky, Thomas was assigned to training recruits and to command an independent force in the eastern half of the state. On January 18, 1862, he defeated Confederate Brig. Gens. George B. Crittenden and Felix Zollicoffer at Mill Springs, gaining the first important Union victory in the war, breaking Confederate strength in eastern Kentucky, and lifting Union morale.Einolf, pp. 101‚Äì23; Cleaves, pp. 81‚Äì100. =Shiloh and Corinth= On December 2, 1861, Brig. Gen. Thomas was assigned to command the 1st Division of Maj. Gen. Don Carlos Buell's Army of the Ohio. He was present at the second day of the Battle of Shiloh (April 7, 1862), but arrived after the fighting had ceased. The victor at Shiloh, Maj. Gen. Ulysses S. Grant, came under severe criticism for the bloody battle and his superior, Maj. Gen. Henry W. Halleck, reorganized his Department of the Mississippi to ease Grant out of direct field command. The three armies in the department were divided and recombined into three \\"wings\\". Thomas, promoted to major general effective April 25, 1862, was given command of the Right Wing, consisting of four divisions from Grant's former Army of the Tennessee and one from the Army of the Ohio. Thomas successfully led this putative army in the siege of Corinth. On June 10, Grant returned to command of the original Army of the Tennessee. =Perryville, Stones River, Chickamauga, and Chattanooga= Defense of Horseshoe Ridge and Union retreat at the Battle of Chickamauga, afternoon and evening of September 20, 1863 Thomas resumed service under Don Carlos Buell. During Confederate General Braxton Bragg's invasion of Kentucky in the fall of 1862, the Union high command became nervous about Buell's cautious tendencies and offered command of the Army of the Ohio to Thomas, who refused. Thomas served as Buell's second-in-command at the Battle of Perryville; although tactically inconclusive, the battle halted Bragg's invasion of Kentucky as he voluntarily withdrew to Tennessee. Again frustrated with Buell's ineffective pursuit of Bragg, the Union replaced him with Maj. Gen. William Rosecrans. Thomas wrote on October 30, 1862, a letter of protest to Secretary Stanton, feeling that Rosecrans was junior to him, but Stanton wrote back on November 15, telling him that that was not the case (Rosecrans had in fact been his junior, but his commission as major general had been backdated to make him senior to Thomas) and reminding him of his earlier refusal to accept command; Thomas demurred and withdrew his protest.Broadwater, p. 88-91 Thomas at his bivouac at Chickamauga Fighting under Rosecrans, commanding the \\"Center\\" wing of the newly renamed Army of the Cumberland, Thomas gave an impressive performance at the Battle of Stones River, holding the center of the retreating Union line and once again preventing a victory by Bragg. He was in charge of the most important part of the maneuvering from Decherd to Chattanooga during the Tullahoma Campaign (June 22 ‚Äì July 3, 1863) and the crossing of the Tennessee River. At the Battle of Chickamauga on September 19, 1863, now commanding the XIV Corps, he once again held a desperate position against Bragg's onslaught while the Union line on his right collapsed. Thomas rallied broken and scattered units together on Horseshoe Ridge to prevent a significant Union defeat from becoming a hopeless rout. Future president James Garfield, a field officer for the Army of the Cumberland, visited Thomas during the battle, carrying orders from Rosecrans to retreat; when Thomas said he would have to stay behind to ensure the Army's safety, Garfield told Rosecrans that Thomas was \\"standing like a rock.\\"eHistory website After the battle he became widely known by the nickname \\"The Rock of Chickamauga\\", representing his determination to hold a vital position against strong odds. Battles for Chattanooga, November 24‚Äì25, 1863 Thomas succeeded Rosecrans in command of the Army of the Cumberland shortly before the Battles for Chattanooga (November 23‚Äì25, 1863), a stunning Union victory that was highlighted by Thomas's troops storming the Confederate line on Missionary Ridge. As the Army of the Cumberland advanced further than ordered, General Grant, on Orchard Knob asked Thomas, \\"Who ordered the advance?\\" Thomas replied, \\"I don't know. I did not.\\" =Atlanta and Franklin/Nashville= During Maj. Gen. William Tecumseh Sherman's advance through Georgia in the spring of 1864, the Army of the Cumberland numbered over 60,000 men, and Thomas's staff did the logistics and engineering for Sherman's entire army group, including developing a novel series of Cumberland pontoons. At the Battle of Peachtree Creek (July 20, 1864), Thomas's defense severely damaged Lt. Gen. John B. Hood's army in its first attempt to break the siege of Atlanta. When Hood broke away from Atlanta in the autumn of 1864, menaced Sherman's long line of communications, and endeavored to force Sherman to follow him, Sherman abandoned his communications and embarked on the March to the Sea. Thomas stayed behind to fight Hood in the Franklin-Nashville Campaign. Thomas, with a smaller force, raced with Hood to reach Nashville, where he was to receive reinforcements. At the Battle of Franklin on November 30, 1864, a large part of Thomas's force, under command of Maj. Gen. John M. Schofield, dealt Hood a strong defeat and held him in check long enough to cover the concentration of Union forces in Nashville. At Nashville, Thomas had to organize his forces, which had been drawn from all parts of the West and which included many young troops and even quartermaster employees. He declined to attack until his army was ready and the ice covering the ground had melted enough for his men to move. The North, including General Grant himself (now general-in-chief of all Union armies), grew impatient at the delay. Maj. Gen. John A. Logan was sent with an order to replace Thomas, and soon afterwards Grant started a journey west from City Point, Virginia to take command in person. Thomas attacked on December 15, 1864, in the Battle of Nashville and effectively destroyed Hood's command in two days of fighting. Thomas sent his wife, Frances Lucretia Kellogg Thomas, the following telegram, the only communication surviving of the Thomases' correspondence: \\"We have whipped the enemy, taken many prisoners and considerable artillery.\\" Thomas was appointed a major general in the regular army, with date of rank of his Nashville victory, and received the Thanks of Congress: Thomas may have resented his late promotion to major general (which made him junior by date of rank to Sheridan); upon receiving the telegram announcing it, he remarked to Surgeon George Cooper: \\"I suppose it is better late than never, but it is too late to be appreciated. I earned this at Chickamauga.\\".Stephen Z. Starr, \\"Grant and Thomas: December, 1864,\\" Cincinnati Civil War Round Table website Thomas also received another nickname from his victory: \\"The Sledge of Nashville\\". Later life and death Oakwood Cemetery After the end of the Civil War, Thomas commanded the Department of the Cumberland in Kentucky and Tennessee, and at times also West Virginia and parts of Georgia, Mississippi and Alabama, through 1869. During the Reconstruction period, Thomas acted to protect freedmen from white abuses. He set up military commissions to enforce labor contracts since the local courts had either ceased to operate or were biased against blacks. Thomas also used troops to protect places threatened by violence from the Ku Klux Klan.Einolf, Christopher J.: \\"Forgotten Heroism\\", North & South, Volume 11, number 2, page 90, December 2008. In a November 1868 report, Thomas noted efforts made by former Confederates to paint the Confederacy in a positive light, stating: President Andrew Johnson offered Thomas the rank of lieutenant general‚Äîwith the intent to eventually replace Grant, a Republican and future president, with Thomas as general in chief‚Äîbut the ever-loyal Thomas asked the Senate to withdraw his name for that nomination because he did not want to be party to politics. In 1869 he requested assignment to command the Military Division of the Pacific with headquarters at the Presidio of San Francisco. He died there of a stroke on March 28, 1870, while writing an answer to an article criticizing his military career by his wartime rival John Schofield. Sherman, by then general-in-chief, personally conveyed the news to President Grant at the White House. None of Thomas's blood relatives attended his funeral as they had never forgiven him for his loyalty to the Union. He was buried in Oakwood Cemetery, in Troy, New York. His gravestone was sculpted by Robert E. Launitz and comprises a white marble sarcophagus topped by a bald eagle. Legacy His cadets at West Point had given him the nickname of \\"Slow Trot Thomas\\", and this sobriquet was used to diminish his reputation. He moved slowly because of an injured back, but he was mentally anything but slow, only methodical. He was known for accurate judgment and thorough knowledge of his profession and once he grasped a problem and the time was right for action, he would strike a vigorous, rapid blow. The veterans' organization for the Army of the Cumberland, throughout its existence, fought to see that he was honored for all he had done. Thomas was in chief command of only two battles in the Civil War, the Battle of Mill Springs at the beginning and the Battle of Nashville near the end. Both were victories. However, his contributions at the battles of Stones River, Chickamauga, Chattanooga, and Peachtree Creek were decisive. His main legacies lay in his development of modern battlefield doctrine and in his mastery of logistics. Thomas has generally been held in high esteem by Civil War historians; Bruce Catton and Carl Sandburg wrote glowingly of him, and many consider Thomas one of the top three Union generals of the war, after Grant and William Tecumseh Sherman. But Thomas never entered the popular consciousness like those men. The general destroyed his private papers, saying he did not want \\"his life hawked in print for the eyes of the curious.\\" Beginning in the 1870s, many Civil War generals published memoirs, justifying their decisions or re-fighting old battles, but Thomas, who died in 1870, did not publish his own memoirs. In addition, most of his campaigns were in the Western theater of the war, which received less attention both in the press of the day and in contemporary historical accounts. Grant and Thomas also had a cool relationship, for reasons that are not entirely clear, but are well- attested by contemporaries. When a rain-soaked Grant arrived at Thomas's headquarters before the Chattanooga Campaign, Thomas, caught up in other activity, did not acknowledge the general for several minutes until an aide intervened. Thomas's perceived slowness at Nashville‚Äîalthough necessitated by the weather‚Äîdrove Grant into a fit of impatience, and Grant nearly replaced Thomas. In his Personal Memoirs, Grant tended to minimize Thomas's contributions, particularly during the Franklin-Nashville Campaign, saying his movements were \\"always so deliberate and so slow, though effective in defence.\\"Grant, chapter LX. Grant did, however, acknowledge that Thomas's eventual success at Nashville obviated all criticism. Sherman, who had been close to Thomas throughout the war, also repeated the accusation after the war that Thomas was \\"slow\\", and this damning with faint praise tended to affect perceptions of the Rock of Chickamauga well into the 20th century. Both Sherman and Grant attended Thomas's funeral, and were reported by third parties to have been visibly moved by his passing. Thomas's legendary bay horse, Billy, bore his friend Sherman's name. Thomas was always on good terms with his commanding officer in the Army of the Cumberland, William Rosecrans. Even after Rosecrans was relieved of command and replaced by Thomas, he had nothing but praise for him. Upon hearing of Thomas' death, Rosecrans sent a letter to the National Tribune, stating Thomas' passing was a \\"National Calamity...Few knew him better than I did, none valued him more.\\" In 1877, Sherman published an article praising Grant and Thomas, and contrasting them to Robert E. Lee. After noting that Thomas, unlike his fellow Virginian Lee, stood by the Union, Sherman wrote:Sherman concluded that Grant and Thomas were \\"heroes\\" deserving \\"monuments like those of Nelson and Wellington in London, well worthy to stand side by side with the one which now graces our city of 'George Washington.'\\" File:George Henry Thomas Buttre portrait.jpgJ.

Background  He was born at Steinbach (near Penig) in Saxony. He studied at Leipzig and Erlangen, and in 1829 was called to Jena as professor of theology. He retired in 1883 and was made a baron. He was the great-grandfather of Dietrich Bonhoeffer. Hase's aim was to reconcile modern culture with historical Christianity in a scientific way. But though a liberal theologian, he was no dry rationalist. Indeed, he vigorously attacked rationalism, as distinguished from the rational principle, charging it with being unscientific inasmuch as it ignored the historical significance of Christianity, shut its eyes to individuality and failed to give religious feeling its due.  Works  Karl Hase statue in Jena His views are presented scientifically in his Evangelisch- protestantische Dogmatik (1826; 6th edition, 1870), the value of which \\"lies partly in the full and judiciously chosen historical materials prefixed to each dogma, and partly in the skill, caution and tact with which the permanent religious significance of various dogmas is discussed\\" (Otto Pfleiderer). More popular in style is his Gnosis: Oder evangelische Glaubenslehre, f√ºr die gebildeten in der Gemeinde, ( volume 1, 1827; volume 2, 1828; volume 3, 1829; second edition in two volumes, 1869 & 1870). But his reputation rests chiefly on his treatment of church history in his Kirchengeschichte, Lehrbuch zun√§chst f√ºr akademische Vorlesungen (1834, 12th edition, 1900; English translation, 1870). His biographical studies, Franz von Assisi (1856; second edition, 1892), Caterina von Siena (1864; second edition, 1892), Neue Propheten (Die Jungfrau von Orleans, Savonarola, Thomas M√ºnzer) are judicious and sympathetic. Other works are: * Hutterus Redivivus, or, doctrine of the Evangelical Lutheran Church (1827; 12th edition, 1883), a work in which he sought to present the teaching of the Protestant church in such a way as Leonhard Hutter would have reconstructed it, had he still been alive. * Das Leben Jesu (1829; 5th edition, 1865; English translation, 1860); in an enlarged form, Geschichte Jesu (second edition, 1891). * Handbuch der protestantischen Polemik gegen die R√∂misch-katholische Kirche (1862; 7th edition, 1900; English translation, volume 1, volume 2, 1906).

With over 1,700 flights since its debut in 1966, the Soyuz is the most frequently used launch vehicle in the world. For nearly a decade, between the final flight of the Space Shuttle program in 2011 and the 2020 first crewed mission of SpaceX's Falcon 9 rocket, Soyuz rockets were the only launch vehicles able and approved for transporting astronauts to the International Space Station. The Soyuz vehicles are used as the launcher for the crewed Soyuz spacecraft as part of the Soyuz programme, as well as to launch uncrewed Progress supply spacecraft to the International Space Station and for commercial launches marketed and operated by Starsem and Arianespace. All Soyuz rockets use RP-1 and liquid oxygen (LOX) propellant, with the exception of the Soyuz-U2, which used Syntin, a variant of RP-1, with LOX. The Soyuz family is a subset of the R-7 family.  History  Soyuz rocket engines = A space workhorse = The Soyuz launcher was introduced in 1966, deriving from the Vostok launcher, which in turn was based on the 8K74 or R-7a intercontinental ballistic missile. It was initially a three-stage rocket with a Block I upper stage. The first four test launches were all failures, but eventually it worked.The Great Soviet Cosmonaut Conspiracy - Soyuz Conspiracy - Timeline Later a Molniya variant was produced by adding a fourth stage, allowing it to reach the highly elliptical Molniya orbit. A later variant was the Soyuz-U. While the exact model and variant designations were kept secret from the west, the Soyuz launcher was referred to by either the United States Department of Defense designation of SL-4, or the Sheldon designation of A-2 (developed by Charles S. Sheldon, an analyst with the Library of Congress). Both systems for naming Soviet rockets stopped being used as more accurate information became available. The production of Soyuz launchers reached a peak of 60 per year in the early 1980s. It has become the world's most used space launcher, flying over 1700 times, far more than any other rocket. Despite its age and perhaps thanks to its simplicity, this rocket family has been notable for its low cost and high reliability. = Soyuz / Fregat = Soyuz-FG erected at the Baikonur Cosmodrome launch pad 1/5 Gagarin's Start (October 2008). In the early 1990s plans were made for a redesigned Soyuz with a Fregat upper stage. The Fregat engine was developed by NPO Lavochkin from the propulsion module of its Phobos interplanetary probes. Although endorsed by the Roscosmos and the Russian Ministry of Defence in 1993 and designated \\"Rus\\" as a Russification and modernisation of Soyuz, and later renamed Soyuz-2, a funding shortage prevented implementation of the plan. The creation of Starsem in July 1996 provided new funding for the creation of a less ambitious variant, the Soyuz-Fregat or Soyuz-U/Fregat. This consisted of a slightly modified Soyuz-U combined with the Fregat upper stage, with a capacity of up to 1350 kg to geostationary transfer orbit. In April 1997, Starsem obtained a contract from the European Space Agency (ESA) to launch two pairs of Cluster II plasma science satellites using the Soyuz-Fregat. Before the introduction of this new model, Starsem launched 24 satellites of the Globalstar constellation in 6 launches with a restartable Ikar upper stage, between 22 September 1999 and 22 November 1999. After successful test flights of Soyuz-Fregat on 9 February 2000 and 20 March 2000, the Cluster II satellites were launched on 16 July 2000 and 9 August 2000. Another Soyuz-Fregat launched the ESA's Mars Express probe from Baikonur in June 2003. Now the Soyuz-Fregat launcher is used by Starsem for commercial payloads. = ISS crew transport = Between 1 February 2003 and 26 July 2005 with the grounding of the United States Space Shuttle fleet, Soyuz was the only means of transportation to and from the International Space Station. This included the transfer of supplies, via Progress spacecraft, and crew changeovers. After the retirement of the Space Shuttle fleet in 2011, the United States space program was without any means to take astronauts into orbit, and NASA was dependent on the Soyuz to send crew into space until 2020. NASA resumed crewed flights from the United States in 2020 through the Commercial Crew Development program. = Recent incidents = A long string of successful Soyuz launches was broken on 15 October 2002 when the uncrewed Soyuz-U launch of the Photon-M satellite from Plesetsk fell back near the launch pad and exploded 29 seconds after lift-off. One person from the ground crew was killed and eight were injured. Another failure occurred on 21 June 2005, during a Molniya military communications satellite launch from the Plesetsk launch site, which used a four-stage version of the rocket called Molniya-M. The flight ended six minutes after the launch because of a failure of the third stage engine or an unfulfilled order to separate the second and third stages. The rocket's second and third stages, which are identical to the Soyuz, and its payload (a Molniya-3K satellite) crashed in the Uvatsky region of Tyumen (Siberia). On 24 August 2011, an uncrewed Soyuz-U carrying cargo to the International Space Station crashed, failing to reach orbit. On December 23, 2011 a Soyuz-2.1b launching a Meridian 5 military communications satellite failed in the 7th minute of launch because of an anomaly in the third stage. On 11 October 2018, the Soyuz MS-10 mission to the International Space Station failed to reach orbit after an issue with the main booster. The launch escape system was used to pull the Soyuz spacecraft away from the malfunctioning rocket. The two crew, Aleksey Ovchinin and Nick Hague, followed a ballistic trajectory and landed safely over 400 km downrange from the Baikonur Cosmodrome. = Soyuz-2 and Guiana spaceport = Soyuz 2 ready to launch (2007) The venerable Soyuz launcher was gradually replaced by a new version, named Soyuz-2 or Soyuz/ST, which has a new digital guidance system and a highly modified third stage with a new engine. The first development version of Soyuz-2 called Soyuz-2-1a, which is equipped with the digital guidance system, but is still propelled by an old third stage engine, started on 4 November 2004 from Plesetsk on a suborbital test flight, followed by an orbital flight on 23 October 2006 from Baikonur. The fully modified launcher (version Soyuz-2-1b) flew first on 27 December 2006 with the CoRoT satellite from the Baikonur Cosmodrome. On 19 January 2005, the European Space Agency (ESA) and the Roscosmos agreed to launch Soyuz/ST rockets from the Guiana Space Centre. The equatorial launch site allows the Soyuz to deliver 2.7 to 4.9 tonnes into sun-synchronous orbit, depending on the third-stage engine used. Construction of a new pad started in 2005 and was completed in April 2011. The pad used vertical loading common at French Guiana, unlike the horizontal loading used at the Baikonur Cosmodrome. A simulated launch was conducted in early May 2011. The first operational launch happened on 21 October 2011, bearing the first two satellites in Galileo global positioning system. The Soyuz-U and Soyuz-FG rockets are gradually being replaced by Soyuz-2 from 2014 onwards. Soyuz-U was retired in 2017, while Soyuz-FG carried astronaut crews to the ISS until September 2019 (final flight Soyuz MS-15 25 September 2019).  Variants  * Soyuz 11A511 (1966-1975) * Soyuz-L 11A511L (1970-1971) * Soyuz-M 11A511M (1971-1976) * Soyuz-U 11A511U (1973-2017) * Soyuz-U2 11A511U2 or 11A511K (1982-1995) * Soyuz-FG 11A511U-FG (2001-2019) * Soyuz-2 14A14 (2006-today) The Molniya-M (1964-2010) was also derived from the Soyuz family.  Assembly  Soyuz rocket assembly: the first and second stages are in the background, already joined together; the third stage is in the lower left corner of the image. The Soyuz spacecraft, covered by its launch shroud, is in the lower right corner. The rocket is assembled horizontally in the Assembly and Testing Building. The assembled rocket is transported to the launch site in its horizontal state and then raised. This is different from the vertical assembly of, for example, the Saturn V, and is one of the features that makes Soyuz cheaper to prepare for launch. Assembling a horizontally positioned rocket is relatively simple as all modules are easily accessible. Assembling the rocket in vertical position would require a windproof high-rise hangar, which was not considered financially feasible at the time the rocket was designed, due to the failing economy of the Soviet Union.  Prelaunch  Soyuz TMA-13 being erected at the Gagarin's Start launch pad, 10 October 2008. The entire rocket is suspended in the launch system by the load-bearing mechanisms on the strap-on boosters where they are attached to the central core. The latter rests on the nose sections of the strap-on boosters. This scheme resembles flight conditions when the strap-on boosters push the central core forward. The concept of suspending the rocket was one of the novelties introduced with the R-7/Soyuz. Since the launch pad has been eliminated, the bottom portion of the rocket is lowered. The launch system trusses bear the wind loads. Resistance to high wind is an important feature of the launch system, as the Kazakhstan steppes, where the Baikonur launch site is located, are known for windstorms.  Launch  A Soyuz-U on the launch pad, ahead of the Apollo-Soyuz Test Project (ASTP) launch on 15 July 1975. The engines are ignited by electrically initiated pyrotechnic flares, mounted on birch poles, which are ignited at approximately T-20 seconds, a few seconds before fuel components are introduced into the combustion chamber. This sequence rarely fails due to its simplicity. During launch, the support booms track the movement of the rocket. After the support boom heads emerge from the special support recess in the nose sections of the strapons, the support booms and trusses disconnect from the rocket airframe, swiveling on the support axes and freeing the way for the rocket to lift off. During launch, the rocket and the launch facility form a single dynamic system. When the strapon booster engines stop, the boosters fall away, providing nonimpact separation. If the skies are clear, ground observers can see a Korolev cross formed by the falling boosters.  Fairings used for uncrewed missions  The Soyuz launch vehicle is used for various Russian uncrewed missions and is also marketed by Starsem for commercial satellite launches. Presently the following fairing types are used: Progress is the cargo spacecraft for uncrewed missions to the ISS and previously to Mir. The spacecraft uses a dedicated platform and fairing and can be launched with either Soyuz-U, Soyuz-FG or Soyuz-2. A-type fairing is used for commercial launches. S-type fairing is used for commercial launches by Starsem. The fairing has external diameter of 3.7 m and a length of 7.7 m. The Fregat upper stage is encapsulated in the fairing with the payload and a payload adapter/dispenser. S-type fairing along with Fregat upper stage were used to launch the following spacecraft: Galaxy 14, GIOVE A, Mars Express, AMOS-2, Venus Express, Cluster. SL-type fairing is used for commercial launches by Starsem. The fairing has external diameter of 3.7 m and a length of 8.45 m. The Fregat upper stage is encapsulated in the fairing with the payload and a payload adapter/dispenser. SL-type fairing along with Fregat upper stage were used to launch the following spacecraft: CoRoT. ST-type fairing is used for commercial launches by Starsem. Its external diameter is 4.1 m and its length is 11.4 m. It can be used with the Soyuz-2 only, because older analog control system cannot cope with aerodynamic instability introduced by a fairing this large. This carbon-plastic fairing is based on the proven configuration used for Arianespace's Ariane 4 vehicles, with its length increased by approximately one additional meter. The fairing has been developed and is being manufactured by TsSKB-Progress in accordance with the requirements of a customer (Starsem). This is the only fairing type offered by Starsem/Arianespace for launches from Kourou.  Stages  Exploded plan of Soyuz FG rocket = First stage = The first stage hauling a crew up to ISS, 2006. The first stage of Soyuz rockets consists of four identical conical liquid booster rockets, strapped to the second stage core.

Beginning in late 1840, other princesses and princes of the young sultan were born. Attention was paid to the education and careful training of the great prince Murad. Among the teachers of the prince, his Quran teacher, Toprik S√ºleyman Efendi, Ferrik Efendi, Sheikh Hafƒ±z Efendi taught him Hadith (the traditions of Muhammad), Monsieur Gardet (French), and Italian Lombardi (piano). Murad also participated in the visits of Abd√ºlaziz to Egypt in 1863 and to Europe in 1867. While he was appreciated by the European rulers with his kindness, his uncle, who was uncomfortable with this, had planned to send him back to Istanbul. Napoleon and Queen Victoria, showed interest in Murad more than Abdulaziz. Moreover, special invitations and excursions were organized for the crown prince. He spent most of his time at the farmhouse in Kurbaƒüalƒ±dere, Kadƒ±k√∂y, which Abd√ºlaziz had allocated to him. He frequently spoke with ≈ûin√¢si, N√¢mƒ±k Kemal and Ziy√¢ (Pasha) gentlemen about legitimacy, democracy and freedom.

Biography Neander was born at G√∂ttingen as David Mendel. His father, Emmanuel Mendel, is said to have been a Jewish pedlar, but August adopted the name of Neander on his baptism as a Protestant Christian. While still very young, he moved with his mother to Hamburg. From the grammar school (Johanneum) he passed to the gymnasium, where the study of Plato appears especially to have engrossed him. Considerable interest attaches to his early companionship with Wilhelm Neumann and certain others, among whom were the writer Karl August Varnhagen von Ense and the poet Adelbert von Chamisso. Baptized on February 25, 1806, Neander went to Halle to study divinity at the age of 17. Friedrich Schleiermacher was then lecturing at Halle. Neander found in him the inspiration he needed, while Schleiermacher found a congenial pupil; one destined to propagate his views in a higher and more effective Christian form. Before the end of that year, the events of the War of the Fourth Coalition forced Neander to move to G√∂ttingen. There he continued his studies, made himself an expert on Plato and Plutarch, and became especially advanced in theology under the venerable GJ Planck. The impulse communicated by Schleiermacher was confirmed by Planck, and Neander seems now to have realized that the original investigation of Christian history was to form the great work of his life. Having finished his university course, he returned to Hamburg, and passed his examination for the Christian ministry. After an interval of about eighteen months, however, he decided on an academic career, which began at Heidelberg, where two vacancies had occurred in the theological faculty of the university. He went there as a teacher of theology in 1811 and in 1812 he became a professor. In the same year (1812) he published his monograph √úber den Kaiser Julianus und sein Zeitalter. The fresh insight into the history of the church evinced by this work drew attention to its author, and even before he had terminated the first year of his academical labours at Heidelberg, he was called to Berlin, where he was appointed professor of Theology. His pupils included Edmond de Pressens√©. In the year following his appointment he published a second monograph Der Heilige Bernhard und sein Zeitalter (Berlin, 1813) and then in 1818 his work on Gnosticism (Genetische Entwickelung der vornehmsten gnostischen Systeme). A still more extended and elaborate monograph than either of the preceding followed in 1822, Der Heilige Johannes Chrysostomus und die Kirche besonders des Orients in dessen Zeitalter, and again, in 1824 another on Tertullian (Antignostikus). He had in the meantime begun his great work, to which these efforts were only preparatory studies. The first volume of his Allgemeine Geschichte der christlichen Religion und Kirche embracing the history of the first three centuries, made it appearance in 1825. The others followed at intervals‚Äîthe fifth, which appeared in 1842, bringing down the narrative to the pontificate of Boniface VIII. A posthumous volume edited by CFT Schneider in 1852, carried it on to the period of the council of Basel. Aside from this work, he published in 1832 his Geschichte der Pflanzung und Leitung der christlichen Kirche durch die Apostel, and in 1837 his Das Leben Jesu Christi, in seinem geschichilichen Zusammenhang und seiner geschichtlichen Entwickelung, called forth by the famous Das Leben Jesu of David Strauss. In addition to all these he published Denkw√ºrdigkeiten aus der Geschichte des Christentums (1823-1824, 2 vols., 1825, 3 vols., 1846); Das Eine und Mannichfaltige des christlichen Lebens (1840); papers on Plotinus, Thomas Aquinas, Theobald Thamer, Blaise Pascal, John Henry Newman, Blanco White and Thomas Arnold, and other occasional pieces (Kleine Gelegenheitsschriften, 1829), mainly of a practical, exegetical and historical character. Several of his books went through multiple editions and were translated into English. Gravesite of August Neander at Friedhof I Jerusalems- und Neue Kirche in Berlin-Kreuzberg He died in Berlin on 14 July 1850, worn out and nearly blind with incessant study. His grave is preserved in the Protestant Friedhof I der Jerusalems- und Neuen Kirchengemeinde (Cemetery No. I of the congregations of Jerusalem's Church and New Church) in Berlin- Kreuzberg, south of Hallesches Tor. After his death a succession of volumes, representing his various courses of lectures, appeared (1856‚Äì1864), in addition to the Lectures on the History of Dogma (Theologische Vorlesungen), admirable in spirit and execution, which were edited by J. L. Jacobi in 1857. Neander's own handwritten letter  Personal influences  = People = Neander's personal influences began first and foremost within his own family. His father did not have a very positive influence in young Neander's life. Shortly after Neander's birth, his mother Esther divorced from her worthless husband and removed the whole family to Hamburg. Esther Mendel struggled on a daily basis to support her children financially. As a result, the family experienced a great deal of poverty. However, Neander cherished this period in his life, and described it in endearing terms as ‚Äúmen in all ages who‚Ä¶have been indebted to their pious mothers‚Äù for planting the seeds of faith in their hearts. This period in Neander's life assuredly had a profound effect on both his personal faith, and his attitude towards life in general. Neander was often described as ‚Äòwide-hearted‚Äô, ‚Äòtruthful‚Äô, ‚Äòsincere‚Äô, ‚Äòfree from all the stuff of vanity‚Äô, ‚Äòaffectionate‚Äô, ‚Äòinnocent and pure of heart‚Äô. This personal quality was most certainly received through his mother's influence. To what degree these influences affected the writings of Neander has not yet been established in the literature. Neander was most indebted to his teacher and later his friend and colleague Schleiermacher, of whom similar sentiments are evident in his perceived purpose of recording church history. > ‚ÄúTo exhibit the history of the church of Christ, as a living witness of the > divine power of Christianity; as a school of Christian experience; a voice, > a sounding through the ages, of instruction, of doctrine, and of reproof, > for all who are disposed to listen.‚Äù Schleiermacher's attitude towards history undoubtedly influenced that of his student and colleague, which in turn would have also influenced Neander's work.  Biblical conversion from Judaism to Christianity  The conversion of Augustus Neander from Judaism to Christianity was the single most important event in his life, and had a large impact upon both himself and his writing. Neander, along with his brothers and sisters, followed later by their mother, eventually left the synagogue and embraced Christianity. In his own personal conversion, Neander was especially influenced by the Apostle John, due to the similarity in the sentiment of John's writings to that of Neander's beloved Plato. Neander's conversion has often been likened to the conversion of Saint Paul of Tarsus. While his transition from Judaism to Christianity was far less abrupt than that of his predecessor, he is thought to resemble the Apostle Paul in other ways. Neander's purity of motive, the strength of his conviction, his unselfish devotion to Christianity, and his similar zeal for freedom from a life of legalism are all aspects of Paul's character that are reflected in the character of Neander. His conversion had a profound impact on his work and gave rise to an incredible conviction of the importance of faith, and is also considered to be one of the most sincere and intelligent events of his life. The impact that it had on both his person and his work was evident in his passion for the Lord, his relationship with his students, and his attitude towards church history.  Church history  His General History of the Christian Religion and Church (Allgemeine Geschichte der christlichen Religion und Kirche) remains the greatest monument of his genius. In this Neander's chief aim was everywhere to understand what was individual in history. In the principal figures of ecclesiastical history he tried to depict the representative tendencies of each age, and also the types of the essential tendencies of human nature generally. His guiding principle in dealing both with the history and with the present condition of the church was \\"that Christianity has room for the various tendencies of human nature, and aims at permeating and glorifying them all; that according to the divine plan these various tendencies are to occur successively and simultaneously and to counterbalance each other, so that the freedom and variety of the development of the spiritual life ought not to be forced into a single dogmatic form\\" (Otto Pfleiderer).

Biography Schaff was born in Chur, Switzerland, and educated at the gymnasium of Stuttgart. At the universities of T√ºbingen, Halle and Berlin, he was successively influenced by Ferdinand Christian Baur and Schmid, by Friedrich August Tholuck and Julius M√ºller, by David Strauss and, above all, Johann August Wilhelm Neander. At Berlin in 1841 he took the degree of Bachelor of Divinity and passed examinations for a professorship. He then traveled through Italy and Sicily as tutor to Baron Krischer. In 1842, he was Privatdozent in the University of Berlin, where he lectured on exegesis and ecclesiastical history. In 1843, he was called to become Professor of Church History and Biblical Literature in the German Reformed Theological Seminary of Mercersburg, Pennsylvania, then the only seminary of that church in America. On his journey Schaff stayed in England and met Edward Pusey and other Tractarians. His inaugural address on The Principle of Protestantism, delivered in German at Reading, Pennsylvania, in 1844, and published in German with an English translation by John Williamson Nevin was a pioneer work in English in the field of symbolics (that is, the authoritative ecclesiastical formulations of religious doctrines in creeds or confessions). This address and the \\"Mercersburg theology\\" which he taught seemed too pro-Catholic to some, and he was charged with heresy. But, at the synod at York in 1845, he was unanimously acquitted. Schaff's broad views strongly influenced the German Reformed Church, through his teaching at Mercersburg, through his championship of English in German Reformed churches and schools in America, through his hymnal (1859), through his labours as chairman of the committee which prepared a new liturgy, and by his edition (1863) of the Heidelberg Catechism. So much so that when the German Reformed Church, in a desire to begin producing more and better published material for the denomination published Samuel Miller's work entitled A Treatise on Mercersburg Theology: Mercersburg and Modern Theology Compared in 1866. Schaff's History of the Apostolic Church (in German, 1851; in English, 1853) and his History of the Christian Church (7 vols., 1858‚Äì1890), opened a new period in American study of ecclesiastical history. In 1854, Schaff visited Europe, representing the American German churches at the ecclesiastical diet at Frankfurt am Main and at the Swiss pastoral conference at Basel. He lectured in Germany on America, and received the degree of DD from Berlin. In consequence of the ravages of the American Civil War the theological seminary at Mercersburg was closed for a while and so in 1863 Schaff became secretary of the Sabbath Committee (which opposed the \\"continental Sunday\\") in New York City, and held the position till 1870. In 1865 he founded the first German Sunday School in Stuttgart. In 1862‚Äì1867 he lectured on ecclesiastical history at Andover Theological Seminary. Schaff was a member of the Leipzig Historical Society, the Netherland Historical Society, and other historical and literary societies in Europe and America. He was one of the founders, and honorary secretary, of the American branch of the Evangelical Alliance, and was sent to Europe in 1869, 1872, and 1873 to arrange for the general conference of the Alliance, which, after two postponements on account of the Franco-Prussian War, was held in New York in October 1873. Schaff was also, in 1871, one of the Alliance delegates to the emperor of Russia to plead for the religious liberty of his subjects in the Baltic provinces. Schaff became a professor at Union Theological Seminary, New York City in 1870 holding first the chair of theological encyclopedia and Christian symbolism till 1873, of Hebrew and the cognate languages till 1874, of sacred literature till 1887, and finally of church history, until his death. He also served as president of the committee that translated the American Standard Version of the Bible, though he died before it was published in 1901. Schaff's History of the Christian Church resembled Neander's work, though less biographical, and was pictorial rather than philosophical. He also wrote biographies, catechisms and hymnals for children, manuals of religious verse, lectures and essays on Dante, etc. He translated Johann Jakob Herzog's Real-Encyklop√§die f√ºr protestantische Theologie und Kirche (Encyclopedia in Real Terms of Protestant Theology and Church) into English. Working with the Evangelical Alliance and the Chicago (1893) World's Parliament of Religions, and in Germany, through the monthly Kirchenfreund, Schaff strove earnestly to promote Christian unity and union. It was his hope that the Pope (then Leo XIII) would abandon the doctrine of infallibility and undertake the reunion of Christianity. He recognized that he was a \\"mediator between German and Anglo-American theology and Christianity.\\" He died October 20, 1893, and is buried in Woodlawn Cemetery in The Bronx, New York City.

Uses Prostaglandin analogues such as misoprostol are used in treatment of duodenal and gastric ulcers. Misoprostol and other prostaglandin analogues protect the lining of the gastrointestinal tract from harmful stomach acid and are especially indicated for the elderly on continuous doses of NSAIDs. In the field of ophthalmology, drugs of this class are used to lower intraocular pressure (IOP) in people with glaucoma. Up until the late 1970s prostaglandins were thought to raise IOP, but a paper published in 1977 showed that prostaglandin F2Œ± lowered it, and subsequent studies found that this was due to increasing the outflow of aqueous humor, mainly by relaxing the ciliary muscle, and possibly also due to changes in extracellular matrix and to widening of spaces within the trabecular meshwork. This work led to the development of prodrugs of PGF2Œ±, including latanoprost, an isopropyl analogue of PGF2Œ±, approved by the FDA in 1996, bimatoprost and travoprost, both approved in 2001, and tafluprost, approved in 2012.

Biography Tholuck was born at Breslau, and educated at the gymnasium and university there. He distinguished himself by his ability to learn languages. A love of Oriental languages and literature led him to exchange the University of Breslau for that of Berlin, in order to study to greater advantage, and there he was received into the house of the Orientalist Heinrich Friedrich von Diez (1750‚Äì1817). He was introduced to pietistic circles in Berlin, and came under the influence of Baron Hans Ernst von Kottwitz, who became his \\"spiritual father,\\" and of the historian Neander. Before deciding on the career of theological professor, he had in view that of a missionary in the East. Meanwhile, he was feeling the influence to a certain degree of the romantic school, and of Schleiermacher and G. W. F. Hegel too, though he never sounded the depths of their systems. At length, in his twenty- first year, he finally decided to adopt the academical calling. In 1821 he was Privatdozent and in 1823 became professor extraordinarius of theology in Berlin, though he was at the same time active in the work of home and foreign missions. He lectured on the Old and New Testaments, theology, apologetics and the history of the church in the 18th century. In 1821 appeared his first work, Sufismus, sive theosophia Persarum pantheistica; following the same line of study he published Bl√ºtensammlung aus der morgenlandischen Mystik (1825) and Speculative Trinit√§tslehre des sp√§teren Orients (1826). His well-known essay on the nature and moral influence of heathenism (1822) was published by Neander, with high commendation, in his Denkw√ºrdigkeiten; and his Commentary on the Epistle to the Romans (1824) secured him a foremost place amongst the most suggestive, if not the most accurate, Biblical interpreters of that time. Another work, soon translated into all the principal European languages, Die wahre Weihe des Zweiflers (1823), the outcome of his own religious history, obtained for him the permanent position of the modern Pietistic apologist of Evangelical Christianity. In 1825, with the aid of the Prussian government, he visited the libraries of England and the Netherlands, and on his return was appointed (in 1826) professor ordinarius of theology at the University of Halle, the centre of German rationalism, where he afterwards became preacher and member of the supreme consistorial council of the Evangelical State Church in Prussia. Here he made it his aim to combine in a higher unity the learning and to some extent the rationalism of Johann Salomo Semler with the devout and active pietism of A H Francke; and, in spite of the opposition of the theological faculty of the university, he succeeded in changing the character of its theology. This he achieved partly by his lectures, but above all by his personal influence on the students, and, after 1833, by his preaching. His theological position was orthodox, but laid more stress upon Christian experience than upon rigid dogmatic belief. On the two great questions of miracles and inspiration he made great concessions to modern criticism and philosophy. His lifelong battle was on behalf of personal religious experience, in opposition to the externality of rationalism, orthodoxy or sacramentarianism. Karl Schwarz happily remarks that, as the English apologists of the 18th century were themselves infected with the poison of the deists whom they endeavoured to refute, so Tholuck absorbed some of the heresies of the rationalists whom he tried to overthrow. He was also one of the prominent members of the Evangelical Alliance, and few men were more widely known or more beloved throughout the Protestant churches of Europe and America than him. He died at Halle. As a preacher, Tholuck ranked among the foremost of his time. As a teacher, he showed remarkable sympathy and won great success. As a thinker he can hardly be said to have been endowed with great creative power. After his commentaries (on Romans, the Gospel of John, the Sermon on the Mount and the Epistle to the Hebrews) and several volumes of sermons, his best-known books are Stunden christlicher Andacht (1839; 8th ed., 1870), intended to take the place of J H D Zschokke's standard rationalistic work with the same title, and his reply to David Strauss's Life of Jesus (Glaubw√ºrdigkeit der evangelischen Geschichte, 1837). He published at various times valuable contributions towards a history of rationalism--Vorgeschichte des Rationalismus (1853‚Äì1862), Geschichte des Rationalismus (1865), and a number of essays connected with the history of theology and especially of apologetics. His views on inspiration were indicated in his work Die Propheten und ihre Weissagungen (1860), in his essay on the \\"Alte Inspirationslehre,\\" in Deutsche Zeitschrift f√ºr christliche Wissenschaft (1850), and in his Gespr√§che √ºber die vornehmsten Glaubensfragen der Zeit (1846; 2nd ed., 1867). He also contributed many articles to Herzog's Realencyklop√§die, and for several years edited a journal (1830‚Äì1849), Literarischer Anzeiger.

Its purpose is to deliver the supplies needed to sustain a human presence in orbit. While it does not carry a crew, it can be boarded by astronauts when docked to a space station, hence it is classified as crewed by its manufacturer. Progress is derived from the crewed Soyuz spacecraft and launches on the same launch vehicle, a Soyuz rocket. Progress has supported space stations as early as Salyut 6 and as recently as the International Space Station (ISS). Each year there are between three and four Progress flights to the ISS. A Progress remains docked until shortly before being replaced with a new one or a Soyuz (which will use the same docking port). Then it is filled with waste, disconnected, and de-orbited, at which point it burns up in the atmosphere. Due to the variation in Progress vehicles flown to the ISS, NASA uses its own nomenclature where \\"ISS 1P\\" means the first Progress spacecraft to ISS. Progress was developed because of the need for a constant source of supplies to make long duration space missions possible. It was determined that cosmonauts needed an inflow of consumables (food, water, air, etc.), plus there was a need for maintenance items and scientific payloads that necessitated a dedicated cargo carrier. Such payloads were impractical to launch with passengers in the restricted space of a Soyuz. As of 4 January 2020, there have been 165 Progress flights with three failures. All three failures have occurred since 2011.  Design  Diagram of the Progress-M spacecraft. Progress is of much the same size and shape as Soyuz. It consists of three modules: * A pressurized forward module. This carries the supplies for the crew such as scientific equipment, clothes, prepackaged and fresh food, and letters from home. The docking drogue is similar to that of the Soyuz but features ducting for the Unsymmetrical dimethylhydrazine (UDMH) fuel and N2O4 oxidiser. * A fuel compartment. The reentry module of the Soyuz was replaced with an unpressurized propellant and refueling compartment with ducting along the outside of the spacecraft. This meant that if a leak occurred, the poisonous gas would not enter the station's atmosphere. The fuel is carried in two tanks. * A propulsion module. The propulsion module, at the rear of the spacecraft, remained unchanged from the Soyuz and contains the orientation engines used for the automatic docking. It may be used to boost the orbit of the station once docked. Reduction in mass was possible because the Progress was designed to be uncrewed and disposable. This means that there is no need for bulky life support systems and heat shields. A small amount of weight is saved due to the lack of automatic rescue crews system and lack of parachutes. The spacecraft also has no ability to split into separate modules. After undocking, the spacecraft performs a retrofire and burns up in the atmosphere.  Versions  There were many small variations between the different flights, but the major upgrades are reflected in the change of name. = Progress (1978‚Äì1990) = Progress logistics resupply spacecraft. It consists of the dry cargo module (left); the tanker compartment (center); and a stretched service module (right). There were 42 spacecraft built using the initial Progress design, the last one being launched in May 1990. The bureau in charge of designing the freighter was TsKBEM (now Energia (corporation)). They began work on the design in mid-1973, assigning Progress the GRAU index 11F615A15. The design was complete by February 1974, and the first production model was ready for launch in November 1977. Progress 1 launched on 20 January 1978 aboard the same rocket used to launch the Soyuz. It still featured the same launch shroud as the Soyuz, though this was purely for aerodynamic purposes as the launch escape system had been deactivated. This first version of Progress had a mass of 7,020 kg and carried 2,300 kg of cargo, or 30% of its launch mass. It had the same diameter as the Soyuz at 2.2 metres, but was 8 metres in length‚Äîslightly longer. The autonomous flight time was 3 days, the same time as that of the Soyuz ferry. It could spend one month docked. Progress always docked to the aft port of the station it was resupplying (the aft being where the main rocket engines of the station and their tankage, for refueling by the Progress, are located). * Launch mass: 7,020‚Äì7,249 kg * Mass of cargo: ** ~2,300 kg (before Progress-24) ** ~2,500 kg (from Progress-24) * Length: 7.94 m * Diameter of cargo modules: 2.2 m * Maximum diameter: 2.72 m * Volume of cargo compartment: 6.6 m3 = Progress-M 11F615A55 (1989-2009) = Progress-M logistics resupply spacecraft. The upgraded Progress M (GRAU: 11F615A55, manufacturer's designation: 7K-TGM) was first launched in August 1989. The first 43 flights all went to Mir; following Mir's re-entry, Progress was used as the resupply vehicle for the International Space Station. As of August 2014, there have been 56 flights to the ISS and more are scheduled. The Progress M is essentially the same spacecraft as the Progress, but it features improvements based on the Soyuz-T and Soyuz-TM designs. It can spend up to 30 days in autonomous flight and is able to carry 100 kg more. Also, unlike the old Progress crafts, it can return items to Earth. This is accomplished by using the VBK-Raduga capsule, which can carry up to 150 kg of cargo. It is 1.5 m long and 60 cm in diameter and has a \\"dry mass\\" of 350 kg. Progress M can also dock to the forward port of the station and still transfer fuel. It uses the same rendezvous system as the Soyuz, and it features solar panels for the first time. * Launch mass: 7,130 kg * Cargo mass: 2,600 kg * Dry cargo mass: 1,500 kg * Liquid cargo mass: 1,540 kg * Length: 7.23 m * Diameter of cargo modules: 2.2 m * Maximum diameter: 2.72 m * Dry cargo compartment volume: 7.6 m¬≥ * Solar array span: 10.6 m = Progress-–ú 11F615A60 (2008-2015) = A new modification of the Progress spacecraft, with new TsVM-101 digital flight computer and MBITS digital telemetry system, was first launched on 26 November 2008, at 12:38 UTC from the Kazakhstan's Baikonur Cosmodrome spaceport aboard a Russian Soyuz rocket. The first spacecraft of this series was Progress M-01M. The spacecraft belongs to the so-called 400 series (GRAU: 11F615A60), and all modifications applied to it were subsequently used in the production of new Soyuz-TMA-M crewed spacecraft. Progress M-27M was launched on 28 April 2015, but communication with the vessel was lost soon after, and it was destroyed as it re-entered the atmosphere on 8 May 2015. The last launch was Progress M-29M = Progress M1 (2000-2004) = Progress M1 is another variant, capable of carrying more propellant (but less total cargo) to the space station. There have been 11 of these flights. * Mass: 7,150 kg * Capacity cargo: 2,230 kg * Capacity dry cargo: 1,800 kg * Capacity propellant: 1,950 kg = Progress M2 = Progress M2 was a planned variant, which was a proposed design for the proposed Mir-2 space station, but was dropped due to financial issues. The M2 variant would have a larger service module for larger cargo or space station modules and would have been launched on a Zenit rocket as the spacecraft is bigger. = Progress MS (2015-present) = Progress MS is an improved variant which first launched on 21 December 2015.http://sputniknews.com/russia/20151114/1030108241/roscosmos-progress- spacecraft.html It has the following improvements: * New external compartment that enables it to deploy satellites. Each compartment can hold up to four launch containers. First time installed on Progress MS-03. * Enhanced redundancy thanks to the addition of a backup system of electrical motors for the docking and sealing mechanism. * Improved Micrometeoroid (MMOD) protection with additional panels in the cargo compartment. * Luch Russian relay satellites link capabilities enable telemetry and control even when not in direct view of ground radio stations. * GNSS autonomous navigation enables real time determination of the status vector and orbital parameters dispensing with the need of ground station orbit determination. * Real time relative navigation thanks to direct radio data exchange capabilities with the space station. * New digital radio that enables enhanced TV camera view for the docking operations. * The Ukrainian Chezara Kvant-V on board radio system and antenna/feeder system has been replaced with a Unified Command Telemetry System (UCTS). * Replacement of the Kurs A with Kurs NA digital system.  Current status  Launch of Progress M-11M The Progress M1-3 seen docked at the bottom of the Zvezda module of the ISS during STS-106. Progress spacecraft are used to resupply the International Space Station (ISS) as of 2020. Between 1 February 2003 and 26 July 2005, they were the only spacecraft available to transport large quantities of supplies to the station, as the Space Shuttle fleet was grounded after the breakup of Columbia at the end of STS-107. For ISS missions, the Progress M1 variant is used, which moves the water tanks from the propellant and refueling module to the pressurized section, and as a result is able to carry more propellant. Progress M-67, the final flight of a Progress-M spacecraft, was launched 24 July 2009 on a Soyuz-U. On 9 July 2018, Progress MS-09 broke a previous record by reaching the ISS in 3 hours and 48 minutes, carrying about 2450 kg of cargo and supplies. It delivered food, fuel and supplies, including 705 kg of propellant, 50 kg of oxygen and air, 420 kg of water. The European Space Agency (ESA) operated its own type of robotic supply freighter, the Automated Transfer Vehicle (ATV). The first of these, named Jules Verne, was launched at 04:03 UTC on 9 March 2008. ATVs can carry up to 8.85 tonnes of cargo into space, roughly three times as much as the Progress, and were launched annually by Ariane 5 rockets from 2011-2014 as part of ESA contribution to ISS upkeep. The design is adopted as the Service Module of the Orion spacecraft. NASA's planned Orion spacecraft was initially designed to have an uncrewed variant of the Crew module similar to Progress; however, this capability was removed in 2009. SpaceX's commercial Dragon spacecraft and Northrop Grumman's Cygnus spacecraft also handle American logistics to the International Space Station.

His remaining years were affected by ill health, and he died of a stroke at a nursing home in Bury St Edmunds, Suffolk, on 31 May 1991, aged 77. His writing, which has a strongly satirical vein, expresses his concern with preserving a liberal humanistic outlook in the face of fashionable doctrinaire temptations. Several of his works were adapted for television. He was Professor of English Literature at the University of East Anglia from 1966 to 1978, and jointly helped to establish their creative writing course at masters level in 1970, which was then a groundbreaking initiative in the United Kingdom. His medals, then in private ownership, were shown on the BBC Television programme Antiques Roadshow in August 2018.

They are called lipid-lowering drugs. These are drugs which lower the level of lipids and lipoproteins in blood.  Classes  The several classes of hypolipidemic drugs may differ in both their impact on the cholesterol profile and adverse effects. For example, some may lower the \\"bad cholesterol\\" low density lipoprotein (LDL) more so than others, while others may preferentially increase high density lipoprotein (HDL), \\"the good cholesterol\\". Clinically, the choice of an agent depends on the patient's cholesterol profile, cardiovascular risk, and the liver and kidney functions of the patient, evaluated against the balancing of risks and benefits of the medications. In the United States, this is guided by the evidence-based guideline most recently updated in 2018 by the American College of Cardiology & American Heart Association. =Established= * Statins (HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors) are particularly well suited for lowering LDL, the cholesterol with the strongest links to vascular diseases. In studies using standard doses, statins have been found to lower LDL-C by 18% to 55%, depending on the specific statin being used. A risk exists of muscle damage (myopathy and rhabdomyolysis) with statins. Hypercholesterolemia is not a risk factor for mortality in persons older than 70 years and risks from statin drugs are more increased after age 85.. * Fibrates are indicated for hypertriglyceridemia. Fibrates typically lower triglycerides by 20% to 50%. Level of the good cholesterol HDL is also increased. Fibrates may decrease LDL, though generally to a lesser degree than statins. Similar to statins, the risk of muscle damage exists. * Niacin, like fibrates, is also well suited for lowering triglycerides by 20‚Äì50%. It may also lower LDL by 5‚Äì25% and increase HDL by 15‚Äì35%. Niacin may cause hyperglycemia and may also cause liver damage. The niacin derivative acipimox is also associated with a modest decrease in LDL. * Lecithin has been shown to effectively decrease cholesterol concentration by 33%, lower LDL by 38% and increase HDL by 46%. * Bile acid sequestrants (resins, e.g. cholestyramine) are particularly effective for lowering LDL-C by sequestering the cholesterol- containing bile acids released into the intestine and preventing their reabsorption from the intestine. It decreases LDL by 15‚Äì30% and raises HDL by 3‚Äì5%, with little effect on triglycerides, but can cause a slight increase. Bile acid sequestrants may cause gastrointestinal problems and may also reduce the absorption of other drugs and vitamins from the gut. * Ezetimibe is a selective inhibitor of dietary cholesterol absorption. * Lomitapide is a microsomal triglyceride transfer protein inhibitor. * Phytosterols may be found naturally in plants. Similar to ezetimibe, phytosterols reduce the absorption of cholesterol in the gut, so they are most effective when consumed with meals. However, their precise mechanism of action differs from ezetimibe. *Omega-3 supplements taken at high doses can reduce levels of triglycerides. They are associated with a very modest increase in LDL (~5%). * PCSK9 inhibitorsKoren MJ, Scott R, Kim JB et al Lancet 2012; 380:1995-2006Gugliano RP, Desai NR, Kohli P et al Lancet 2012; 380:2007-17 are monoclonal antibodies for refractory cases.

Some of them occur naturally in blood-eating animals such as leeches and mosquitoes, where they help keep the bite area unclotted long enough for the animal to obtain some blood. As a class of medications, anticoagulants are used in therapy for thrombotic disorders. Oral anticoagulants (OACs) are taken by many people in pill or tablet form, and various intravenous anticoagulant dosage forms are used in hospitals. Some anticoagulants are used in medical equipment, such as sample tubes, blood transfusion bags, heart-lung machines, and dialysis equipment. One of the first anticoagulants, warfarin, was initially approved as a rodenticide. Anticoagulants are closely related to antiplatelet drugs and thrombolytic drugs by manipulating the various pathways of blood coagulation. Specifically, antiplatelet drugs inhibit platelet aggregation (clumping together), whereas anticoagulants inhibit specific pathways of the coagulation cascade, which happens after the initial platelet aggregation and ultimately leads to formation of fibrin and stable aggregated platelet products. Common anticoagulants include warfarin and heparin. Medical uses The use of anticoagulants is a decision based upon the risks and benefits of anticoagulation. The biggest risk of anticoagulation therapy is the increased risk of bleeding. In otherwise healthy people, the increased risk of bleeding is minimal, but those who have had recent surgery, cerebral aneurysms, and other conditions may have too great of risk of bleeding. Generally, the benefit of anticoagulation is prevention of or reduction of progression of a thromboembolic disease. Some indications for anticoagulant therapy that are known to have benefit from therapy include: * Atrial fibrillation ‚Äî commonly forms an atrial appendage clot * Coronary artery disease * Deep vein thrombosis ‚Äî can lead to pulmonary embolism * Ischemic stroke * Hypercoagulable states (e.g., Factor V Leiden) ‚Äî can lead to deep vein thrombosis * Mechanical heart valves *Myocardial infarction * Pulmonary embolism * Restenosis from stents *Cardiopulmonary bypass (or any other surgeries requiring temporary aortic occlusion) *Heart failure In these cases, anticoagulation therapy can prevent formation of dangerous clots or prevent growth of clots. The decision to begin therapeutic anticoagulation often involves the use of multiple bleeding risk predictable outcome tools as non- invasive pre-test stratifications due to the potential for bleeds while on blood thinning agents. Among these tools are HAS-BLED, ATRIA, HEMORR2HAGES, and CHA2DS2-VASc. The risk of bleeding using the aforementioned risk assessment tools must then be weighed against thrombotic risk in order to formally determine patient's overall benefit in starting anticoagulation therapy. Adverse effects The most serious and common adverse side effect associated with anticoagulant are increased risk of bleeding, both nonmajor and major bleeding events. Risk of bleeding is dependent on the class of anticoagulant agent used, patient's age, and pre-existing health conditions. Warfarin has an estimated Incidence of bleeding of 15-20% per year and life- threatening bleeding rate of 1-3% per year. Newer non-vitamin K antagonist oral anticoagulants appear to have fewer life-threatening bleeding events compared to warfarin. Additionally, patients aged 80 years or more may be especially susceptible to bleeding complications, with a rate of 13 bleeds per 100 person-years. Bleeding risk is especially important to consider in patients with renal impairment and NOAC therapy due to the fact that all NOACs, to some extent, are excreted by the kidneys. Thus, patients with renal impairment may be at higher risk of increased bleeding. In people with cancer, a systematic review has found warfarin had no effect on death rate or the risk of blood clots. However it did increase the risk of major bleeding in 107 more people per 1000 population and minor bleeding in 167 more people in 1000 population. Apixaban had no effect on mortality, recurrence of blood clots in blood vessels or major bleeding or minor bleeding, however this finding comes only from one study. Nonhemorrhagic adverse events are less common than hemorrhagic adverse events but should still be monitored closely. Nonhemorrhagic adverse events of warfarin include skin necrosis, limb gangrene, and purple toe syndrome. Skin necrosis and limb gangrene are most commonly observed on the third to eighth day of therapy. The exact pathogenesis of skin necrosis and limb gangrene are not completely understood but are believed to be associated with warfarin's effect on inhibiting production of protein C and protein S. Purple toe syndrome typically develops three to eight weeks after initiation of warfarin therapy. Other adverse effects of warfarin are associated with depletion of vitamin K, which can lead to inhibition of G1a proteins and growth arrest-specific gene 6, which can lead to increased risk of arterial calcification and heart valve, especially if too much Vitamin D is present. Warfarin's interference of G1a proteins have also been linked to abnormalities in fetal bone development in mothers who were treated with warfarin during pregnancy. Long-term warfarin and heparin usage have also been linked to osteoporosis. Another potentially serious complication associated with heparin use is called heparin-induced thrombocytopenia (HIT). There are two distinct types of HIT 1) immune-mediated and 2) non-immune mediated. Immune-mediated HIT most commonly arises five to ten days after exposure to heparin. Pathogenesis of immune-mediated HIT is believed to be caused by heparin-dependent immunoglobulin antibodies binding to platelet factor 4/heparin complexes on platelets, leading to wide spread platelet activation.  Interactions  Foods and food supplements with blood- thinning effects include nattokinase, lumbrokinase, beer, bilberry, celery, cranberries, fish oil, garlic, ginger, ginkgo, ginseng, green tea, horse chestnut, licorice, niacin, onion, papaya, pomegranate, red clover, soybean, St. John's wort, turmeric, wheatgrass, and willow bark. Many herbal supplements have blood-thinning properties, such as danshen and feverfew. Multivitamins that do not interact with clotting are available for patients on anticoagulants. However, some foods and supplements encourage clotting. These include alfalfa, avocado, cat's claw, coenzyme Q10, and dark leafy greens such as spinach. Excessive intake of aforementioned food should be avoided whilst taking anticoagulants or, if coagulability is being monitored, their intake should be kept approximately constant so that anticoagulant dosage can be maintained at a level high enough to counteract this effect without fluctuations in coagulability. Grapefruit interferes with some anticoagulant drugs, increasing the amount of time it takes for them to be metabolized out of the body, and so should be eaten with caution when on anticoagulant drugs. Anticoagulants are often used to treat acute deep vein thrombosis. People using anticoagulants to treat this condition should avoid using bed rest as a complementary treatment because there are clinical benefits to continuing to walk and remaining mobile while using anticoagulants in this way., which cites Bed rest while using anticoagulants can harm patients in circumstances in which it is not medically necessary. Types A number of anticoagulants are available. The traditional ones (warfarin, other coumarins and heparins) are in widespread use. Since the 2000s a number of agents have been introduced that are collectively referred to as directly acting oral anticoagulants (DOACs), novel oral anticoagulants (NOACs), or non-vitamin K antagonist oral anticoagulants. These agents include direct thrombin inhibitor (dabigatran) and factor Xa inhibitor (rivaroxaban, apixaban, betrixaban and edoxaban) and they have been shown to be as good or possibly better than the coumarins with less serious side effects. The newer anticoagulants (NOACs/DOACs), are more expensive than the traditional ones and should be used with care in patients with kidney problems. =Coumarins (vitamin K antagonists)= These oral anticoagulants are derived from coumarin, which is found in many plants. A prominent member of this class is warfarin (Coumadin) and was found to be the dominant anticoagulant prescribed in a large multispecialty practice. It takes at least 48 to 72 hours for the anticoagulant effect to develop. Where an immediate effect is required, heparin must be given concomitantly. These anticoagulants are used to treat patients with deep-vein thrombosis (DVT), pulmonary embolism (PE) and to prevent emboli in patients with atrial fibrillation (AF), and mechanical prosthetic heart valves. Other examples are acenocoumarol, phenprocoumon, atromentin, and phenindione. The coumarins brodifacoum and difenacoum are used as rodenticides but are not used medically. =Heparin and derivative substances= Heparin is the most widely used intravenous clinical anticoagulant worldwide. Heparin is a naturally occurring glycosaminoglycan. There are three major categories of heparin: unfractionated heparin (UFH), low molecular weight heparin (LMWH), and ultra- low-molecular weight heparin (ULMWH). Unfractionated heparin is usually derived from pig intestines and bovine lungs. UFH binds to the enzyme inhibitor antithrombin III (AT), causing a conformational change that results in its activation. The activated AT then inactivates factor Xa, thrombin, and other coagulation factors. Heparin can be used in vivo (by injection), and also in vitro to prevent blood or plasma clotting in or on medical devices. In venipuncture, Vacutainer brand blood collecting tubes containing heparin usually have a green cap. Low molecular weight heparin (LMWH) Low molecular weight heparin (LMWH), is produced through a controlled depolymerization of unfractionated heparin. LMWH exhibits higher anti-Xa/anti- IIa activity ratio and is useful as it does not require monitoring of the APTT coagulation parameter and has fewer side effects. =Synthetic pentasaccharide inhibitors of factor Xa= * Fondaparinux is a synthetic sugar composed of the five sugars (pentasaccharide) in heparin that bind to antithrombin. It is a smaller molecule than low molecular weight heparin. * Idraparinux * Idrabiotaparinux = Directly acting oral anticoagulants = The directly acting oral anticoagulants (DOACs) were introduced on and after 2008. There are five DOACs currently on the market: dabigatran, rivaroxaban, apixaban, edoxaban and betrixaban. They were also previously referred to as \\"new/novel\\" and \\"non-vitamin K antagonist\\" oral anticoagulants (NOACs). Compared to warfarin, DOACs have a rapid onset action and relatively short half-lives; hence, they carry out their function more rapidly and effectively and allow for drugs to quickly reduce their anticoagulation effects. Routine monitoring and dose adjustments of DOACs is less important than for warfarin, as they have better predictable anticoagulation activity. Both DOACs and warfarin are equivalently effective but compared to warfarin, DOACs have fewer drug interactions, no known dietary interactions, wider therapeutic index, and have conventional dosing that do not require dose adjustments with constant monitoring. However, there is presently no countermeasure for most DOACs unlike in warfarin; nonetheless, the short half-lives of DOACs will result in its effects to swiftly recede. A reversal agent for dabigatran, idarucizumab, is currently available and approved for use by the FDA. Rates of adherence to DOACs are only modestly higher than adherence to warfarin among patients prescribed these drugs, and thus adherence to anticoagulation is universally poor, despite hopes that DOACs would lead to higher adherence rates. DOACs are a lot more expensive than warfarin, after having taken into consideration the cost of frequent blood testing associated with warfarin. Direct factor Xa inhibitors Drugs such as rivaroxaban, apixaban and edoxaban work by inhibiting factor Xa directly (unlike the heparins and fondaparinux, which work via antithrombin activation). Also betrixaban from Portola Pharmaceuticals, darexaban (YM150) from Astellas, and more recently letaxaban (TAK-442) from Takeda and eribaxaban (PD0348292) from Pfizer. Betrixaban is significant as it is the only oral factor Xa inhibitor approved by the FDA for use in acutely medically ill patients. The development of darexaban was discontinued in September 2011: in a trial for prevention of recurrences of myocardial infarction in addition to dual antiplatelet therapy (DAPT), the drug did not demonstrate effectiveness and the risk of bleeding was increased by approximately 300%. The development of letaxaban was discontinued for acute coronary syndrome in May 2011 following negative results from a Phase II study. Direct thrombin inhibitors Another type of anticoagulant is the direct thrombin inhibitor. Current members of this class include the bivalent drugs hirudin, lepirudin, and bivalirudin; and the monovalent drugs argatroban and dabigatran. An oral direct thrombin inhibitor, ximelagatran (Exanta) was denied approval by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in September 2004 and was pulled from the market entirely in February 2006 after reports of severe liver damage and heart attacks. In November 2010, dabigatran etexilate was approved by the FDA to treat atrial fibrillation.  DOAC relevance to dental treatments  As in any invasive procedures, patients on anticoagulation therapy have increased risk for bleeding and caution should be used along with local hemostasis methods to minimize bleeding risk during the operation as well as post-operatively. However, with regards to DOACs and invasive dental treatments, there has not been enough clinical evidence and experience to prove any reliable adverse-effects, relevance or interaction between these two. Further clinical prospective studies on DOACs are required to investigate the bleeding risk and haemostasis associated to surgical dental procedures. Recommendations of modifications to usage/dosage of DOACs prior to dental treatments are made based on the balance of severity of each procedure and also the individual's bleeding risks and renal functionality. With low bleeding risk of dental procedures, it is recommended that DOAC medicine still be taken by the patient as per normal, so as to avoid increase in the risk of thromboembolic event. For dental procedures with a higher risk of bleeding complications (i.e. complex extractions, adjacent extractions leading to large wound or more than three extractions), the recommended practice is for patient to miss or delay a dose of their DOAC before such procedures so as to minimize the effect on bleeding risk. =Antithrombin protein therapeutics= The antithrombin protein itself is used as a protein therapeutic that can be purified from human plasma or produced recombinantly (for example, Atryn, which is produced in the milk of genetically modified goats.) Antithrombin is approved by the FDA as an anticoagulant for the prevention of clots before, during, or after surgery or birthing in patients with hereditary antithrombin deficiency. =Other types of anticoagulants= Many other anticoagulants exist, for use in research and development, diagnostics, or as drug candidates. * Batroxobin, a toxin from a snake venom, clots platelet-rich plasma without affecting platelet functions (lyses fibrinogen). * Hementin is an anticoagulant protease from the salivary glands of the giant Amazon leech, Haementeria ghilianii. * Vitamin E Reversal agents With the growing number of patients taking oral anticoagulation therapy, studies into reversal agents are gaining increasing interest due to major bleeding events and need for urgent anticoagulant reversal therapy. Reversal agents for warfarin are more widely studied and established guidelines for reversal exist, due to longer history of use of warfarin and the ability to get a more accurate measurement of anticoagulation effect in a patient via measuring the INR (International Normalized Ratio). In general, vitamin K is most commonly used in order to reverse the effect of warfarin in non-urgent settings. However, in urgent settings, or in settings with extremely high INR (INR >20), hemostatic reversal agents such as fresh frozen plasma (FFP), recombinant factor VIIa, and prothrombin complex concentrate (PCC) have been utilized with proven efficacy. Specifically with warfarin, four factor PCC (4F-PCC) has been shown to have superior safety and mortality benefits compared to FPP in lowering INR levels. Although specific antidotes and reversal agents for DOACs are not as widely studied, idarucizumab (for dabigatran) and andexanet alfa (for factor Xa inhibitor) have been used in clinical settings with varying efficacy. Idarucizumab is a monoclonal antibody, approved by the US FDA in 2015, that reverses effect of dabigatran by binding to both free and thrombin-bound dabigatran. Andexanet alfa is a recombinant modified human factor Xa decoy that reverses the effect of factor Xa inhibitors by binding at the active sites of factor Xa inhibitor and making it catalytically inactive. Andexanet alfa was approved by US FDA in 2018. Another drug called ciraparantag, a potential reversal agent for direct factor Xa inhibitors, is still under investigation. Additionally, hemostatic reversal agents have also been used with varying efficacy to reverse effects of DOACs. Coagulation inhibitor measurement A Bethesda unit (BU) is a measure of blood coagulation inhibitor activity. It is the amount of inhibitor that will inactivate half of a coagulant during the incubation period. It is the standard measure used in the United States, and is so named because it was adopted as a standard at a conference in Bethesda, Maryland. Laboratory use Laboratory instruments, blood transfusion bags, and medical and surgical equipment will get clogged up and become non-operational if blood is allowed to clot. In addition, test tubes used for laboratory blood tests will have chemicals added to stop blood clotting. Apart from heparin, most of these chemicals work by binding calcium ions, preventing the coagulation proteins from using them. * Ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA) strongly and irreversibly chelates (binds) calcium ions, preventing blood from clotting. * Citrate is in liquid form in the tube and is used for coagulation tests, as well as in blood transfusion bags. It binds the calcium, but not as strongly as EDTA. Correct proportion of this anticoagulant to blood is crucial because of the dilution, and it can be reversed with the addition of calcium. It can be in the form of sodium citrate or acid-citrate-dextrose. * Oxalate has a mechanism similar to that of citrate. It is the anticoagulant used in fluoride oxalate tubes used to determine glucose and lactate levels.  Dental considerations for people on long term anticoagulants  Dental practitioners play an important role in the early detection of anticoagulant overdose through oral manifestations as the patient doesn't show any symptoms. Dental treatment of patients taking anticoagulant or antiplatelet medication raises safety concerns in terms of the potential risk of bleeding complications following invasive dental procedures. Therefore, there comes the need for certain guidelines for the dental care of patients taking these drugs. Detection of an overdose of anticoagulants An overdose in anticoagulants usually occurs in people who have heart problems and need to take anticoagulants in a long term, in order to reduce the risk of stroke from their high blood pressure. An International Normalised Ratio (INR) test would be recommended, to confirm the overdose so that the dosage can be adjusted to an acceptable standard. The INR test measures the time taken for a clot to form in a blood sample, relative to a standard. An INR value of 1 indicates a level of coagulation equivalent to that of an average patient not taking warfarin and values greater than 1 indicate a longer clotting time and thus a longer bleeding time. Assessing bleeding risk There are 2 main parts to the assessment of bleeding risk: * Assessment of the likely risk of bleeding associated with the required dental procedure * Assessment of the patient's individual level bleeding risk General advice for managing bleeding risk in dental setting A patient who is on anticoagulants or antiplatelet medications may undergo dental treatments which are unlikely to cause bleeding such as local anaesthesia injection, basic gum charting, removal of plaque, calculus and stain above the gum level, direct or indirect fillings which are above the gingiva, root canal treatment, taking impression for denture or crown and fitting or adjustment of orthodontic appliances. For all these procedures, it is recommended for the dentist to treat the patient following the normal standard procedure and taking care to avoid any bleeding. For a patient who needs to undergo dental treatments which is more likely to cause bleeding such as simple tooth extractions (1-3 teeth with small wound size), drainage of swelling inside the mouth, periodontal charting, root planing, direct or indirect filling which extends below the gingiva, complex filling, flap raising procedure, gingival recontouring and biopsies, the dentist needs to take extra precautions apart from the standard procedure. The recommendations are as follows: * if the patient has another medical condition or taking other medication that may increase bleeding risk, consult the patient's general medical practitioner or specialist * if the patient is on a short course anticoagulant or antiplatelet therapy, delay non- urgent, invasive procedure, until the medication has been discontinued * plan treatment for early in the day and week, where possible, to allow time for the management of prolonged bleeding or re-bleeding, if it occurs * perform the procedure as atraumatically as possible, use appropriate local measures and only discharge patient once haemostasis has been confirmed * if travel time to emergency care is a concern, place particular emphasis at the time of the initial treatment on the use of measures to avoid complications * advise the patient to take paracetamol, unless contraindicated, for pain relief rather than NSAIDs such as aspirin, ibuprofen, diclofenac or naproxen * provide the patient with written post-treatment advice and emergency contact details * follow the specific recommendations and advice given for the management of patients taking the different anticoagulants or antiplatelet drugs There is general agreement that in most cases, treatment regimens with older anticoagulants (e.g., warfarin) and antiplatelet agents (e.g., clopidogrel, ticlopidine, prasugrel, ticagrelor, and/or aspirin) should not be altered before dental procedures. The risks of stopping or reducing these medication regimens (i.e., thromboembolism, stroke, myocardial infarction) far outweigh the consequences of prolonged bleeding, which can be controlled with local measures. In patients with other existing medical conditions that can increase the risk of prolonged bleeding after dental treatment or who are receiving other therapy that can increase bleeding risk, dental practitioners may wish to consult the patient's physician to determine whether care can safely be delivered in a primary care office. Any suggested modification to the medication regimen prior to dental surgery should be done in consultation and on advice of the patient's physician. On the basis of limited evidence, general consensus appears to be that in most patients who are receiving the newer direct-acting oral anticoagulants (i.e., dabigatran, rivaroxaban, apixaban, or edoxaban) and undergoing dental treatment (in conjunction with usual local measures to control bleeding), no change to the anticoagulant regimen is required. In patients deemed to be at higher risk of bleeding (e.g., patients with other medical conditions or undergoing more extensive procedures associated with higher bleeding risk), consideration may be given, in consultation with and on advice of the patient's physician, to postponing the timing of the daily dose of the anticoagulant until after the procedure; timing the dental intervention as late as possible after last dose of anticoagulant; or temporarily interrupting drug therapy for 24 to 48 hours.

The novel was adapted into a 1985 New Zealand science fiction film of the same name directed by Geoff Murphy. The 2013 Penguin edition includes an introduction by Bernard Beckett. Plot summary =Alone= John Hobson, a geneticist involved in a project concerned with manipulating DNA, awakes in his hotel room in Thames, New Zealand, after a nightmare of falling from a great height. His wristwatch has stopped at 6:12. Upon getting up he finds the electricity off. It is quiet outside, with nobody in sight. Hobson checks the time in his car, finding the vehicle's clock is also frozen at 6:12. The town's shops are locked and unattended, with no sign of people. Investigating a car sitting at an intersection, Hobson sees that the driver's seatbelt is still fastened. Telephones are dead and there is only static on the radio. All humans and animals have disappeared. No watch or clock shows anything other than 6:12. Hobson concludes that some force has altered the clocks to show the same time and then stopped them, suggesting an intelligence behind the event, which Hobson dubs \\"the Effect\\". A garden yields the first sign of life Hobson has found ‚Äì a worm dug up from the soil. The garden is otherwise devoid of fauna. Hobson wonders if he has gone mad, but dismisses the idea. During the night, Hobson hears sounds from outside approaching. Hobson wills the entity to leave, and the sounds retreat. Uncertainty as to whether the presence was there, or whether it may have been a stray animal spared from the Effect competes in his mind with speculations that the intruder could be a manifestation of the Effect. Hobson reassures himself that he can keep the entity at bay with mental effort. The next morning Hobson procures weapons and supplies, and leaves for Auckland, finding the city deserted. Hobson seems to be the only human being remaining. He wonders what rendered him immune to the Effect. Hobson hurries to an apparent smoke signal coming from the North Shore, only to find suburban homes destroyed by the impact of a jetliner. The plane was empty when it crashed. Hobson travels to the research unit, where he worked to reactivate dormant genes in humans and animals using high-frequency sound waves and radiation. The unit's head, Perrin, believed that awakening the dormant genes would lead to a quantum leap in evolution. Hobson finds Perrin in a radiation chamber, dead at the controls of the sound wave machine. The machine appears to have short-circuited, but there is no evidence indicating how Perrin died. Hobson decides he perished before the Effect ‚Äì as dead animal tissue did not vanish. Hobson retrieves Perrin's papers, then begins journeying to Wellington, hoping to find survivors or clues as to what happened. En route to Rotorua, Hobson sees a creature in his headlights. The monster is some kind of hybrid of dog and calf. Hobson drives off terror- stricken, unsure as to whether the apparition was really there. At Rotorua, after realising everyone else is dead, Hobson almost commits suicide. When he comes across live fish in a stream, Hobson concludes that the Effect did not penetrate water. He is startled when an electronic howling noise booms out across Lake Taupo from the far side. Hobson reaches an area of bushland near Turangi, his path blocked by a truck. Back-tracking, he finds the alternate route also cut off. Trying to work around the stalled vehicle, he is confronted by another survivor with a rifle. =Api= The gunman is Apirana Maketu, a MƒÅori and a lance-corporal in the New Zealand Army. \\"Api\\" woke up at his barracks in Waiouru to find the base deserted. He remained at his post for two days before setting out to find survivors. A search of Gisborne and the East Coast yielded nothing, and a visit to the power station at Tokaanu led him to believe the electrical grid was knocked out by a massive surge. Api heard the same sound that Hobson heard ‚Äì albeit earlier in the day and coming from the side of the lake that Hobson was standing on. Believing it to be a car, Api laid the roadblock to catch anyone coming south. Api reveals his belief that something hostile is loose in the land. It is present only in certain places, and is stronger at night. The soldier is both relieved and worried to find that Hobson has experienced the same dread. The two men seem to already know one other, sharing a flash of recognition upon first meeting. Neither can account for this, as they have never encountered each other before. They arrive at the nation's capital to find it devoid of life. Api and Hobson set up dwellings in a hotel and hunt for survivors. Hobson plans to run tests to see if he can determine the nature of the Effect and the reason why he and Api survived. Api assists Hobson with procuring equipment for the scientist's studies. A radio transceiver is set up, and the duo transmit words and Morse code across the world. They receive no response. Hobson's investigations reveal no reason for their exemption from the Effect. The men face the prospect that they are alone. Api goes skin-diving for shellfish ‚Äì he pretends to drown as a joke, and Hobson reacts unconsciously by holding the other man's head underwater. There is a moment of hostility when Api breaks free, resolved when Hobson explains that his son, who was autistic, drowned in a bathtub, and Hobson felt Api was making fun of this. The death of the child led to the end of Hobson's marriage. Both men realise that Hobson is not in complete control of his actions. Visiting the Beehive, Api speculates that they could be lab rats on some kind of duplicate Earth; it is they who disappeared. Hobson puts no stock in this theory. Three weeks after the Effect, Hobson is left alone while Api goes to get a new car. Hobson goes into Api's bedroom and finds photographs of Api as a private during the Vietnam War, posing with the mutilated corpses of Viet Cong. Hobson believes that Api is a psychopath. =The End Is The Beginning= Hobson feels helpless to prevent his relationship with Api from deteriorating further and plans to kill Api with sleeping pills. After searching for a boat to take them to the South Island, during which both men experience an attack of dread from the \\"force\\" hounding them, Api takes Hobson for a joyride in his Lotus Elite. A woman runs into the car's path. She is taken to the hotel and made comfortable, but neither Api nor Hobson are medically trained. Unless she is less badly hurt than she seems, she will die. The men bicker pointlessly. The woman's condition worsens, and there is nothing her fellow survivors can do for her. Hobson senses the unseen force again, emanating from the empty city. He speculates that the force may have always been a part of the land, and is claiming the Earth. Api studies the Bible, and later wakes Hobson to tell him that he has solved the clock enigma. 6:12 relates to the Number of the Beast, 666 (6‚Äì12 = 6 and 6 plus 6) and to Revelation 6:12, with the Biblical chapter's talk of men hiding from the face of God. Hobson does not believe this, and holds a hidden gun on the deranged soldier. The woman dies, sending Api into hysterics. After another argument, a full-scale battle with guns and grenades ensues. Hobson kills Api, with the soldier seeming to give up. The scientist is now alone. Breaking open Perrin's box, Hobson realises his colleagues considered him unbalanced and kept him under surveillance. Perrin believed that Hobson's DNA was altered due to radiation, which caused his child's autism. Hobson believes the Effect was his doing. The project he worked on caused the unravelling of animal DNA; only those with the dormant gene pair were spared. Flashbacks detail Hobson's last days at the research unit. Perrin seizes upon an accident with the sound wave/radiation machine in which Hobson set the sound modulator too high and was blasted out of his chair by an invisible energy wave. Perrin charges Hobson with negligence, as the sample slides for insects and animals in the machine are blank, while the ones for plants are normal. This event cements for Hobson his long-growing misgivings about the experiments, and what he believes are Perrin's motives for pursuing them. In a later flashback, Hobson relates how he sabotaged the sound wave machine before going on leave to output a much higher level of infrasound than the controls would register. The idea was to put the machine out of action temporarily, ruining Perrin's chance to use Hobson's theories. Hobson took what he believed to be a fatal dose of sleeping pills on the night before the Effect. As he reads Perrin's notes, Hobson realises that this sabotage almost certainly caused the Effect. His act always had a different purpose ‚Äì to kill Perrin. Believing his boss insane and consumed with a desire to play God, Hobson subconsciously altered his own memory to hide this fact from himself. This ability to edit his own recollections, and to take refuge in a kind of mental \\"super-reality\\", is purely automatic. Hobson finally accepts the guilt for letting his son drown. Allowing his child to die was his way of destroying himself, a kind of external suicide. The child's autism mirrored his father's own emptiness. Perhaps Hobson caused the Effect, or is dreaming all this in a barbiturate coma, or is in Hell or Purgatory. Perhaps the rest of humanity evolved, or is unchanged and wondering where Hobson and a handful of others have gone to. With the death of the entire race on his hands, Hobson jumps from the hotel. He gathers speed, then wakes up in his motel room in Thames. Recovering from the nightmare of falling, all he can remember of the dream he was ripped from, he notices that his wrist watch has stopped at 6:12.

His early work was influenced by the Amsterdam Impressionism movement. Biography Johannes Theodorus Toorop was born on 20 December 1858 in Purworejo on the island of Java in the Dutch East Indies (present-day Indonesia). His father was Christoffel Theodorus Toorop, a civil servant, and his mother was Maria Magdalena Cooke. B. H.

He was the third of five children and lived on the island of Bangka near Sumatra until he was nine years old. Johannes (Jan) Theodoor Toorop, Biografisch Woordenboek Gelderland, 2004. Retrieved on 18 February 2015. He was then sent to school in Batavia on Java. In 1869 he left Indonesia for the Netherlands, where he studied in Delft and Amsterdam. In 1880 he became a student at the Rijksakademie in Amsterdam. From 1882 to 1886 he lived in Brussels where he joined Les XX (Les Vingts), a group of artists centred on James Ensor. Toorop worked in various styles during these years, such as Realism, Impressionism Neo-Impressionism and Post- Impressionism. Lady in white (1886) of his wife Annie Hall After his marriage to an Annie Hall, a British woman, in 1886, Toorop alternated his time between The Hague, England and Brussels, and after 1890 also the Dutch seaside town of Katwijk aan Zee. During this period he developed his unique Symbolist style, with dynamic, unpredictable lines based on Javanese motifs, highly stylised willowy figures, and curvilinear designs. Jan Toorop in Amsterdam in 1892 In the late 19th century (in 1897) Toorop lived for 20 years in a small house on the market in the seaside town Domburg, Walcheren, Zeeland. He worked with a group of fellow artists, including Marinus Zwart and Piet Mondrian. There was no joint endeavor or common style among them. Each followed his individual personality, but they sought their inspiration in \\"the Zeeland Light\\", in the dunes, forests, beaches and the characteristic Zeeland population. Toorop was the center of this group. His 1900 novel portrait of his friend Marie Jeanette de Lange was made whilst she was not wearing fashionable (restrictive) clothing and it was in the style of Pointillism. Thereafter he turned to Art Nouveau styles, in which a similar play of lines is used for decorative purposes, without any apparent symbolic meaning. In 1905, he converted to Catholicism and began producing religious works. He also created book illustrations, posters, and stained glass designs. Throughout his life Toorop also produced portraits, in sketch format and as paintings, which range in style from highly realistic to impressionistic. Toorop died on 3 March 1928 in The Hague in the Netherlands. His daughter Charley Toorop (1891‚Äì1955) was also a painter, as was his grandson Edgar Fernhout.

It is a part of the Mount Graham International Observatory. When using both 8.4 m (330 inch) wide mirrors, with centres 14.4 m apart, the LBT has the same light-gathering ability as a 11.8 m (464 inch) wide single circular telescope and the resolution of a 22.8 m (897 inch) wide one. The LBT mirrors individually are the joint second-largest optical telescope in continental North America, next to the Hobby‚ÄìEberly Telescope in West Texas. It has the largest monolithic, or in an optical telescope. Strehl ratios of 60‚Äì90% in the infrared H band and 95% in the infrared M band have been achieved by the LBT.  Project  The LBT was originally named the \\"Columbus Project\\". It is a joint project of these members: the Italian astronomical community represented by the Istituto Nazionale di Astrofisica, the University of Arizona, University of Minnesota, University of Notre Dame, University of Virginia, the LBT Beteiligungsgesellschaft in Germany (Max Planck Institute for Astronomy in Heidelberg, Landessternwarte in Heidelberg, Leibniz Institute for Astrophysics Potsdam (AIP), Max Planck Institute for Extraterrestrial Physics in Munich and Max Planck Institute for Radio Astronomy in Bonn); The Ohio State University; and the Research Corporation for Science Advancement based in Tucson, AZ. The cost was around 100 million Euro. The telescope design has two 8.4 m (330 inch) mirrors mounted on a common base, hence the name \\"binocular\\". LBT takes advantage of active and adaptive optics, provided by Arcetri Observatory. The collecting area is two 8.4 meter aperture mirrors, which works out to about 111 m2 combined. This area is equivalent to an circular aperture, which would be greater than any other single telescope, but it is not comparable in many respects since the light is collected at a lower diffraction limit and is not combined in the same way. Also, an interferometric mode will be available, with a maximum baseline of for aperture synthesis imaging observations and a baseline of for nulling interferometry. This feature is along one axis with the LBTI instrument at wavelengths of 2.9‚Äì13 micrometres, which is the near infrared. The telescope was designed by a group of Italian firms, and assembled by Ansaldo in its Milanese plant. = Mountain controversy = LBT perched on an Arizona mountain The choice of location sparked considerable local controversy, both from the San Carlos Apache Tribe, who view the mountain as sacred, and from environmentalists who contended that the observatory would cause the demise of an endangered subspecies of the American red squirrel, the Mount Graham red squirrel. Environmentalists and members of the tribe filed some forty lawsuits ‚Äì eight of which ended up before a federal appeals court ‚Äì but the project ultimately prevailed after an act of the United States Congress. The telescope and mountain observatory survived two major forest fires in thirteen years, the more recent in the summer of 2017. Likewise the squirrels continue to survive. Some experts now believe their numbers fluctuate dependent upon nut harvest without regard to the observatory.  First light  Dome during the day with doors closed The telescope was dedicated in October 2004 and saw first light with a single primary mirror on October 12, 2005 which viewed NGC 891. The second primary mirror was installed in January 2006 and became fully operational in January 2008. The first light with the second primary mirror was on September 18, 2006, and for the first and second together it was on January 11‚Äì12, 2008. The first binocular light images show three false-color renditions of the spiral galaxy NGC 2770. The galaxy is 88 million light years from our Milky Way, a relatively close neighbor. The galaxy has a flat disk of stars and glowing gas tipped slightly toward our line of sight. The first image taken combined ultraviolet and green light, and emphasizes the clumpy regions of newly formed hot stars in the spiral arms. The second image combined two deep red colors to highlight the smoother distribution of older, cooler stars. The third image was a composite of ultraviolet, green and deep red light and shows the detailed structure of hot, moderate and cool stars in the galaxy. The cameras and images were produced by the Large Binocular Camera team, led by Emanuele Giallongo at the Rome Astrophysical Observatory. In binocular aperture synthesis mode LBT has a light-collecting area of 111 m2, equivalent to a single primary mirror in diameter, and will combine light to produce the image sharpness equivalent to a single telescope. However, this requires a beam combiner that was tested in 2008, but has not been a part of regular operations. It can take images with one side at 8.4 m aperture, or take two images of the same object using different instruments on each side of the telescope. Adaptive optics Interior looking down one of the primary mirrors In the summer of 2010, the \\"First Light Adaptive Optics\\" (FLAO) ‚Äì an adaptive optics system with a deformable secondary mirror rather than correcting atmospheric distortion further downstream in the optics ‚Äì was inaugurated. Using one 8.4 m side, it surpassed Hubble sharpness (at certain light wavelengths), achieving a Strehl ratio of 60‚Äì80% rather than the 20‚Äì30% of older adaptive optic systems, or the 1% typically achieved without adaptive optics for telescopes of this size. Adaptive optics at a telescope's secondary (M2) was previously tested at MMT Observatory by the Arcetri Observatory and University of Arizona team.  In the media  The telescope has also made appearances on an episode of the Discovery Channel TV show Really Big Things, National Geographic Channel Big, Bigger, Biggest, and the BBC program The Sky At Night. The BBC Radio 4 radio documentary The New Galileos covered the LBT and the JWST.  Discoveries and observations LBT, with the XMM-Newton, was used to discover the galaxy cluster 2XMM J083026+524133 in 2008, over 7 billion light years away from Earth. In 2007 the LBT detected a 26th magnitude afterglow from the gamma ray burst GRB 070125. In 2017, LBT observed the OSIRIS-REx spacecraft, an unmanned asteroid sample return spacecraft, in space while it was en route. Instruments Computer systems for LBT Computer workstation for LBT Some current or planned LBT telescope instruments: *LBC ‚Äì optical and near ultraviolet wide field prime focus cameras. One is optimized for the blue part of the optical spectrum and one for the red. (Both cameras operational) *PEPSI ‚Äì A high resolution and very high-resolution optical spectrograph and imaging polarimeter at the combined focus. (In development) *MODS ‚Äì two optical multi object and longslit spectrographs plus imagers. Capable of running in a single mirror or binocular mode. (MODS1 operational ‚Äì MODS2 in integration on the mountain) *LUCI ‚Äì two multi-object and longslit infrared spectrographs plus imagers, one for each side (associated with one of the 8m mirrors) of the telescope. The imager has 2 cameras and can observe in both seeing-limited and diffraction-limited (with adaptive optics) modes. End of commissioning and hand over to the LBTO was in 2018. *LINC/Nirvana ‚Äì wide- field interferometric imaging with adaptive optics at the combined focus (in commissioning). *LBTI/LMIRCAM ‚Äì 2.9 to 5.2 micron Fizeau imaging and medium resolution grism spectroscopy at the combined focus. *LBTI/NOMIC ‚Äì N band nulling imager for the study of protoplanetary and debris disks at the combined focus. (In commissioning phase ‚Äì first stabilization of the fringes in Dec 2013) *FLAO ‚Äì first light adaptive optics to correct atmospheric distortion * ARGOS ‚Äì multiple laser guide star unit capable of supporting ground layer or multi conjugate adaptive optics. End of commissioning and handover to LBTO was in 2018. =LUCI= LUCI (originally LUCIFER: Large Binocular Telescope Near-infrared Spectroscopic Utility with Camera and Integral Field Unit for Extragalactic Research) is the near-infrared instrument for the LBT. The name of the instrument was changed to LUCI in 2012. LUCI operates in the 0.9‚Äì2.5 ¬µm spectral range using a 2048 x 2048 element Hawaii-2RG detector array from Teledyne and provides imaging and spectroscopic capabilities in seeing- and diffraction-limited modes. In its focal plane area, long-slit and multi-slit masks can be installed for single- object and multi-object spectroscopy. A fixed collimator produces an image of the entrance aperture in which either a mirror (for imaging) or a grating can be positioned. Three camera optics with numerical apertures of 1.8, 3.75 and 30 provide image scales of 0.25, 0.12, and 0.015 arcsec/detector element for wide field, seeing-limited and diffraction-limited observations. LUCI is operated at cryogenic temperatures, and is therefore enclosed in a cryostat of 1.6 m diameter and 1.6 m height, and cooled down to about ‚àí200 ¬∞C by two closed-cycle coolers.

In their 1945 statement Dialectique de la Dialectique, Romanian surrealists Gherashim Luca and Dolfi Trost wrote, :We have returned to the problem of knowledge through images... by establishing a clear distinction between images produced by artistic means and images resulting from rigorously applied scientific procedures, such as the operation of chance or of automatism. We stand opposed to the tendency to reproduce, through symbols, certain valid theoretical contents by the use of pictorial techniques, and believe that the unknown that surrounds us can find a staggering materialization of the highest order in indecipherable images. In generally accepting until now pictorial reproductive means, surrealist painting will find that the way to its blossoming lies in the absurd use of aplastic, objective and entirely non-artistic procedures. The name surautomatism suggests \\"going beyond\\" automatism, but whether surautomatism is anything but a group of methods by which surrealist automatism is practiced is controversial.

He is sometimes known as \\"the father of German rationalism\\". Youth and education He was born at Saalfeld in the Electorate of Saxony, the son of a poor clergyman. He grew up in pietistic surroundings, which powerfully influenced him his life through, though he never became a Pietist. In his seventeenth year he entered the University of Halle, where he became the disciple, afterwards the assistant, and finally the literary executor of the orthodox rationalistic professor S. J. Baumgarten. He also wrote Latin poems. In 1749 he accepted the position of editor, with the title of professor, of the Coburg official Gazette. But in 1751 he was invited to the University of Altdorf as professor of philology and history, and in 1752 he became a professor of theology at Halle. Early work After the death of Baumgarten in 1757, Semler became head of the theological faculty, and the fierce opposition provoked by his writings and lectures only helped increase his fame as a professor. His popularity continued undiminished until 1779. In that year he produced a reply (Beantwortung der Fragmente eines Ungenannten) to the Wolfenbuttel Fragments (see Reimarus) and to KF Bahrdt's confession of faith, a step which was interpreted by the extreme rationalists as a revocation of his own rationalistic position. Later work and impact =Contemporary perception= Even the Prussian government, which favoured Bahrdt, made known its displeasure at this new but quite consistent aspect of his position. But, though Semler was not inconsistent with himself in attacking the views of Reimarus and Bahrdt, his popularity began to decline, and towards the end of his life he felt a need to emphasize the apologetic and conservative value of true historical inquiry. His defence of the notorious edict of July 9, 1788, issued by the Prussian minister for ecclesiastical affairs, Johann Christoph von W√∂llner, the object of which was to enforce Lutheran orthodoxy, might be cited as a sign of the decline of his powers and of an unfaithfulness to his principles. He died at Halle, Magdeburg, exhausted and disappointed. =Classification= The importance of Semler, sometimes called \\"the father of German rationalism\\", in the history of theology and the human mind is that of a critic of biblical and ecclesiastical documents and of the history of dogmas. He was not a philosophical thinker or theologian, though he insisted, with an energy and persistency before unknown, on certain distinctions of great importance when properly worked out and applied, e.g. the distinction between religion and theology, that between private personal beliefs and public historical creeds, and that between the local and temporal and the permanent elements of historical religion. His great work was that of the critic. He was the first to reject the equal value of the Old and New Testaments, the uniform authority of all parts of the Bible, the divine authority of the traditional canon of Scripture, the inspiration and supposed correctness of the text of the Old and New Testaments, and, generally, the identification of revelation with Scripture. Though to some extent anticipated by the British deist, Thomas Morgan, Semler was the first to take due note of and use for critical purposes the opposition between the Judaic and anti- Judaic parties of the early church. He led the way in the task of discovering the origin of the Gospels, the Epistles, the Acts of the Apostles, and the Apocalypse. He revived previous doubts as to the direct Pauline origin of the Epistle to the Hebrews, called in question Peter's authorship of the first epistle, and referred the second epistle to the end of the 2nd century. He wished to remove the Apocalypse altogether from the canon. In textual criticism Semler pursued further the principle of classifying manuscripts in families, adopted by Richard Simon and Johann Albrecht Bengel. In church history Semler did the work of a pioneer in many periods and in several departments. Friedrich Tholuck pronounced him \\"the father of the history of doctrines,\\" and Ferdinand Christian Baur \\"the first to deal with that history from the true critical standpoint.\\" At the same time, it is admitted by all that he was nowhere more than a pioneer. His concept of church has been contrasted with Friedrich Schleiermacher's.Rendtorff, Trutz. Church and Theology: The Systematic Function of the Church Concept in Modern Theology, Westminster Press, 1971, . Bibliography Tholuck gives 171 as the number of Semler's works, of which only two reached a second edition.

This is often not the first viewing using the telescope; optical tests will probably have been performed in daylight to adjust the components. Characteristics The first light image is normally of little scientific interest and is of poor quality, since the various telescope elements are yet to be adjusted for optimum efficiency. Despite this, a first light is always a moment of great excitement, both for the people who design and build the telescope and for the astronomical community, who may have anticipated the moment for many years while the telescope was under construction. A well-known and spectacular astronomical object is usually chosen as a subject. Historical examples The famous Hale Telescope of Palomar Observatory saw first light on 26 January 1949, targeting NGC 2261 under the direction of American astronomer Edwin Powell Hubble. The image was published in many magazines and is available on Caltech Archives. The Isaac Newton Telescope had two first lights: one in England in 1965 with its original mirror, and another in 1984 at La Palma island.http://www.ing.iac.es/PR/chronology.html The second first light was done with a video camera that showed the Crab Pulsar flashing. Elation at first light images by the Hubble Space Telescope in 1990 soon gave way to initial disappointment when a flaw prevented adjustments for proper operation. The expected first light image quality was finally achieved after a servicing mission in 1993. The Large Binocular Telescope had its first light with a single primary mirror on 12 October 2005, which was a view of NGC 891.http://medusa.as.arizona.edu/lbto/first_light.htm The second primary mirror was installed in January 2006 and became fully operational in January 2008. The Gran Telescopio Canarias had a first light image of Tycho 1205081 on 14 July 2007. The IRIS solar space observatory achieved first light on 17 July 2013.

Entertainment division of Time Warner and the Tribune Broadcasting subsidiary of the Tribune Company, with the former acting as controlling partner. The network principally aired programs targeting teenagers and young adults between the ages of 12 and 34, with its Children's Division, Kids' WB, geared toward children ages 6 to 12. The common metonym of the network called \\"The Frog\\", referring to a former mascot Michigan J. Frog. On January 24, 2006, CBS Corporation and Warner Bros. Entertainment announced plans to shut down the network and launch The CW later that same year. The WB Television Network shut down on September 17, 2006, with select programs from both it and competitor UPN (which had shut down two days earlier) moving to The CW when it launched the following day, September 18. Time Warner re-used The WB brand for an online network that launched on April 28, 2008, over 19 months after The WB ceased broadcasting operations. Until it was discontinued in December 2013, the website allowed users to watch shows aired on the former television network, as well as original programming and shows formerly hosted on the now- defunct In2TV service (which itself was created prior to Time Warner's spinoff of AOL). The website could only be accessed within the United States. History =1993‚Äì1995: Origins= Much like its competitor UPN, The WB was summoned in reaction primarily to the Federal Communications Commission (FCC)'s then-recent deregulation of media ownership rules that repealed the Financial Interest and Syndication Rules, and partly due to the success of the Fox network (which debuted in October 1986, nine years before The WB launched) and first-run syndicated programming during the late 1980s and early 1990s (such as Baywatch, Star Trek: The Next Generation, and War of the Worlds), as well as the erosion in ratings suffered by independent television stations due to the growth of cable television and movie rentals. The network can also trace its beginnings to the Prime Time Entertainment Network (PTEN), a programming service operated as a joint venture between Time Warner and the Chris-Craft Industries group of stations, and launched in January 1993. On November 2, 1993, the Warner Bros. division of Time Warner announced the formation of The WB Television Network, with the Tribune Company holding a minority interest; as such, Tribune Broadcasting signed agreements to affiliate six of its seven television stations at the time ‚Äì all of which were independent stations, including the television group's two largest stations, WPIX in New York City and KTLA in Los Angeles ‚Äì with the network. Only five of these stations ‚Äì along with a sixth that Tribune acquired the following year ‚Äì would join The WB at launch (the company's Atlanta independent WGNX would instead agree to affiliate with CBS in September 1994, as a result of Fox's affiliation deal with New World Communications, then-owner of longtime CBS station WAGA-TV; in contrast, New Orleans sister station WGNO did become a WB charter affiliate before joining ABC in January 1996 due to a similar affiliation deal between Fox and longtime ABC station WVUE-TV). On December 3, 1993, The WB announced a separate affiliation agreement with Tribune for its Chicago flagship station WGN-TV (which originally planned to remain an independent station due to concerns about handling its sports programming commitments while maintaining a network affiliation); through this deal, WGN's superstation feed would provide additional national distribution for The WB as a cable-only affiliate, in order to give the network time to fill gaps in markets where it was unable to find an affiliate at launch. Although Tribune had a minority stake in the network, its stations were not technically considered owned-and-operated stations of The WB since Time Warner held controlling interest in the network's ownership. When the network was announced, The WB planned to run a predominately network programmed schedule over time. It was originally slated to launch with two nights of primetime programming in its first year, and two additional nights of primetime programming, a nightly half-hour in late primetime, 4¬Ω hours of weekday daytime programming and a four-hour Saturday morning children's lineup in its second year. By the third year, a fifth night of primetime and 1¬Ω hours of weekday programming outside of primetime would have been added, followed by an additional hour of programming in primetime and 1¬Ω hours on weekday afternoons by the network's fourth year, and a seventh night of primetime in the fifth year of operation. However, this plan was scaled back dramatically, as The WB launched with only one night of primetime programming; and by September 1995, the network added only one additional night (Sundays), along with a three (Later 4 then 5)-hour Saturday morning, one-hour weekday morning and two-hour weekday afternoon children's block. Warner Bros. appointed many former Fox executives to run the network, including the network's original chief executive Jamie Kellner, who served as president of Fox from 1986 to 1993; and president of programming Garth Ancier, who was the programming chief of Fox from 1986 to 1989. =1995‚Äì1997: Beginnings= The WB Television Network premiered on January 11, 1995, with the inaugural episode of The Wayans Bros. (a sitcom starring comedians Shawn and Marlon Wayans) as its first program. The classic Warner Bros. cartoon character Michigan J. Frog appeared on-air as the network's official mascot (with animator Chuck Jones, in person, drawing him out after Bugs Bunny and Daffy Duck argued about who should launch The WB during the network's premiere), and would remain as part of the network's branding in one form or another until 2005. WB affiliates introduced their station ID where the WB letters being projected on the Warner Bros. studio lot while moving, then, the WB letters light up before turning off and the logo for the station affiliated with the network zooms out shortly thereafter accompanied by an orchestral version of \\"Hello Ma Baby\\". Much of the network's branding was based around Warner Bros. locations and characters: the television network's original logo (which was originally displayed upright until 1998, and displayed at a titled angle thereafter) was based on the typography of the iconic Warner Bros. Pictures' \\"shield\\" logo; network promotions and imaging campaigns for The WB and the Kids' WB block from their launches until the 2003‚Äì2004 season were also centered on the Warner Bros. Studios backlot, often involving large neon signs promoting the nights of programming and their component shows (at times including signs for Kids' WB and certain shows from that block); this approach was similar to one used for Fox's 1989-90 \\"This is the Year\\" fall campaign (likely thanks to Kellner and Ancier previously having worked at Fox). The WB's scheduling structure was similar to Fox's when it launched, as it started with one night a week of programming and then gradually added additional nights of programming over the course of several seasons: the network started with a two-hour Wednesday night lineup of sitcoms, airing from 8:00 to 10:00 p.m. Eastern and Pacific Time. The limited amount of network programming in The WB's early years essentially rendered its affiliates as nominal independent stations; because of this, affiliates held the responsibility of programming primetime slots on nights that the network did not program, airing either first-run and/or off-network syndicated programs or more commonly, movies. The network's first programs were mostly sitcoms targeted at an ethnically black audience. Even though four of the five shows that debuted in the network's first nine months were renewed beyond the first year ‚Äì The Wayans Bros., Unhappily Ever After (a dysfunctional family sitcom from Married... with Children co-creator Ron Leavitt), The Parent 'Hood (a family sitcom starring and co-created by Robert Townsend), and Sister, Sister (a teen/blended family sitcom starring Tia and Tamera Mowry that was picked up by the network after its cancellation by ABC in the spring of 1995) ‚Äì none of them made a significant impact. On August 17, 1995, the Tribune Company acquired a 12.5% limited partnership interest in The WB for $12 million; the deal gave Tribune an option to increase its stake in the network up to a 25% interest; Tribune would eventually increase its ownership share in The WB to 22.5% on March 31, 1997. The WB expanded its programming to Sunday nights for the 1995‚Äì96 season, but none of the new shows (including the Kirk Cameron vehicle Kirk and night-time soap opera Savannah) managed to garner much viewing interest. The network also launched the Kids' WB programming block in September 1995, which featured a mix of existing Warner Bros. animated series that originated either on Fox Kids or in syndication and originally aired on Monday through Saturday mornings. The WB continued to expand in the 1996‚Äì97 season, adding programming on Monday nights. This season gave The WB modest hits in the Aaron Spelling-produced family drama 7th Heaven (centering on a reverend and his family) and comedies The Steve Harvey Show (starring Harvey as a funk musician working as a music teacher at an inner-city Chicago high school), and The Jamie Foxx Show (starring Foxx as an aspiring actor/singer working at a Los Angeles hotel owned by his aunt and uncle). =1997‚Äì2000: Courting the teen market= The WB first began to experience success with Buffy the Vampire Slayer (a series based on the 1992 film of the same name) which became a hit with critics when it premiered as a mid-season replacement in March 1997. The series was produced by 20th Century Fox Television and it debuted with the highest Monday night ratings in the network's history, attracting not only new teenage viewers, but new advertisers as well. Inspired by Buffys success, The WB intentionally shifted the focus of its programming, trying to capture what it perceived to be a heavily fragmented market by marketing to the under-courted teen demographic. While the Fox network, the previous destination for teen television (with shows such as Beverly Hills, 90210, Party of Five and Parker Lewis Can't Lose), began to court older audiences with shows such as Ally McBeal, The WB began to craft its identity with programs targeted at teenagers. The network's breakout hit and, arguably, its signature series was Dawson's Creek, which debuted in January 1998 to what were then the highest ratings in the network's history (and made stars out of its four principal actors, James Van Der Beek, Michelle Williams, Joshua Jackson, and Katie Holmes). The series was produced by Columbia TriStar Television and it quickly became the highest-rated show on television among teenage girls, and the most popular program on The WB. The popularity of Dawson helped boost the network's other shows, such as Buffy, which served as its lead-in on The WB's new night of programming that also launched in January 1998, branded as \\"New Tuesday,\\" and 7th Heaven, which enjoyed a massive 81% increase in viewership that season. With three hit shows in its roster, The WB continued to build its teen fanbase the following season with college drama Felicity (which made a star out of lead Keri Russell) and the wicca-themed Charmed (which was also produced by Aaron Spelling, and co-starred Alyssa Milano, Holly Marie Combs and 90210 alumnus Shannen Doherty), both of which set new records for the network when they respectively premiered to 7.1 and 7.7 million viewers; Charmed had the highest-rated premiere on the network until Smallville broke its record, debuting to 8.4 million viewers in October 2001. At the start of the 1998‚Äì99 season, the network expanded its programming to Thursday nights. That season, 7th Heaven overtook Dawson's Creek as the network's highest-rated program, and garnered The WB the highest ratings it would ever see ‚Äì the show's February 8, 1999 episode attracted 12.5 million viewers. For the 1999‚Äì2000 season, the network concluded its primetime expansion with the addition of programming on Friday nights. New shows that season included Roswell, Popular, and the Buffy the Vampire Slayer spin-off Angel, the latter of which premiered with 7.5 million viewers ‚Äì the second-highest rated premiere for the network at the time. During this season, The WB was the only network to have gains in its total audience viewership and in each key demographic. =2000‚Äì2003: Broadening the focus= As the teen boom of the late 1990s began to wane, The WB attempted to broaden the scope of its primetime lineup. Although teen-oriented fare like Popular and Roswell had premiered to strong ratings, both series saw serious ratings erosion in their sophomore seasons, leading the network to cancel them both (Roswell, like Buffy the Vampire Slayer, would end up being revived by rival network UPN). Meanwhile, even though ratings for 7th Heaven, Buffy and Charmed remained consistent, viewership for flagship series such as Felicity and Dawson's Creek began sagging. The network realized that it could no longer rely merely on the tastes of young teenage girls, and thus began moving back into more family- friendly fare, attempting to launch a successful sitcom, and generally targeting a more diverse audience. This new strategy came as The WB had dropped to sixth place in the ratings among all major broadcast networks (behind UPN) during the 1999‚Äì2000 season, losing 19% of its household audience. Executives for the network attributed the ratings decline in large part due to the Tribune Company's decision to remove WB network programming from WGN-TV's superstation feed in October 1999, on the pretense that the network's national distribution was large enough that it was no longer necessary for WGN to broadcast The WB's programs outside of Chicago; the network reached several affiliation deals during the prior four years with various station owners (such as the Sinclair Broadcast Group and Pappas Telecasting Companies), buoyed by the September 1998 launch of The WB 100+ Station Group, a national cable-only service that served most of the 110 smallest Nielsen media markets in the United States that did not have enough television stations to support an over-the-air affiliate. The removal of The WB's programs from the WGN national feed effectively reduced the network's potential household audience by 10 million homes (WGN-TV continued to carry WB programming over-the-air and on cable within the Chicago market until the network shut down in 2006). Despite the slight downturn in the network's fortunes, there were a few bright spots during the era. Gilmore Girls, which debuted in 2000, netted meager ratings when it debuted in a tough Thursday timeslot (where it competed against NBC's powerhouse Must See TV lineup), but subsequently grew into one of the network's most successful shows after moving to Tuesdays in 2001, where it remained for six seasons (before moving to The CW for its seventh and final season). Also in the fall of 2000, the fantasy sitcom Sabrina, the Teenage Witch moved from ABC to The WB as part of its Friday night schedule; the show continued on the network for three more seasons before ending in May 2003. Time Warner transferred operational duties for The WB from Warner Bros. over to its Turner Broadcasting System division in 2001. On November 12, 2002, chairman Jamie Kellner ‚Äì who became chairman and chief executive officer of the Turner Broadcasting System concurrent with that deal ‚Äì sold his 11% stake in The WB to majority corporate parent AOL Time Warner, leaving it and minority owner, the Tribune Company, as the only partners in the network. Following Kellner's departure from Turner, AOL Time Warner reassigned the network's operations back to the Warner Bros. unit in 2003. In October 2001, the Superman-inspired Smallville debuted with 8.4 million viewers, the highest-rated premiere in the history of the network; that show was also important because it was one of the few series that drew a substantial male viewership. 2001 also saw the launch of the Reba McEntire vehicle Reba, arguably the network's most successful comedic series; Reba and Sabrina served as the linchpins for a new Friday night sitcom block that debuted in October 2001 (delayed from a mid-September launch, as other networks did with their fall schedules following the September 11th terrorist attacks) and continued for much of the remainder of the network's run (comedies on that night were relegated to one hour in April 2006, with reality series filling the 8:00 p.m. hour). Other series to gain attention during this period were the family drama Everwood, and the short-lived but critically acclaimed soap satire Grosse Pointe. =2003‚Äì2006: Decline= Despite some early success, the network struggled to shift its focus from the female 12‚Äì24 demographic to the broader 12‚Äì34 range, in its attempt to attract a broader young adult audience. In 2005, the network retired Michigan J. Frog, as the network's trademark mascot. The WB's president of entertainment at the time, David Janollari, explained in July 2005 at the network's summer press tour that \\"[Michigan] was a symbol that perpetuated the young-teen feel of the network. That's not the image we [now] want to put to our audience.\\" Still, the move did not seem to help the network. The period from 2003 to 2005 produced only three viable new series, the teen-oriented drama One Tree Hill, social experiment reality competition Beauty and the Geek, and fantasy drama Supernatural (all of which ultimately moved to successor network The CW), and even still their ratings paled in comparison to the ratings peaks of Dawson's Creek, which had ended its run in May 2003. Ratings dropped for many of The WB's shows, while also cancelling shows with steady ratings such as Angel; the network failed to launch new hit shows to take their places. Although The WB's well-known inability to launch successful comedy series was nothing new (Reba being the sole exception), this period saw the network struggling to establish new dramas as well. High-profile failures included Birds of Prey (a series inspired by the Batman mythos, which premiered in October 2002 with an impressive 8 share), Tarzan, Jack & Bobby, The Mountain, the Jerry Bruckheimer-produced legal dramedy Just Legal, the Marta Kauffman-created dramedy Related, and the Rebecca Romijn vehicle Pepper Dennis. During the 2004‚Äì05 season, The WB finished behind rival UPN for the first time in four years, and fell even further behind in fall 2005. Both networks fell behind Spanish language network Univision in the overall 18‚Äì34 demographic. Between November and December 2005, the network laid off approximately 40 employees amid continued ratings and profit losses (with viewership down 12% by November 2005), with network representatives expecting The WB to lose about $35 million during the 2005‚Äì06 fiscal year. The WB was programming six days and 13 hours per week at this time. =2006: Network closure= On January 24, 2006, CBS Corporation and Warner Bros. Entertainment announced plans to shut down both UPN and The WB and partner to launch a new broadcast television network that would include series from both soon-to-be predecessor networks, known as The CW. Over the next eight months, it was to be seen which shows from the two networks would cross over to The CW, as well as which stations aligned with either UPN or The WB would become future affiliates of the new network. In the end, 7th Heaven, Beauty and the Geek, Gilmore Girls, One Tree Hill, Reba, Smallville, and Supernatural were chosen to move from The WB to The CW for its inaugural 2006‚Äì07 fall schedule. 7th Heaven and Reba were originally canceled after the 2005‚Äì06 season, but were ultimately renewed at the last minute with 13-episode deals (the former show was later given a full-season order, while the latter served as a midseason replacement and, in spite of becoming The CW's highest-rated comedy of the 2006‚Äì07 season, ended rather abruptly). Supernatural, which aired its final (15th) season in fall 2019 was the last surviving series from The WB that remained on the CW network schedule. Tribune Broadcasting also committed 16 of its 19 WB-affiliated stations at the time to serve as the network's core affiliates (though it relinquished its stake in The WB shortly after the launch announcement for The CW, in order to avoid shouldering shutdown costs for The WB, and would not take on an ownership stake in The CW) ‚Äì alongside 11 UPN O&Os; that were named as CW charter stations by CBS Corporation. Starting on August 14, 2006, with the Daytime WB block, The WB stopped displaying its on-screen logo bug during the network's programming and replaced it with a countdown of days until The CW's premiere. Some stations that either affiliated with MyNetworkTV (itself created in response to Tribune and CBS receiving affiliation deals with The CW, leaving UPN affiliates owned by Fox Television Stations, a subsidiary of MyNetworkTV's original parent company News Corporation, with the prospect of ending up as independents), became independent stations or became CW charter affiliates received a logo-free feed of the network, while others took the main feed and overlaid the station's own logo bug over The CW's logo. The WB aired its final night of programming on September 17, 2006, with The Night of Favorites and Farewells, a five-hour block of pilot episodes of the network's past signature series. Commercial breaks featured re-airings of past image campaigns and network promotions, along with promotional spots given to cable networks carrying these shows in off-network syndication and ads for each series' TV- on-DVD box set. The 60-second montage that closed The WB's existence featured many well-known stars from shows that aired during the 11-year run of the network, ending with the statement \\"For 11 years, you brought us into your homes. We made you smile and tugged at your heart. And now, we say goodbye. From all of us at The WB, Thank you.\\" The final image seen in the montage was former network mascot Michigan J. Frog (who was shown as a silhouette due to the animated character being retired as The WB's mascot the year before), who is shown taking his hat off and bowing, thanking the audience for watching the network for 11 years and marking the end of The WB. The final night of WB programming netted relatively low ratings. The network scored a 1.0 household rating (amounting to 1% of all U.S. television households) and a share of 2, meaning just 2% of viewers were tuned into The WB on its final night of programming. This is mostly due to the fact that some WB affiliates in certain areas had already joined MyNetworkTV, which debuted on September 5, two weeks before The CW's launch, leaving The WB's final two weeks of programming unavailable in those areas. After its closure, the network's URLs were redirected to The CW's website, cwtv.com. By March 30, 2008, the URLs redirected to the Warner Bros. Studios homepage, before being redirected to the TheWB.com beta website one month later on April 28. The CW maintained many operational and scheduling elements from The WB. When it launched on September 18, 2006, The CW initially maintained The WB's scheduling model; The WB had carried 30 hours of network programming each week (13 of which were devoted to primetime shows) in comparison to UPN's weekly programming total of 12 hours (10 hours of which were allocated to primetime shows). It also inherited The WB 100+ Station Group ‚Äì which became The CW Plus ‚Äì though the distribution model of The CW Plus started to differ from The WB 100+ by mixing digital subchannel affiliations, alongside the cable-only affiliates and few conventional affiliate stations that were part of the predecessor group at the end of The WB's run. The CW continued the Daytime WB block ‚Äì which became The CW Daytime (and was reduced from two hours to one in 2010), although two blocks that moved to The CW from The WB would eventually be discontinued: Kids' WB continued on The CW until May 17, 2008, when it was replaced with The CW4Kids after 4Kids Entertainment began programming The CW's Saturday morning block through a time-lease agreement (Kids' WB was later relaunched as an online portal); The CW discontinued its Sunday primetime schedule in September 2009, effectively ending the EasyView block in the process. =2008‚Äì2013: Internet streaming= Logo as an internet-only streaming service, used from August 2010 until TheWB.com's shutdown in December 2013. Warner Bros.' television arm planned on resurrecting The WB brand in the form of a website at TheWB.com, the website domain used for the official site of the broadcast network. The site streamed episodes of series that were broadcast during The WB Television Network's 1995‚Äì2006 run, including Gilmore Girls, Smallville, Everwood, Buffy the Vampire Slayer, Dawson's Creek, One Tree Hill, Roswell, and What I Like About You. The new incarnation of the TheWB.com began in beta testing on April 28, 2008, and officially launched on August 27. The site ‚Äì whose business model resembled that of free-to-stream services such as Hulu ‚Äì was ad-supported and geared primarily to women ages 15‚Äì39. In addition to older full-length series (among which also included All of Us, Hangin' with Mr. Cooper, Martin, Jack & Bobby, and Veronica Mars), the website featured original serialized web content including short series and vignettes from such well-known television producers as Josh Schwartz and McG, including Sorority Forever, Pushed, Rockville, CA, The Lake, and Children's Hospital (the latter's popularity was sustained enough to receive a run and eventual move to cable television as a regular series on Cartoon Network's Adult Swim). Each of these 10-episode programs ran for five minutes. Many other well-known Warner Bros.-produced series that did not air on The WB, including Friends and The O.C., were also made available on the site. However, the website did not include episodes of two of The WB's most popular shows, Charmed and Felicity, as the distribution rights to Charmed are owned by CBS Television Distribution and Felicitys rights are owned by Disney-ABC Domestic Television. Comcast offers over 1,000 episodes from the Warner Bros. Television library on its video on demand service. While Warner Bros. Entertainment did not promote the site in any multimedia ads, it had drawn about 250,000 unique viewers a month, according to Mindshare's Mr. Chapman, who had been tracking the site. Some of its original material had been offered on partner sites such as MySpace and Facebook. Data compiled by comScore Video Metrix showed that 62% of visitors to the site were female. The McG-produced original series Sorority Forever premiered on the site on September 8, 2008. By 2012, it had accrued more than 7.3 million views from TheWB.com and partner sites. An original reality series, Rich Girl, Poor Girl from Laguna Beach and Newport Harbor executive producer Gary Auerbach, in which two teenagers from different economic and social backgrounds swap lives (similar in format to Wife Swap and A Walk In Your Shoes), had ranked among the top 100 programs in the teenage category on iTunes since its October 20, 2008, debut. With the full replacement of the CW's original Internet programming efforts with their CW Seed portal, the WB website was shut down in December 2013. The closure of the WB website ended, after more than eighteen years, the usage of the brand name \\"The WB\\". However, the legacy of The WB still lives on as of 2019. Various programs that aired on the network air reruns on various cable networks such as MTV2 and TNT. Also, WMJF, a small student-run television station at Towson University just outside Baltimore, Maryland, still uses the same call letters (WMJF ‚Äì Michigan J. Frog) from when the station was a WB affiliate. A neon likeness of Michigan J. Frog also adorns the facade of former WB affiliate WBNX-TV's studio complex in Cuyahoga Falls, Ohio. Similarly, a large Hollywood lights-style sign of the network's logo that was used in the network's \\"backlot\\"-themed idents, promos, and bumpers is still located near storage facilities at the Warner Bros. Ranch Facilities in California. Internet advertising The clothing retailer H&M;, not a traditional television advertiser in the United States, sponsored Sorority Forever and had some of its clothing worn by characters in the series. Unilever's Axe brand has sponsored Children's Hospital. Warner Horizon Television executive vice president Craig Erwich, who oversaw TheWB.com, said in regards to these tie-ins \\"If an advertiser has an interest in a series we have in production, we can work in their products or even adjust our launch dates if they want to tie it in to a special promotion.\\" Programming Many, though not all, of The WB's programming during its eleven-year run as a television network was produced by corporate cousin Warner Bros. Television. The network's schedule during its first two seasons ‚Äì the 1995 midseason (when it inaugurated its initial Wednesday lineup) and the first half of the 1995‚Äì96 season (when the network expanded its programming to Sundays) ‚Äì consisted entirely of sitcoms; the first drama series to debut on the network was the primetime soap Savannah, which debuted in February 1996 and ran for two seasons until its cancellation in February 1997. The WB's first reality series was the U.S. adaptation of Popstars, which ran for two seasons from 2001 to 2003. In addition to live-action programs, the network has experimented with primetime animated series; Pinky and the Brain was the first such series, airing as part of the network's Sunday lineup from September 1995 to July 1996, before moving exclusively to the Kids' WB Saturday lineup due to low ratings in its prime time slot. Most of the animated projects that aired afterward were adult animation series; the last such attempts being The Oblongs (running for one season in 2001, and was later revived on corporate sister Cartoon Network's Adult Swim block) and The PJs (which moved to the network in 2000 following its cancellation by Fox, and ran for only one additional season on The WB). The WB also occasionally aired regularly scheduled repeat episodes of first-run series airing on other nights throughout the television season intermittently throughout its history; Sister, Sister was the first WB series to receive this treatment, with repeats of the sitcom's first two seasons (which originally aired on ABC) from August 1995 to August 1996, in addition to the first-run episodes it aired on Wednesday nights (this marked the first time that a network aired reruns as part of its regular schedule ‚Äì outside of the summer months ‚Äì since December 1993, when NBC removed repeats of Classic Concentration from its daytime lineup two years after that program's cancellation). From 1998 to 2000, the network also aired episode repeats from the first two seasons of 7th Heaven during the first hour of its Sunday lineup under the title 7th Heaven Beginnings; this concept was revived during the 2002‚Äì03 and 2003‚Äì04 seasons with Smallville and Gilmore Girls (which aired repeats from their early seasons under the respective titles Smallville: Beginnings and Gilmore Girls: Beginnings). Furthermore, from September 2002 until The WB ceased operations, the network ran a two-hour extension of its Sunday lineup (from 5:00 to 7:00 p.m. Eastern and Pacific Time), known as \\"EasyView\\", a block featuring week- behind episode rebroadcasts of select shows from the network's primetime schedule. Out of all the network's series, 7th Heaven ‚Äì which by the time it ended, had become the longest-running family drama in television history ‚Äì was the longest-running series ever to have aired on The WB, having run on the network for ten seasons from 1996 to 2006. The program was beaten by Supernatural as the longest-running series to originate on The WB in the 2017-18 season, when the latter series began its thirteenth season (7th Heaven ran for an additional season on The CW from 2006 to 2007; while Supernatural aired on The WB for one season from 2005 to 2006, before moving to The CW in September 2006, where it has aired since). =Children's programming= The WB debuted the Kids' WB children's program block in September 1995; the lineup initially featured a mix of Warner Bros.' most popular children's shows (such as Tiny Toon Adventures, Animaniacs, and later Batman: The Animated Series, all of which originated either on Fox Kids or in syndication) and newer series (such as Freakazoid!, Histeria!, Superman: The Animated Series, Road Rovers, Pinky and the Brain, and Batman Beyond). After the Turner Broadcasting System was acquired by Time Warner in 1996, Kids' WB formed an alliance with Cartoon Network, resulting over time in an increasing number of programs being shared between the block and the cable channel. In February 1999, Kids' WB began airing the American English dub of Pok√©mon. The WB acquired the U.S. rights to the Japanese animated series from TV Tokyo earlier that year (from its U.S. premiere in the fall of 1998 up to that point, the show was syndicated); the series ultimately became a widespread pop culture phenomenon with the added exposure on the network. Kids' WB also acquired the English-language dub of Yu-Gi-Oh!, which also saw the type of viewer popularity experienced by Pok√©mon. Between 2000 and 2005, Kids' WB experimented with some live-action programming, though the block continued to mainly run animated series. A television series adaptation of R. L. Stine's The Nightmare Room debuted on the block in 2001, it was cancelled after one season. It also aired the live- action made-for-TV movie Zolar, as well as the JammX Kids All-Star dance specials. Logo for Daytime WB. With Cartoon Network now outrating Fox Kids, and The WB sharing more of its children's programming with the cable channel, The WB announced on May 31, 2005, that it would discontinue Kids' WB's weekday afternoon block as it became financially unattractive due to broadcast stations shifting their afternoon target audiences more exclusively to adults by filling the slot with talk shows and sitcom reruns, on the basis that children's viewing options in that time period had gravitated more towards cable television. Kids' WB's weekday programming continued, but with redundant programs and theme weeks until December 30, 2005 (the block began to increasingly promote Cartoon Network's afternoon Miguzi block and the Kids' WB Saturday morning lineup during the transition). The weekday block was replaced on January 2, 2006, by \\"Daytime WB,\\" a block that featured repeats of sitcoms and drama series formerly aired by The WB and other networks (such as ER, 8 Simple Rules, and What I Like About You); five days later on January 7, the Kids' WB Saturday morning lineup was expanded by one hour. The Daytime WB block continued on The CW, unofficially renamed The CW Daytime (though occasional on-air promos for the block do not refer to this name); The CW also kept the Kids' WB name for the network's Saturday morning children's programming. However, on October 2, 2007, The CW announced that it would discontinue the Kids' WB block, due to competition with youth-oriented cable channels. Kids' WB aired for the last time on May 17, 2008, replaced with a new block programmed in conjunction with 4Kids Entertainment called The CW4Kids (which was replaced by Vortexx on August 25, 2012, after Saban Brands and Kidsco Media Ventures took over programming the block as part of its acquisition of much of 4Kids's program library; Vortexx continued to run until September 27, 2014, before being replaced a week later by One Magnificent Morning programmed by Litton Entertainment). As a result of its distribution deal with The CW, 4Kids produced Saturday morning blocks for two networks during the 2008‚Äì09 season, as it already programmed Fox's 4Kids TV block (which was discontinued by that network on December 27, 2008). Like its parent network, Kids' WB was revived as an online-only network in April 2008. In addition to carrying select previous Kids' WB programs, the site also features other archived programs to which Time Warner owns or holds distribution rights, and programs seen on Cartoon Network and Boomerang. Differences between The WB and the \\"Big Four\\" networks =Scheduling= At the time of its shutdown, The WB ran only two hours of primetime network programming on Monday through Fridays and five hours on Sundays, compared to the three Monday through Saturday and four Sunday primetime hours offered by the Big Three networks (unlike The WB, UPN never carried any weekend primetime programming, though it did offer a movie package to its affiliates on weekend afternoons until September 2000, when the latter was replaced with a two-hour repeat block of UPN programs). This primetime scheduling allowed for many of the network's affiliates to air local newscasts during the 10:00‚Äì11:00 p.m. (Eastern and Pacific) time period. The WB never ran network programming on Saturday nights ‚Äì despite the fact that the network maintained a children's program block on Saturday mornings ‚Äì allowing affiliates to run syndicated programs, sports, movies or network programs that were preempted from earlier in the week due to special programming, in the 8:00‚Äì10:00 p.m. (Eastern and Pacific) time period. The network's Sunday schedule was originally three hours when The WB began programming that night in September 1995, but expanded to five hours (from 5:00‚Äì10:00 p.m. Eastern and Pacific Time) in September 2002, with the creation of the \\"EasyView\\" repeat block (that block was retained by The CW, which initially adopted The WB's scheduling model until it turned Sunday programming over to its affiliates in September 2009). In comparison to ABC and CBS, The WB also had the fewest hours devoted to daytime programming on weekdays between September 2001 (when the network dropped the weekday morning block of Kids' WB programs) and September 2006, running only two hours of programming each weekday afternoon (compared to 4¬Ω hours on CBS and four hours on ABC) ‚Äì NBC in comparison ran only three hours of daytime programming each weekday (not counting its morning news program Today) until September 2000, when it scaled back its daytime programming block to two hours. Because of these reasons, the schedules of The WB's affiliates were largely composed of syndicated programming. =Affiliate distribution= The WB was the only English language broadcast network that historically did not have any owned- and-operated stations. Although Tribune Broadcasting maintained an ownership stake in The WB, its stations in the three largest television markets of New York City (WPIX), Los Angeles (KTLA) and Chicago (WGN-TV) were actually affiliates of the network since Tribune did not have a controlling ownership interest in the network to allow its stations to be constituted as O&Os; (by 2005, Tribune owned 22.5% of the network, while Time Warner held the controlling 77.5% interest). Time Warner did not have a station group of its own at the time (and still does not in the present day); although its Turner Broadcasting System division did own Atlanta independent station WPCH-TV (then WTBS-TV, the local feed of then-superstation TBS) at the time, but it never carried WB programming due to the network's affiliation with WATL, which Tribune Broadcasting had owned from 1999 (when it acquired the station from Qwest Broadcasting, which was part-owned by Tribune) to 2006 (when it sold the station to the Gannett Company, now Tegna, Inc.). Unlike the other major networks, The WB distributed its programming in markets that did not have enough commercial television stations to support a standalone WB affiliate to cable-only outlets: the superstation feed of WGN-TV (now known as WGN America and since converted into a general entertainment cable channel) carried the network's programming from January 1995 to October 1999 to make The WB available primarily to areas where it did not yet have a full-time affiliate. While viewers in the Chicago area saw primetime and Kids' WB programming on separate stations until September 2004 (primetime shows on WGN-TV and children's programs on WCIU-TV), the WGN superstation feed carried The WB's entire schedule during the four-year period that it carried the network. On September 21, 1998, The WB launched The WB 100+ Station Group, an alternate national feed for small and certain mid-sized U.S. markets (generally those within the bottom 110 Nielsen media markets). The service ‚Äì which transmitted its content via an IBM-developed data server network that digitally transmitted local and national advertisements, promos, station identifications and customized logo bugs to each individual affiliate, with the programming feeds and accompanying data being relayed via satellite and stored to a wireless PC-based system (known as a \\"station in a box\\") ‚Äì was primarily affiliated with cable-only television channels (which were mainly operated by area cable providers), though it was also carried on full-power or low-power stations in some markets. The WB 100+ offered its own master schedule with programs available on the syndication market that were acquired by The WB (including some feature films and infomercials) airing outside of network programming hours; the addition of local advertisements and newscasts were at the discretion of the local distributor. Most of the stations that were part of The WB 100+ Station Group joined The CW Plus after The CW's September 2006 launch, though most of the cable-only affiliates that became part of The CW Plus have since been replaced by or converted into digital subchannels carried by major network affiliates. WT05 in Toledo, Ohio was the only cable-exclusive WB affiliate that was not part of The WB 100+ Station Group; owner Block Communications (which operates area cable provider Buckeye CableSystem) handled programming for WT05, running its own schedule of syndicated programs during non-network hours ‚Äì a model the channel maintained as a CW affiliate until its shutdown and replacement by WTVG-DT2 in October 2014. In certain mid-sized and smaller markets, some of The WB's stations held dual affiliations with another major network ‚Äì most commonly, UPN (with The WB often serving as the primary affiliation) ‚Äì if there were not enough television stations to allow both networks to maintain separate affiliates (though this was also the case in a few markets where enough stations were available for a standalone affiliate). =News programming= News programming on The WB's affiliates was similar to Fox stations at the time in that the quantity of newscasts varied from station to station. Roughly half of The WB's approximately 200 affiliates aired a local newscast in the 10:00‚Äì11:00 p.m. Eastern/Pacific (9:00‚Äì10:00 p.m. Central/Mountain) time slot at some point during or throughout their affiliations with the network. Fundamentally, the newscast schedules on WB affiliates varied considerably between stations compared to those affiliated with ABC, CBS, NBC and especially Fox. Most WB affiliates generally ran a two-hour morning newscast on weekdays and/or a half-hour or hour-long 10:00 p.m. newscast on Monday through Fridays only or all seven nights of the week; although there were a few larger market stations that maintained in-house news departments that also produced midday newscasts and had morning newscasts that began in the then-traditional 5:00‚Äì7:00 a.m. timeslot; early evening newscasts were largely absent on most of these stations. The WB affiliate body had fewer news-producing stations in comparison to stations aligned with the Big Three television networks (NBC, ABC and CBS) and considerably fewer than Fox (which has only around 70 stations with in-house news departments, with most of its stations outsourcing their news programming to a competitor). When the network launched in January 1995, The WB automatically gained five affiliates with functioning news departments through the initial agreement with Tribune Broadcasting, all of whom founded their news operations as either independent stations or during early affiliations with other networks, such as the DuMont Television Network: WGN-TV/Chicago, WPIX/New York City, KTLA/Los Angeles, KWGN-TV/Denver and WLVI- TV/Boston (a fifth news-producing station owned by Tribune at the time, WGNX/Atlanta, was to become a WB charter affiliate but instead affiliated with CBS after WAGA-TV dropped that network to join Fox in December 1994, through a groupwide affiliation deal between Fox and WAGA owner New World Communications). KPLR-TV/St. Louis (which would not be acquired by Tribune until 2003, when it bought the station from ACME Communications) also continued to produce a 9:00 p.m. newscast as a WB affiliate; while Phoenix, Arizona's KTVK began running expanded newscasts shortly before joining The WB at the network's launch (it had earlier lost the ABC affiliation to KNXV-TV, the WB affiliation moved to KASW, which KTVK began managing under a local marketing agreement upon its sign-on, in September 1995). In the late 1990s, Tribune asked the company's remaining WB-affiliated stations that did not run newscasts to develop their own news departments; the only stations to do this were KDAF/Dallas‚ÄìFort Worth, KHWB/Houston, KSWB-TV/San Diego and WPHL- TV/Philadelphia ‚Äì the first three debuted their newscasts in 1999, while WPHL had debuted a 10:00 p.m. newscast that was produced in conjunction with The Philadelphia Inquirer in 1994, before WPHL took over production of the program in 1996. KSWB and WPHL would both shutter their news departments in 2005, outsourcing production of their 10:00 p.m. newscasts to NBC owned-and-operated stations in their respective markets (KSWB restored in-house newscasts after it switched from WB successor The CW to Fox in August 2008). KNTV/San Jose became the largest news-producing WB affiliate by market size to be owned by a company other than Tribune (and the only other affiliate of the network to produce early evening newscasts, after KTVK) after it terminated its ABC affiliation, and began carrying WB programming (in a partial simulcast with then-sister station KBWB-TV) in 2000, before affiliating with ‚Äì and then ultimately being purchased by ‚Äì NBC in 2002. Sinclair Broadcast Group also operated several WB affiliates with local news departments: Raleigh's WLFL was the only WB affiliate that the company owned which had an existing news operation at the time it joined the network (WLFL began producing a 10:00 p.m. newscast as a Fox affiliate in 1992, six years before it joined The WB); Sinclair's Tampa, Buffalo, Milwaukee, Cincinnati, Las Vegas and Norfolk WB affiliates began producing their own newscasts through Sinclair's local/national hybrid news format News Central in the early 2000s. The news departments of all seven of those stations were shut down in 2006 due to companywide cutbacks in Sinclair's news operations and the discontinuance of News Central. Of the former WB affiliates that produced newscasts during their affiliation with the network, only WGN-TV, WPIX, KTLA, KDAF and KIAH (all of whom became affiliates of The CW) continue to maintain self-supporting news departments (KPLR and KWGN respectively merged their news departments with those of Fox affiliates KTVI and KDVR through a 2008 management agreement between Tribune and Local TV, while WLVI's news department was shut down after Tribune sold the station to Sunbeam Television in 2006, with production of its 10:00 p.m. newscast taken over by new sister station WHDH). In most markets, the local WB affiliate either outsourced news programming to an NBC, ABC or CBS station in the market (either due to insufficient funds for production of their own newscasts or in later years after the FCC permitted duopolies in markets with at least eight unique station owners in 2000, the station being operated through a legal duopoly or operational agreement with a major network affiliate) or opted to carry syndicated programming in the hour following The WB's primetime programming. As with Fox affiliates, WB-affiliated stations whose newscasts were produced by a same-market competitor tended to have fewer programming hours devoted to news than the station producing the broadcasts. Affiliates In 2005, The WB had an estimated audience reach of 91.66% of all U.S. households (equivalent to 90,282,480 households with at least one television set); the network was carried by 177 VHF and UHF stations in the United States. The WB was also available in Canada on cable and satellite providers through affiliates that are located within proximity to the Canada‚ÄìUS border (whose broadcasts of WB shows were subject to simultaneous substitution rules imposed by the Canadian Radio-television and Telecommunications Commission to protect program rights held by a domestically based network), and through two affiliates owned by Tribune Broadcasting (WPIX/New York City and KTLA/Los Angeles) that are classified in that country as superstations, as well as the superstation feed of Chicago affiliate WGN- TV. =Station standardization= When The WB launched in 1995, the network began branding most of its affiliates with a combination of \\"WB\\" or \\"The WB,\\" and the station's channel number. This meant that, for example, New York City affiliate WPIX and St. Louis affiliate KPLR-TV were both referred to as \\"WB11\\" (though WPIX branded as \\"The WB, Channel 11\\" until 1996, and KPLR as its pre- affiliation brand \\"St. Louis 11\\" until 1998). Fox originated such naming schemes, and CBS uses similar on-air branding for most of its owned-and- operated stations (NBC and ABC also utilize similar, but less extreme, naming schemes). While Fox and UPN mandated their respective branding schemes on all of their stations, The WB did not. Therefore, other WB affiliates opted to use non-standardized brandings: WGN-TV/Chicago branded as \\"WGN Channel 9\\" (or simply \\"WGN\\") with The WB's logo placed within the right curve of the station's \\"9 as an upside-down G\\" logo after the network launched, and next to a boxed \\"9\\" from 2002 to 2006. Most of the Tribune Company's WB affiliates only used the network's logo within the logos of each station or used \\"The WB\\" name after the callsign in its on-air branding (an example was Los Angeles affiliate KTLA, which branded as \\"KTLA, The WB\\", after dropping its longstanding and genericized \\"Channel 5\\" brand in 1997). Many WB affiliates used another form of standardized branding: the network's Lakeland, Florida affiliate (serving Tampa) acquired the WWWB call letters and branded on-air as \\"The WB 32\\" (it is now known as WMOR-TV). Other stations would take on a 'by city' branding approach (for example, KHWB/Houston was called \\"Houston's WB\\" and WLVI-TV/Boston was called \\"Boston's WB\\" ‚Äì both used the \\"WB (channel number)\\" branding prior to incorporating the station's city of primary service during the final years of the network's run); some stations which followed this scheme used a regional name instead of a specific city (such as \\"Capital Region's WB\\" for WEWB/Albany, New York or \\"Hawaii's WB\\" for KFVE/Honolulu, Hawaii), while others also incorporated the channel number (such as Philadelphia affiliate WPHL-TV as \\"Philadelphia's WB17\\", or Mobile, Alabama affiliate WBPG as \\"The Gulf Coast's WB55\\"). Many stations affiliated with The WB 100+ Station Group also followed either one of these variations on \\"The City/Region's WB\\" scheme (though the group's cable-only affiliates also used fictional call signs).

The band consists of Matt Bellamy (lead vocals, guitar, keyboards), Chris Wolstenholme (bass guitar, backing vocals), and Dominic Howard (drums). Muse released their debut album, Showbiz, in 1999, showcasing Bellamy's falsetto and a melancholic alternative rock style. Their second album, Origin of Symmetry (2001), incorporated wider instrumentation and romantic classical influences, featured their acclaimed cover of \\"Feeling Good\\", and earned them a reputation for energetic live performances. Absolution (2003) saw further classical influence, with strings on tracks such as \\"Butterflies and Hurricanes\\", and was the first of six consecutive UK number-one albums. Black Holes and Revelations (2006) incorporated electronic and pop elements, displayed in singles such as \\"Supermassive Black Hole\\", and brought Muse wider international success. The Resistance (2009) and The 2nd Law (2012) explored themes of government oppression and civil uprising and cemented Muse as one of the world's major stadium acts. Rolling Stone stated the band possessed \\"stadium-crushing songs\\". Topping the US Billboard 200, their seventh album, Drones (2015), was a concept album about drone warfare and returned to a harder rock sound. Their eighth album, Simulation Theory (2018), prominently featured synthesisers and was influenced by science fiction and the simulation hypothesis. Muse have won numerous awards, including two Grammy Awards, two Brit Awards, five MTV Europe Music Awards and eight NME Awards. In 2012 they received the Ivor Novello Award for International Achievement from the British Academy of Songwriters, Composers and Authors. , they have sold over 20 million albums worldwide. History =Early years (1994‚Äì1997)= The members of Muse played in separate school bands during their time at Teignmouth Community College in the early 1990s. Guitarist Matt Bellamy successfully auditioned for drummer Dominic Howard's band, Carnage Mayhem, becoming its singer and songwriter. They renamed the band Gothic Plague. They asked Chris Wolstenholme ‚Äì at that time the drummer for Fixed Penalty ‚Äì to join as bassist; he agreed and took up bass lessons.International who's who in popular music, Volume 4 p.37. Routledge, 2002 The band was renamed Rocket Baby Dolls and adopted a goth-glam image. Around this time, they received a ¬£150 grant from the Prince's Trust for equipment.Jools Holland interview, 10 October 2018 In 1994, Rocket Baby Dolls won a local battle of the bands, smashing their equipment in the process. Bellamy said, \\"It was supposed to be a protest, a statement, so, when we actually won, it was a real shock, a massive shock. After that, we started taking ourselves seriously.\\" The band quit their jobs, changed their name to Muse, and moved away from Teignmouth. The band liked that the new name was short and thought that it looked good on a poster. According to journalist Mark Beaumont, the band wanted the name to reflect \\"the sense Matt had that he had somehow 'summoned up' this band, the way mediums could summon up inspirational spirits at times of emotional need\\".Mark Beaumont (2010). \\"Out of This World: The Story of Muse\\". Omnibus Press, 2010 =First EPs and Showbiz (1998‚Äì2000)= Muse EP in 1998 After a few years building a fanbase, Muse played their first gigs in London and Manchester supporting Skunk Anansie on tour. They had a significant meeting with Dennis Smith, the owner of Sawmills Studio, situated in a converted water mill in Cornwall. He had seen the three boys grow up as he knew their parents, and had a production company with their future manager Safta Jaffery, with whom he had recently started the record label Taste Media. The meeting led to their first serious recordings and the release of the Muse EP on 11 May 1998 on Sawmills' in-house Dangerous label, produced by Paul Reeve.Ben Myers (2007). \\"Muse: Inside the Muscle Museum\\". p. 58. Random House, Their second EP, the Muscle Museum EP, also produced by Reeve, was released on 11 January 1999. It reached number 3 in the indie singles chart and attracted the attention of British radio broadcaster Steve Lamacq and the weekly British music publication NME. Later in 1999, Muse performed on the Emerging Artist's stage at Woodstock '99 and signed with Smith and Jaffery. Despite the success of their second EP, British record companies were reluctant to sign Muse. After a trip to New York's CMJ Festival, Nanci Walker, then Sr. Director of A&R; at Columbia Records, flew Muse to the US to showcase for Columbia Records' then-Senior Vice-President of A&R;, Tim Devine, as well as for American Recording's Rick Rubin. During this trip, on 24 December 1998, Muse signed a deal with American record label Maverick Records. Upon their return to England, Taste Media arranged deals for Muse with various record labels in Europe and Australia, allowing them control over their career in individual countries. John Leckie was brought in alongside Reeve to produce the band's first album, Showbiz (1999). The album showcased Muse's aggressive yet melancholic musical style, with lyrics about relationships and their difficulties trying to establish themselves in their hometown.Showbiz. Kerrang Review, 1999 =Origin of Symmetry and Hullabaloo (2000‚Äì2002)= Muse performing at Roskilde Festival in Denmark, July 2000 During the production of their second album, Origin of Symmetry (2001), Muse experimented with instrumentation such as a church organ, Mellotron, animal bones, and an expanded drum kit. There was more of Bellamy's falsetto, arpeggiated guitar, and piano playing. Bellamy cites guitar influences such as Jimi Hendrix and Tom Morello (of Rage Against the Machine), the latter evident in the more riff-based songs in Origin of Symmetry and in Bellamy's use of guitar pitch- shifting effects. The album features a cover of Anthony Newley and Leslie Bricusse's \\"Feeling Good\\", voted in various polls one of the greatest cover versions of all time. It was released as a double A-side single, \\"Hyper Music/Feeling Good\\". Origin of Symmetry received positive reviews by critics; NME gave the album 9/10 and wrote: \\"It's amazing for such a young band to load up with a heritage that includes the darker visions of Cobain and Kafka, Mahler and The Tiger Lillies, Cronenberg and Schoenberg, and make a sexy, populist album.\\" Maverick, Muse's American label, did not consider Bellamy's vocals \\"radio-friendly\\" and asked Muse to rerecord the song for the US release. The band refused and left Maverick; the album was not released in the US until September 2005, after Muse signed to Warner Bros. Origin of Symmetry has made appearances on lists of the greatest rock albums of the 2000s, both poll-based and on publication lists. In 2006, it placed at number 74 on Q magazine's list of the 100 Greatest Albums of All-Time, while in February 2008, the album placed at number 28 on a list of the Best British Albums of All Time determined by the magazine's readers. Kerrang! placed the album at number 20 in its 100 Best British Rock Albums Ever! List and at number 13 on its 50 Best Albums of the 21st Century list. Acclaimed Music ranks Origin of Symmetry as the 1,247th greatest album of all time. In 2002, Muse released the first live DVD, Hullabaloo, featuring footage recorded during Muse's two gigs at Le Zenith in Paris in 2001, and a documentary film of the band on tour. A double album, Hullabaloo Soundtrack, was released at the same time, containing a compilation of B-sides and a disc of recordings of songs from the Le Zenith performances. A double-A side single was also released featuring the new songs \\"In Your World\\" and \\"Dead Star\\". In 2002, Muse threatened Celine Dion with legal action when she planned to name her Las Vegas show \\"Muse\\", as Muse have worldwide performing rights to the name. Dion offered Muse $50,000 for the rights, but they turned it down and Dion backed down. Bellamy said: \\"We don't want to turn up there with people thinking we're Celine Dion's backing band.\\" =Absolution (2003‚Äì2005)= Chris Wolstenholme of Muse performing at the Mod Club Theatre, Toronto in 2004. The international Absolution tour included the band's first shows in North America since 1999. Muse's third album, Absolution, produced by Rich Costey, Paul Reeve and John Cornfield was released on 15 September 2003. It debuted at number one in the UK and produced Muse's first top-ten hit, \\"Time Is Running Out\\", and three top-twenty hits: \\"Hysteria\\", \\"Sing for Absolution\\" and \\"Butterflies and Hurricanes\\". Absolution was eventually certified gold in the US. Muse undertook a year-long international tour in support of the album, visiting Australia, New Zealand, the United States, Canada, and France. On the 2004 US leg of the tour, Bellamy injured himself onstage during the opening show in Atlanta; the tour resumed after Bellamy received stitches. In June 2004, Muse headlined the Glastonbury Festival, which they later described as \\"the best gig of our lives\\". Howard's father, William Howard, who attended the festival to watch the band, died from a heart attack shortly after the performance. Bellamy said: \\"It was the biggest feeling of achievement we've ever had after coming offstage. It was almost surreal that an hour later his dad died. It was almost not believable. We spent about a week sort of just with Dom trying to support him. I think he was happy that at least his dad got to see him at probably what was the finest moment so far of the band's life.\\" Muse won two MTV Europe awards, including \\"Best Alternative Act\\", and a Q Award for \\"Best Live Act\\",Billboard, 4 December 2004' and received an award for \\"Best British Live Act\\" at the Brit Awards.International Who's Who in Popular Music 2008 p.561 Taylor and Francis, 2008 On 2 July 2005, they participated in the Live 8 concert in Paris.

An unofficial DVD biography, Manic Depression, was released in April 2005. Muse released another live DVD on 12 December 2005, Absolution Tour, containing edited and remastered highlights from their Glastonbury performance unseen footage from their performances at London Earls Court, Wembley Arena, and the Wiltern Theatre in Los Angeles. During the 2004 Absolution tour, Bellamy smashed 140 guitars, a world record for the most guitars smashed in a tour. =Black Holes and Revelations and HAARP (2006‚Äì2008)= Starlight\\" at Reading and Leeds Festivals on 28 August 2006 In 2006, Muse released their fourth album, Black Holes and Revelations, co- produced once again with Rich Costey. The album's title and themes reflect the band's interest in science fiction. The album charted at number one in the UK, much of Europe, and Australia. In the US, it reached number nine on the Billboard 200. Before the release of the new album, Muse made several promotional TV appearances starting on 13 May 2006 at BBC Radio 1's Big Weekend. The Black Holes and Revelations Tour started before the release of their album and initially consisted mostly of festival appearances, including a headline slot at the Reading and Leeds Festivals in August 2006. The band's main touring itinerary started with a tour of North America from late July to early August 2006. After the last of the summer festivals, a tour of Europe began, including a large arena tour of the UK. Black Holes and Revelations was nominated for the 2006 Mercury Music Prize, but lost to Arctic Monkeys. It earned a Platinum Europe Award after selling one million copies in Europe. The first single from the album, \\"Supermassive Black Hole\\", was released as a download in May 2006.

They performed two gigs at the newly rebuilt Wembley Stadium on 16 and 17 June 2007, where they became the first band to sell out the venue. Both concerts were recorded for a DVD/CD, HAARP, released in early 2008. It was named the 40th greatest live album of all time by NME. The tour continued across Europe in July 2007 before returning to the US in August, where Muse played to a sold-out crowd at Madison Square Garden, New York City. They headlined the second night of the Austin City Limits Music Festival on 15 September 2007, and performed at the October 2007 Vegoose in Las Vegas with bands including Rage Against the Machine, Daft Punk and Queens of the Stone Age.

During the recording of Muse's fifth studio album The Resistance, Wolstenholme checked into rehab to deal with his alcoholism, which was threatening the band's future. Howard said: \\"I've always believed in band integrity and sticking together. There's something about the fact we all grew up together. We've been together for 18 years now, which is over half our lives.\\" The Resistance was released in September 2009, the first album produced by Muse, with engineering by Adrian Bushby and mixing by Mark Stent. It topped album charts in 19 countries, became the band's third number one album in the UK, and reached number three on the Billboard 200.

The trailer, which included dubstep elements, was met with mixed reactions. On 7 June, Muse announced a European Arena tour, the first leg of The 2nd Law Tour. The leg included dates in France, Spain and the UK. The first single from the album, \\"Survival\\", was the official song of the London 2012 Summer Olympics, and Muse performed it at the Olympics closing ceremony.

The band performed the album's opening song, \\"Supremacy\\", with an orchestra at the 2013 Brit Awards on 20 February 2013. The album was a nominee for Best Rock Album at the 2013 Grammy Awards. The song \\"Madness\\" was also nominated for Best Rock Song. The album listed at number 46 on Rolling Stones list of the top 50 albums of 2012, saying \\"In an era of diminished expectations, Muse make stadium-crushing songs that mix the legacies of Queen, King Crimson, Led Zeppelin and Radiohead while making almost every other current band seem tiny.\\" Muse released their fourth live album, Live at Rome Olympic Stadium, on 29 November 2013 on CD/DVD and CD/Blu-ray formats. In November 2013, the film had theatrical screenings in 20 cities worldwide. The album contains the band's performance at Rome's Stadio Olimpico on 6 July 2013, in front of over 60,000 people; it was the first concert filmed in 4K format. The concert was a part of the Unsustainable Tour, Muse's mid-2013 tour of Europe. =Drones (2014‚Äì2016)= the O2 Arena in London in April 2016 as part of the Drones World Tour Muse began writing their seventh album soon after the Rome concert. The band felt that the electronic side of their music was becoming too dominant, and wanted to return to a simpler rock sound. After self-producing their previous two albums, the band hired producer Robert John \\"Mutt\\" Lange so they could focus on performance and spend less time mixing and reviewing takes. Recording took place in the Vancouver Warehouse Studio from October 2014 to April 2015. Muse announced their seventh album, Drones, on 11 March 2015. The following day, they released a lyric video for \\"Psycho\\" on their YouTube channel, and made the song available for instant download with the album pre-order. Another single, \\"Dead Inside\\", was released on 23 March. From 15 March to 16 May, Muse embarked on a short tour in small venues throughout the UK and the US, the Psycho Tour. Live performances of new songs from these concerts are included on the DVD accompanying the album along with bonus studio footage. On 18 May 2015, Muse released a lyric video for \\"Mercy\\" on their YouTube channel, and made the song available for instant download with the album pre-order. Drones was released on 8 June 2015. A concept album about the dehumanisation of modern warfare, it returned to a simpler rock sound with less elaborate production and genre experimentation. It topped the album charts in the UK, the US, Australia and most major markets.\\"Muse land fifth UK number one album\\" . BBC. Retrieved 17 June 2015\\"ARIA Album charts: Muse album debuts at No. 1\\" . Noise 11. Retrieved 17 June 2015 Muse headlined Lollapalooza Berlin on 13 September 2015.

A film based on the album, Muse ‚Äì Simulation Theory, combining concert footage and narrative scenes, was released in August 2020. In December 2019, Muse released Origin of Muse, a box set comprising remastered versions of Showbiz and Origin of Symmetry plus unreleased material. Musical style Described as an alternative rock, space rock and progressive rock band, Muse mix sounds from genres such as electronic music, progressive metal and art rock, and forms such as classical music, rock opera and many others. In 2002, Bellamy described Muse as a \\"trashy three-piece\\". In 2005, Pitchfork described Muse's music as \\"firmly ol' skool at heart: proggy hard rock that forgoes any pretensions to restraint ... their songs use full- stacked guitars and thunderous drums to evoke God's footsteps.\\" AllMusic described their sound as a \\"fusion of progressive rock, glam, electronica, and Radiohead-influenced experimentation.\\" On the band's association with progressive rock, Howard said: \\"I associate it [progressive rock] with 10-minute guitar solos, but I guess we kind of come into the category. A lot of bands are quite ambitious with their music, mixing lots of different styles ‚Äì and when I see that I think it's great. I've noticed that kind of thing becoming a bit more mainstream.\\" Muse performing \\"Supremacy\\" at Stadio Olimpico, Rome on 6 July 2013 during The Unsustainable Tour. Rolling Stone stated the band possess ‚Äústadium-crushing songs‚Äú. For their second album, Origin of Symmetry (2001), Muse wanted to craft a more aggressive sound. In 2000, Wolstenholme said: \\"Looking back, there isn't much difference sonically between the mellow stuff and the heavier tracks [on Showbiz]. The heavy stuff really could have been a lot heavier and that's what we want to do with [Origin of Symmetry].\\" Their third album, Absolution (2003), features prominent string arrangements and drew influences from artists such as Queen. Their fourth album, Black Holes and Revelations (2006) was influenced by artists including Depeche Mode and Lightning Bolt, as well as Asian and European music such as Naples music. The band listened to radio stations from the Middle East during the album's recording sessions. Queen guitarist Brian May has praised Muse's work, calling the band \\"extraordinary musicians\\", who \\"let their madness show through, always a good thing in an artist.\\" Muse's sixth album, The 2nd Law (2012) has a broader range of influences, ranging from funk and film scores to electronica and dubstep. The 2nd Law is influenced by rock acts such as Queen and Led Zeppelin (on \\"Supremacy\\") as well as dubstep producer Skrillex and Nero (on \\"The 2nd Law: Unsustainable\\" and \\"Follow Me\\", with the latter being co-produced by Nero), Michael Jackson, Stevie Wonder (on \\"Panic Station\\" which features musicians who performed on Stevie Wonder's \\"Superstition\\") and Hans Zimmer. The album features two songs with lyrics written and sung by bassist Wolstenholme, who wrote about his battle with alcoholism. It features extensive electronic instrumentation, including modular synthesisers and the French Connection, a synthesiser controller similar to the ondes martenot. =Musicianship= Many Muse songs are recognisable by vocalist Matt Bellamy's use of vibrato, falsetto, and melismatic phrasing, influenced by Jeff Buckley. As a pianist, Bellamy often uses arpeggios. Bellamy's compositions often suggest or quote late classical and romantic era composers such as Sergei Rachmaninov (in \\"Space Dementia\\" and \\"Butterflies and Hurricanes\\"), Camille Saint-Sa√´ns (in \\"I Belong to You (Mon Coeur S'ouvre √Ä Ta Voix)\\") and Fr√©d√©ric Chopin (in \\"United States of Eurasia\\"). As a guitarist, Bellamy often uses arpeggiator and pitch-shift effects to create a more \\"electronic\\" sound, citing Jimi Hendrix and Tom Morello as influences. His guitar playing is also influenced by Latin and Spanish guitar music; Bellamy said: \\"I just think that music is really passionate...It has so much feel and flair to it. I‚Äôve spent important times of my life in Spain and Greece, and various deep things happened there ‚Äì falling in love, stuff like that. So maybe that rubbed off somewhere.\\" Wolstenholme's basslines are a central motif of many Muse songs; the band combines bass guitar with effects and synthesisers to create overdriven fuzz bass tones. Both Bellamy and Wolstenholme use touch-screen controllers, often built into their instruments, to control synthesisers and effects including a Korg Kaoss pad or Digitech Whammy pedal. =Lyrics= Most earlier Muse songs lyrically dealt with introspective themes, including relationships, social alienation, and difficulties they had encountered while trying to establish themselves in their hometown. However, with the band's progress, their song concepts have become more ambitious, addressing issues such as the fear of the evolution of technology in their Origin of Symmetry (2001) album. They deal mainly with the apocalypse in Absolution (2003) and with catastrophic war in Black Holes and Revelations (2006). The Resistance (2009) focused on themes of government oppression, uprising, love, and panspermia. The album itself was mainly inspired by Nineteen Eighty-Four by George Orwell. Their sixth studio album, The 2nd Law (2012) relates to economics, thermodynamics, and apocalyptic themes. Their 2015 album Drones, is a concept album that uses autonomous killing drones as a metaphor for brainwashing and loss of empathy. Books that have influenced Muse's lyrical themes include Nineteen Eighty-Four, Confessions of an Economic Hitman by John Perkins, Hyperspace by Michio Kaku,The Making of Origin of Symmetry.

It was established as an intergovernmental body of the United Nations Economic Commission for Europe (UNECE) in 1996 and evolved from UNECE's long tradition of work in trade facilitation which began in 1957 UN/CEFACT's goal is, ‚ÄúSimple, Transparent and Effective Processes for Global Commerce.‚Äù It aims to help business, trade and administrative organizations from developed, developing and transition economies to exchange products and services effectively. To this end, it focuses on simplifying national and international transactions by harmonizing processes, procedures and information flows related to these transactions, rendering these more efficient and streamlined, with the ultimate goal of contributing to the growth of global commerce.  Trade facilitation and electronic business UN/CEFACT focusses on two main areas of activity to make international trade processes more efficient and streamlined, namely: trade facilitation and electronic business. Trade facilitation involves the simplification of trade procedures (or the elimination of unnecessary procedures). This includes work to standardize and harmonize the core information used in trade documents, to ease the flow of information between parties by relying on appropriate information and communication technology, and to promote simplified payment systems to foster transparency, accountability and cost-effectiveness. Electronic business, in the UN/CEFACT context, focuses on harmonizing, standardizing and automating the exchange of information that controls the flow of goods along the international supply chain. UN/CEFACT's work on electronic business is driven by the understanding that goods cannot move faster than the processes and information that accompany them. UN/CEFACT takes a total trade transaction approach to trade facilitation and associated electronic business, covering all the processes from initial placement of orders through to final payments. This is best illustrated through the UN/CEFACT Buy-Ship-Pay model of the international supply chain, which forms the basis of its work. Buy Ship Pay model of the international supply chain  Deliverables UN/CEFACT has produced over 30 trade facilitation recommendations and a range of electronic business standards (collectively referred to as ‚Äúinstruments‚Äù) which are used throughout the world by both governments and the private sector. They reflect best practices in trade procedures and data and documentary requirements. The International Organization for Standardization (ISO) has adopted many of them as international standards. UN/CEFACT Recommendations and Standards are implemented throughout the world. Some of the more well known instruments are: Recommendation 1: United Nations Layout Key (UNLK) for Trade Documents. This provides an international basis for the standardized layout of documents used in international trade. The Layout Key facilitates the exchange of information between the various parties involved in a commercial transaction and is used as the basis for many key trade documents such as the European Union's Single Administrative Document (SAD); FIATA's Freight Forwarding Instruction; UNECE's Dangerous Goods Declaration; and the World Customs Organization (WCO) Goods Declaration for Export. Use of the UN Layout Key is specifically recommended in the WCO's Revised Kyoto Convention. It is important to note that the Layout Key is so widely used in international trade that many expect normal trade documents to conform to the Recommendation. Recommendation 16: UN/LOCODE Code for Trade and Transport Locations provides an alphabetic code for seaports, airports, inland freight terminals and other customs clearance sites. Recommended by the International Maritime Organization (IMO), it is used by most major shipping companies and also by the universal Postal Union (UPU). UN/LOCODE's website is regularly visited, accounting for 6% of all ‚Äúhits‚Äù to the UNECE website. The first issue of UN/LOCODE in 1981 provided codes to represent the names of some 8000 locations in the world. Today, UN/LOCODE, which is updated twice annually, contains almost 100 000 entries with strong demand for further updates and extension. Every recognised national and international airport or maritime port will have a UN/LOCODE coding. Recommendation 25 and the UN/EDIFACT Standard represent a set of internationally agreed standards, directories, and guidelines for the electronic interchange of structured data, between independent computerized information systems. UN/EDIFACT is the international standard for Electronic Data Interchange and is used throughout the commercial and administrative world. UN/EDIFACT accounts for over 90% of all electronic data interchange (EDI) messages exchanged globally. UN/EDIFACT messages are used by almost all national customs administrations, all major seaports and a large range of companies (including over 100 000 in the retail sector), and throughout international supply chains. For example, more than 7 million EDIFACT messages are exchanged each year in the French agricultural supply chain. Recommendation 33 on Single Windows proposes that governments establish a Single Window facility that allows parties involved in trade and transport to lodge standardized information and documents with a single entry point to fulfil all import, export and transit-related regulatory requirements. A suite of complementary Single Window Recommendations has also been developed, namely Recommendation 34 on Data Simplification and Standardization and 35 on Establishing a Legal Framework for Single Windows. A family of Supply Chain ‚ÄúCross-Industry‚Äù messages are exchanged globally between trading partners covering the majority of business-to-business (B2B) electronic exchanges from order to payment. One of the key documents within this family is the Cross Industry Invoice (CII) which functions primarily as a request for payment, used as a key document for Value Added Tax (VAT) declaration and reclamation, for statistics declarations and to support export and import declarations in international trade. The eDAPLOS message describes the data crop sheet exchanged between farmers and their partners. This message has allowed users to harmonize the definitions of technical data, develop consensual data dictionaries which can be used as a basis for all the steps of traceability and create a standardized Crop Data Sheet message. DAPLOS, which is based on the UN/CEFACT Core Component Library, has been adopted by 25 000 farmers and regional agriculture chambers in France and Belgium. CITES (the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora) has developed a version of their declaration using the Core Component Library of UN/CEFACT and has generated an XML message according to the specifications of UN/CEFACT. CITES is an international agreement between governments. Its aim is to ensure that international trade in specimens of wild animals and plants does not threaten their survival. The CITES declarations are used in customs clearance procedures in all countries around the globe.  Benefits  Governments, traders and consumers all benefit from having simpler and more cost-effective trade procedures. UN/CEFACT's work is particularly relevant for developing countries, where the elimination of trade-related inefficiencies is many times more beneficial than the reduction or removal of tariff barriers to trade. In addition, UN/CEFACT's work is of particular benefit to landlocked countries and countries distant from major markets. These countries experience challenges and constraints resulting from complex and inefficient procedures, including the creation of many additional costs in bringing goods to market. The gains from this work are considerable for small and medium-sized enterprises, for which the costs of compliance with various trade-related procedures are proportionally higher. This is particularly true in the case of low-value shipments, where the cost of administrative procedures represents a large proportion of total cost. Structure In view of the global character of its work on trade facilitation and electronic business standards, UN/CEFACT is open to representatives of all UN Member States and all organisations recognized by the United Nations Economic and Social Council (ECOSOC). The participation of developing countries and countries in transition in standards development processes is strongly encouraged. The highest authority regarding all aspects of UN/CEFACT's work is the intergovernmental Plenary which meets once a year in Geneva. Delegations to the Plenary include UN Member States, intergovernmental organizations and non-governmental organizations (NGO's) recognized by the Economic and Social Council of the United Nations (ECOSOC). Only UN Member States have the right to vote at Plenary meetings ‚Äì all other members are observers. The Plenary elects the UN/CEFACT Bureau which consists of a Chair and at least four vice-Chairs. The Bureau acts in the name of the Plenary between sessions and meets physically an average of four times per year and more frequently through virtual conference calls. Each UN Member States may nominate a permanent Head of Delegation (HOD) to UN/CEFACT. HODs participate in the Plenary, are consulted by the Bureau on key strategic issues, and are responsible for nominating experts to participate in UN/CEFACT activities. The technical work to develop UN/CEFACT standards and recommendations is done by over 200 volunteer experts from around the world, nominated by HODs. The experts come from both the public and the private sectors, forming a public-private partnership in support of trade facilitation and electronic business. They participate as independent volunteer experts in their own right, without representing any special interests of their countries or institutions. The experts are representatives from: * Governments * Private companies * Intergovernmental organizations * Industry associations (representing large collective groups of private-sector companies) * Academia UN/CEFACT experts meet physically in UN/CEFACT Forums, which are held twice a year (one in Geneva and one hosted by a UN member State) in order to coordinate their work. The vast majority of the work is done virtually between Forums. UNECE provides secretarial support to UN/CEFACT in order that the Centre may implement its programme of work. Annually, the UN/CEFACT Bureau (acting on behalf of the Plenary) and the UNECE Secretariat plan for the implementation of UN/CEFACT's programme of work, taking into account the resources available from both the United Nations and externally. The secretariat takes responsibility for supporting the work of UN/CEFACT including supporting the maintenance of Recommendations and standards; and handles the administrative functions related to UN/CEFACT, including UN oversight, organizing meetings and preparing official documents and papers. The technical work of standards development is undertaken by the UN/CEFACT experts. Some important users of UN/CEFACT norms, standards and recommendations * Governments of Australia, Canada, France and New Zealand: for agricultural trade certificates * Government of Canada: for its air cargo security initiative * Government of France: for eArchiving, the transfer of digital records and public procurement (all under current development) * Government of India: for its ports management system * Government of the Republic of Korea: for public procurement services * Government of the United States of America: for defence contract compliance reporting and for material safety data sheets (the latter being used in transport of dangerous goods) * Governments of Central Asian and South East European (SEE) countries: for Single Window capacity-building and implementation * Asia Pacific Economic Cooperation and Association of Southeast Asian Nations and the Government of India: for development of electronic trade documents * Southeast European countries: for work on customs corridors * World Customs Organization and numerous national Customs administrations, S.W.I.F.T and ISO 20022 (Finance): for data formats and definitions * World Trade Organization negotiators on trade facilitation: as examples of relevant standards and recommendations particularly for aligned documents and Single Windows * Global Standards 1 (GS1): for all trade messages (with approximately 110,000 companies having implemented these) * International insurance industry: for coverage and claims * European gas and electricity industries: for information exchange * Japanese construction industry: for e-tendering * Japanese tourism industry: for rental of small-scale lodging houses * European transport companies: for the exchange of short sea-transport information * Numerous Governments in both developed and developing countries: for aligned documents * Most shipping companies, container operators, terminal operators and others in the maritime shipping industry: for almost all maritime shipping messages through EDIFACT messages.

He denied the supernatural origin of Christianity, and was the first influential critic to investigate the historical Jesus. According to Reimarus, Jesus was a mortal Jewish prophet, and the apostles founded Christianity as a religion separate from Jesus‚Äô own ministry.Theissen, Gerd and Annette Merz. The historical Jesus: a comprehensive guide. Fortress Press. 1998. translated from German (1996 edition). Chapter 1. The quest of the historical Jesus. p. 1‚Äì15. Biography Reimarus was educated by his father and by the scholar J. A. Fabricius, whose son-in-law he subsequently became. He attended school at the Gelehrtenschule des Johanneums. He studied theology, ancient languages, and philosophy at the university of Jena, became Privatdozent at the University of Wittenberg in 1716, and in 1720-21 visited the Netherlands and England. In 1723 he became rector of the high school at Wismar, and in 1727 professor of Hebrew and Oriental languages at his native city's high school. Although he was offered more lucrative positions by other schools, he held this post until his death. His duties were light; and he employed his leisure in the study of philology, mathematics, philosophy, history, political economy, science and natural history, for which he made large collections. His house was the center of the highest culture of Hamburg; and a monument of his influence in that city still remains in the Haus der patriotischen Gesellschaft, where the learned and artistic societies partly founded by him still meet. He had seven children, only three of whom survived him - the distinguished physician Johann Albrecht Heinrich Reimarus, and two daughters, one of them being Elise Reimarus, Lessing's friend and correspondent. Reimarus died on 1 March 1768. Publications Reimarus' reputation as a scholar rests on the valuable edition of Dio Cassius (1750‚Äì52) which he prepared from the materials collected by Johann Andreas Fabricius. He published a work on logic (Vernunftlehre als Anweisung zum richtigen Gebrauche der Vernunft, 1756, 5th ed., 1790), and two popular books on the religious questions of the day. The first of these was a collection of essays on the principal truths of natural religion (Abhandlungen von den vornehmsten Wahrheiten der nat√ºrlichen Religion, 1755, 7th ed., 1798); the second (Betrachtungen √ºber die Triebe der Thiere, 1760, 4th ed., 1798)The second edition can be found online : , 2nd ed. Hamburg: Johann Carl Bohn, 1762 dealt with one particular branch of the same subject. But Reimarus' main contribution to theological science was his analysis of the historical Jesus, Apologie oder Schutzschrift f√ºr die vern√ºnftigen Verehrer Gottes (\\"An apology for, or some words in defense of, reasoning worshipers of God\\" ‚Äî read by only a few intimate friends during his lifetime), which he left unpublished. After Reimarus' death, Gotthold Ephraim Lessing published parts of this work as \\"Fragments by an Anonymous Writer\\" in his Zur Geschichte und Literatur in 1774-1778, giving rise to what is known as the Fragmentenstreit. This had a deep impact as the beginning of critical research of the historical Jesus. Reimarus pointed out the differences between what Jesus said and what the apostles said, identifying Jesus as a Jewish preacher. Jesus, according to this view, was an apocalyptic prophet preaching about a worldly kingdom soon to come. This view still has currency within modern scholarship. Reimarus also considered Christianity to be a fabrication. Reimarus' philosophical position is essentially that of Christian Wolff, but he is best known for his Apologie as excerpted by Lessing in what became known as the Wolfenb√ºttel Fragmente. The original manuscript is in the Hamburg town library. A copy was made for the university library of G√∂ttingen, 1814, and other copies are known to exist. In addition to the seven fragments published by Lessing, a second portion of the work was issued in 1787 by C. A. E. Schmidt (a pseudonym), under the title √úbrige noch ungedruckte Werke des Wolfenb√ºttelschen Fragmentisten, and a further portion by D. W. Klose in Christian Wilhelm Niedner's Zeitschrift f√ºr historische Theologie, 1850-52. The complete work has been published as edited by Gerhard Alexander (2 vols, Frankfurt am Main: Insel, 1972). D. F. Strauss has given an exhaustive analysis of the whole work in his book on Reimarus. The standpoint of the Apologie is that of pure naturalistic deism. Miracles and mysteries are denied and natural religion is put forward as the absolute contradiction of revealed religion. The essential truths of the former are the existence of a wise and good Creator and the immortality of the soul. These truths are discoverable by reason, and can constitute the basis of a universal religion. A revealed religion could never obtain universality, as it could never be intelligible and credible to all men. However, the Bible does not present such a revelation. It abounds in error as to matters of fact, contradicts human experience, reason and morals, and is one tissue of folly, deceit, enthusiasm, selfishness and crime. Moreover, it is not a doctrinal compendium, or catechism, which a revelation would have to be. According to Reimarus, the Old Testament says little of the worship of God, and that little is worthless, while its writers are unacquainted with the second fundamental truth of religion, the immortality of the soul (see sheol). The design of the writers of the New Testament, as well as that of Jesus, was not to teach true rational religion, but to serve their own selfish ambitions, thereby exhibiting an amazing combination of conscious fraud and enthusiasm. However, it is important to remember that Reimarus attacked atheism with equal effect and sincerity. Analysis Estimates of Reimarus may be found in the works of B. P√ºnjer, Otto Pfleiderer and Harald H√∏ffding. P√ºnjer states the position of Reimarus as follows: \\"God is the Creator of the world, and His wisdom and goodness are conspicuous in it. Immortality is founded upon the essential nature of man and upon the purpose of God in creation. Religion is conducive to our happiness and alone brings satisfaction. Miracles are at variance with the divine purpose; without miracles there could be no revelation.\\"P√ºnjer, History of Christian Philosophy of Religion since Kant, Engl. trans., pp. 550‚Äì57, which contains an exposition of the Abhandlungen and Schutzschrift. Pfleiderer says the errors of Reimarus were that he ignored historical and literary criticism, sources, date, origin, etc., of documents, and the narratives were said to be either purely divine or purely human. He had no conception of an immanent reason.Philosophy of Religion, Eng. trans., vol. i. p. 102. H√∏ffding also has a brief section on the Apologie, stating its main position as follows: :\\"Natural religion suffices; a revelation is therefore superfluous. Moreover, such a thing is both physically and morally impossible. God cannot interrupt His own work by miracles; nor can He favour some men above others by revelations which are not granted to all, and with which it is not even possible for all to become acquainted. But of all doctrines that of eternal punishment is most contrary, Reimarus thinks, to true ideas of God; and it was this point which first caused him to stumble.\\"History of Modern Philosophy, Eng. trans. 1900, vol. ii. pp. 12, 13. The work of Reimarus is highly praised in Albert Schweitzer. While calling the views expressed in the Fragments mistaken in some respects and one-sided, Schweitzer describes the essay on \\"The Aims of Jesus and His Disciples\\" as not only \\"one of the greatest events in the history of criticism\\" but also \\"a masterpiece of general literature\\". Lessing's third excerpt in Fragments, \\"On the Passing of the Israelites Through the Red Sea,\\" is said to be \\"one of the ablest, wittiest and most acute which has ever been written.\\"Von Reimarus zu Wrede, English translation by W. Montgomery as The Quest of the Historical Jesus. Richard N. Soulen points out that Reimarus \\"is treated as the initiator of ‚ÄòLives of Jesus Research‚Äô by Schweitzer and accorded special honor by him for recognizing that Jesus' thought-world was essentially eschatological, a fact overlooked until the end of the 19th century.\\"Handbook of Biblical Criticism, Atlanta 1981, pp. 166‚Äì7. Werner Georg K√ºmmel argues that Reimarus saw the need to distinguish between the proclamation of the historical Jesus and the proclamation of the Early Church and to ask to what extent Jesus himself is the origin of his followers' break with Judaism.

It has been the home of Liverpool Football Club since their formation in 1892. It was originally the home of Everton from 1884 to 1891, before they moved to Goodison Park after a dispute with the club president. The stadium has four stands: the Spion Kop, the Main Stand, the Sir Kenny Dalglish Stand and the Anfield Road End. The record attendance of 61,905 was set at a match between Liverpool and Wolverhampton Wanderers in 1952. The ground converted to an all-seater stadium in 1994 as a result of the Taylor Report, which reduced its capacity. Two gates at the stadium are named after former Liverpool managers: Bill Shankly and Bob Paisley. Both managers have been honoured with statues outside the stadium: Shankly's unveiled in 1997 by the Kop Stand and Paisley's in 2020 by the Main Stand. The ground is from Liverpool Lime Street railway station. It was proposed in 2002 to replace the stadium with a new one in the adjacent Stanley Park, but after the acquisition of Liverpool F.C. by Fenway Sports Group in 2010 it was made clear this would not happen. Construction for an extension to the Main Stand began on 8 December 2014.\\"Carillion to start work on ¬£75m Anfield expansion\\". The Telegraph. Retrieved 17 January 2015 This extension, one of the largest all- seater single stands in European football, opened to the public on 9 September 2016 increasing the stadium capacity to 54,074. There are future plans to expand the Anfield Road Stand which would bring the stadium size to around 61,000. History Memorial to John Houlding outside Anfield on the 125th anniversary of Liverpool F.C. The name Anfield comes from the old town land of \\"Annefield\\" outside New Ross, County Wexford in Ireland. Opened in 1884, Anfield was originally owned by John Orrell, a minor land owner who was a friend of Everton F.C. member John Houlding.Kelly (1988). p. 13. Everton, who previously played at Priory Road, were in need of a new venue owing to the noise produced by the crowd on match days. Orrell lent the pitch to the club in exchange for a small rent. The first match at the ground was between Everton and Earlestown on 28 September 1884, which Everton won 5‚Äì0.Liversedge (1991). p. 112. During Everton's tenure at the stadium, stands were erected for some of the 8,000-plus spectators regularly attending matches, although the ground was capable of holding around 20,000 spectators and occasionally did. The ground was considered of international standard at the time, playing host to the British Home Championship match between England and Ireland in 1889. Anfield's first league match was played on 8 September 1888, between Everton and Accrington F.C. Everton quickly improved as a team, and became Anfield's first league champions in the 1890‚Äì91 season. In 1892, negotiations to purchase the land at Anfield from Orrell escalated into a dispute between Houlding and the Everton F.C. committee over how the club was run. Events culminated in Everton's move to Goodison Park. Houlding was left with an empty stadium, and decided to form a new club to occupy it. The new team was called Liverpool F.C. and Athletic Grounds Ltd, and the club's first match at Anfield was a friendly played in front of 200 people on 1 September 1892, against Rotherham Town. Liverpool won 7‚Äì1.Kelly (1988). p. 187. The alt=A white flagpole in front of football ground Liverpool's first Football League match at Anfield was played on 9 September 1893, against Lincoln City. Liverpool won 4‚Äì0 in front of 5,000 spectators.Graham (1984). p. 15. A new stand capable of holding 3,000 spectators was constructed in 1895 on the site of the present Main Stand. Designed by architect Archibald Leitch, the stand had a distinctive red and white gable, and was similar to the main stand at Newcastle United's ground St James' Park. Another stand was constructed at the Anfield Road end in 1903, built from timber and corrugated iron. After Liverpool had won their second League championship in 1906, a new stand was built along the Walton Breck Road. Local journalist Ernest Edwards, who was the sports editor of newspapers the Liverpool Daily Post and Echo, named it the Spion Kop; it was named after a famous hill in South Africa where a local regiment had suffered heavy losses during the Boer War in 1900. More than 300 men had died, many of them from Liverpool, as the British army attempted to capture the strategic hilltop. Around the same period a stand was also built along Kemlyn Road.Kelly (1988). p. 117. The ground remained much the same until 1928, when the Kop was redesigned and extended to hold 30,000 spectators, all standing. A roof was erected as well.Liversedge (1991). p. 113. Many stadia in England had stands named after the Spion Kop. Anfield's was the largest Kop in the country at the time‚Äîit was able to hold more supporters than some entire football grounds. In the same year the topmast of the , one of the first iron ships, was rescued from the ship breaking yard at nearby Rock Ferry, and was hauled up Everton Valley by a team of horses, to be erected alongside the new Kop. It still stands there, serving as a flag pole. The Kop in 1983, before the Taylor Report recommended standing areas in football grounds be outlawed following the Hillsborough disaster in 1989. Floodlights were installed at a cost of ¬£12,000 in 1957. On 30 October they were switched on for the first time for a match against Everton to commemorate the 75-year anniversary of the Liverpool County Football Association. In 1963 the old Kemlyn Road stand was replaced by a cantilevered stand, built at a cost of ¬£350,000, accommodating 6,700 spectators.Inglis (1983). p. 210. Two years later alterations were made at the Anfield Road end, turning it into a larger covered standing area with refreshments under the structure. The biggest redevelopment came in 1973, when the old Main Stand was partially demolished and extended backwards with new roof. Simultaneously the concrete pylon floodlights were demolished with new lights installed along the rooflines of the Kemlyn Road and Main Stands. The new stand was officially opened by the Duke of Kent on 10 March 1973. In the 1980s the paddock in front of the Main Stand was turned into seating, and in 1982 seats were introduced at the Anfield Road end. The Shankly Gates were erected in 1982, a tribute to former manager Bill Shankly; his widow Nessie unlocked them for the first time on 26 August 1982. Across the Shankly Gates are the words You'll Never Walk Alone, the title of the hit song by Gerry and the Pacemakers adopted by Liverpool fans as the club's anthem during Shankly's time as manager.Smith (2008). pp. 68‚Äì69. Coloured seats and a police room were added to the Kemlyn Road stand in 1987. After the Hillsborough disaster in 1989 when Police mismanagement led to overcrowding and the deaths of 96 Liverpool fans, the Taylor Report recommended that all grounds in the country should be converted into all-seater grounds by May 1994. A second tier was added to the Kemlyn Road stand in 1992, turning it into a double-decker layout. It included executive boxes and function suites as well as 11,000 seating spaces. Plans to expand the stand had been made earlier, with the club buying up houses on Kemlyn Road during the 1970s, and 1980s, but had to be put on hold until 1990 because two sisters, Joan and Nora Mason, refused to sell their house. When the club reached an agreement with the sisters in 1990, the expansion plans were put into action.Moynihan (2008). p. 125. The stand‚Äîrenamed the Centenary Stand‚Äîwas officially opened on 1 September 1992 by UEFA president Lennart Johansson. The Kop was rebuilt in 1994 after the recommendations of the Taylor Report and became all seated; it is still a single tier, and the capacity was significantly reduced to 12,390. The Shankly Gates were erected in 1982 in tribute to Bill Shankly On 4 December 1997, a bronze statue of Bill Shankly was unveiled at the visitors' centre in front of the Kop. Standing at over tall, the statue depicts Shankly with a fan's scarf around his neck, in a familiar pose he adopted when receiving applause from fans. Inscribed on the statue are the words \\"Bill Shankly ‚Äì He Made The People Happy\\".Moynihan (2008). p. 103. The Hillsborough memorial was situated alongside the Shankly Gates before it was moved next to 96 Avenue in front of the redeveloped main stand in 2016. The memorial is always decorated with flowers and tributes to the 96 people who died in 1989 as a result of the disaster. At the centre of the memorial is an eternal flame, signifying that those who died will never be forgotten. In 1998 a new two-tier Anfield Road end was opened. The stand has encountered a number of problems since its redevelopment; at the beginning of the 1999‚Äì2000 season, a series of support poles and stanchions had to be brought in to give extra stability to the top tier of the stand. During Ronnie Moran's testimonial match against Celtic, many fans complained of movement of the top tier. At the same time that the stanchions were inserted, the executive seating area was expanded by two rows in the main stand, lowering the seating capacity in the paddock. On 30 January 2020, a bronze statue of Bob Paisley was unveiled outside the Main Stand in Paisley Square. The statue was commissioned and donated by the club's main sponsor, Standard Chartered, to celebrate the 10 year anniversary of the relationship with the club.‚ÄúBronze statue unveiled at Anfield to celebrate Bob Paisley legacy‚Äù.

Entry to the stadium is gained by radio-frequency identification (RFID) smart cards rather than the traditional manned turnstile. This system, used in all 80 turnstiles around Anfield, was introduced in 2005. Plans to replace Anfield with a new 60,000-capacity stadium in adjacent Stanley Park were initiated in 2002.\\"Liverpool unveil new stadium\\", BBC Sport, 17 May 2002. Retrieved 18 February 2014. The plans were revisited under the ownership of Tom Hicks and George Gillett.\\"Liverpool unveil new stadium plan\\", BBC Sport, 25 July 2007. Retrieved 18 February 2014 Following the acquisition of Liverpool F.C. by Fenway Sports Group in 2010, the owners have abandoned the proposed new stadium in Stanley Park, preferring instead to redevelop and expand Anfield,Smith, Ben. \\"Liverpool to redevelop Anfield instead of building on Stanley Park\\", BBC Sport, 15 October 2012. Retrieved 18 February 2014 thus echoing their decision to renovate Fenway Park. The Kop is a large single-tiered stand. Originally a large terraced banking providing accommodation for more than 30,000 spectators, the current incarnation was constructed in 1994‚Äì95 and is single-tiered with no executive boxes. The Kop houses the club's museum, the Reducate centre and the official club shop. The Kop is the most-renowned stand at Anfield among home and away supporters, with the people who occupy the stand referred to as kopites. Such was the reputation that the stand had it was claimed that the crowd in the Kop could suck the ball into the goal. Traditionally, Liverpool's most vocal supporters congregate in this stand. alt=steps leading down to tunnel, above the tunnel is a sign with This Is Anfield in white letters on a red background, with a crest on it The oldest stand at Anfield is the Main Stand, taking 76 years to complete. The stand was completed in 2016, however, the lower section dates from 1906. The bottom tier of the stand houses the directors' box. The directors' VIP box is located at the rear of the lower tier of the stand. The old large roof was supported by two thin central uprights, with a large suspended television camera gantry which has moved to the front of the third tier.Inglis (1983). p. 211. The players' tunnel and the technical area where the managers and substitutes sit during the match are in the middle of the stand at pitch level. Above the stairs leading down to the pitch hung a sign stating \\"THIS IS ANFIELD\\". Its purpose was to both intimidate the opposition and to bring the Liverpool players who touch it good luck. Accordingly, Liverpool players and coaching staff traditionally reached up and placed one or both hands on it as they passed underneath.Moynihan (2008). p. 110. The sign was temporarily removed during the most recent reconstruction of the Main Stand; it was placed at the exit from the new Main Stand tunnel to the pitch in advance of Liverpool's 2016‚Äì17 home opener. Current Liverpool manager J√ºrgen Klopp had banned players from touching the restored sign until the team had won at least one major trophy. After winning the 2019 UEFA Champions League Final players are now allowed to do so again. Praising the impact the Anfield atmosphere has on the home team and the effect it has on the away team, opposition manager Pep Guardiola states, ‚ÄúThe motto ‚ÄòThis is Anfield‚Äô is no marketing spin. There's something about it that you will find in no other stadium in the world.‚Äù The Paisley Gateway was erected outside the Kop in 1999 in tribute to former manager Bob Paisley. It includes a depiction of the three European Cups he won during his tenure. The Sir Kenny Dalglish Stand is a two-tiered stand. Originally a single-tiered stand called the Kemlyn Road Stand, the second tier was added in 1992 to coincide with the club's centenary. It is located opposite the Main Stand and houses directors' boxes, which are between the two tiers. The stand also houses the ground's police station. On 3 May 2017, Liverpool announced the Centenary Stand would be renamed the Kenny Dalglish Stand in honour of the club's greatest servant, former player and manager Kenny Dalglish. The Anfield Road stand, on the left side of the Main Stand, houses the away fans during matches. The Anfield Road End was rebuilt in 1965, and multi-coloured seats were added in 1982. Originally a single-tier stand, a further revamp, which was completed in 1998, gave the stand a second-tier providing additional seating. There are 59 spaces available in the stadium to accommodate wheelchair users who have season tickets; a further 33 spaces are available for general sale and 8 are allocated to away supporters. These spaces are located in the Main Stand, Anfield Road Stand and The Kop. There are 38 spaces available for the visually impaired, which are situated in the old paddock area of the Main Stand, with space for one personal assistant each. A headset with full commentary is provided. The stadium features tributes to two of the club's most successful managers. The Paisley Gateway is a tribute to Bob Paisley, who guided Liverpool to three European Cups and six League Championships in the 1970s, and 1980s. The gates were erected at the Kop; their design includes representations of the three European Cups Paisley won during his tenure, the crest of his birthplace in Hetton-le-Hole, and the crest of Liverpool F.C.Moynihan (2008). p. 88. The Shankly Gates, in tribute of Bill Shankly, Paisley's predecessor between 1959 and 1974, are at the Anfield Road end. Their design includes a Scottish flag, a Scottish thistle, the Liverpool badge, and the words \\"You'll Never Walk Alone\\".Moynihan (2008). p. 31. Redevelopment =Abandoned new stadium plans= The Kop; the atmosphere generated by the crowd in the stand led owner John W. Henry to reconsider the construction of a new stadium. Plans to replace Anfield were originally started by Liverpool F.C. in May 2002. The proposed capacity was 55,000, but it was later changed to 61,000, with 1,000 seats given for segregation between home and away fans. Several attempts were made between 2003 and 2007 by the Liverpool City Council to instigate a groundshare of the proposed stadium with local rivals Everton, but this move was rejected, as neither club favoured it. On 30 July 2004 Liverpool was granted planning permission to build a new stadium away from Anfield at Stanley Park. On 8 September 2006 Liverpool City Council agreed to grant Liverpool F.C. a 999-year lease of the land on the proposed site. Following the takeover of Liverpool F.C. on 6 February 2007 by George Gillett and Tom Hicks, the proposed stadium was redesigned. In November 2007 the redesigned layout was approved by the council, and construction was due to start in early 2008. The new stadium, provisionally called Stanley Park Stadium, was to be built by HKS, Inc.. It was scheduled to open in August 2011 with a capacity of 60,000. If the new stadium had been built, Anfield would have been demolished. The land would have become home to the centrepiece for the Anfield Plaza development, which would have included a hotel, restaurants, and offices. However, the construction of Stanley Park was delayed following the economic crisis of 2008 and the subsequent recession, which directly affected the then American owners. The situation was worsened because the club was bought with borrowed money, not the owners' capital, and interest rates were higher than expected. Hicks and Gillett promised to begin work on the stadium within 60 days of acquisition of the club, but had trouble financing the estimated ¬£500 million needed for the Stanley Park development. The deadline passed and the plan was eventually cancelled by the Fenway Sports Group, as their preference was to re-develop Anfield. =Anfield redevelopment= The acquisition of Liverpool F.C. by Fenway Sports Group in October 2010 put into question whether Liverpool would leave Anfield. In February 2011 the new club owner, John W. Henry, stated he had a preference for staying at Anfield and expanding the capacity. After attending a number of games at Anfield, Henry stated that \\"the Kop is unrivalled\\", adding \\"it would be hard to replicate that feeling anywhere else\\". On 15 October 2012, Liverpool City Council announced plans to regenerate the Anfield area after securing a ¬£25m grant, with a housing association also set to invest. The Main Stand redevelopment in March 2016 On 23 August 2013 Anfield was listed as an Asset of Community Value by Liverpool City Council. On 11 September, current owner, John W. Henry announced that they had the funds to afford the expansion but they are waiting for the City Council to finalise the purchase of houses in the area before they commit to plans to expand the Main Stand and the Anfield Road end of the ground. In April 2014 Liverpool F.C. signed a legal agreement with Liverpool City Council and Your Housing Group to redevelop the surrounding Anfield area. This was seen as a significant step towards the renovation of the stadium. The redevelopment was worth around ¬£260 million. Phase one (2015‚Äì16): main stand redevelopment On 23 April 2014, Liverpool F.C. revealed plans for an expansion of the Main Stand, which involved adding new third tier, new matchday facilities and enhanced corporate facilities. The new stand would add 8,500 seats and take the capacity of the stadium to 54,742. Work began on 8 December 2014, with the club aiming for the new stand to be match-ready and operational for the start of the 2016‚Äì17 season. The work was undertaken by Carillion. The structure of new stand was uniquely constructed around the existing main stand to enable the existing stand to continue to be used at full operational capacity during the 2015‚Äì16 season. Demolition of the existing stand took place in summer 2016, allowing for the construction of the lower tiers of the new stand during the off- season. Consisting of 1.8 million bricks and blocks and over 5000 tonnes of steel, the stand was opened on schedule on 9 September 2016 for the first home game of the 2016‚Äì17 season, a 4‚Äì1 victory over Leicester City. Further internal construction work including new changing rooms and media facilities continued until April 2017. New club superstore and matchday experience enhancements (2016‚Äì17) In May 2016, outline planning permission was granted by Liverpool council for the construction of a new 1,800 sq m club superstore development, situated on Walton Breck Road on the corner of the Kop and the new Main Stand. Construction began in December 2016, with the store opening early in the 2017‚Äì18 season. The space between the new store and the stadium was developed into a \\"fan zone\\", with new catering outlets and pre- match entertainment. Proposed phase two: Anfield Road redevelopment The second phase of Anfield's redevelopment is to redevelop the Anfield Road stand. The club received initial outline planning permission in 2014 for the redevelopment, with seating to be increased by 4,825, giving Anfield a total capacity of 58,000. However, in August 2019, Liverpool allowed the planning permission associated with the original 2014 designs to lapse, confirming their intention to submit \\"ambitious new plans\\" for the Anfield Road End redevelopment which are believed to increase the capacity further to take the overall capacity of Anfield to comfortably above 60,000. The club is currently finalising plans and consulting local residents, planning officials and other stakeholders with a view to submitting the new plans for approval in the near future. If everything goes according to plan, it is estimated that work will begin at the end of 2020 and be completed in the summer of 2022. The redevelopment will focus on the upper tier of the stand, with the lower tier remaining unchanged. Construction work will be completed behind the existing stand and, according to current plans, will be connected to the lower tier in the off-season in 2022. Therefore, Anfield's capacity is not expected to be affected throughout the duration of the works.‚ÄúLiverpool unveil new plans for ¬£60m Anfield redevelopment to boost capacity to 61,000 in 2022‚Äù.

The first international match hosted at Anfield was between England and Ireland, in 1889. England won the match 6‚Äì1. Anfield was also the home venue for several of England's international football matches in the early 1900s, and for the Welsh national team in the later part of that century.Kelly (1988). p. 118. Anfield has also played host to five FA Cup semi-finals, the last of which was in 1929. The most recent international to be hosted at Anfield was England's 2‚Äì1 victory over Uruguay on 1 March 2006. England has played two testimonial matches against Liverpool at Anfield. The first was in 1983, when England faced Liverpool for Phil Thompson's testimonial. Then, in 1988, England visited again for Alan Hansen's testimonial.Moynihan (2008). p. 59. Liverpool's arch rival Manchester United played their first home game of the 1971‚Äì72 season at Anfield as they were banned from playing their first two home league matches at Old Trafford after an incident of hooliganism. United beat Arsenal 3‚Äì1. In November 2019, Anfield hosted a Women's Super League fixture for the first time, with the 6th matchday of the 2019‚Äì20 season featuring a derby between Liverpool FC Women and local rivals Everton FC Women. The stadium has hosted five rugby league matches: the 1989 Charity Shield between Widnes and Wigan; the 1991 World Club Challenge between Wigan, winners of the RFL Championship, and Penrith Panthers, winners of the Australian NSWRL Premiership, with an attendance of 20,152; a 1997 St. Helens Super League home game against Castleford Tigers, with an attendance of 12,329; and the 2016 Rugby League Four Nations Final, in front of 40,042 people. Anfield was chosen as the venue for the 2019 Magic Weekend after two test matches were played there in 2016 and 2018. After previously choosing games that were local derbies or competitive games, in 2019 the fixtures were determined by the previous seasons league position. Robert Elstone, Super League Chief Executive, said ‚ÄúOn behalf of the Super League clubs, we‚Äôre delighted to be taking the Dacia Magic Weekend to one of the most famous stadiums in the world. Anfield has been the venue for many other events. During the mid-twenties, Anfield was the finishing line for the city marathon. Liverpool held an annual race which started from St George's plateau in the city centre and finished with a lap of Anfield. Boxing matches were regularly held at Anfield during the inter-war years, including a number of British boxing championships; on 12 June 1934 Nel Tarleton beat Freddie Miller for the World Featherweight title. Professional tennis was played at Anfield on boards on the pitch. US Open champion, Bill Tilden, and Wimbledon champion, Fred Perry, entertained the crowds in an exhibition match. In 1958, an exhibition basketball match featuring the Harlem Globetrotters was held at the ground.Inglis (1983). p. 209. =Non sporting events= Aside from sporting uses, Anfield has been a venue for musicians of different genres as well as evangelical preachers. One week in July 1984, the American evangelist Billy Graham preached at Anfield, attracting crowds of over 30,000 each night. Anfield was featured in Liverpool's 2008 European Capital of Culture celebrations: 36,000 people attended a concert on 1 June 2008, featuring The Zutons, Kaiser Chiefs, and Paul McCartney. Live concerts made a return to Anfield in the Summer of 2019, with Take That, Bon Jovi and Pink performing. Take That lead singer Gary Barlow, a Liverpool fan, brought out a guest vocalist, Gerry Marsden, and they sang the club's anthem ‚ÄúYou'll Never Walk Alone‚Äù. Records alt=graph showing troughs and peaks of attendance at Anfield The highest attendance recorded at Anfield is 61,905, for Liverpool's match against Wolverhampton Wanderers in the FA Cup fifth round, on 2 February 1952. The lowest attendance recorded at Anfield was 1,000 for a match against Loughborough on 7 December 1895. The highest average attendance of 53,112 was set for the 2016‚Äì17 season. Liverpool did not lose a match at Anfield during the 1893‚Äì94, 1970‚Äì71, 1976‚Äì77, 1978‚Äì79, 1979‚Äì80, 1987‚Äì88, 2008‚Äì09, 2017‚Äì18, 2018‚Äì19 and 2019‚Äì20 seasons. Liverpool's longest unbeaten streak at home extended from January 1978 to January 1981, a period encompassing 85 games, in which Liverpool scored 212 goals and conceded 35. Liverpool's worst losing streak at Anfield is three games. This has occurred three times in the club's history to date (1899‚Äì1900, 1906‚Äì07 and 1908‚Äì09 seasons). The most consecutive league wins at Anfield is 24, this is the longest run in English top-flight history. It has been accomplished across the 2018‚Äì19 and 2019‚Äì20 seasons. Transport The stadium is about from Lime Street Station, which lies on a branch of the West Coast Main Line from London Euston. Kirkdale Station, about from the stadium, is the nearest station to Anfield. Fans travelling by train for matches may book direct to Anfield or Goodison Park, changing to the Peoplesbus Soccerbus service at Sandhills Station on the Merseyrail Northern Line. The stadium has no parking facilities for supporters, and the streets around the ground allow parking only for residents with permits, although there are a small number of passes that can be allocated to over-65s. There are proposals under consideration for reinstating passenger traffic on the Bootle Branch, which would cut the distance from the nearest railway station to about .

Education Jarvis graduated from Mohawk Central High School (later renamed to Gregory B. Jarvis High School, which eventually became the Gregory B. Jarvis Middle School in his honor), in Mohawk, New York, in 1962. He received a B.S. degree in electrical engineering from the State University of New York at Buffalo in 1967, and a M.S. degree in the same discipline from Northeastern University in 1969. Jarvis joined the United States Air Force the same year and served until 1973, when he was honorably discharged as a Captain. Thereafter he worked for Hughes Aircraft. Space Shuttle Challenger disaster In June 1984, Jarvis was one of two Hughes Aircraft employees selected as candidates for the Space Shuttle program. He planned to conduct experiments regarding the effects of weightlessness on fluids. Jarvis was originally scheduled to make his shuttle flight in April 1985, but his spot on that flight was replaced by U.S. senator Jake Garn. His flight was rescheduled for early January 1986, but he was again replaced ‚Äì this time by U.S. representative Bill Nelson. Jarvis was Payload Specialist 2 on STS-51-L which was launched from the Kennedy Space Center, Florida, at 11:38:00 EST on January 28, 1986. The crew on board the Orbiter Challenger included Commander Dick Scobee, pilot Michael J. Smith (USN), mission specialists Dr. Ronald McNair, Lt. Col. Ellison Onizuka (USAF), Dr. Judith Resnik, and fellow civilian payload specialist, Christa McAuliffe. The entire STS-51-L crew died on January 28, 1986, when Challenger broke up during launch. The remains of all seven astronauts from the Challenger disaster were discovered in the crew decks on the ocean floor. Jarvis' body was discovered in the lower mid-deck along with McNair and McAuliffe. During salvage operations to raise the crew deck from the ocean floor, his body escaped from the wreckage, floated to the surface, and disappeared back into the sea. On April 15, 1986, on the last scheduled attempt to recover wreckage, it was rediscovered and returned to shore. Jarvis was cremated and his ashes scattered in the Pacific Ocean. Awards and honors The East Engineering building on University at Buffalo (SUNY) north campus was renamed Jarvis Hall after Gregory Jarvis' death. In Spring of 1986, when the university had not yet named the building in his memory, students nailed a sign with the name \\"Jarvis Hall\\" onto the side of the building as a show of support for the deceased astronaut. In 1987, the name was made official with a dedication ceremony. Jarvis Hall is devoted largely to Aerospace Engineering and engineering support services. Mohawk Central High School in Mohawk, NY was renamed Gregory B. Jarvis Jr/Sr High School. It is now the Gregory B. Jarvis Middle School of the Central Valley Central School District. Jarvis was portrayed by Richard Jenkins in the 1990 TV movie Challenger. In 2004, Jarvis was posthumously awarded the Congressional Space Medal of Honor.

Richard Simon CO (13 May 1638 ‚Äì 11 April 1712), was a French priest, a member of the Oratorians, who was an influential biblical critic, orientalist and controversialist. Early years Simon was born at Dieppe. His early education took place at the Oratorian college there, and a benefice enabled him to study theology at Paris, where he showed an interest in Hebrew and other Oriental languages. He entered the Oratorians as novice in 1662.Fran√ßois Pouillon, Dictionnaire des orientalistes de langue fran√ßaise (2008), p. 900; Google Books. At the end of his novitiate he was sent to teach philosophy at the College of Juilly. But he was soon recalled to Paris, and employed in preparing a catalogue of the Oriental books in the library of the Oratory. Conflicts as Oratorian Simon was ordained a priest in 1670. He then taught rhetoric at Juilly until 1673, having among his students the noted philosopher, Count Henri de Boulainvilliers.Israel, p. 566. Simon was influenced by the ideas of Isaac La Peyr√®re who came to live with the Oratorians (though taking little of the specifics), and by Benedict Spinoza. Simon's approach earned him the later recognition as a \\"Father of the higher criticism\\", though this title is also given to German writers of the following century, as well as to Spinoza himself.Richard Henry Popkin, Isaac La Peyr√®re (1596‚Äì1676): his life, work, and influence (1987), p. 87; Google Books. Simon aroused ill will when he strayed into a legal battle. Fran√ßois Verjus was a fellow Oratorian and friend who was acting against the Benedictines of F√©camp Abbey on behalf of their commendatory abbot, the Prince de Neubourg.Antoine Augustin Bruzen de La Martini√®re , Lettres choisies de M. Simon (1730), p. 25; Google Books. Simon composed a strongly worded memorandum, and the monks complained to the Abb√© Abel-Louis de Sainte-Marthe, Provost General of the Oratory from 1672.L'Oratoire de France The charge of Jesuitism was also brought against Simon, on the grounds that his friend's brother, Father Antoine Verjus, was a prominent member of the Society of Jesus. Suppression of the Histoire critique At the time of the printing of Simon's Histoire critique du Vieux Testament, the work passed the censorship of the University of Paris, and the Chancellor of the Oratory gave his imprimatur. Simon hoped, through the influence of the Jesuit priest, Fran√ßois de la Chaise, the king's confessor, and Charles de Sainte-Maure, duc de Montausier, to be allowed to dedicate the work to King Louis XIV of France; but the king was absent in Flanders. The freedom with which Simon expressed himself, especially where he declared that Moses could not be the author of much in the writings attributed to him, gained attention. The influence of Jacques-Benigne Bossuet, at that time tutor to the Dauphin of France, was invoked; the chancellor, Michael le Tellier, lent his assistance. A decree of the Royal Council was obtained, and, after a series of intrigues, the whole printing, consisting of 1,300 copies, was seized by the police and destroyed. Later life The Oratory then expelled Simon (1678). He retired in 1679 to the curacy of Bolleville, Seine-Maritime. He later returned to Dieppe, where much of his library was lost in the naval bombardment of 1694. http://dieppe76.pagesperso-orange.fr/s-personnages.html http://www.dieppe.fr/mini-sites/reseau-des-bibs-ludos/pages/fonds-richard- simon-557 He died there on 11 April 1712, at the age of seventy-four. Works Most of what Simon wrote in biblical criticism was not really new, given the work of previous critics such as Louis Cappel, Johannes Morinus, and others. In denying that Moses wrote the entire Pentateuch he followed Abraham ben Ezra.William McKane, Selected Christian Hebraists (2005), p. 114; Google Books. The Jesuit tradition of biblical criticism starting with Alfonso Salmeron had paved the way for his approach.John W. O'Malley, The Jesuits: cultures, sciences, and the arts, 1540-1773 (1999), p. 97; Google Books. =Old Testament= The Histoire critique du Vieux Testament (1678) consists of three books. The first deals with the text of the Hebrew Bible and the changes which it has undergone, and the authorship of the Mosaic writings and of other books of the Bible. It presents Simon's theory of the existence during early Jewish history of recorders or annalists of the events of each period, whose writings were preserved in the public archives. The second book gives an account of the main translations, ancient and modern, of the Old Testament. The third discusses biblical commentators. The book had a complicated early development. It appeared, with Simon's name on the title page, in the year 1685, from the press of Reinier Leers in Rotterdam. This Dutch edition, in fact the second, superseded the suppressed French first edition, but differed from it in a number of ways. Simon had hoped to overcome the opposition of Bossuet by making changes; these negotiations with Bossuet lasted a considerable time, but finally broke down. The original French printer of the book, in order to promote sales, had the titles of the chapters printed separately and circulated. These had come into the hands of the Port Royalists, who had undertaken a translation into French of the Prolegomena to Brian Walton's Polyglott. To counteract this, Simon announced his intention of publishing an annotated edition of the Prolegomena, and added to the Histoire critique a translation of the last four chapters of that work, not part of his original plan. Simon's announcement prevented the appearance of the projected translation. A faulty edition of the Histoire critique had previously been published at Amsterdam by Daniel Elzevir, based on a manuscript transcription of one of the copies of the original work which had been sent to England; and from which a Latin translation (Historia critica Veteris Testamenti, 1681, by No√´l Aubert de Vers√©)Israel, p. 576. and an English translation (Critical History of the Old Testament, London, 1682)Schaff-Herzog article were made. The edition of Leers was a reproduction of the work as first printed, with a new preface, notes, and those other writings which had appeared for and against the work up to that date; it included Simon's answers to criticisms of Charles de Veil and Friedrich Spanheim the Younger.Richard Henry Popkin, James E. Force, David S. Katz, Everything connects: in conference with Richard H. Popkin: essays in his honor (1999), p. 41; Google Books. =New Testament= In 1689 appeared Simon's companion Histoire critique du texte du Nouveau Testament, consisting of thirty-three chapters. In it he discusses: the origin and character of the various books, with a consideration of the objections brought against them by the Jews and others; the quotations from the Old Testament in the New; the inspiration of the New Testament (with a refutation of the opinions of Spinoza); the Greek dialect in which they are written (against C. Salmasius); and the Greek manuscripts known at the time, especially Codex Bezae (Cantabrigiensis). There followed in 1690 his Histoire critique des versions du Nouveau Testament, where he gives an account of the various translations, both ancient and modern, and discusses the way in which difficult passages of the New Testament have been rendered in the various versions. In 1693 was published the Histoire critique des principaux commentateurs du Nouveau Testament depuis le commencement du Christianisme jusques a notre tems. Nouvelles Observations sur le texte et les versions du Nouveau Testament (Paris, 1695) contains supplementary observations on the subjects of the text and translations of the New Testament. In 1702 Simon published at Tr√©voux his own translation into French of the New Testament (the version de Tr√©voux). It was substantially based on the Latin Vulgate, but was annotated in such a way as to cast doubt on traditional readings that were backed by Church authority. Again Bossuet did what he could to suppress the work. la-bible.net Despite changes over two decades in how Bossuet was able to exert influence through his circle of contacts, he again mobilised against Simon beyond the boundaries of his diocese. Fabrice Preyat, Le Petit Concile de Bossuet et la christianisation des moeurs et des pratiques litt√©raires sous Louis XIV (2007), p. 252; Google Books. =Other works= As a controversialist, Simon tended to use pseudonyms, and to display bitterness. Simon was early at odds with the Port-Royalists. Antoine Arnauld had compiled with others a work Perp√©tuit√© de la foi (On the Perpetuity of the Faith), the first volume of which dealt with the Eucharist. After Fran√ßois Diroys, who knew both of them, had involved Simon in commenting on the work, Simon's criticisms from 1669 aroused indignation in Arnauld's camp.1902 Britannica article on Simon.Fabrice Preyat, Le Petit Concile de Bossuet et la christianisation des moeurs et des pratiques litt√©raires sous Louis XIV (2007), p. 119; Google Books. Simon's first major publication followed, his Fides Ecclesiae orientalis, seu Gabrielis Metropolitae Philadelphiensis opuscula, cum interpretatione Latina, cum notis (Paris, 1671), on a work of (1541‚Äì1616), the object of which was to demonstrate that the belief of the Greek Church regarding the Eucharist was the same as that of the Church of Rome. In 1670 he had written a pamphlet in defence of the Jews of Metz, who had been accused of having murdered a Christian child. C√©r√©monies et coutumes parmi les Juifs by Leon of Modena, translated by Simon. Simon published in 1675 a translation of the travels of Girolamo Dandini in Lebanon, as Voyage au Mont Liban (1675).Guy G. Stroumsa, A New Science: the discovery of religion in the Age of Reason (2010), p. 183 note 9; Google Books. Dandini was a perceptive observer, and Simon in his preface argued for the utility of travel to theologians.Stroumsa, p. 64; Google Books. In 1676 contacts with Huguenots at Charenton led Simon to circulate a manuscript project for a new version of the Bible.Rens Bod, Jaap Maat, Thijs Weststeijn, The Making of the Humanities: Volume I: Early Modern Europe, Volume 1 (2011), p. 345 note 18; Google Books. This was a sample for a proposed improved edition of the Giovanni Diodati translation; but after Simon had translated the Pentateuch the funding ran out.Magne Saebo, Hebrew Bible, Old Testament: From the Renaissance to the Enlightenment [1300-1800] (2008), p. 555; Google Books. =Reception= The Histoire critique du Vieux Testament encountered strong opposition from Catholics who disliked Simon's diminishing of the authority of the Church Fathers.Watson E. Mills, Mercer Commentary on the New Testament (2003), p. 42; Google Books. Protestants widely felt that an infallible Bible was threatened by doubts which Simon raised against the integrity of the Hebrew text; and indeed Simon as basic tenets argued against sola scripturaDavid Lyle Jeffrey, Gregory P. Maillet, Christianity and Literature: Philosophical Foundations and Critical Practice (2011), p. 221; Google Books. and in favour of the Catholic Church tradition of interpretation. Jean Le Clerc, in his 1685 work Sentimens de quelques th√©ologiens de Hollande, controverted the views of Simon acutely, and claimed that an uninformed reader might take Simon to be any of a Calvinist, Jew or crypto-Spinozan; Bossuet made a point of banning this also, as even more harmful than Simon's book.Israel, p. 100 and p. 452 It was answered in R√©ponse aux Sentimens de quelques th√©ologiens de Hollande by Simon (1686). In France, Simon's work became well known and widely circulated, despite Bossuet's hostility and efforts to keep it marginal. √âtienne Fourmont was in effect a disciple of Simon, if not acknowledging the fact.William Johnstone, The Bible and the Enlightenment: a case study, Dr. Alexander Geddes (1737‚Äì1802) (2004), p. 89; Google Books. Another orientalist influenced by Simon was Nicolas Barat. An important eighteenth century biblical critic in France that did use Simon's work on the Hebrew Bible was Jean Astruc.Richard H. Popkin, Isaac de la Peyr√®re (1596‚Äì1676): His Life, Work, and Influence, Leiden, E. J. Brill, 1987, p. 74; Google Books The identity of the translator of the 1682 English version Critical History of the Old Testament is unclear, being often given as a Henry Dickinson who is an obscure figure, and sometimes as John Hampden; John Dryden wrote his Religio Laici in response with a dedication to Dickinson, and Simon's work became well known. Isaac Newton took an interest in Simon's New Testament criticism in the early 1690s, pointed out to him by John Locke, adding from it to an Arian summary of his views that was intended for publication by Le Clerc, but remained in manuscript.Richard S. Westfall, Never at Rest: A biography of Isaac Newton (1983), pp. 490‚Äì1. Later Samuel Clarke published his The Divine Authority of the Holy Scriptures Asserted (1699) in reply to Simon. Simon's works were later an influence on Johann Salomo Semler.Joel B. Green, Hearing the New Testament: strategies for interpretation (1995), p. 12; Google Books. Pope Leo XIII's 1897 catalogue of condemned books contains several works by Richard Simon.

Some hazardous substances have their own UN numbers (e.g. acrylamide has UN 2074), while sometimes groups of chemicals or products with similar properties receive a common UN number (e.g. flammable liquids, not otherwise specified, have UN 1993). A chemical in its solid state may receive a different UN number than the liquid phase if their hazardous properties differ significantly; substances with different levels of purity (or concentration in solution) may also receive different UN numbers. UN numbers range from UN 0004 to about UN 3548 (UN 0001 ‚Äì UN 0003 are no longer in use) and are assigned by the United Nations Committee of Experts on the Transport of Dangerous Goods. They are published as part of their Recommendations on the Transport of Dangerous Goods, also known as the Orange Book. These recommendations are adopted by the regulatory organization responsible for the different modes of transport. There is no UN number allocated to non-hazardous substances. For more details, see Lists of UN numbers. NA numbers (North America), are issued by the United States Department of Transportation and are identical to UN numbers, except that some substances without a UN number may have an NA number. These additional NA numbers use the range NA 9000 - NA 9279. There are some exceptions, for example NA 2212 is all asbestos with UN 2212 limited to Asbestos, amphibole amosite, tremolite, actinolite, anthophyllite, or crocidolite. Another exception, NA 3334, is self-defense spray, non- pressurized while UN 3334 is aviation regulated liquid, not otherwise specified. For the complete list, see NA/UN exceptions. For more details see List of NA numbers. ID numbers are a third type of identification number used for hazardous substances being offered for Air transport. Substances with an ID number are associated with proper shipping names recognized by the ICAO Technical Instructions. ID 8000, Consumer commodity does not have a UN or NA number, and is classed as a Class 9 hazardous material. Hazard identifiers Associated with each UN number is a hazard identifier, which encodes the general hazard class and subdivision (and, in the case of explosives, their compatibility group). If a substance poses several dangers, then subsidiary risk identifiers may be specified. It is not possible to deduce the hazard class(es) of a substance from its UN number: they have to be looked up in a table.

Life Cappel, a Huguenot, was born at St Elier, near Sedan. He studied theology at the Academy of Sedan and the Academy of Saumur, and Arabic at the University of Oxford, where he spent two years. At the age of twenty-eight he accepted the chair of Hebrew at Saumur, and twenty years later was appointed professor of theology. Amongst his fellow lecturers were Moses Amyraut and Josu√© de la Place. Works As a Hebrew scholar he made a special study of the history of the Hebrew text, which led him to the conclusion that the vowel points and accents are not an original part of the Hebrew language, but had been inserted by the Massorete Jews of Tiberias, no earlier than the 5th century; he also concluded that the primitive Hebrew characters are those now known as the Samaritan, while the square characters are Aramaic and were substituted for the more ancient at the time of the captivity. These conclusions, published anonymously in his book Arcanum punctuationis revelatum (Leiden, 1624), were hotly contested by Johannes Buxtorf II, since they conflicted with those of his father, Johannes Buxtorf senior; Elias Levita had already disputed the antiquity of the vowel points, with which neither Jerome nor the Talmud showed any acquaintance. Eighteenth- century theologian John Gill in his writing, A Dissertation Concerning the Antiquity of the Hebrew Language, Letters, Vowel-Points and Accents, disputed the idea that the vowel points were invented by the Masorites, and claimed that Hebrew authorities removed the vowel points because of their rejection of Jesus as the Messiah.G.A. Riplinger, In Awe of Thy Word, chapter 11 Gill shows that the name Jehovah is documented from before 200 B.C. throughout the centuries of Jewish Authorities, the early Church and the following millennium. He argued that throughout this history the Masorites did not invent the vowel points and accents, but that they were delivered to Moses by God at Sinai, citing Karaite authorities(In Awe of Thy Word, G.A. Riplinger- Chapter 11, page 422-435),A Dissertation Concerning the Antiquity of the Hebrew Language, Letters, Vowel-Points, and Accents, by John Gill, p. 540 Online Mordechai ben Nisan Kukizov (1699) and his associates, who stated that \\"all our wise men with one mouth affirm and profess that the whole law was pointed and accented, as it came out of the hands of Moses, the man of God,\\" The argument of the Karaites shows that some copies have always been pointed and some copies were not pointed with the vowels, especially those copies in Synagogues which Gill talks about.A Dissertation Concerning the Antiquity of the Hebrew Language, John Gill, pp. 548-560 Gill claims that various early sources support the pronunciation of Jehovah, including:Gill, John (1697‚Äì1771). \\"A Dissertation Concerning the Antiquity of the Hebrew Language, Letters, Vowel-Points and Accents\\". *Saadiah Gaon - 927 AD A Dissertation Concerning the Antiquity of the Hebrew Language, John Gill, p. 501 *Jerome - 380 AD A Dissertation Concerning the Antiquity of the Hebrew Language, John Gill, pp. 512-516 *Origen - 250 AD A Dissertation Concerning the Antiquity of the Hebrew Language, John Gill, p. 522 *Zohar - 120 AD A Dissertation Concerning the Antiquity of the Hebrew Language, John Gill, p. 531 *Josephus - 70 AD A Dissertation Concerning the Antiquity of the Hebrew Language, John Gill, p. 533 * Demetrius Phalereus, librarian for Ptolemy II Philadelphus king of Egypt- 277 BCA Dissertation Concerning the Antiquity of the Hebrew Language, John Gill, p. 544 Cappel's understanding was proved through the discovery of the Dead Sea Scrolls, where the Hebrew did not include vowel points. Cappel's second important work, Critica sacra, went further, and was controversial from a theological point of view; having dismissed the antiquity of the vowel points, he now held, based on the various readings in the text and the differences between the ancient versions and the Masoretic text, that the consonantal text of the Hebrew Bible was susceptible to change, corruption, and human interference, which amounted to an attack on the verbal inspiration of Scripture. He had completed the book in 1634, but fierce opposition prevented him from printing it at Paris until 1650, in which he was aided by Jean Morin, who was enthusiastic about the book and agreed with its conclusions.Michael C. Legaspi, Reviving the Dead Letter: Johann David Michaelis and the Quest for Hebrew Antiquity (Oxford University Press, 2010), ch. 1. Bitter as was the opposition to Cappel's views, it was not long before his results were accepted by most scholars. Cappel was also the author of Annotationes et commentarii in Vetus Testamentum and other biblical works, as well as of several other treatises on Hebrew, among which are the Diatribe de veris et antiquis Ebraeorum literis (1645). His Commentarius de Capellorum gente, giving an account of the Cappel family to which he belonged, was published by his nephew James Cappel (1639‚Äì1722), who, at the age of eighteen, became professor of Hebrew at Saumur, but, on the revocation of the edict of Nantes, fled to England.

She was a founding editor of the Yale Journal of Criticism, and serves on the editorial boards of YJC, The Yale Review, and Transition. Early life and education Suleri was born in Pakistan, one of six children, to a Welsh mother, Mair Jones, an English professor, and a Pakistani father, Z. A. Suleri (1913‚Äì1999), a notable political journalist, conservative writer, author, and the Pakistan Movement activist regarded as one of the pioneer of print journalism in Pakistan, and authored various history and political books on Pakistan as well as Islam in the Indian subcontinent.

Two years later, she was awarded an M.A. from Punjab University, and went on to graduate with a PhD from Indiana University in 1983. Career and major works Suleri taught for two years at Williams College in Williamstown, Massachusetts, before she moved to Yale and began teaching there in 1983. Suleri is a founding editor of the Yale Journal of Criticism.

Her 1992 The Rhetoric of English India was well received in literary circles.
