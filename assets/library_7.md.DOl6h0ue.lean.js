The film stars Vijay and Simran, while Manivannan, Dhamu and Vaiyapuri among others play supporting roles. The film, produced by R. B. Choudary, has its score and soundtrack composed by S. A. Rajkumar and cinematography performed by R. Selva. The film turned out to be blockbuster hit at the box office and won two awards at the Tamil Nadu State Film Awards with Simran winning Best Actress and Vijay winning the MGR honorary award. Plot The film begins with Kutty (Vijay) waiting at the Pune rail station for the train back to Chennai. As he continues to stay, he tears off a paper scrap from a pillar that reveals a carving of the name \\"Rukmani\\". The train arrives and Kutty boards a cabin that is boarded by college students from Chennai who are musicians. During the train journey, Kutty starts singing \\"Innisai Paadivarum\\", which catches the attention of everyone and they all begin to sing along with him. After finishing the song, the students applaud Kutty for his singing and ask him whether he's a professional musician and his reason for coming to Pune. Kutty denies this and reveals that he's an ex-convict, having been released from Pune jail after seven years. When asked why he was imprisoned for so long, Kutty explains the reason for his conviction as the film goes for a flashback. Kutty is an aspiring singer while working as a local cable provider run by Mani (Manivannan) in Chennai. A college student Rukmani alias appreciates his songs 'Rukku' (Simran), and she wishes to meet him. But every time they meet, circumstances place Kutty in situations where Rukku dismisses him as a rowdy, unaware that the person she hates and is accusing of being a rowdy is the same person whom she admires. Kutty learns about Rukku's admiration for him and tries to reveal his identity to her, but he still ends up in situations that portray him as a transgressive element.when rukku comes to find kutty mani scoldes kutty . that night when kutty was watching rukku's dance for the orphanage children kutty is unaware that he is peeking from above the girls bathroom. One day while chasing after a pickpocket who stole his wallet, Kutty ends up in Rukku's college where he locates the pickpocket at the other side of a lab room that Rukku happens to be in. Kutty runs into the lab room in front of Rukku and accidentally knocks over a flask containing reactive chemicals that fall into the ground, causing Rukku to go blind. Kutty doesn't learn about Rukku's loss of sight until one rainy day, when he sees her and tries to reveal his identity. After learning that he became the cause for Rukku's blindness, Kutty is wracked with guilt and decides to devote himself to her from then onwards attending to her every need.one day when kutty notices that rukkus bindi is not placed correctly he says to rukku that why don't you take help from your grandmother for which in return rukku says that why don't you place my bindi with your own hands (Romantic ) Kutty begins to fall in love with Rukku and he regularly writes to his mother about the development of love he has for her. Rukku, in turn, learns to respect and love Kutty too, thinking that he is the singer she admires and not knowing that he is the same person she thought was a rowdy and the one who caused her eyesight loss. .when kutty comes to know about his mothers death he goes to the bathroom and cries bitterly.He ask his friend to prepare 2000 ruppes after the check up the doctor says that rukku's eye pupil is damaged due to chemical and cannot regain her eyesight even if she haves a surgery .when kutty's mother dies as she knows that rukku's eyesight is lost she offers her eyes to rukku . To meet the cost of the eye transplant, Kutty offers his kidney to a Pune- based rich man and travels to Pune with Rukku promising that she will never forget him and will wait for him to return. While at the Pune rail station waiting for the train back to Chennai, Kutty carves Rukku's name on one of the pillars (the same carving that was seen at the beginning of the film). Unfortunately, Kutty is arrested by the police after unknowingly agreeing to look after the luggage - which turned out to contain explosives - of another man. Back in the present day, the students ask Kutty whether he was able to get in touch with Rukku during the past seven years to which Kutty replies he wasn't able to and misses her a lot. The students assure Kutty that he will find Rukku and wishes him the best of luck as the train arrives in Chennai. When Kutty comes to the area, he used to live, and he finds that everything has changed during the past 8 years save for a shrine. While contemplating where Rukku might be and the changing environment around him, Kutty sees a passing ambassador car and finds that Rukku is riding in it. Kutty chases after the vehicle while calling out to Rukku and ends up at a Collector's office where it is revealed that Rukku, who had studied for IAS, became a Collector. Kutty calls out to Rukku while being held by an officer whom he accidentally bumped into. However, Rukku, having regained her eyesight, still thinks of Kutty as the rowdy who caused her eyesight loss and orders her officers to arrest him. A shocked Kutty is then knocked unconscious and dragged into the police jeep by the officers. As the jeep reaches the office gates, it collides with a rickshaw that happens to contain Kutty's local cable provider owner Mani. Finding Kutty at the back of the jeep and learning that Rukku gave the order to arrest him, Mani goes to the Collector's office entrance and angrily questions Rukku about Kutty's arrest. During the confrontation, a travelling bus full of people, who accompanied Kutty during his trip back from Pune, sing \\"Innisai Paadivarum\\". Rukku hears them and orders the officers to stop the bus chasing after it with Mani tailing behind. As Rukku boards the bus, she asks the passengers if any of them are Kutty. One of the students then reveals to Rukku that Kutty has come back from Pune and is looking for her. Just then Kutty, who regained consciousness and got out of the police jeep, begins singing \\"Innisai Paadivarum\\". Everyone hears him and runs towards him. As Kutty continues singing, Rukku realises that the person who she accused of being rowdy and accidentally caused her blindness and the person who she admired as a singer and took care of her when she was blind has been Kutty this whole time. After Kutty finishes singing, a pang of guilt- stricken Rukku expresses her joy of finally being able to meet him after so long and tearfully begs for his forgiveness. Kutty forgives her, and the two reunite with each other.

B. Choudary's production house. The film's concept was inspired from Charlie Chaplin starrer City Lights which Ezhil had watched during a film festival. Earlier version of the script showed Vijay's character as a painter. Initial title for the film was \\"Rukmanikkaga\\". But producer RB Chaudhary told the director that he \\"wanted a title like Paarthaal Pasi Theerum\\" and it was titled as Thullatha Manamum Thullum. =Casting= Initially, Ezhil wanted comedian Vadivelu to play the lead role. Vadivelu, who was impressed with the story, has said to Ezhil that the story line was too good and he doesn't know whether it will work with him in the lead. Vadivelu also asked Ezhil to wait for six months, if he didn't get anyone hero then he will act in it then he was replaced by Vijay. On the suggestion of his friends, he decided to make it with a commercial hero and changed the entire script retaining only the emotional core of City Lights. Murali was also considered for the lead role before Vijay was selected. Prior to release, the role of Vijay's mother in the film was kept under wraps with the media speculating who would play the role. Eventually, no actress played the role although the character played a pivotal part in the film. Vijay took a pay cut for the film, accepting only 30 lakh instead of 50 lakh, as he had signed the film before the release of his film Kadhalukku Mariyadhai.starbacks.ca Rambha was initially supposed to do the project, but as the project underwent changes, the actress opted out before she was replaced by Simran. =Filming= The film's shoot began with the \\"Dhuddu\\" song as the director felt it would give the team some time to gel. This was the first Vijay song which Raju Sundaram choreographed. The story takes place in Triplicane because Ezhil had lived there for a while in his uncle's house. The team scouted for long to find a suitable location that fit the story's requirements however a chance visit to the set of a Malayalam film at Murugalaya Studios convinced Ezhil that erecting a set would be far more cost-effective and thus set resembling Triplicane was erected. Soundtrack The soundtrack of the film was composed by S. A. Rajkumar, while lyrics were written by Vairamuthu and Muthu Vijayan. Rajkumar agreed to compose the music for this film after coming to know that Ezhil had assisted Robert-Rajasekaran, the duo who introduced him in films. The song \\"Meghamaai Vandhu\\" which was supposed to be the theme song of the film was inspired from punjabi song sing by Janoon band in 1997 in Pakistan\\"Saiyoni\\" as Ezhil wanted Tamil version of it. But after the song was recorded, he came to know that Deva had used the same tune for \\"Salomiya\\" from Kannedhirey Thondrinal. SA Rajkumar told him not to worry and gave him the tune of \\"Innisai Paadi Varum\\". Release =Reception= A critic from the Deccan Herald mentioned that \\"the experience of seeing the film is simply thrilling\\", mentioning that the success comes from \\"the naivete, the simplicity, the absolute lack of sophistication, and from the delightful hero (Vijay)\\". =Accolades= ;Tamil Nadu State Film Awards * Best Film - Second prize for Best Film * Best Actress - Simran * MGR honorary award - Vijay. Remakes Owing to its success, the film was remade in Kannada as O Nanna Nalle, in Telugu as Nuvvu Vastavani, in Bengali as Sathi, in Odia as I Love You and in Bhojpuri Pyar Jab Kenhu Se Hoi Jala (2008). Legacy The success of the film led to more offers for Simran, who with Thulladha Manamum Thullum and Vaali, established herself among the leading actresses in Tamil films. Vijay and Simran were also paired together in several other films after the success of Thulladha Manamum Thullum, with projects titled Priyamanavale and Udhaya launched weeks after this film's release.

Early life Prince Ahmed was born in Riyadh on 17 November 1958. He was the third eldest son of Salman bin Abdulaziz, King of Saudi Arabia, and Sultana bin Turki Al Sudairi who died in July 2011. She was a daughter of Prince Salman's uncle, Turki bin Ahmed al Sudairi, a former governor of Asir. Ahmed bin Salman is full brother of Prince Fahd, Prince Sultan, Prince Abdulaziz, Prince Faisal and Princess Hassa. Education Prince Ahmed first studied at Colorado School of Mines. He then graduated from Wentworth Military Academy in Lexington, Missouri. After graduation, he returned to Saudi Arabia and joined the Saudi Air Force. Later, Ahmed bin Salman continued his studies in the U.S. and attended University of California, Irvine. He studied comparative culture and graduated from the university in the early 1980s. Career In Saudi Arabia, Ahmed bin Salman joined the Saudi armed forces, before later dealing in business. After leaving the Saudi armed forces in 1985, he established ASAS, a company which specialized in maintenance and contracting. He became chairman of Saudi Research and Marketing Group (SRMG) in 1989, a media company with offices in Riyadh and Jeddah as well as in London and Washington D.C. Prince Ahmed also bought 80 percent of the daily, Asharq Al Awsat, which is a publication of the SRMG. SRMG is reported to be the largest media company in the Middle East. However, the business was worth $90 million when Prince Ahmed took over the company. Its assets had grown to nearly $533 million at the point he died. After his death, his full brother Prince Faisal became the chairman of SRMG. Involvement in horse racing Ahmed bin Salman began horseracing activity with his college friend Richard Mulhall as his horse trainer and eventually his manager of racing operations. First he bought a gray stallion named Jumping Hill. Then, Prince Ahmed began racing under the name Universal Stable until 1994. Later, he created the Thoroughbred Corporation and became the principal partner of this company. In 1999 Ahmed bin Salman won The Derby with Oath. He also won the Preakness and Belmont Stakes with the 2001 horse of the year, Point Given. He also achieved another dream by winning the Kentucky Derby with War Emblem in May 2002, making him the first Arab horse owner to win this race. War Emblem was sold to Prince Ahmed just three weeks before the race after the horse won the Illinois Derby. The price of the horse was $900,000. Prince Faisal, his brother, succeeded him as the head of the Thoroughbred Corporation after his death in 2002. Ahmed bin Salman also owned Spain, horse racing's all-time female money-winner. He is one of only four men to have raced both a Kentucky Derby winner and an Epsom Derby winner. The others are John W. Galbreath, Michael Tabor, and Paul Mellon. Other positions Ahmed bin Salman was appointed secretary-general of the Prince Fahd bin Salman Charitable Association for Kidney Patients, and was a member of the charity‚Äôs board of directors following the death of his elder brother Fahd bin Salman in 2001. Personal life Prince Ahmed was survived by his wife, Lamia bint Mishaal, daughter of Mishaal bin Saud Al Saud. He had four daughters and a son. His family owns three percent of Saudi Research and Marketing Group. Death and double funeral Ahmed bin Salman died of heart failure at age 43 in Riyadh on 22 July 2002. He was buried in Al Oud cemetery on 23 July 2002 after funeral prayers at the Imam Turki bin Abdullah mosque in Riyadh. His cousin, Sultan bin Faisal bin Turki bin Abdullah, brother of Abdullah bin Faisal, was coming to Riyadh to participate in funeral prayers for Prince Ahmed when he was killed in a car crash. The cousins were buried together. War Emblem's win in the Preakness With his college friend Richard Mulhall as trainer, he got into the racing business initially as Universal Stable. In 1994 when the operation resurfaced as The Thoroughbred Corporation, with Mulhall retiring as a trainer and taking on the job of racing manager. Mulhall is currently the president of the operation. The pair would go on to racing greatness, both with sales purchases and homebreds. The Thoroughbred Corp.'s roster reads like a who's who of racing in the past decade, with such greats as Sharp Cat, Lear Fan, Jewel Princess, Windsharp, Military, Royal Anthem, Anees, Officer, Habibti, Spain, 2001 Horse of the Year Point Given, and this year's dual classic winner War Emblem. Currently Thoroughbred Corp. has approximately 60 horses in training mostly stabled with Bob Baffert, D. Wayne Lukas, and John Shireffs, along with 45 broodmares, mostly at Mill Ridge Farm in Lexington. His name will always be associated with War Emblem, his one Kentucky Derby winner, which he quipped was \\"one of the best investments I ever made in my life, besides buying oil in Saudi Arabia,\\" after he won the Preakness. He bought a 90% share in the colt just three weeks before the Derby, and with the win, became the first Arab owner to capture the Roses. Legacy Faisal bin Salman announced in 2004 that Prince Ahmad bin Salman Institute for Applied Media Training would be established to train journalists. Alleged involvement in 9/11 attacks unproven In Why America Slept (2003), Gerald Posner claimed Ahmed bin Salman, along with Sultan bin Faisal bin Turki bin Abdullah, and Prince Fahd bin Turki bin Saud al-Kabir, all had ties to al-Qaeda, and had advance knowledge of the September 11, 2001 attacks. All three died within days of each other, soon after the CIA inquired about their possible connection to the attacks. The story was strongly denied by his family, who claimed he admired the United States, spent a great deal of time at his home there in Bradbury, California, and had invested heavily in the American horse racing industry. His friends in American horse racing stated their knowledge of him and his attitudes made it impossible to believe the allegations. Ancestry  References  Other sources * Posner, Gerald L.

Manu Tupou not only was the founder but remained artistic director until his death in 2004. Founder The American Repertory Company has a weird heritage as it is a product of the great artistic teachers of New York from the mid to late 20th Century. Tupou, being the Artistic Director, shared his wealth of knowledge that had been passed down from his teachers. He studied with Lee Strasberg for 15 years at The Actors Studio, where he remained a senior lifetime member. Although his primary teacher was Strasberg, he also studied with the other greats such as Uta Hagen, Stella Adler, Sanford Meisner, and Harold Clurman. His studies with the aforementioned as well as his collegiate studies coupled with his understanding of nature as a life force in itself that benefits the artist, was the core of what The American Repertory had to offer for its select students. It was a private company which offered classes limited to no more than 12 or 15 students at the very maximum at a time as well as private training. This allowed Tupou to give focus on his students in detail and find their working problem and remedy it. Although Tupou brought with him the teachings of the great acting teachers, he reformulated much of the techniques to not only enhance the actors' training but to also protect their sanity. Being classmates with Al Pacino, Robert De Niro, Shelley Winters etc. during the heyday of sense memory, Tupou experienced first hand the long-term effects of the resultant damage that some of these techniques can cause. He sought to revamp these techniques while retaining their strength and intensity in order to protect the actors' sanity. The new technique was called the New Era Acting Technique (NEAT). Technique and training Gleaning true knowledge and workable applications from his extensive educational experience in the arts, Manu Tupou formulated his discoveries into the simplistic, but revolutionary, \\"New Era Acting Technique\\" (NEAT). The hallmark of the NEAT technique is its respect for the sanctity and sanity of the individual artist‚Äîupgrading the artist's creation away from the limitations of memory and recalled past experiences, into a more redeeming and uplifting \\"slice of life\\", happening here and now in present time. This was the major difference in approach from the way his mentor Lee Strasberg taught Tupou and his classmates. One of the main philosophies behind the technique is that each talent is a unique essence unto itself‚Äîand also the most important, single, irreducible creative element in any production. Also equally unique (almost without exception), each talent observed will be found to have his own \\"working problem\\" as a creative artist. Small or large, the working problem can effectively sabotage any actor's creative abilities, and hence, his career. To Tupou an important aspect was not only to correctly and accurately identify the working problem of an actor but more importantly providing a workable route by which such problems could be overcome through understanding and improved artistic ability.

It released the album First Steps, which has been re-released on Blueprint Records (Voiceprint Group) in 2006. The roots of 2nd Vision were sown in 1977 when Sanders invited keyboard player Dave Bristow and drummer Mickey Barker, both of whom he'd already played with in his Birmingham days, to form an improvising unit named Surrounding Silence, which debuted at the Riverside Jazz Festival in August 1977. After Etheridge and ex-Gryphon bassist Jonathan Davie joined them, the band, renamed 20/20 Vision, played a well-received gig at the Alexandra Palace in May 1979. The band were offered a management deal by Jo Lustig, who had already represented the likes of Richard Thompson, Pentangle and the Chieftains, and signed with Chrysalis, recording their debut LP in the autumn of 1979, with John Cameron producing. The material was composed by either Sanders or Bristow, with Etheridge contributing one piece, a new version of his Soft Machine solo acoustic guitar piece \\"Etika\\". \\"It was a jazz-rock group, in the mould of Weather Report, Mahavishnu, that kind of things\\", Etheridge remembered. \\"The one album we made was a very good record. It sounds dated now of course, because it was done using the Yamaha CS-80... But of all the records that I've made, it's the one that the most trouble was taken over making. I was very pleased with the guitar on it, we took a lot of time to do it. I was quite happy with that... But this was in the late 70's, so it was all punk and new-wave...\\". The album was launched with a four-night residency at London's Riverside Studios in Hammersmith on 7‚Äì10 May 1980, with a different guest (Richard Thompson, Gordon Giltrap, Jethro Tull's David Palmer, June Tabor) joining the band each night. Unfortunately, all the British music papers went on strike for several weeks, so there was almost no coverage of the event, and the album failed to sell. There was an attempt to continue the band with a revised line-up, including bassist Fred Thelonious Baker and drummer Nick Twyman (his predecessor Barker would go on to join heavy-metal band Magnum in 1985), which toured the UK extensively as the John Etheridge/Ric Sanders Group in May 1981, but sadly this was to be its swansong.

Canadian Army A troop commander (TC) is normally a junior officer (2nd lieutenant or lieutenant) in the Royal Canadian Artillery or Royal Canadian Armoured Corps. Red Army A troop commander is the senior officer in command of a Red Army cavalry troop. The rank is usually that of a captain, or senior lieutenant. A cavalry troop is equivalent in size and general strength to a rifle (infantry) company. A cavalry troop normally has five platoons. *The HQ platoon is made up of the HQ section (administrative personnel), and all the support sections, such as mess, supply (trooper equipment), quartermaster (mount/horse equipment), medical, and maintenance (both vehicles, and tack). *First platoon: This is the attack platoon, composed of the most experienced troopers in the unit. This platoon conducts direct action against enemy forces. It may engage in direct attacks, or flanking manoeuvres on enemy forces, and positions. *Second platoon: One of the two scouting/reconnaissance platoons that engage in reconnaissance activities against enemy positions, troop concentrations, and rear area targets of interest (such as ammo dumps, bridges, railroad marshalling yards). This platoon observes enemy activity, and reports by radio, land line, or semaphore to HQ the enemies activities. Such units tend to operate in small groups, or sections, and so avoid direct enemy contact when ever possible. *Third platoon: Composed the same as second platoon. *Fourth platoon: This is the speciality platoon. It contains all unit snipers, any heavy weapons provided to the troop, and will lead in both the defensive operations of the troop area, as well as provide primary support to the first platoon in any of its direct action attacks against the enemy. This typical formation was used by the 25th Ukrainian Mounted Rifle Regiment, a mounted rifle unit of the Ukrainian territorial defense army of the Red Army of the Soviet Union. Although disbanded, it is commemorated by living historians in the North East United States.

It is noted for the Guimiliau Parish close. It should not be confused with the neighbouring commune and village of Lampaul-Guimiliau. Population Inhabitants of Guimiliau are called in French Guimiliens. Local Saints Guimiliau, or Gwimilio in Breton, is named after St Miliau. The name simply means town or settlement (Breton: gwic) of Milio. According to legend, Miliau was a good and just Breton prince, put to death in a dynastic quarrel in the 6th or 9th century. Guimiliau is also famous as the reputed birthplace of St Herv√©, a 6th-century ascetic, who is one of the most popular Breton saints. Parish close Entrance to the parish close, showing the enclosing wall and gateway. Parish closes are a distinctive feature of Breton culture in the historic L√©on diocese, in which Guimiliau stands. As the name suggests, a close is a completely enclosed church yard, usually with a commanding entrance arch. Sacred enclosures were a feature of Celtic religion even before the arrival of Christianity. Parish closes today form the foci for pardons, the annual Breton pilgrimage festivals, which can attract thousands of worshippers. The parish close of Guimiliau is situated at the upper end of the main village street, with the entrance dominating the village. The calvary or crucifix is the centre piece of the church yard, surrounded by a fine and complex retelling of the Passion in statuary. See Calvary at Guimiliau The church contains many fine examples of polychrome sculpture from the sixteenth century onwards, including several large retables. There is also a fine octagonal baptistery, a carved pulpit and a collection of banners used especially in religious processions at pardons. Gallery Image:Guimiliau Calvaire.jpgChurch and Calvary.

Head of the House of Lippe Armin succeeded his father as head of the House of Lippe following the latter's death on 30 December 1949. On 22 March 1953, he renounced his position in favour of his older half brother, Prince Leopold. This move proved controversial within the house, and several princes started legal proceedings. Prince Leopold later in 1958 renounced the headship in favour of his older brother, Hereditary Prince Ernst. Later in that year, the Hereditary Prince called a family council, where it was agreed by the princes in attendance that the oldest prince living in Germany would be head of the house. So the position went to Prince Simon Casimir (1900‚Äì1980). Although agreeing at the time, Prince Ernst August of Lippe, the son of Prince Julius Ernst of Lippe-Biesterfeld and Duchess Marie of Mecklenburg, later changed his mind, believing that all princes of house, not just those living in Germany, should be considered. He ultimately assumed the headship of the house. Ernst August died in 1990 and his son Prince Friedrich Wilhelm of Lippe (b. 1947) has continued his claim. Prince Armin, who said he did not think his decision in 1953 was irrevocable, also claimed to be head of the house, given the fact that he inherited the family fortune, including farming land, forests and the princely castle at Detmold, where he was living. He was a first cousin of Prince Bernhard of Lippe-Biesterfeld, consort of Queen Juliana of the Netherlands, and was a child attendant at their 1937 wedding.

He devised 24 restrictive diets, such as bread and water with a little sugar for thirty-one days, but died after only eight months whilst living exclusively on honey puddings and Cheshire cheese. Early life William was born in Birmingham, the eldest son of Thomas Stark, a merchant of Manchester. (also sometimes described as of 'Scottish parents'Alan Saunders, \\"Martyrs of Nutrition.\\" Australian Broadcasting Corporation - Biography of William Stark). He studied philosophy at Glasgow University, where he graduated MA in 1758, and then proceeded to Edinburgh, where he became friends with William Cullen. He moved to London in 1765, and concentrated on the study of medicine, entering as a pupil at St George's Hospital. He studied anatomy under John Hunter (1728‚Äì1773), and undertook experiments on blood and other animal fluids. He studied medicine at the University of Leiden, obtaining his degree on 2 September 1766 (or 1769) He published his thesis Specimen medicum inaugurale septem historias et dissectiones dysentericorum exhibens in 1766. Self experimentation Stark was a friend of Sir John Pringle, and Benjamin Franklin,Who goes first?: the story of self-experimentation in medicine By Lawrence K. Altman and his experimenting was triggered by Ben Franklin's description of how, as a printer, he had survived for 2 weeks on a simple diet of bread and water. Encouraged and advised by John Pringle, Stark began his study of scurvy in London, June 1769, with a series of dietary experiments on himself. He devised a series of 24 dietary experiments in an effort to prove that a \\"pleasant and varied diet was as healthful as simpler strict diets\\". He kept accurate measures of temperature and weather conditions, the weights of all food and water he consumed, and the weight of all daily excretions. Stark also recorded how he felt on a daily basis, he described himself as being a healthy, young man.Vanderbilt Medical Library - William StarkFAQs Biography, William Stark His experiment started with a basic diet of bread and water with a little sugar for thirty-one days. He became 'dull and listless' so ate better until he recovered. He resumed experimenting by adding various foods, one at a time - olive oil, milk, roast goose, boiled beef, fat, figs, and veal. After two months, his gums were red and swollen, and they bled when pressure was applied, a symptom of scurvy.Vanderbilt University Medical Center. \\"Scurvy and Vitamin C\\" By November 1769 he was living on nothing but pudding, albeit with black currants to celebrate Boxing Day. He had considered testing fresh fruits and vegetables but was still working through tests with honey puddings and Cheshire cheese when he died in February 1770. Death and legacy After eight months of experimenting, he died on 23 February 1770, at the age of twenty-nine. His legacy was not a breakthrough discovery but his detailed record keeping indicated the importance of vitamin C to later researchers. Had he heeded the recent discoveries of James Lind, he would have known to include citrus fruits in his experimental diet. Instead he followed Pringle's advice to abstain from salt. His friends attributed his death to the impudent zeal with which he prosecuted his investigations. James Carmichael Smyth published The works of the late William Stark ‚Ä¶ consisting of clinical and anatomical observations, with experiments dietetical and statical (1788), eighteen years after his death.

Wade, an eight-year veteran of the Canadian Football League (CFL), was active in several roles with the British Columbia Lions (2006, 2007, 2011), the Calgary Stampeders (2004), the Ottawa Renegades (2005, 2006) and the Hamilton Tiger-Cats (2008, 2009, 2010). Primarily noted for his work in player personnel, recruiting and evaluation, Wade also held coaching positions with Calgary and Ottawa, where as an offensive assistant coach he worked with quarterbacks and receivers, the offensive line and special teams. In his only front office role, Wade was promoted to Director of Football development in Ottawa 2006 and tasked with re-structuring the club operations. His development of import players additions was highlighted in his personnel work and in the identification, evaluations, workouts and signings of four import players who were named as CFL Rookies of the Year in 2011, 2007, 2006 and 2004. Wade planned and operated US free agent workout camps that produced numerous active roster impact players and was instrumental in assisting to rebuild the Hamilton Tiger-Cats from 2008 to 2010. In his previous role with the BC Lions, the club has historic levels of success with record seasons of 15‚Äì5 and 14‚Äì3‚Äì1 marks and a 2006 Grey Cup Championship. (Ulrich V.P., Edwards H.S.) Football background =Coach Richard Wade= Wade would be named as Offensive Line and Special Teams Assistant Coach and responsible for the operation of the club's Player Personnel department working closely with Forrest Gregg, the Renegades executive Vice President. The press announcement of Wade's hire in Ottawa described Wade as follows: Forrest Gregg announced Friday that Richard Wade has been named to the new position of Director of Football Development. Wade, a Los Angeles native will serve in a multi dimensional role as an assistant special teams coach, be involved in Canadian and U.S. player talent evaluations, facilitate player contracts and act as a liaison between the Renegades media department and the Renegade coaching and personnel department. Wade has taken over his new role in the Renegades office effective today. (Ottawa Citizen, Ottawa Sun) Forrest Gregg stated that ‚ÄúRichard is a bright young man who has a wide range of talents that will well serve the Renegade organization.‚Äù Head coach John Jenkins stated ‚ÄúRichard has already served us well as a regional scout in the Western United States, plus I worked with him when he was a guest coach with the Calgary Stampeders, so I know he will be a major asset for our organization.\\" www.lionbackers.com After the Ottawa Renegades team was suspended Wade was picked up by the British Columbia Lions Football Club, In the 2006 Grey Cup Championship, after winning the Western Division Final, the BC Lions defeated the Montreal Alouettes 25-14 to cap off a highly successful season, which included CFL Rookie of the Year award Aaron Hunt, Most Outstanding Canadian and defensive Linemen DE Brent Johnson, CFL Top Offensive Linemen and CFL Most Outstanding Player Geroy Simon, Head Coach Wally Buono would later be named CFL Coach of the Year. Returning in 2007 Wade would continue to work with Bob O'Billovich, the BC Lions Director of Player Personnel as a Regional Scout. BC Lions Cameron Wake was named CFL Rookie of the Year marking another stellar scouting season as Wade has now been involved with three scouting programs in four years and has three CFL most outstanding rookies from this time. The BC Lions have eight of the last ten Rookie of the Year award winners. 12 March 2008 Wade joins Bob O'Billovich and the Hamilton Tiger-Cat in the Eastern Division of the Canadian Football League. CFL players return to the NFL/ Wade Scouting Prospects and Quotes/ Hamilton Spectator Article The death of both the Arena Football League and NFL Europa means that the CFL and the fledgling United Football League‚Äîa four-team league playing a six-game schedule‚Äîare the only remaining pro leagues. The success of recent exports such as Cameron Wake (Miami) and Stefan Logan (Pittsburgh) -- both former B.C. Lions‚Äîhas shown that CFL players can thrive in the NFL. Ticat general manager Bob O'Billovich says the evolution of the American game is also making CFL players more attractive. \\"When you look at the style of play in the U.S now, in both college and the pros, teams are throwing the ball a lot more than they ever did in the past,\\" O'Billovich said, citing the popularity of the spread offence. \\"Some of the NFL teams are going for the smaller, quicker guys rather than the big, bulky body-type guys. We've been playing with faster guys at most positions for years.\\" While O'Billovich says he doesn't mind losing players to the NFL -- \\"you can't fault them for wanting to give it a shot\\"‚Äîthere are those around the CFL who have concerns. \\"It says good things about our league that there are great players up here and people recognize that,\\" Saskatchewan Roughriders' president-CEO Jim Hopson said this week after losing Chick to the Indianapolis Colts. \\"I would like to see it be clean -- you have a contract, you finish it and then you go. I'm not sure if that is in the best interest of the CFL at this point.\\" But Ticat scout Richard Wade, who scouted current Ticat starters DeAndra' Cobb and Marquay McDaniel among others, says there is an upside to the option year. \\"For every player we send down south to a healthy NFL contract we get 20 additional prospects who will consider playing in the CFL. From my experience, you see the better agents viewing this route as a legitimate avenue to get a player's career advanced, and thus the league gets a better level of competition in the long run,\\" Wade said in an e-mail. \\"And more and more the players see it as a real chance to play now and still live the NFL dream. Replacing players has become better as a result of the flow.\\" Miami Dolphin \\"Phins\\" website/Wade Comment Richard Wade scouted, worked out, and signed Chris Wilson and Cam Wake two players who made the jump from the CFL to the NFL successfully, he is sort of a CFL scout/guru who has the eye for talent and he has a great point, it is hard to convince American College Football players to give the CFL a try, but as there is more CFL to NFL cross pollination the CFL can attract those better, more gifted players to give the CFL a shot The CFL won't make any player wealthy, the #3 overall pick in 2009, Jamall Lee took a shot at the NFL as an UDFA in Carolina last preseason because even if he made the practice squad, his salary would be 5k a week, in the CFL he entire salary would have been 50,000..Canadian Dollars. 2011 Wade vacates Tiger-Cats player personnel role.\\\\- Cached www.sportsnet.ca The Hamilton Tiger-Cats will forge ahead in 2001 without top US Scout Richard Wade. After a three-season run in Hamilton and a successful rebuild of the O'Billovich era Tiger-Cats Wade has left the club.

These current T-cats include Chris Williams(New Mexico State), Pierre Singfield (Arizona State) and Mitch Mustain (Southern California) joining Markeith knowlton, Marquay McDaniel, Jason Boltus, Demonte Bolden and Justin Hick as other Tiger-Cat player additions.

This attribution has often been questioned.Jonathan Janson, Essential Vermeer: St Praxedis accessed 12 December 2010 However, in 2014 the auction house Christie's announced the results of new investigations which in their opinion demonstrate conclusively that it is a Vermeer.Christie's, Saint Praxedis by Johannes Vermeer (press release, Monday 9 June 2014) accessed 10 June 2014 The painting is a copy of a work by Felice Ficherelli, and depicts the early Roman martyr, Saint Praxedis or Praxedes. It may be Vermeer's earliest surviving work, dating from 1655. Description and date The painting shows the saint squeezing a martyr's blood from a sponge into an ornate vessel. It is closely related to a work by Ficherelli from 1640‚Äì45, now in the Collection Fergnani in Ferrara, and is generally assumed to be a copy of it (though see below for an alternative interpretation). The most obvious difference between the two is that there is no crucifix in the Ferrara work. It is Vermeer's only known close copy of another work. This is one of only four dated Vermeer paintings, the others being The Procuress (1656), The Astronomer (1668) and The Geographer (1669). Vermeer's two early history paintings, Christ in the House of Martha and Mary and Diana and Her Companions, are dated by almost all art historians to 1654-6, although opinions differ as to which is earlier.Christie's, Saint Praxedis by Johannes Vermeer: Saint Praxedis (catalogue entry), accessed 10 June 2014 Provenance and 2014 sale The painting's provenance before the mid-twentieth century is unknown. The collector Jacob Reder bought it at a minor auction house in New York in 1943. It first received significant attention as a possible Vermeer when being shown as a part of an exhibition of Florentine Baroque art at the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York in 1969. The exhibition catalogue drew attention to the signature \\"Meer 1655\\" and Michael Kitson, reviewing the exhibition, suggested it could be a genuine Vermeer on the basis of stylistic similarities to Diana and Her Companions. Following Reder's death (also in 1969) it was bought by the art dealer Spencer A. Samuels, who also believed it to be a Vermeer. The Barbara Piasecka Johnson Collection Foundation bought it from Spencer in 1987. The leading Vermeer scholar Arthur Wheelock subsequently argued the case for the attribution to Vermeer in an article devoted to it in 1986. The painting was not included in the exhibition \\"The Young Vermeer\\" held in The Hague, Dresden and Edinburgh in 2010-11. However it was included in an exhibition of Vermeer's work held in Rome in 2012‚Äì13, curated by Wheelock, Liedtke and Sandrina Bandera. It was sold at Christie's in London on 8 July 2014 on behalf of the Barbara Piasecka Johnson Collection Foundation. It sold to an unknown buyer for ¬£6,242,500 (US$10,687,160), at the lower end of the estimated price range of ¬£6-¬£8 million. Some art market commentators speculated that doubt about the attribution to Vermeer may have contributed to the relatively low price. From March 2015 it has been on display in the National Museum of Western Art in Tokyo, labelled as \\"attributed to Johannes Vermeer\\". This appears to be a long-term loan to the museum from a private collector.National Museum of Western Art, Announcement of Debut Display of Works accessed 27 April 2015 Debates over attribution upright The painting may have two signatures. The more obvious of the two reads \\"Meer 1655\\", while the second appears as \\"Meer N R o o\\". It is possible that this second signature originally read \\"Meer naar Riposo\\", or \\"Vermeer after Riposo\\": Riposo was Ficherelli's nickname. The Doerner Institute's examination of the signatures concluded that both signatures were original and composed of pigments typical of the painting.Spencer Samuels catalogue, date unknown Wheelock's examination also led him to conclude that both signatures were original, and recent technical examination has demonstrated that the clearer signature is likely to have been added at, or close to, the date the painting was created. However these new investigations agreed with the earlier opinion of the conservator J√∏rgen Wadum that the possible second signature is too indistinct to be deciphered. Analysis of the lead white, performed by the Rijksmuseum, in association with the Free University, Amsterdam used in the painting demonstrates a Dutch or Flemish origin, with a strong possibility that the pigment came from the same batch used for Vermeer's Diana and Her Companions. The use of a chalk ground is also typically Dutch, and there is an unusually extensive use of ultramarine, typical of Vermeer's later work, though not of Diana and Her Companions or Christ in the House of Martha and Mary. Wheelock identifies stylistic similarities with two history paintings which are universally attributed to Vermeer. He also notes similarities between the depiction of the saint's face and the figure in Vermeer's A Girl Asleep and argues that the painter's conversion to Catholicism would have given him an interest in the subject matter. Although it is thought unlikely that the Ferrara painting ever left Italy, or that Vermeer visited Italy, Wheelock points out that he had a reputation as an authority on Italian art. It is possible that another version or copy of the Ferrara painting was the model for Vermeer's work. In 1998, Wadum argued that the painting was not a copy of the work in Ferrara, or indeed of any other work, because the background elements were painted before the foreground, as is typical of an original work rather than a copy. In 2014 Christie's put forward the argument that this could be explained as experimentation by Vermeer, the young artist trying to recreate and adapt the technique used to create the original.

He debuted on-screen during episodes airing on 12 September 2003 as a new student and left on 8 September 2006 after his character was axed by Bryan Kirkwood. Storylines Joe arrived as a young fresher in Hollyoaks studying fashion and got himself in a bit of a bother with roommate Robbie Flynn (Andy Newton-Lee), after the pair had a falling out over room sharing. Joe certainly had his share of attention and was fleetingly labelled as gay. This brought a few admirers like Nick O'Connor (Darren Bransford), after he too thought Joe was gay. But to prove he was not gay, Joe began dating Jodie Nash (Kate McEnery) after the pair met on a dating spree contest. However it wasn't too last for too long as Joe moved on to his next relationship, this time with Sophie Burton (Connie Powney). The pair seemed like love's young dream couple, but Joe felt the strain after he thought Sophie became too pushy in the relationship after introducing Joe to her mother Liz Burton (Andr√©e Bernard). Soon after, Sophie ended the relationship with Joe after learning that he was going to dump her. Joe soon built up a good friendship relations with Dannii Carbone (Christina Baily), Russ Owen (Stuart Manning) and Jeremy Peterson (Simon Cole). He also revealed that he had a rocky relationship with his alcoholic father, a police officer, who was abusive towards Joe's mother. He was also smitten with ice-queen Louise Summers (Roxanne McKee), despite the fact she has shown no interest in him. Despite being a cheeky chap, Joe's confidence was to take a huge blow after he was beaten up by a bunch of teenage school girls. With the support of Russ and Danni, Joe was able to recover from his trauma. Joe began to concentrate on his fashion degree, however things got from bad to worse for Joe. He managed to run up in massive debts after his dealing for supplying jackets collapsed. Joe became desperate and took out a credit card in best mate Jeremy's name. Jez was oblivious to this and also bought him a laptop after Joe claimed his was stolen. Although he and Dannii were forced to leave the student flat they shared with Zara Morgan (Kelly Greenwood) and Jez to make room for Jessica Harris (Jennifer Biddall) and Olivia Johnson (Rochelle Gadd), it appeared that he moved back into the flat after Zara Mark Jury (Ash Newman) moved out. Meanwhile, Joe's debt deepened and soon it resulted in loan sharks chasing Joe, which led to Joe faking his own death in order to get he's loan sharks off his back. The whole debt saga cost Joe dearly as he was unable to take his exams as the college records had him down as \\"deceased\\" and had to resit his final year. Before college restarted in September 2006 he found out he, Olivia, and Jessica had to move out to make room for new students. Joe recognised the name of one of the students as Zoe Carpenter (Zoe Lister), a girl he used to date in high school, but he dumped her because she was fat but realised that it was his big mistake and tried to convince her to take him back. Joe tried to stay in the flat with Jessica and Olivia by telling the new students that they were their live-in student mentors, but the students saw through their plans. Joe tried to bribe the students with drinks but with no success. Joe made it up to Zoe by telling her he regretted dumping her in high school and then they went to The Dog in The Pond together with Kris Fisher (Gerard McCarthy), Jessica, and Olivia. That night escaped rapist Sam Owen (Louis Tamone) burst into the pub and set it on fire. Joe had theorised that the only safe way out would be through the basement. After successfully getting Kris and Zoe out, he went back for Olivia, who had been pinned under a beam just behind the bar. Before Joe left he told Zoe that he already lost her once, and he wasn't going to again. Upon finding Olivia, Joe freed her, but the bottles of alcohol behind the bar exploded, killing both of them. Zoe tried to ring Joe's phone and heard his ring tone; she and Kris followed it, with Kris remarking that \\"People like Joe are born lucky\\". Seconds later, they found it coming from a group of body bags. Joe died a hero, trying to save Olivia.

Spanish Florida originally included much of what is now the Southeastern United States, although Spain never exercised long-term effective control over more than the northern part of what is now the State of Florida from present-day St. Augustine to the area around Tallahassee, southeastern Georgia, and some coastal settlements, such as Pensacola, Florida. A few short-lived missions were established in other locations, including Mission Santa Elena in present-day South Carolina, around the Florida peninsula, and in the interior of Georgia and Alabama. The missions of what are now northern Florida and southeastern Georgia were divided into main four provinces where the bulk of missionary effort took place. These were Apalachee, comprising the eastern part of what is now the Florida Panhandle; Timucua, ranging from the St. Johns River west to the Suwanee; Mocama, the coastal areas east of the St. Johns running north to the Altamaha River; and Guale, north of the Altamaha River along the coast to the present-day Georgia Sea Islands. These provinces roughly corresponded to the areas where those dialects were spoken among the varying Native American peoples, thus, they reflected the territories of the peoples. Missionary provinces were relatively fluid and evolved over the years according to demographic and political trends, and at various times smaller provinces were established, abandoned, or merged with larger ones. There were also ephemeral attempts to establish missions elsewhere, particularly further south into Florida. History The priests and religious that traveled with the early conquistadors notwithstanding, the 1549 expedition of Father Luis de Cancer and three other Dominicans to Tampa Bay was the first solely missionary effort attempted in La Florida. It ended in failure after six weeks with de Cancer's death at the hands of the Tocobaga natives, which sent shock waves through the Dominican missionary community in New Spain for many years. The first Spanish missions to Florida, starting with the foundation of St. Augustine in 1565, were attached to presidios. Between 1559 and 1567, ten presidios were established at major harbors from Port Royal Sound in modern South Carolina to Pensacola Bay on the northern Gulf of Mexico in an attempt to prevent other European powers from establishing bases on land claimed by Spain. Most of the presidios were unsustainable; San Mateo (near modern Jacksonville, Florida) was destroyed by the French, the entire garrison at Tocobago was wiped out, and most of the other presidios were abandoned due to a combination of hostility from the native inhabitants, difficulty in providing supplies, and damage from hurricanes. By 1573, the only remaining presidios in Florida were at St. Augustine and Santa Elena on Paris Island, South Carolina. Santa Elena was abandoned in 1587, leaving St. Augustine as the only sizeable Spanish settlement in La Florida. Modern map showing the approximate location of Spanish missions and the connecting Camino Real across northern Florida The missions at the presidios were staffed by the Jesuits. Due to the hostility of the Native Americans, which resulted in the killing of several of the missionaries, the Jesuits withdrew from the mission field in La Florida in 1572. Franciscan friars entered into La Florida in 1573, but at first confined their activities to the immediate vicinity of St. Augustine. The Franciscans began taking their mission to the Guale and Timucua along the Atlantic coast in 1587. Starting in 1606 the Franciscans expanded their mission efforts westward across northern Florida along a primitive but lengthy road known as El Camino Real. The road and the network of missions stretched across the Florida panhandle through the territory of the Timucua and reached the Apalachees in the vicinity of modern Tallahassee by 1633. The mission system functioned for decades, as the Spanish convinced most village leaders to provide food and labor in exchange for tools and protection. Regular waves of European-borne disease along with conflict with arriving English colonists to the north weakened the system as the 1600s progressed. It collapsed in the aftermath of Queen Anne's War, when English soldiers from the Province of Carolina, along with their Creek allies, killed or kidnapped much of the remaining native population of Spanish Florida except in areas near St. Augustine and Pensacola.McEwan. pp. xix-xx. The network of missions was virtually destroyed by Carolina Governor James Moore's incursions into northern Florida between 1702 and 1709, a series of attacks that were later called the Apalachee massacre. Dozens of missions and surrounding villages were abandoned by the early 1700s and their locations lost, as was much of the former route of El Camino Real. As a result, only a few mission sites in Florida have been found and positively identified. Architecture The mission buildings of La Florida were built with posts set into the ground. The walls were palmetto thatch, wattle and daub or plank, or left open. The floors were clay, and scholars believe the roofs were thatched. The church buildings in the missions averaged some 20 m by 11 m. Other buildings situated within a palisade included a convento to house the missionaries, a barracks for the soldiers, and often a separate kitchen.Saunders. pp. 51-6.Thomas. pp. 9-19. Provinces The Spanish used the term \\"province\\" for the territory of a tribe or chiefdom. There was no fixed definition of province boundaries. As tribes and chiefdoms lost population and importance, the provinces associated with them would no longer appear in the records. Other provinces expanded to take in their territories. Most of the people taken into the mission system were Timucua speakers. Three major groups that spoke other languages were also taken into the mission system. The Guale Province was the territory the Guale, and covered what is now coastal Georgia and the Sea Islands north of the Altamaha River. The Guale were among the first people to be taken into the mission system, in the 1580s. Later in the 17th century, Guale Province was sometimes referred to as extending southward and including the region otherwise known as Mocama. The Apalachee Province included the Apalachee people, who spoke a Muskogean language, and were brought into the mission system in the 1630s. It occupied the easternmost part of what is now the Florida Panhandle, along the Gulf of Mexico coast from the Aucilla River to the Ochlockonee River. The Spanish established one early mission among the Mayaca people, a non-Timucuan speaking tribe south of the Agua Fresca, and resumed efforts among them, and their relatives, the Jororo, in the late 17th century. This district, which became known as the Mayaca-Jororo Province, occupied an area to the south of Lake George, on the upper (southern) St. Johns River.Griffin: xvHann 1993: 92, 128.Milanich: 97, 98, 99Saunders: 35-6 The Timucua-speakers, most of whom were brought into the mission system in the late 16th and early 17th centuries, were initially seen by the Spanish as living in a dozen or so provinces, with the Acuera, Ibi, Mocama, Potano, Timucua (in its restricted sense, north of the Santa Fe River, and east of the Suwannee River), Utina, Yufera, and Yustaga provinces becoming major components of the mission system. During the 17th century, as Timucuan populations declined and the locations of Spanish missions were consolidated along the road between St. Augustine and Apalachee, most of these provinces were gradually consolidated in Spanish usage into a Timucua Province stretching from the Atlantic Ocean to the Aucilla River.Hann 1996: 2, 5-7, 9, 12 The Mocama Province included the coastal areas of southeastern Georgia and northern Florida from St. Simons Island south to St. Augustine, extending westward to approximately the distance of the St. Johns River in Florida.Milanich: 98 It included some of the earliest missions to be established, and served the Mocama, a Timucuan-speaking group of the coastal areas. Important missions established in the Mocama Province were San Juan del Puerto, among the Saturiwa chiefdom, and San Pedro de Mocama, among the Tacatacuru. The Timucua Province was initially established to serve the people known to the Spanish as the Timucua (called the Northern Utina by modern scholars), who spoke the \\"Timucua proper\\" dialect. Eventually, however, it absorbed several other Timucua-speaking provinces and became the largest of all the Florida mission districts. Following shortly after the success of the Mocama missions, the Spanish established missions among the Agua Fresca (Eastern Utina or Freshwater Timucua) along the middle St. Johns River, from roughly present-day Palatka south to Lake George. Similarly, the missions among the Potano, centered on what is now Gainesville, were considered part of the Potano Province, while missions to the Acuera, who lived around the Ocklawaha River, were part of the Acuera Province. Most of these areas were eventually considered part of the larger Timucua Province, in some cases because native populations had declined to the point that they could no longer support multiple missions. (The missions in Acuera Province were abandoned after the Timucua rebellion of 1656, although non-Christian Acueras continued to live there for another 40 years.) At this stage the Timucua Province included the area between the St. Johns and Suwanee rivers. Later, the Yustaga Province, which served the Yustaga who lived to the west of the Suwanee as far as the Aucilla River, was added, and the Timucua province covered the majority of north central Florida. The coastal area south of the Mocama Province and St. Augustine was known as La Costa; though this area had some Timucua speakers, it did not see much missionary activity, perhaps because it was less densely populated. There were also a few missions established to the north and west of the Apalachee Province.Milanich: 98‚Äì99 Missions *Apalo *Santa Ana de Potano *San Ant√≥n de Carlos (Calusa) *San Antonio de Anacape/Enacape (Agua Dulce/Utina) *San Antonio de Bacuqua (Apalachee) *Asunci√≥n de Puerto (Chatot) *San August√≠n de Ahoica *San August√≠n de Urihica *San Bl√°s de Avino (Acuera) *San Buenaventura de Guadalquini (moved to St. Johns River as Santa Cruz y San Buenaventura de Guadalquini) *San Buenaventura de Potano *San Carlos de los Chacatos *San Carlos de Yatcatani *Santa Catalina de Afuerica (Northern Utina) *Santa Catalina de Guale (St. Catherines Island, Sapelo Island and Amelia Island, in succession) *Santa Clara de Tupiqui (Sapelo River) *Cofa (mouth of Suwannee River) *La Concepci√≥n de Ayubale (Ayubale) *Santa Cruz de Ajohica *Santa Cruz de Cachipile (Arapaha) *Santa Cruz de Capoli *Santa Cruz de Tarihica (Northern Utina) *San Dami√°n de Cupaica (... de Cupahica) (... de Escambi) *San Diego de Helaca/Laca, later moved to San Diego de Salamototo (on St. Johns River) *San Diego de Satuache (Guale) *Santo Domingo de Asao (Guale) *Santo Domingo de Talaje (Altamaha River) *Santa Elena *Santa Elena de Machaba (Yustaga) *La Encarnaci√≥n a la Santa Cruz de S√°bacola (Chatot) *Santa Fe de Toloca/Teleco/Toloco *San Felipe de Athulutheca *San Francisco de Chuaquin (Arapaha) *San Francisco de Oconi *San Francisco de Potano (Potano) *San Ildefonso de Chamini/Chamile (Arapaha) *Santa Isabel de Utinahica *San Joseph de Escambe (San Jos√© de Escambe) (Apalachee) *San Joseph de Ocuya (San Jos√© de Ocuya) *San Joseph de Sapala (San Jos√© de Zapala) (Sapelo Island) *San Juan De Aspalaga *San Juan (de) Guacara (on the Suwannee River) *San Juan del Puerto *San Lorenzo de Ibihica *San Lorenzo de Ivitachuco (Apalachee) *Santa Lucia de Acuera *San Luis de Apalachee (Tallahassee), a U.S. National Historic Landmark *San Luis de Eloquale (Acuera) *San Luis de Talimali (Apalachee) *Santa Mar√≠a *Santa Mar√≠a de Ayubale (Apalachee) *Santa Mar√≠a de Loreto (Tequesta) *Santa Mar√≠a de los Angeles de Arapaha *Santa Maria de Sena, on Amelia Island *San Mart√≠n de Asunci√≥n de Puerto (Chatot) *San Mart√≠n de Timucua/Ayacutu/Ayaocuto *San Mart√≠n de Tomole (Apalachee) *San Matheo de Tolapatafi (Yustaga) *San Miguel de Asile (Yustaga) *San Miguel de Potano *San Nicol√°s de Tolentino (Chatot) *Nombre de Dios *Nuestra Se√±ora de Guadalupe de Tolomato *San Pedro de Mocama (Cumberland Island) *San Pedro do los Chines *San Pedro y San Pablo de Patale (San Pedro de Patali) *San Pedro y San Pablo de Potohiriba (San Pedro de Potohiriba) (Yustaga) *La Purificaci√≥n de Tama *San Salvador de Mayaca *Santiago de Oconi (near the Okefenokee Swamp) *San Sebastian See also *Spanish missions in Georgia *History of Florida *Spanish Florida (La Florida) Notes References Hann, John H.

Powder Day or Day of the Powder () is celebrated in the southern Spanish village of Tolox on Shrove Tuesday, the final day of the annual Tolox carnival. This local tradition involves the throwing of talcum powder at one another. One reason given for the custom is that it takes place the day before Ash Wednesday on which the priest declares to the faithful \\"Remember, man, that you are dust, and unto dust you shall return‚Äù.\\"Powder for everybody\\" , Aifos Promociones Inmobiliarias A more likely origin of the tradition is said to have its roots in a Christian/Moorish riot in the 16th century when Tolox, then under Christian control, had a large Moorish population. During Christmas of 1539 there was civil strife between the predominantly Moorish peasants and the Christian landholders.\\"M√°laga Province ‚Äì Tolox\\", andalucia.com One chronicler states that this custom originated in a dispute between a Moorish and a Christian girl who were in love with the same man. Both worked in a bakery and as the argument grew more heated, they ended up throwing all the flour they could find at each other.\\"Tolox - Fiestas and Gastronomy\\", Tourist Board of the Costa del Sol In years gone by, the custom evolved that young men wanting to request their girlfriends‚Äô hand in marriage would throw flour at them. Girls not wishing be subjected to this would refrain from going out on the streets, forcing the boys to come up with ingenious ways to powder their target. A young man would dust his hands with flour and try to enter a young girl's house and smother her face with flour. If doors and windows were closed, it meant he was not desired by the girl. If the lad was still keen, he had to smartly outwit her by climbing to the roof or breaking windows and doors to get her smeared with the flour, thus winning her heart in a symbolic way, or simply to impress her.Metro World, Metro, pg. 14, February 22, 2007 Nowadays this tradition especially appeals to the young people who hurl talcum powder instead of flour at each other, without preference or distinction as to gender or origin, until they are completely covered with it.

Origins The community was founded circa 1830 and named for the Mission (then known as San Antonio de B√©xar) which was the location of the Battle of the Alamo,Harris, W. Stuart (1982) Alabama Place- Names, p. 23. Huntsville, Alabama: The Strode Publishers, scene of one of the bloodiest battles fought on North American soil. Bexar first appeared on the Alabama state map in 1853. The major road through Bexar was U.S. Route 78, connecting Birmingham and Memphis, Tennessee. However, the road was improved and rerouted about one mile north of Bexar in the 1960s. All that remains today in Bexar are homes, a few churches and the vacant buildings that once housed the post office and general store. Demographics Bexar appeared on the 1880 U.S. Census having 37 residents. It was the only time it appeared on census rolls. Postal service The Bexar post office was established August 12, 1843, making it the oldest post office in Marion County. Richmon Pearce Goggans served the longest of any postmaster here, from 1905 until 1953. Postal service was discontinued on February 15, 1974. Mrs. Willie Lou Lochridge served as the last Postmaster from May 1971 till the end. The local community rallied around the post office in an attempt to thwart the end of postal service but were not successful. At the time the post office was closed, it had a modern building for the times, having been built in 1962. Former postmaster Pearce Goggans was the guest of honor at the dedication of the new post office, and U.S. Rep. Carl Elliott gave a speech. The Bexar post office served a large area of Western Alabama and Eastern Mississippi. The old Bexar rural delivery area is now served by the post offices in Detroit, Vina, Hamilton (all in Alabama) and Tremont, Mississippi. The ZIP code assigned to the Bexar post office was 35547. Schools Bexar has been the home of two secondary schools. Gravel Springs Junior High School (home of the Golden Tigers) was established in 1907 and educated the children of the surrounding countryside until 1985. It was the last \\"country school\\" in Marion County. Gravel Springs \\"graduated\\" sophomore students to Hamilton High School up until the 1950s. At the time it was closed it only served to 8th grade. There have been three Gravel Springs Junior High School buildings. The last one was dedicated in 1947 and still stands. The school grounds are owned by a local family and serve as a gathering place each Christmas and Decoration Day for the family. After the school was closed, the buyers utilized two of the class rooms on the southern end of the school to manufacture horse trailers for a few years and thus the exterior wall was knocked out. Other than that, the building looks much the way it did when it was closed in 1985, both on the exterior and interior. The other school that served the Bexar community over the years was known as Ada Hannar High School. It was established in 1921 as the Marion County Training School and then the Rosenwald School. The first teachers at the school were Professor G.H. Hannar and his wife, Ada‚Äîhence the name of the school. The Marion County Board of Education gave permission for a new school to be built to replace the outdated Rosenwald School building and on September 19, 1965, the Ada Hannar High School was dedicated. However, in 1967, with desegregation, the AHHS began phasing out grades. The students were transferred to Hamilton with the school being shut down completely at the end of the 1969 school year. The building was used as a place for local children to play basketball in the school gym for a few years, then was used as a manufacturing plant. It has since fallen into severe disrepair after a fire gutted most of the school building. The remnants of the school are still standing, though they are very overgrown with weeds and trees.

Santa Maria del Suffragio is a 17th-century church in the center Rome, Italy. It lies on the via Giulia, in the rione Ponte. In 1592, the Confraternita del Suffragio (\\"Fraternity of those who succor the suffering\\") was a purgatorial society established adjacent to the church of Saint Biagio della Pagnotta; their goal was to pray for the spirits of the dead and dying. Two years later, the group received a charter of approval from Pope Clement VIII. In 1620, it was elevated to Arciconfraternita by Pope Paul V. Having outgrown their premises, the group acquired in 1607, part of an unfinished site that originally had been destined to be the Bramante-designed Palace of the Courts. In 1662, the architect Carlo Rainaldi designed the church, which was completed by 1669, with interior decorations continuing till 1685.

His inspiration was his father Donald, who worked as a sideman, in jazz parlance a musician for hire who can blend in with the band or star as a solo performer, according to what is required by the gig. Plot The play starts in the 1950s and follows the family through the next 35 years. The play's narrator is Clifford Glimmer, the only son of Gene, a talented but self-absorbed jazz trumpeter, and his alcoholic wife Terry, who describes the tumultuous relationship his parents shared and the haphazard career journey Gene followed over the course of three decades. Dedicated more to his music than his family, he refuses to accept a regular job to support them, and their home life gradually unravels. Clifford eventually assumes the role of breadwinner his father has forsaken and offers his mother the emotional support Gene cannot. Scenes alternate between the family's Spartan New York City apartment and the smoke-filled nightclubs and cabarets of another era. Productions Side Man was first presented in a workshop by the Naked Angels in March 1996. It was then produced at Vassar College in a joint production of the New York Stage and Film Company and The Powerhouse Theatre, in association with RKJ Productions in July 1996.Leight, Warren. \\"Introduction\\", Side Man, Dramatists Play Service, Inc., 2000, , p. 2Klein, Alvin. \\"Theater Review;New Works Shaped by Audiences\\" New York Times, July 7, 1996 The play premiered at the off-off-Broadway East 13th Street Theater from March 11, 1998 to March 29.

For one thing, there is the dexterous hand of Michael Mayer (who has been involved in this show since its early workshops) guiding; he keeps the storytelling in sharp focus. For another, there are the wholly convincing performances, rendered with attentive and obvious joy, and no weak links. But in the final analysis, it is the integrity of Warren Leight's semi-autobiographical story that sets this play apart.

This event is performed by partners consisting of a female and male skater. The competition consists of two segments. A short program is skated first, with eight required elements performed within 2 minutes and 50 seconds. All pairs progress to the free skating, where each pair skates for 4 minutes and 30 seconds. There were 20 pairs who competed at the 2006 Games.

Campbell is a fluent speaker of four languages: Cree, Michif, Western Ojibwa, and English. Four of her published works have been published in eight countries and translated into four other languages (German, Chinese, French, Italian). Campbell has had great influence in her community as she is very politically involved in activism and social movements. Campbell is well known for being the author of Halfbreed, a memoir describing her own experiences as a M√©tis woman in society and the difficulties she has faced, which are commonly faced by many other women both within and outside of her community. Background Campbell is the oldest of eight children, and had to drop out of school to care for her siblings when her mother died. She moved to Vancouver at age fifteen, but returned to Saskatchewan in her twenties and became an organizer in her community. In 1969 she published Many Laws, a handbook that explained the issues faced by Indigenous people who move into cities. Campbell remembers early stages of her life in her community when her and her siblings learned how to hunt and trap, dance, play the fiddle, and learned the use for roots, herbs and barks. In Campbell's settlement, her family consisted of groups titled \\"The Isbisters\\", \\"Campbells\\", and \\"Vandals\\". Campbell's family was a mix of Scottish, French, Cree, English and Irish. Campbell recalls her experiences at school in Spring River. Her experiences demonstrate the racism that occurred within her community. Those who were white and those who were M√©tis were divided, and many M√©tis children were bullied by white children. Campbell had negative attitudes towards school, resulting in feelings of resentment towards her community and family. Campbell's father, who was a hunter and trapper, became an alcoholic and her mother died around this time during childbirth, leaving Campbell and her siblings on their own. At the age of fifteen, Campbell married a man named Darrel, with the hope that it would allow her to remain with her siblings and be able to provide for them. However, Darrel was abusive towards Campbell and had her siblings taken away. Campbell moved to Vancouver with Darrell, expecting her life to improve however, claims the poverty she witnessed in Vancouver was far worse than anything she had seen in her community in her early life. Darrel abandoned Campbell, and never returned. This left her with no money and no occupation in Vancouver. This forced Campbell into sex work, which seemed like her only option to make a living. In this time, she had to send her daughter to a convent, as she was unable to support her on her own. The difficulties which Campbell had experienced drove her to develop an addiction to drugs and alcohol. Campbell claims that she felt rejected by the city of Vancouver, as she felt they were prejudiced towards her due to being a M√©tis woman. According to Campbell, survival sex work was her most viable option at this point in her life, a difficulty also forced upon many other Indigenous women. Her involvement in sex work resulted from isolation, exclusion and poverty, due to systemic racism. In Halfbreed, violence, racism and the sex trade are described as expressions of ongoing colonial violence, especially in the lives of Metis women. Campbell was absent from her community for seventeen years. Upon returning to her community in Saskatchewan, Campbell claims that it was nothing like she had remembered it. Campbell claims she saw much more poverty and abuse in her community than she recalls from her childhood years spent there. Campbell eventually recovered from her drug and alcohol addiction and was reunited with her children. After beginning to attend Alcoholics Anonymous meetings, Campbell became much more involved in activism. Being heavily involved in political activism provided Campbell with a connection to her community, which she felt that she had been previously disconnected with. Campbell has struggled with a variety of experiences faced by many other M√©tis women today, including drug and alcohol addictions, resorting to sex work, depression and attempted suicide. Despite these negative experiences Campbell has dealt with, they are also shared experiences. Many other members of her community share similar experiences. Halfbreed (1973) Campbell's first book was the memoir Halfbreed (1973), which deals with her experience as a M√©tis woman in Canada, and the sense of identity that is generated by being neither wholly Indigenous nor Anglo. Halfbreed is an autobiographical work discussing various stages of Maria Campbell's life, including her early life in rural Saskatchewan, followed by her life as a sex worker in Vancouver. It discusses her later life and the challenges she faced associated with being a single mother, as well as her role in the Indigenous rights movement which occurred in Calgary. In Campbell's Halfbreed, the first chapters focus on the early stages of her life, where her sense of identity was created from her community near Spring River, Saskatchewan. Campbell's community had a prominent role in the formation of her identity. Based on the progression of her writing, Campbell became increasingly isolated as her community split apart. Halfbreed discusses the long-standing issue of the urban struggles faced by many Indigenous women. The work criticizes political systems on the basis that they are both corrupt and prejudiced towards females in society. the text highlights the issues of systemic racism and colonial violence, as well as the effects that sex work has on the women involved in it. The text focuses on Campbell's sense of collective M√©tis identity, emphasizing community belonging and common M√©tis experiences. Campbell was born and raised in a M√©tis community however, uses the term \\"halfbreed\\" over M√©tis due to ongoing debates about the precise definition of the latter, and makes a distinction between the identities \\"Indian\\" and \\"halfbreed.\\" Halfbreed is considered to be a seminal work of Indigenous literature in Canada and has been the subject of much scholarly work, sparking academic debates about pan- Indigeneity, M√©tis identity, Indigenous status, and the contemporary Indigenous experience in Canada. It recounts the difficulties Campbell faced in her search for self-discovery, including poverty, substance abuse, sexual abuse, and sex work. Halfbreed continues to be taught in schools across Canada, and inspires generations of Indigenous women and men. The original manuscript of Halfbreed was two thousand pages however, discussion with editors resulted in the reduction of the text to two hundred pages. Campbell had originally included more focus on the dark stages of her life including her time as a sex worker struggling with addictions. It was requested by editors that she include more focus on her early life in order to reduce the appearance of negative aspects of her life. Upon publications, Halfbreed received criticism and rejections on the basis that it lacked authenticity and accuracy. In May 2018, researchers from Simon Fraser University (BC, Canada) published an article detailing the discovery of two missing pages from the original Halfbreed manuscript. These pages, discovered in the McClelland and Stewart fonds at McMaster University, reveal how Campbell was raped at the age of 14 by members of the RCMP, and how she was prevented from including these pages in her published autobiography by publishers McClelland and Stewart. A new, fully restored edition of Halfbreed was published by McClelland and Stewart in November 2019 with the two missing pages included. This updated edition includes a new introduction by M√©tis scholar Kim Anderson, and an afterword by Campbell. Maria Campbell's Halfbreed consists of anecdotes with humorous expressions. Stories like these, with a humorous effect are important in the upbringing of M√©tis children, as they are often used in storytelling practices. The humour used in her work counteracts Campbell's negative life experiences, and is seen as an expression of survival. The humorous effect in Halfbreed removes dark aspects describing the struggle faced by many Indigenous populations and reduces perceptions of a continued struggle. Campbell's text is often received as a story of Indigenous oppression experienced in Canada. Other works Campbell is also the author of three children's books: People of the Buffalo (1975), Little Badger and the Fire Spirit (1977), and Riel's People (1978). All three are meant to teach M√©tis spirituality and heritage to M√©tis children. She has also translated stories in The Road Allowance People to Cree and Michif. Campbell chose to translate her work into what she describes as \\"Village English\\", as she felt that this was more representative of her experiences and community, then using standard English. Her short-story, \\"Blankets of Shame\\" is included in the anthology of Native American Women's writing and art, #NotYourPrincess (Annick Press, 2017). Campbell has also been featured on the radio talk show Our Native Land on CTV. Plays Campbell's first professionally produced play, Flight, was the first all Aboriginal theatre production in modern Canada. Weaving modern dance, storytelling and drama together with traditional Aboriginal art practises, this early work set a stylistic tone that her most recent productions continue to explore. It won the Dora Mavor Moore Award at Toronto's Theatre Passe Muraille in 1986 (where it debuted) and the Best Canadian Production at the Quinzanne International Festival in Quebec City. Two of her plays have toured extensively within Canada and abroad to Scotland, Denmark and Italy. From 1985 to 1997 Ms. Campbell owned and operated a production company, Gabriel Productions. She has written and/or directed films by the National Film Board of Canada (NFB) and Canadian Broadcasting Corporation (CBC), including My Partners My People, which aired on CTV for 3 years. She is coordinator and member of Sage Ensemble, a community theatre group for Aboriginal elders, and is actively associated with the Gordon Tootoosis Nikaniwin Theatre (Formerly Saskatchewan Native Theatre Company) in Saskatoon. Political career and education In addition to her work in the arts, Campbell is a volunteer, activist and advocate for Aboriginal rights and the rights of women. She was a founder of the first Women's halfway house and the first Women and Children's Emergency Crisis Centre in Edmonton. She has worked with Aboriginal youths in community theatre; set up food and housing co-ops; facilitated women's circles; advocated for the hiring and recognition of Native people in the arts, and mentored many indigenous artists working in all forms of the arts. Campbell sits as an Elder on the Saskatchewan Aboriginal Justice Commission, and is a member of the Grandmothers for Justice Society. Academically, she has focused on teaching M√©tis history and Methods in Oral Tradition Research. She has worked as a researcher, meeting with elders to gather and record oral historical evidence of many aspects of aboriginal traditional knowledge, including medical and dietary as well as spiritual, social, and general cultural practices. She has completed the course work for an M.A. in Native Studies at the University of Saskatchewan (though it has not been awarded) and has received honorary degrees from the University of Regina, York University, and Athabasca University. Campbell has become the leader of many M√©tis social movements and has become very active in the political community. Due to her moving to the city of Vancouver, and the issues she faced there, Campbell felt as though she became disconnected from her community in Saskatchewan. Involvement in activism and politics has allowed Campbell to reconnect with her childhood community.

The line currently runs from the Patapsco Light Rail Stop to Parkway Center in Anne Arundel County, via BWI Airport and Arundel Mills. Weekend trips and some weekday trips on this line terminate at Arundel Mills. The line operates between BWI Airport and downtown Baltimore during hours when the light rail is not operating. History Route 75 is one of the most modified bus routes in MTA history from its original route. Only three of the 27 miles of its initial route in 1973 are still in place today. Much of its original route is not served by any public transportation, particularly portions along Maryland Route 177. Its current route is actually the successor to several other bus routes no longer in operation. The route has seen a very fragile existence, facing a lot of budget cuts that have resulted in its route and schedule being reduced, and a near threat of elimination. The current Route 17 started operating in 1973 between downtown Baltimore and Gibson Island. At that time, it served the Annapolis Road/Baltimore-Annapolis Boulevard and Mountain Road corridors, mostly of Anne Arundel County. It also passed through the towns of Linthicum, Glen Burnie, and Pasadena. The no. 17 designation was previously used for a streetcar that ran along the St. Paul Street corridor of Charles Village from 1893 to 1938. In 1939, this was converted to a bus operation and extended south to Westport along Annapolis Road. This route was replaced with other services in 1947. Another unrelated route briefly ran along East East Fayette Street 1949-50, the last Baltimore bus route to carry this designation until the introduction of the current Route 17. The route was shortened during the 1980s from Gibson Island to Lake Shore Plaza. Gibson Island became a private island, and the causeway leading there closed to the public, and ridership demand in this area was very low. Also, trips at certain times of day terminated at Pinewood Village in the Harundale area. Route 17 did not serve BWI Airport until 1993. From 1973 to 1989, Route 16, which operated from downtown Baltimore to Odenton, provided service to BWI. This was replaced with Route 230 in 1989. Route 230 provided a limited number of express trips to the airport until the light rail was extended into Anne Arundel County in 1993, and local bus routes replaced the service.MTA June 1993 schedule changes Opening of Central Light Rail When the Central Light Rail line was opened in South Baltimore and Anne Arundel County, Route 17 underwent a series of changes in various phases. In September 1992, the route was converted into a feeder bus into the light rail, and was truncated to the Patapsco Light Rail Stop. The portion going to downtown Baltimore was eliminated, though it was covered locally by Route 28. In addition, Sunday service was completely abolished.MTA September 1992 schedule changes In January 1993, the route faced budget cuts. On weekdays, midday service between 9 AM and 2 PM, which had very low ridership was eliminated.November 1992 hearings on MTA cutbacks Saturday service was shortened to Pinewood Village.MTA January 1993 schedule changes In September 1993, when the final stretch of the light rail opened, midday service was restored, as the route underwent even more changes, replacing the then- eliminated Route 230. It was modified to serve BWI Airport and the BWI business area and hotel district. The portion along Hammonds Ferry Road in Linthicum was provided on a new Route 12. Rush hour service operated to Lake Shore Plaza, and midday service only as far as the Cromwell Light Rail Stop. Combining with Route 12 and cuts In 1996, Route 17 faced its biggest cuts ever. All service between BWI Airport and Lake Shore Plaza was eliminated, as MTA would no longer serve some of these communities. Service to Pinewood Village was replaced with a new limited branch of Route 14, and service on Mountain Road was no longer provided. Other parts of Baltimore-Annapolis Boulevard are within a close walk of various light rail stops. Route 17 line was also combined with Route 12 line and extended to Parkway Center, thereby providing all this service on a single route. Extension to Arundel Mills In 2001, with the opening of Arundel Mills mall in Hanover, Maryland, Route 17 was extended to this area. All trips to Parkway Center were routed via Arundel Mills, and all trips terminating at BWI Airport were extended there. In addition, Sunday service was added to serve the mall. Threat of total elimination In 2005, as part of the Greater Baltimore Bus Initiative, MTA proposed to completely eliminate Route 17, except for a few trips between downtown Baltimore and BWI Airport when the light rail was not operating. Under this plan, riders between the airport and Arundel Mills were instructed to use Howard County Transit's Red Express Route, which operates along nearly the same route in this area, and all other riders in Anne Arundel County would lose service. MTA stated that the underperforming route required a heavy taxpayer subsidy. The plan resulted in a public outcry from riders, businesses along the route, and community activists. One of the major complaints was that many non-English-speaking riders along the route who worked within the BWI hotel district would lose service and not even know it.Word of bus changes isn't reaching Latino riders - Social Issues, Maryland, Metropolitan Transportation Authority - baltimoresun.com In 2006, MTA revised its plan for Route 17. Under the new routing plan, the line would continue to operate full- time, but from the Patapsco Light Rail Stop to Arundel Mills only, with service provided every 30 minutes during rush hour, and every 90 minutes at other times. Some of the deviations along the route where duplicate service is provided (such as to BWI Amtrak) would be eliminated or modified. Only riders west of Arundel Mills to Parkway Center would lose service. In 2007, GBBI was canceled, and plans to eliminate or reduce service on this line were not made. In 2009, branches to Airport 100 Business Park and SECU were eliminated. In 2017, Route 17 became LocalLink Route 75 under BaltimoreLink.http://baltimorelink.com/routes/route-17 References 17 1973 establishments in Maryland ","title":"Route 75 (MTA Maryland LocalLink)"},{"id":"9651228","text":"The Panavision HD-900F is the first digital high definition camera, able to record using the standard motion picture frame rate of 24 frames per second.

It was first launched in 2006 as Google Apps for Your Domain and rebranded as G Suite in 2016. Google Workspace comprises of Gmail, Contacts, Calendar, Meet and Chat for communication; Currents for employee engagement; Drive for storage; and the Google Docs suite for content creation. An Admin Panel is provided for managing users and services. Depending on edition Google Workspace may also include the digital interactive whiteboard Jamboard and an option to purchase such add-ons as the telephony service Voice. The education edition adds a learning platform Google Classroom and as of October 2020 retains the name G Suite for Education. While most of these services are individually available at no cost to consumers who use their free Google (Gmail) accounts, Google Workspace adds enterprise features such as custom email addresses at a domain (@yourcompany.com), an option for unlimited Drive storage, additional administrative tools and advanced settings, as well as 24/7 phone and email support. Being based in Google's data centers, data and information is saved instantly and then synchronized to other data centers for backup purposes. Unlike the free, consumer-facing services, Google Workspace users do not see advertisements while using the services, and information and data in Google Workspace accounts do not get used for advertisement purposes. Furthermore, Google Workspace administrators can fine-tune security and privacy settings. As of April 2020, G Suite had 6 million paying businesses,https://www.cnbc.com/2020/04/07/google-g-suite- passes-6-million-customers.html and 120 million G Suite for Education users.https://blog.google/outreach-initiatives/education/meet-for-edu/ History From February 10, 2006, Google started testing \\"Gmail for Your Domain\\" at San Jose City College, hosting Gmail accounts with SJCC domain addresses and admin tools for account management. On August 28, 2006, Google launched Google Apps for Your Domain, a set of apps for organizations. Available for free as a beta service, it included Gmail, Google Talk, Google Calendar, and the Google Page Creator, which was later replaced with Google Sites. Dave Girouard, then Google's vice president and general manager for enterprise, outlined its benefits for business customers: \\"Organizations can let Google be the experts in delivering high quality email, messaging, and other web-based services while they focus on the needs of their users and their day-to-day business\\". Google announced an edition for schools, then known as Google Apps for Education, on October 10, 2006. On February 22, 2007, Google introduced Google Apps Premier Edition, which differed from the free version by offering more storage (10 GB per user), APIs for business integration, 99.9% uptime for Gmail, and 24/7 phone support. It cost $50 per user account per year. According to Google, early adopters of Google Apps Premier Edition included Procter & Gamble, San Francisco Bay Pediatrics, and Salesforce.com. Additionally, all editions of Google Apps were then able to use Google Documents and Spreadsheets, users could access Gmail on BlackBerry mobile devices, and administrators gained more application control. Further enhancements came, on June 25, 2007, when Google added a number of features to Google Apps, including mail migration from external IMAP servers, shared address books, a visual overhaul of Google Docs and Google Sheets, and increased Gmail attachment size. A ZDNet article noted that Google Apps now offered a tool for switching from the popular Exchange Server and Lotus Notes, positioning Google as an alternative to Microsoft and IBM. On October 3, 2007, a month after acquiring Postini, Google announced that the startup's email security and compliance options had been added to Google Apps Premier Edition. Customers now had the ability to better configure their spam and virus filtering, implement retention policies, restore deleted messages, and give administrators access to all emails. Google introduced Google Sites on February 28, 2008. Google Sites provided a simple new Google Apps tool for creating intranets and team websites. On June 9, 2009, Google launched Google Apps Sync for Microsoft Outlook, a plugin that allows customers to synchronize their email, calendar, and contacts data between Outlook and Google Apps. Less than a month later, on July 7, 2009, Google announced that the services included in Google Apps‚ÄîGmail, Google Calendar, Google Docs, and Google Talk‚Äîwere out of beta. Google opened the Google Apps Marketplace, on March 9, 2010, which is an online store for third-party business applications that integrate with Google Apps, to make it easier for users and software to do business in the cloud. Participating vendors included Intuit, Appirio, and Atlassian. On July 26, 2010, Google introduced an edition for governments, then-known as Google Apps for Government, which was designed to meet the public sector's unique policy and security needs. It was also announced that Google Apps had become the first suite of cloud applications to receive Federal Information Security Management Act (FISMA) certification and accreditation. Nearly five years after the launch of Google Apps, on April 26, 2011, Google announced that organizations with more than 10 users were no longer eligible for the free edition of Google Apps. They would have to sign up for the paid version, now known as Google Apps for Business. A flexible billing plan was also introduced, giving customers the option of paying $5 per user per month with no contractual commitment. On March 28, 2012, Google launched Google Vault, an optional electronic discovery and archiving service for Google Apps for Business customers. And then, on April 24, 2012, Google introduced Google Drive, a platform for storing and sharing files. Each Google Apps for Business user was given 5GB of Drive storage, with the option to purchase more. Later that year, Google announced that the free version of Google Apps would no longer be available to new customers. Google unified the storage between Drive and Gmail, on May 13, 2013, giving Google Apps customers 30GB total that are shared across the apps. On March 10, 2014, Google launched the Google Apps Referral Program, which offers participating individuals a $15 referral bonus for each new Google Apps user they refer. Google, on June 25, 2014, announced Drive for Work, a new Google Apps offering featuring unlimited file storage, advanced audit reporting, and new security controls for $10 per user per month. Google Enterprise, the company's business product division, was officially renamed Google for Work on September 2, 2014. Eric Schmidt, then Google's executive chairman said, \\"we never set out to create a traditional 'enterprise' business‚Äîwe wanted to create a new way of doing work (...) so the time has come for our name to catch up with our ambition\\". Google announced that Google Apps would be rebranded as G Suite on September 29, 2016. Then, on October 25, 2016, Google launched the first hardware product for G Suite, the Jamboard; a 55-inch digital whiteboard connected to the cloud. Google announced that G Suite would be rebranded as Google Workspace on October 6, 2020https://gsuiteupdates.googleblog.com/2020/10/introducing- google-workspace.html, and that Workspace would emphasize increased integration between the apps, such as the ability to create Docs from within Chats, or start a Meet call from within a presentation.https://www.theverge.com/2020/10/6/21503649/google-workspace-g- suite-gmail-chat-meet-docs As part of the rebranding, the iconic logos for Gmail, Google Drive, Google Docs, Google Calendar, Google Meet, and other products in Google Workspace were changed.

The Starter plan includes email addresses with custom domains (@yourcompany.com), video and voice calls, calendars, 30GB storage, collaborative documents, spreadsheets, presentations and sites, controls for security and privacy, and 24/7 phone and email support. The Business Plus plan enables many additional custom features, including advanced admin controls for Drive, 5TB storage on Drive, audit and reporting insights for Drive content and sharing, custom message retention policies, and more. Enterprise-level customers receive S/MIMI encryption, noise cancellation in Meet, and as much storage as they need.https://workspace.google.com/pricing.html =Gmail= Gmail is a web- based email service, launched in a limited beta release on April 1, 2004. With over 1 billion active consumer users worldwide in February 2016, it has become popular for giving users large amounts of storage space, and for having threaded conversations and robust search capabilities. As part of Google Workspace, Gmail comes with additional features designed for business use, including: * Email addresses with the customer's domain name (@yourcompany.com) * 99.9% guaranteed uptime with zero scheduled downtime for maintenance * 30GB of storage space * 24/7 phone and email support * Synchronization compatibility with Microsoft Outlook and other email providers * Support for add-ons that integrate third-party apps purchased from the Google Workspace Marketplace with Gmail =Google Drive= Google Drive is a file storage and synchronization service, launched on April 24, 2012. The official announcement described Drive as \\"a place where you can create, share, collaborate, and keep all of your stuff\\". With Google Drive, users can upload any type of file to the cloud, share them with others, and access them from any computer, tablet, or smartphone. Users can sync files between their device and the cloud with apps for Microsoft Windows and Apple macOS computers, and Android and iOS smartphones and tablets. As part of Google Workspace, Google Drive comes with additional features designed for business use, including: * Either 30GB, 2TB, 5TB per user, or unlimited storage, depending on the plan * Advanced admin controls, depending on the plan * Audit and reporting insights for Drive content and sharing, depending on the plan =Google Docs, Sheets and Slides= Google Docs, Google Sheets and Google Slides are a word processor, a spreadsheet and a presentation program respectively. The three programs originate from company acquisitions in 2006, and are today integrated into Google Drive as part of the Google Docs suite. They all serve as collaborative software that allow users to view and edit documents, spreadsheets and presentations together in real-time through a web browser or mobile device. Changes are saved automatically, with a revision history keeping track of changes. There is also the capability to set user permission levels to designate who can view, comment or edit the document as well as permissions to download the specific document. Google Forms, meanwhile, is a tool that allows collecting information from users via a personalized survey or quiz. The information is then collected and automatically connected to a spreadsheet. The spreadsheet is populated with the survey and quiz responses. In June 2014, Google introduced Office support in Google Docs, Sheets, and Slides without the need for file conversion. Writing for TechCrunch, Frederic Lardinois wrote that \\"Google is clearly positioning its apps as a more affordable solutions for companies that need to occasionally edit Office files\\". As part of Google Workspace, Google Docs and Slides come with additional features designed for business use, including unlimited revision history. Google Workspace also has garnered a strong following in education, with over 70 million users by 2017. =Google Forms= Google Forms is a survey application. Forms features all of the collaboration and sharing features found in Docs, Sheets, and Slides. It can also be used to create quizzes, including some specialized functions that are of use in educational settings. =Google Sites= Google Sites is a creation tool that allows multiple people to create and edit websites, without requiring coding knowledge or other web design skills. It was introduced in February 2008 in an effort to help customers \\"quickly gather a variety of information in one place ‚Äì including videos, calendars, presentations, attachments, and text ‚Äì and easily share it for viewing or editing with a small group, their entire organization, or the world.\\" =Google Calendar= Google Calendar is an online calendar intended to help keep track of time and schedules. It was launched in April 2006, and integrates with Gmail for users to easily add events from email messages directly to the calendar. As part of Google Workspace, Google Calendar comes with additional features designed for business use, including: * Smart scheduling of meetings, where the service finds available times and appropriate locations based on coworkers' schedules * Public calendars for consumers to see a business' upcoming events * Calendar integration with Google Sites * Easy migration from Exchange, Outlook or iCal, or from .ics and .csv files * Ability to see what meeting rooms and shared resources are available =Google Chat= Google Chat is a communication software developed by Google built for teams that provides direct messages and team chat rooms, similar to competitors Slack and Microsoft Teams, along with a group messaging function that allows G Drive content sharing (Google Docs, Google Sheets, Google Slides). It is one of two apps that constitute the replacement for Google Hangouts, the other being Google Meet. Google planned to begin retiring Google Hangouts in October 2019. Google Hangouts remains a part of Google Workspace, but will be discontinued and replaced by Google Chat and Google Meet by the end of 2020. =Google Meet= Google Meet is a standards-based Video Conferencing application, using proprietary protocols for video, audio and data transcoding. Google have partnered with Pexip to provide interoperability between the Google protocol and standards-based SIP/H.323 protocols to enable communications between Hangouts Meet and other Video Conferencing equipment and software. =Google Currents= Google Currents lets team members \\"engage and communicate\\" at \\"a deeper level\\", with a stream featuring posts, comments and Communities based on common goals. It \\"makes it easy for anyone to discuss and share ideas, no matter their team, level or location\\". It features Collections that make it easy to group posts by topic, in order for users to \\"show what they know and follow what matters most\\". As part of Google Workspace, Google Currents comes with additional features designed for business use, including enhanced privacy controls and restricted communities. Currents is a modified successor of Google+, which was shut down for consumers and brands on April 2, 2019. =Google Keep= Google Keep is a note-taking service with a variety of tools for notes, including text, lists, voice, and images. Google Keep became part of Google Workspace in February 2017, and as part of Google Workspace, Google Keep comes with additional features designed for business use, including: * Integration with Google Docs to easily access Keep notes while on Docs on the web =Google Vault= Google Vault, an archiving and electronic discovery service exclusively available to Google Workspace customers, was announced on March 28, 2012. Vault gives users \\"an easy-to-use and cost-effective solution for managing information critical to your business and preserving important data\\", with Google stating that it can \\"reduce the costs of litigation, regulatory investigation and compliance actions\\" by saving and managing Gmail messages and chat logs with the ability to search and manage data based on filters, such as terms, dates, senders, recipients, and labels. An update in June 2014 let Vault customers search, preview, copy, and export files in Google Drive. =Jamboard= In October 2016, Google announced Jamboard, the first hardware product designed for Google Workspace. Jamboard is a digital interactive whiteboard that enables collaborative meetings and brainstorming. The Jamboard is connected to the cloud, and enables people in different locations to work together in real-time through multiple Jamboards or connected remotely through a smartphone companion app. The Jamboard recognizes different touch inputs, such as using a stylus to sketch or eraser to start over, and does not require batteries or pairing. The Jamboard is a 55-inch 4K display with a built-in HD camera, speakers and Wi-Fi. =Google Workspace Marketplace= Google Workspace Marketplace (formerly Google Apps Marketplace and then G Suite Marketplace), launched in 2010, is an online store with business-oriented cloud applications that augment G Suite functionality. The Marketplace lets administrators browse for, purchase, and deploy integrated cloud applications. It comprises the Business Tools, Productivity, Education, Communication, and Utilities categories. In September 2014, Google released a blog post saying that employees would be able to install third-party apps from the Marketplace without involving administrators. =Other functionality= Introduced in February 2017, Google Cloud Search enables a \\"unified search experience\\" in G Suite. Cloud Search lets users search for information across the entire G Suite product lineup. Users can also search for contacts, with results including the person's contact details, as well as events and files in common. The Cloud Search mobile app features \\"assist cards\\", described by Google as \\"a new way to help you find the right information at the right time. Using Google's machine intelligence technology, these cards can help you prepare for an upcoming meeting or even suggest files that need your attention\\". Google states that Cloud Search respects file-sharing permissions, meaning that users will only see results for files they have access to. The initial global roll- out of Cloud Search introduced the functionality for G Suite Business and Enterprise customers, with Google stating that more functionality will be added over time, including support for third-party applications. Introduced in July 2017, \\"Hire\\" is a job applications and management tool developed by Google to be used in combination with G Suite. The tool lets employers track job candidates' contact information, as well as r√©sum√©s, calendar invitations, and allows for business partners to share feedback on candidates. Job applicants can choose what information to share with potential employers. The tool is designed for businesses based in the United States with fewer than 1,000 employees, and integrates with Google services, such as Gmail for sending messages, Google Calendar for tracking schedules, Google Sheets for overview of all candidates, and Google Hangouts for initial conversations. Google introduced Work Insights in September 2018 for administrators to see how departments are using Google products. Security and privacy Google states that \\"we do not collect, scan or use your G Suite data for advertising purposes and do not display ads in G Suite, Education, or Government core services\\". Furthermore, it states that \\"the data that companies, schools and government agencies put into our G Suite services does not belong to Google. Whether it's corporate intellectual property, personal information or a homework assignment, Google does not own that data and Google does not sell that data to third parties\\". Data is stored in Google's data centers, which are \\"built with custom-designed servers, that run our own operating system for security and performance\\", with \\"more than 550 full-time security and privacy professionals\\". In a blog post, Google stated that benefits of using G Suite included \\"disaster recovery\\", with data and information \\"simultaneously replicated in two data centers at once, so that if one data center fails, we nearly instantly transfer your data over to the other one that's also been reflecting your actions.\\" Though acknowledging that \\"no backup solution from us or anyone else is absolutely perfect\\", Google states that it has \\"invested a lot of effort to help make it second to none\\". Encryption, specifically AES 128-bit or stronger, is applied to data while stored at data centers, under transit between data centers and users, and between data centers. At its introduction in June 2014, TechCrunch reported that Google Drive, as part of G Suite, offers \\"enterprise-grade security and compliance\\", including SSAE 16 / ISAE 3402 Type II, SOC 2-audit, ISO 27001 certification, adherence to the Safe Harbor Privacy Principles, and can support industry-specific requirements like Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA). In October 2020, Google announed the new Business Plus pricing tier for Workspace that includes enhanced security features and controls like Vault and Advanced Endpoint Management, but not the full security options available in Enterprise editions of Workspace.https://workspace.google.com/pricing.htmlhttps://www.forbes.com/sites/barrycollins/2020/10/06/g-suite- revamped-as-google-workspace-with-a-host-of-new-features/#2a18627b7521 Customers , Google has 5 million businesses paying for G Suite, while it has 70 million G Suite for Education users. In September 2014, Amit Singh, then-President of then-named Google for Work, stated that \\"60 percent of the Fortune 500\\" companies were paying for the service, with \\"more than 1,800 customers\\" signing up each week. Notable companies using G Suite include Uber, AllSaints, BuzzFeed, Design Within Reach, Verizon, Axis Bank and PwC. Referral and partner programs In March 2014, Google announced the Google Apps Referral Program in the United States and Canada. The program lets users receive money, coupons and other incentives by referring customers to G Suite. In December 2014, Google introduced the Google for Work and Education Partner Program. The program combined existing, individual programs from Apps, Chrome, Cloud Platform, Maps, and Search into one overall program, and \\"allows partners to better sell, service and innovate across the Google for Work and Education suite of products and platforms\\". Reception In an August 2011 review, PC Worlds Tony Bradley wrote that \\"the value of a rival platform such as Google Apps hinges on how compatible it is with Microsoft Office formatting conventions and file types\\", praising Google for having \\"gone to great lengths to improve fidelity with Microsoft Office, but it hasn't gone far enough\\", criticizing \\"many features\\" for being reformatted, including \\"tables of contents, footnotes, or inserted images\\". Bradley praised Google's collaborative apps, writing that it was \\"besting what Microsoft offers in Office 365\\". Regarding the price, he wrote that \\"Google's package is the best value. The annual pricing of $50 per user per year makes it about a third less per user per year than Office 365, yet it boasts equivalent functionality sufficient for most small and medium organizations\\". Gary Marshall of TechRadar commented in 2016 that \\"Where Office tries to do everything imaginable, Google's suite is much more basic. That said, it's much more powerful than it was when the package debuted in 2006, but the emphasis on simplicity and speed remains.\\" Marshall wrote that \\"We wouldn't want to craft a massive, complicated manuscript in Google Docs, but then that isn't what Docs is designed to do. It's a fast and user-friendly way to create everyday documents and to share them with colleagues and clients\\", and that fellow service Google Sheets \\"covers the most common Excel functions [...] but doesn't have the power of Microsoft's offering\\". Marshall praised collaboration for being \\"effortless\\", and praised importing of external file formats and making those editable and collaborative for being a \\"big selling point\\". PC Magazines Eric Grevstad wrote that \\"what's online is what you get\\", adding that \\"configuring them to [work offline] is a rigmarole\\". He stated that the package was \\"an illustration of software's version of the 80/20 rule [...] 80 percent of users will never need more than 20 percent of the features\\". He stated that \\"comparing [G Suite] to Office 2016 is like bringing a handgun to a cannon fight [...] Microsoft's PC-based suite is designed to have almost every feature anyone might ever need; Google's online suite is designed to have most features most people use daily.\\" Tom's Hardware's James Gaskin wrote that \\"like most Google products, it can claim the cleanest and most minimal interface in the market\\", and \\"No other suite except Office 365 can get close to the ease of collaboration Google provides. And even Microsoft's product trails by a wide margin as changes only appear in real- time in Word 2016, not the other apps\\". Conclusively, he wrote: \\"The progress made between the first Google App release and now has been considerable. As the world moves to more and more mobile computing, Google has a distinct advantage. But tradition dies hard, and those who build more than basic documents, spreadsheets, and presentations will remain tied to their desktops and laptops for the time being.\\" After Google+ was launched, many articles were published that emphasized that having a presence on Google+ helped with the business' Google search result rankings. Particularly public-facing Pages and +1 buttons were pushed as effective marketing strategies. However, writing for The New York Times, Quentin Hardy said that \\"the sour grapes version is that Google Plus isn‚Äôt getting anything like the buzz or traffic of Facebook, so Google is figuring out other ways to make the service relevant\\". However, Hardy did note that the integration between Google+ and other, more popular Google services, including Hangouts, meant \\"it‚Äôs still early on, but it‚Äôs easy to see how this could be an efficient way to bring workers to a virtual meeting, collaborate during it and embed in a calendar the future work commitments and follow-up that result\\". =Competitors= The key competitor to the Google suite is Microsoft Office 365, Microsoft's cloud-based offering for businesses that includes similar products. The key differences are in the pricing plans, storage space and number of features. As noted by TechRepublic in 2013, pricing plans differ in that \\"Google Apps has a quick and easy pricing plan for their standard Google Apps for Business package: $5 per user per month or $50 per user per year ... In contrast, Office 365 has a multitude of plans (six as of September, 2013) which can be both good and bad since it provides flexibility but also involves some complexity to figure out the best choice\\". Storage space varies because \\"Office 365 gives users 50 GB of space in Outlook and 1 TB in OneDrive. Google Apps provides 30 GB of space which is spread among Gmail, Drive and Picasa\\". And regarding features, it states that \\"Office 365 has the advantage for plenty of users who have been familiar with Word, Excel and the rest of the gang for years; there is less of a learning curve than with Google Apps if the latter represents a brand new experience ... However, it's also true that Office is notorious for being loaded with complex, unused features which can cause confusion, so the familiarity many will embrace also comes with something of a price, especially if companies are paying for advanced packages not all employees will use. By contrast, Google Apps programs are fairly easy to learn and intuitive, but may feel too awkward for those who are hard-coded to work in Office.\\" Stephen Shankland of CNET wrote in 2014 that \\"It's hard to compare Google Apps' success to that of Microsoft Office since Google doesn't release revenue or user figures\\". , Microsoft has 60 million commercial customers signed up for its Office 365 product offering, with \\"50,000 small business customers added to Office 365 each month\\".

It operates the Fairchild Republic A-10 Thunderbolt II aircraft conducting close air support missions. If activated to federal service, the Wing is gained by the United States Air Force Air Combat Command. Mission The federal mission of the 124th Fighter Wing under Title 10 United States Code is to properly equip and train personnel in a high state of readiness for immediate tasking as levied by higher headquarters as part of the Air Reserve Component (ARC) of the U.S. Air Force. Its state mission under Title 32 United States Code is to, at the call of the Governor of the State of Idaho, provide personnel and equipment to assist civil authorities prior to, during and after emergencies or disasters; to protect life, property, preserve peace, order and public safety.Globalsecurity.org Units The 124th Fighter Wing consists of the following units: * 124th Operations Group : 190th Fighter Squadron * 124th Maintenance Group * 124th Mission Support Group * 124th Medical Group * 266th Range Squadron History =Air Defense= 190th FIS F-86L Sabre Interceptor 51-2968. Today, this aircraft is on display at McClellan Air Force Base, California. On 1 July 1955, the Idaho Air National Guard 190th Fighter- Interceptor Squadron was authorized to expand to a group level, and the 124th Fighter Group (Air Defense) was established by the National Guard Bureau. The 190th FIS becoming the group's flying squadron. Other squadrons assigned into the group were the 124th Headquarters, 124th Material Squadron (Maintenance), 124th Combat Support Squadron, and the 124th USAF Dispensary. Also in 1955, the F-86A day interceptors were replaced by the F-94A Starfire all-weather interceptor. The 190th changed aircraft four more times over the next 23 years to fly the F-89C Scorpion, F-86L Sabre Interceptor and the F-102 Delta Dagger. In 1958, the 124th implemented the ADC Runway Alert Program, in which interceptors of the 190th FIS were committed to a five-minute runway alert, a task that would last until 1974. In 1968 Air Defense Command was re-designated as Aerospace Defense Command (ADCOM). =Tactical Reconnaissance= 190th TRS RF-4C Phantom II 68-0608 about 1988. The 190th did not carry tail codes on its RF-4C aircraft. In November 1975, the 124th Fighter-Interceptor Group was transferred from Air Defense Command to Tactical Air Command (TAC). It was re- equipped by TAC with the RF-4C Phantom II Mach 2 high speed reconnaissance aircraft. Many of these planes were veterans of combat in Vietnam. F-4 Phantom jets would eventually spend 20 years on Gowen Field, longer than any other aircraft in the history of Idaho's Air National Guard. The unarmed RF-4C carried high resolution cameras and electronic sensors, which soon proved their worth to thousands of people in Idaho. RF-4C jets tracked flood waters pouring from the ruptured Teton Dam within hours of the dam's collapse in 1976 to show officials where flood waters were headed in time to warn people living in endangered areas. Aerial photographs were also taken immediately after the 1983 Borah Peak earthquake near Challis. The Challis-Mackay region experienced rather thorough damage, with 11 commercial buildings and 39 homes with major damage; while another 200 houses were damaged, minor to moderate. The reconnaissance photos helped emergency response crews locate and evaluate the damage. The RF-4C was still in service at the time of the 1991 Gulf War, Operation Desert Storm, although the 190th TRS did not deploy any aircraft to the Middle East. Following the end of Desert Storm, all of the remaining RF-4Cs were withdrawn from USAF service. =Electronic Warfare= 190th FS F-4G \\"Wild Weasel\\" 69-307 In 1991, Idaho's Air Guard changed aircraft and mission again, and began its conversion from the RF-4C to the F‚Äë4G Phantom II \\"Wild Weasel\\" Electronic Warfare aircraft in June 1991. The Idaho ANG was to be the only ANG unit to operate the F-4G. The F-4G was designed as an anti- Surface to Air Missile aircraft to jam and attack enemy radars when they were activated. \\"Wild Weasel\\" tactics and techniques were first developed in 1965 during the Vietnam War, and were later integrated into the Suppression of Enemy Air Defenses (SEAD) a plan used by US air forces to establish immediate air control, prior to possible full-scale conflict. The F-4Gs were received from the 37th Tactical Fighter Wing at George AFB, California as part of the closure of George AFB. The squadron was re-designated as the 190th Fighter Squadron with the changeover of its parent 124th to the Air Force Objective Wing organization. In 1992, the 124th Fighter Group became part of the new Air Combat Command. In April 1993 the squadron's Wild Weasel jets were sent to Southwest Asia to support Operation Southern Watch, enforcing the no‚Äëfly zone over southern Iraq. Twice 190th airmen were challenged by illegal Iraqi air defense radar near Basra. The threats were answered ‚Äì and silenced ‚Äì with AGM-88 High-Speed Anti-Radiation Missile (HARM) anti-radiation missiles. Less than six months after ending its first Southwest Asia tour, the squadron began a second Southern Watch deployment, followed by two back‚Äëto‚Äëback tours in support of Operation Provide Comfort, enforcing the northern no‚Äëfly zone and protecting Kurds from Iraqi aggression. From 1993 to 1995 there were a total of four deployments to the Gulf. The last such deployment returned to Boise in December 1995. Idaho's airmen served longer in Southwest Asia than any other flying unit in the Air National Guard. The 124th was named \\"Best Flying Unit in the Air National Guard\\" and received the prestigious Spaatz Trophy from the National Guard Association. Idaho airmen and Phantom jets went to Canada and Norway to provide critical tactical reconnaissance capabilities to U.S. and NATO forces =Composite Wing= In the mid-1990s the mission of the 124th changed considerably. On 1 October 1995, the status of the 124th was changed from Group to Wing, and the organization became the 124th Fighter Wing on 1 October 1995. On 20 April 1996, the Air Force withdrew the last F-4Gs from the 124th FW and the aircraft were consigned to storage at Davis Monthan AFB, Arizona. This marked the final retirement of the F-4 Phantom II from active service with any American military unit, and after 20 years of service with the Idaho Air National Guard. The Phantoms of the 190th Fighter Squadron were replaced by the A-10 Thunderbolt II air-ground support aircraft, better known as the \\"Warthog\\". The 124th also became a composite wing, designated the 124th Wing on 1 September 1996 with the activation of the 189th Airlift Squadron at Boise ANGB. The squadron, assigned to the 124th Operations Group, was a tactical airlift squadron, equipped with Lockheed C-130E Hercules transports. The 124th Wing, consisted of 18 units ‚Äì two flying squadrons, 15 support units at Gowen Field and an electronic combat training range control squadron assigned to Mountain Home Air Force Base, Idaho. =Tactical Airlift= 189th Airlift Squadron C-130E 62-1846 on the flight line at Gowen Field, 4 March 2004. Prior to its activation as a squadron in 1995, the 189th Airlift Squadron was initially formed on 1 April 1984 as the 189th Tactical Reconnaissance Training Flight. Its mission was a Formal Training Unit (FTU) for aircrews being assigned to the 124th Tactical Reconnaissance (later Fighter) group flying RF-4C Phantom II reconnaissance and later F-4G Phantom II electronic warfare aircraft. On 16 March 1992 it was re-designated as the 189th Fighter Flight. The flight used 190th TFS/FS aircraft for its training mission. With the retirement of the F-4Gs in 1995, the status of the unit was changed from a flight to a squadron, and it received C-130E aircraft for operational missions. The 189th supported countless deployments all over the world in support of the U.S. Southern Command, Operation Allied Force, Operation Southern Watch, Operation Enduring Freedom and Operation Iraqi Freedom. They also responded to winter weather disasters New Mexico and provided humanitarian support for Hurricanes Katrina and Rita. The Airlift Squadron's awards include the Governor's Outstanding Unit Citation 1997, 1999, and 2005 as well as the Adjutant General Award 1998. The 189th Airlift Squadron was inactivated as a result of the 2005 Base Realignment and Closure Act on 18 October 2009. Many of the members who were part of the squadron were absorbed within the wing. With the inactivation of the 190th, the wing's designation was returned to the 124th Fighter Wing. =Close Air Support= 190th Fighter Squadron A-10A flying over Sawtooth Range in 2009 The Warthog, famous for its success against Iraqi armor in the Gulf War, provides close air support to troops on the ground. Idaho's A-10s were deployed during Operation Allied Force in 1999 when they flew combat missions over Kosovo and again in Operation Iraqi Freedom in 2003. Already deployed to Kuwait in support of Operation Southern Watch, more than 250 personnel were mobilized in place. Idaho's A-10s led combat search and rescue and close air support missions in the initial weeks and months of the war. Two 190th pilots received the Distinguished Flying Cross for their efforts. On 8 April 2003, an A-10A (USAF Serial Number '78-0691') of 124th Wing/190th FS was shot down while on a combat mission, reportedly by an Iraqi Roland SAM. The pilot successfully ejected, and was soon rescued by USAF Pararescue forces of the 301st ARRS. The 190th Fighter Squadron also deployed in 2007 to Iraq, and 2008 to Afghanistan. In 2009, the 124th Fighter Wing was selected a key installation to perform a new Consolidated Install Program for the entire active duty, Guard and Reserve A-10 fleet.

During the mission, the two A-10 aircraft mistakenly attacked a patrol of four armored vehicles from D Squadron of the British Blues and Royals of the Household Cavalry that were supporting the 16 Air Assault Brigade in Operation Telic. As a result of the attack by the 190th A-10 aircraft, British Lance-Corporal of Horse Matty Hull was killed and five of his colleagues were injured, four seriously. =Lineage= * Designated 124th Fighter Group (Air Defense), and allotted to Idaho ANG, 1955 : Extended federal recognition and activated, 1 July 1955 : Re-designated: 124th Fighter-Interceptor Group, 1 July 1972 : Re-designated: 124th Tactical Reconnaissance Group, 1 December 1975 : Re-designated: 124th Fighter Group, 16 October 1991 : Status changed from Group to Wing, 1 October 1995 : Re-designated: 124th Fighter Wing, 1 October 1995 : Re-designated: 124th Wing, 1 September 1996 : Re-designated: 124th Fighter Wing, 18 October 2009 =Assignments= * 140th Air Defense Wing, 1 July 1955 * Idaho Air National Guard, 1 January 1961 ‚Äì Present : Gained by: Tactical Air Command : Gained by: Air Combat Command, 1 June 1982‚ÄìPresent : 189th Airlift Squadron gained by Air Mobility Command, 1 September 1996 ‚Äì 18 October 2009 =Components= * 124th Operations Group, 1 October 1995 ‚Äì Present * 189th Airlift Squadron, 1 September 1996 ‚Äì 18 October 2009 * 190th Fighter- Interceptor (later Tactical Reconnaissance, Fighter) Squadron, 1 July 1955 ‚Äì Present =Stations= * Gowen Field (later Boise Air Terminal), Idaho, 1 July 195 : Designated: Gowen Field Air National Guard Base, Idaho, 1991‚ÄìPresent =Aircraft= * F-94 Starfire, 1955‚Äì1956 * F-89C Scorpion, 1956‚Äì1959 * F-86L Sabre Interceptor, 1959‚Äì1964 * F-102 Delta Dagger, 1964‚Äì1975 * RF-4C Phantom II, 1976‚Äì1991 * F-4G Wild Weasel, 1991‚Äì1996 * C-130E/H/H2/H2.5 Hercules, 1996‚Äì2009 * A-10 Thunderbolt II, 1996‚ÄìPresent References * History of the Idaho Air National Guard * Rogers, B.

Krone,Genzlinger, Neil, Gerald Krone, 86, Founder Of Negro Theater Troupe Dies at 86, The New York Times, New York Edition, Section D, Page 6, March 9, with funding from the Ford Foundation. The company's focus on original works with themes based in the black experience with an international perspective created a canon of theatrical works and an audience for writers who came later, such as August Wilson, Suzan-Lori Parks, and others. Beginnings The Negro Ensemble Company was created in 1964 when Hooks created a tuition-free acting workshop for urban youth which he named the Group Theatre Workshop (GTW), in tribute to Harold Clurman's The Group Theatre. The group became a refuge for young minority actors, with a focus on black theatre. He and his associate Barbara Ann Teer produced in a one-night showcase for friends and family of the actors. The plays chosen were Gwendolyn Brooks's We Real Cool and Douglas Turner Ward's Happy Ending. Jerry Tallmer, reviewer for the New York Post, happened to attend this showcase and gave it a glowing review.Jerry Tallmer, \\"Reading Between Races\\", The Villager, Feb. 4, 2009. This inspired Hooks to produce Happy Ending and Ward's Day of Absence as a double bill presented by Robert Hooks Productions. After raising $35,000 from music executives Clarence Avant and Al Bell, Hooks booked the St. Mark's Playhouse (where many black performers had performed in the long-running show, The Blacks) and hired Gerald Krone as company manager. Ward was invited by the New York Times to write an opinion piece for its Sunday edition on the state of black theatre. His piece, \\"American Theatre: For Whites Only?\\", published in August 1966, was a scathing indictment of America's theatre establishment and posited the need for a unique black theatre institution.\\"Negro Ensemble Company records, 1967-1993\\", Schomburg Center for Research in Black Culture, The New York Public Library. This article caused McNeil Lowery of the Ford Foundation contact Ward to set up a meeting with Ward, Hooks, and Krone.\\"Top Down: The Ford Foundation, Black Power, and the Reinvention of Racial Liberalism\\", Karen Ferguson, 2013 University of Pennsylvania.Neil Genzlinger, \\"Gerald Krone, a Negro Ensemble Company Founder, Dies at 86\\", The New York Times, Feb. 28, 2020. Invited to present a proposal, they came with a bid for an ensemble company much like Bertolt Brecht's Berliner Ensemble. The concept of a true ensemble company (a nucleus of actors performing a roster of plays back-to- back within each season) was uncommon in American theatre. A theatre based on the black experience, created and staffed by black artists, was even more of a departure. In the legacy of the Group Theatre Workshop, this new theatre incorporated a workshop providing tuition-free acting, directing, writing, and theatre administration instruction, which was intended to raise a new generation of theatre professionals. The proposal was accepted and they were awarded a three-year, $1.5 million grant to establish the company.  Controversy  From the beginning, they resisted demands that the new company be located in Harlem and instead, sought out a space downtown where they could build on the existing theatre audience while cultivating an informed black theatre-going audience that hadn't previously existed on a significant scale. They chose the St. Mark's Playhouse primarily because of its flexible configuration. During this era of Black Power, the decision to use the term, \\"Negro\\", rather than the more current, \\"Black\\", was controversial. The name was intended as a tribute to the Harlem Renaissance and the legacy of its artists (Langston Hughes, Zora Neal Hurston, Countee Cullen, Jessie Fauset, Claude McKay, Ethel Waters, etc.), some of whom were still alive and living in New York at the time. The term, \\"New Negro\\", made popular by philosopher and journalist Alain Locke, was used during the Harlem Renaissance to invoke an outspoken advocacy of dignity and a refusal to submit to the practices and laws of Jim Crow. Krone, who was serving as administrative director for the company, was Caucasian, which caused some vocal protest from black nationalists.\\"Negro Ensemble Company, The (1967- )\\", BlackPast.org.\\"About the Negro Ensemble Co.\\", American Masters, August 18, 2004. To present When introducing the Negro Ensemble Company, the three founders wanted to inform New York and the world that they were not \\"an exclusionary... but an inclusive... black theatre; an arts institution dedicated to discovering, nurturing and expanding a theatrical exploration of what it was to be black within in a 'world view' perspective.\\"\\"Not the Other Avant-Garde: The Transnational Foundations of Avant-Garde Performance\\", James M. Harding, John Rouse, University of Michigan Press. Part of this approach was to acknowledge that playwrights of many races, ethnicities, and nationalities had been, and currently, were writing about the experiences of Africans and African Americans, and about colonialism. The first repertory season, 1967-1968, was not without controversy. The company presented Summer of the Seventeenth Doll by Australian playwright Ray Lawler; Kongi's Harvest by Nigerian playwright Wole Soyinka, Daddy Goodness by Richard Wright, and as their first play, Song of the Lusitanian Bogey by Swedish-German playwright Peter Weiss. The Weiss play addresses the oppression of black people from an international perspective, set in colonized Angola. Some black activists protested, accusing NEC of taking \\"white money\\" and for producing the work of a white playwright. On one occasion, activists attempted to storm the theatre during a performance of the Weiss play. Soon afterward, the NEC production of Song of the Lusitanian Bogey in London created further controversy, where the company was heckled by right-wing protesters who resented the play's anti-imperialist message. Many of the plays produced by the Negro Ensemble Company dealt with complex, sometimes disturbing, and often ignored aspects of the black experience and the American experience. The company's nurturing of black playwrights (such as Lonne Elder III with Ceremonies in Dark Old Men and Charles Fuller with Zooman and The Sign) over four decades contributed to the body of plays and performance literature that form the backbone of the African-American theatrical canon.John J. O'Connor, \\"NY Times: Profile of Negro Ensemble Company\\", The New York Times, Sept. 14, 1987. While the company often received glowing reviews, had sold-out audiences, and was producing some of the critically acclaimed theatre of the era, the early 1970s found the Negro Ensemble Company in financial trouble. The 145-seat theatre had become too small to generate the revenue needed for its ambitious projects. During the 1972-73 season, the resident company was disbanded, staff was cut, workshops were cancelled, and salaries were deferred. The decision was made to produce only one new play per year. The play chosen that year was The River Niger by Joseph A. Walker. A poetic play set in Harlem during the turbulent racial redefining of the 1970s, the work depicts the struggles of a proud black family divided between the past and the future. This was the first NEC production to transfer to Broadway, where it ran for nine months, won a Tony Award for Best Play, and embarked on a national tour. This helped to ensure the continued existence of the NEC. In July 1980, the NEC relocated to a new 299-seat home at Theatre Four at 424 West 55th Street, where it would remain until 1991. In 1981, the NEC presented what would be its most successful production. A Soldier's Play by Charles Fuller is the story of the murder of a black soldier on a Southern army base during World War II, and the subsequent investigation by a black army captain. It examines black pride and black self- hatred, and won both the Pulitzer Prize and the New York Drama Critics Circle Best Play awards. The original cast included Adolph Caesar, Denzel Washington, Samuel L. Jackson, Brent Jennings, Charles Brown, Larry Riley, Peter Friedman, Cotter Smith, James Pickens Jr., Eugene Lee, and Stephen Zettler. In 1984, it was made into a movie, featuring several original cast members and NEC alumni (notably Adolph Caesar, Denzel Washington, and David Alan Grier). The film of A Soldier's Story was nominated for three Academy Awards. In 2005, the Negro Ensemble Company, Inc., a restructured incarnation of the original Negro Ensemble Company, was formed, with NEC alumna Charles Weldon as Artistic Director. It was among 406 New York City arts and social service institutions to receive part of a $20 million grant from the Carnegie Corporation, which was made possible through a donation by New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg.Sam Roberts, \\"City Groups Get Bloomberg Gift of $20 Million\\", The New York Times, July 6, 2005.

There is no scientific evidence that vitamin C megadosage helps to cure or prevent cancer, the common cold, or a variety of other medical conditions. Historical advocates of vitamin C megadosage include Linus Pauling, who won the Nobel Prize in Chemistry in 1954. Pauling argued that because humans lack a functional form of L-gulonolactone oxidase, an enzyme required to make vitamin C that is functional in most other mammals, plants, insects, and other life forms, humans have developed a number of adaptations to cope with the relative deficiency. These adaptations, he argued, ultimately shortened lifespan but could be reversed or mitigated by supplementing humans with the hypothetical amount of vitamin C that would have been produced in the body if the enzyme were working. Vitamin C megadoses are claimed by alternative medicine advocates including Matthias Rath and Patrick Holford to have preventive and curative effects on diseases such as cancer and AIDS,Bad Science, Ben GoldacreTrick Or Treatment, Simon Singh & Edzard Ernst but the available scientific evidence does not support these claims. Some trials show some effect in combination with other therapies, but this does not imply vitamin C megadoses in themselves have any therapeutic effect.David Gorski, Science Based Medicine, 18 Aug 2008 Background Vitamin C is an essential nutrient used in the production of collagen and other biomolecules, and for the prevention of scurvy. It is also an antioxidant, which has led to its endorsement by some researchers as a complementary therapy for improving quality of life. Certain animal species, including the haplorhine primates (which include humans), members of the Caviidae family of rodents (including guinea pigs and capybaras), most species of bats, many passerine birds, and about 96% of fish (the teleosts), cannot synthesize vitamin C internally and must therefore rely on external sources, typically obtained from food. For humans, the World Health Organization recommends a daily intake of 45 mg/day of vitamin C for healthy adults, and 25‚Äì30 mg/day in infants. The vitamin C article provides examples of recommendations from individual countries. None exceed 110 mg/day. Since its discovery, vitamin C has been considered almost a panacea by some, although this led to suspicions of it being overhyped by others. Vitamin C has long been promoted in alternative medicine as a treatment for the common cold, cancer, polio, and various other illnesses. The evidence for these claims is mixed. Since the 1930s, when it first became available in pure form, some physicians have experimented with higher-than- recommended vitamin C consumption or injection. Orthomolecular-based megadose recommendations for vitamin C are based mainly on theoretical speculation and observational studies, such as those published by Fred R. Klenner from the 1940s through the 1970s. There is a strong advocacy movement for very high doses of vitamin C, yet there is an absence of large-scale, formal trials in the 10 to 200+ grams per day range. The single repeatable side effect of oral megadose vitamin C is a mild laxative effect if the practitioner attempts to consume too much too quickly. In the United States and Canada, a tolerable upper intake level (UL) was set at 2,000 mg/day, citing this mild laxative effect as the reason for establishing the UL. However, the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) reviewed the safety question in 2006 and reached the conclusion that there was not sufficient evidence to set a UL for vitamin C. The Japan National Institute of Health and Nutrition reviewed the same question in 2010 and also reached the conclusion that there was not sufficient evidence to set a UL.Dietary Reference Intakes for Japanese 2010: Water- Soluble Vitamins Journal of Nutritional Science and Vitaminology 2013(59):S67-S82. About 70‚Äì90% of vitamin C is absorbed by the body when taken orally at normal levels (30‚Äì180 mg daily). Only about 50% is absorbed from daily doses of 1 gram (1,000 mg). Oral administration, even of megadoses, cannot raise blood concentration above 0.22 mM. Relative deficiency hypothesis Linus Pauling's popular and influential 1986 book How to Live Longer and Feel Better advocated very high doses of vitamin C Humans and other species that cannot synthesize their own vitamin C carry a mutated and ineffective form of the enzyme L-gulonolactone oxidase, the fourth and last step in the ascorbate-producing machinery. In the anthropoids lineage, this mutation likely occurred 40 to 25 million years ago. The three surviving enzymes continue to produce the precursors to vitamin C, but the absence of the fourth enzyme means the process is never completed, and the body ultimately disassembles the precursors. In the 1960s, the Nobel-Prize-winning chemist Linus Pauling, after contact with Irwin Stone, began actively promoting vitamin C as a means to greatly improve human health and resistance to disease. His book How to Live Longer and Feel Better was a bestseller and advocated taking more than 10 grams per day orally, thus approaching the amounts released by the liver directly into the circulation in other mammals: an adult goat, a typical example of a vitamin C-producing animal, will manufacture more than 13,000 mg of vitamin C per day in normal health and much more when stressed. Matthias Rath is a controversial German physician who worked with and published two articles discussing the possible relationship between lipoprotein and vitamin C with Pauling. He is an active proponent and publicist for high-dose vitamin C. Pauling's and Rath's extended theory states that deaths from scurvy in humans during the Pleistocene, when vitamin C was scarce, selected for individuals who could repair arteries with a layer of cholesterol provided by lipoprotein(a), a lipoprotein found in vitamin C-deficient species. Stone and Pauling believed that the optimum daily requirement of vitamin C is around 2,300 milligrams for a human requiring 2,500 kcal per day. For comparison, the FDA's recommended daily allowance of vitamin C is only 90 milligrams. Adverse effects Although sometimes considered free of toxicity, there are in fact known side effects from vitamin C intake, and it has been suggested that intravenous injections should require \\"a medical environment and trained professionals.\\" For example, a genetic condition that results in inadequate levels of the enzyme glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD) can cause sufferers to develop hemolytic anemia after using intravenous vitamin C treatment. The G6PD deficiency test is a common laboratory test. Because oxalic acid is produced during metabolism of vitamin C, hyperoxaluria can be caused by intravenous administration of ascorbic acid. Vitamin C administration may also acidify the urine and could promote the precipitation of kidney stones or drugs in the urine. Although vitamin C can be well tolerated at doses well above what government organizations recommend, adverse effects can occur at doses above 3 grams per day. The common \\"threshold\\" side effect of megadoses is diarrhea. Other possible adverse effects include increased oxalate excretion and kidney stones, increased uric acid excretion, systemic conditioning (\\"rebound scurvy\\"), preoxidant effects, iron overload, reduced absorption of vitamin B12 and copper, increased oxygen demand, and acid erosion of the teeth when chewing vitamin C tablets. In addition, one case has been noted of a woman who received a kidney transplant followed by high-dose vitamin C and died soon afterwards as a result of calcium oxalate deposits that destroyed her new kidney. Her doctors concluded that high-dose vitamin C therapy should be avoided in patients with kidney failure. =Overdose= As discussed previously, vitamin C generally exhibits low toxicity. The (the dose that will kill 50% of a population) is generally accepted to be 11,900 milligrams (11.9 grams) per kilogram in rat populations. The American Association of Poison Control Centers has reported zero deaths from vitamin C toxicity. Interactions Pharmaceuticals designed to reduce stomach acid, such as the proton-pump inhibitors (PPIs), are among the most widely sold drugs in the world. One PPI, omeprazole (Prilosec), has been found to lower the bioavailability of vitamin C by 12% after 28 days of treatment, independent of dietary intake. The probable mechanism of vitamin C reduction, intragastric pH elevated into alkalinity, would apply to all other PPI drugs, though not necessarily to doses of PPIs low enough to keep the stomach slightly acidic. In another study, 40 mg/day of omeprazole lowered the fasting gastric vitamin C levels from 3.8 to 0.7 ¬µg/mL. Aspirin may also inhibit the absorption of vitamin C. Regulation There are regulations in most countries that limit the claims regarding treatment of disease that can be placed on food and dietary supplement product labels. For example, claims of therapeutic effect with respect to the treatment of any medical condition or disease are prohibited by the United States Food and Drug Administration even if the substance in question has gone through well conducted clinical trials with positive outcomes. Claims are limited to Structure:Function phrasing (\\"Helps maintain a healthy immune system\\") and the following notice is mandatory on food and dietary supplement product labels that make these types of health claims: These statements have not been evaluated by the Food and Drug Administration. This product is not intended to diagnose, treat, cure, or prevent any disease. Research =Cancer= The use of vitamin C in high doses as a treatment for cancer was promoted by Linus Pauling, based on a 1976 study published with Ewan Cameron which reported intravenous vitamin C significantly increased lifespans of patients with advanced cancer. This trial was criticized by the National Cancer Institute for being designed poorly, and three subsequent trials conducted at the Mayo Clinic could not replicate the results. However, the trials at the Mayo Clinic were conducted with oral doses of ascorbate, not intravenous ascorbate as was done in the original trial, and it has been suggested that this difference is a possible reason for the failure of the Mayo Clinic trials to replicate the original trial results.The Riordan IVC Protocol for Adjunctive Cancer Care Intravenous Ascorbate as a Chemotherapeutic and Biological Response Modifying Agent Preliminary clinical trials in humans have shown that it is unlikely to be a \\"miracle pill\\" for cancer and more research is necessary before any definitive conclusions about efficacy can be reached. A 2010 review of 33 years of research on vitamin C to treat cancer stated \\"we have to conclude that we still do not know whether Vitamin C has any clinically significant antitumor activity. Nor do we know which histological types of cancers, if any, are susceptible to this agent. Finally, we don't know what the recommended dose of Vitamin C is, if there is indeed such a dose, that can produce an anti-tumor response.\\" The American Cancer Society has stated, \\"Although high doses of vitamin C have been suggested as a cancer treatment, the available evidence from clinical trials has not shown any benefit.\\" =Burns= One clinical trial used high intravenous doses of vitamin C (66 mg/kg/hour for 24 hours, for a total dose of around 110 grams) after severe burn injury, but despite being described as promising, it has not been replicated by independent institutions and thus is not a widely accepted treatment. Based on that study, the American Burn Association (ABA) considers high-dose ascorbic acid an option to be considered for adjuvant therapy in addition to the more accepted standard treatments. =Cardiac effects= Atrial fibrillation (AF) is a common cardiac rhythm disturbance associated with oxidative stress. Four meta-analyses have concluded that there is strong evidence that consuming 1‚Äì2 g/day of vitamin C before and after cardiac operations can decrease the risk of post-operative AF. However, five randomized studies did not find any such benefit in the United States, so that the benefit was restricted to less wealthy countries. =Exercise-induced bronchoconstriction= Exercise-induced bronchoconstriction (EIB) indicates acute narrowing of the airways as a result of vigorous exercise. EIB seems to be caused by the loss of water caused by increased ventilation, which may lead to the release of mediators such as histamine, prostaglandins, and leukotrienes, all of which cause bronchoconstriction. Vitamin C participates in the metabolism of these mediators and might thereby influence EIB. A meta-analysis showed that 0.5 to 2 g/day of vitamin C before exercise decreased EIB by half. =Endothelial function= A meta-analysis showed a significant positive effect of vitamin C on endothelial function. Benefit was found of vitamin C in doses ranging from 0.5 to 4 g/day, whereas lower doses from 0.09 to 0.5 g/day were not effective. =Common cold= A frequently cited meta-analysis calculated that various doses of vitamin C (daily doses under 0.2 grams were excluded) do not prevent the common cold in the general community, although 0.25 to 1 g/day of vitamin C halved the incidence of colds in people under heavy short-term physical stress. Another meta-analysis calculated that, in children, 1‚Äì2 g/day vitamin C shortened the duration of colds by 18%, and in adults 1‚Äì4 g/day vitamin C shortened the duration of colds by 8%. There is evidence of linear dose- dependency in the effect of vitamin C on common cold duration up to 6‚Äì8 g/day. As noted above, there is an absence of large-scale, formal trials in the 10 to 200+ grams per day range, so no information is available for these higher dosages. Additionally, the cited studies of larger daily doses of vitamin C do not take into account the fast excretion rate of vitamin C at gram-level doses, which makes it necessary to give the total daily amount in smaller, more frequent doses to maintain higher plasma levels. As of 2014, at least 16 studies had found that vitamin C supplements did not prevent the common cold and had minimal effect at best in shortening cold lengths.

It is used to treat moderate to severe pain. It is taken by mouth. Recreational use is common in the United States. Common side effects include dizziness, sleepiness, constipation, and vomiting. Serious side effects include addiction, decreased rate of breathing, low blood pressure, serotonin syndrome, severe allergic reactions, and liver failure. Use during pregnancy may harm the baby. Use with alcohol is not recommended. Hydrocodone works by binding to the mu-opioid receptor. How paracetamol works is unclear but may involve blocking the creation of prostaglandins. Hydrocodone/paracetamol was approved for medical use in the United States in 1982. In the United States, it is a schedule II controlled substance. In 2017, it was the thirteenth most commonly prescribed medication in the United States, with more than 40 million prescriptions. It is not available in the United Kingdom, though the combination codeine/paracetamol is. It is sold under the brand names Vicodin and Norco among others. Uses =Medical= Hydrocodone/paracetamol is a fixed-dose combination consisting of the opioid hydrocodone and the non-opioid analgesic paracetamol. It is indicated for relief of moderate to severe pain of acute, chronic, or postoperative types. Hydrocodone/paracetamol comes in oral solution and tablet formulations; however strength of each component may vary. In October 2014, the Drug Enforcement Administration rescheduled hydrocodone combination drugs from schedule III to schedule II due to its risk for misuse, abuse, and diversions. =Recreational= Hydrocodone diversion and recreational use has escalated in recent years due to its opioid effects. In 2009 and 2010, hydrocodone was the second most frequently encountered opioid pharmaceutical in drug evidence submitted to U.S. federal, state, and local forensic laboratories as reported by DEA's National Forensic Laboratory Information System (NFLIS) and System to Retrieve Information from Drug Evidence (STRIDE). =Pregnancy and breastfeeding= Pregnancy category C: Risk in pregnancy cannot be ruled out. Animal controlled studies have not been conducted with this medication. Low concentrations of paracetamol is excreted through breast milk, however, hydrocodone's excretion is unknown. =Kidney and liver impairment= Use with caution due to possible risk of toxicity. Side effects =Most common= *Lightheadedness *Dizziness *Euphoria *Sedation *Nausea and vomiting *Headaches =Less common= *Central nervous system: drowsiness, confusion, lethargy, anxiety, fear, unease, dependence, mood changes, impairment of mental and physical performance *Gastrointestinal system: constipation *Genitourinary system: inability to urinate, bladder spasms *Respiratory depression: decreased rate and effort of breathing *Hearing impairment, permanent hearing loss *Dermatological: rash, itching =Black box warning= \\"Paracetamol has been associated with cases of acute liver failure, at times resulting in liver transplant or death. Most of the cases of liver injury are associated with the use of paracetamol at doses that exceed 4000 milligrams per day, and often involve more than one paracetamol-containing product.\\" =Allergy warning= \\"Do not take hydrocodone bitartrate and paracetamol tablets if you are allergic to any of its ingredients. If you develop signs of allergy such as a rash or difficulty breathing stop taking hydrocodone bitartrate and paracetamol tablets and contact your healthcare provider immediately.\\" Overdose Hydrocodone: Respiratory depression, extreme somnolence progressing towards coma, muscle limpness, cold and clammy skin, slow heart rate, low blood pressure, abrupt loss of heart function, and death may occur. Paracetamol: Liver and kidney failure, low blood sugar coma may occur.  Interactions  Hydrocodone may demonstrate an enhanced respiratory depressant effect when combined with other sedatives such as other opioids, benzodiazepines, nonbenzodiazepine sedatives, psychotropics, and anticonvulsants. Concurrent use of paracetamol with alcohol products may increase the risk of acute liver failure. Monitoring Laboratory function tests should be used to monitor therapy in people with severe liver or renal disease. Pharmacology =Hydrocodone= *Mechanism of action: Hydrocodone acts primarily as an agonist at the mu-opioid receptors, but is also a weak agonist against the delta opioid and kappa opioid receptors. *Absorption/distribution: The oral formulation can be absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract and remain 20‚Äì50% bound to plasma proteins. The onset of analgesia is about 20 to 30 minutes with duration of 4 to 8 hours and t1/2 of 3 to 4 hours. *Metabolism/excretion: It is metabolized to norhydrocodone by cytochrome P450 3A4 and to hydromorphone, also biologically active, by cytochrome P450 2D6. For individuals who have a defect in the gene encoding CYP2D6, the clearance of the drug will be lower and less metabolite such as hydromorphone will be formed; however, the effect on analgesia remains unknown. =Paracetamol= *Mechanism of action: Paracetamol acts to inhibit COX enzyme, which is responsible for prostaglandin synthesis. Prostaglandins increase the perception of pain. Inhibition of prostaglandin production helps to alleviate pain. *Absorption/distribution: The half-life of oral paracetamol is 1.25 to 3 hours and peak level is reached by 10‚Äì60 minutes after ingestion. *Metabolism/excretion: Paracetamol is metabolized primarily in the liver via glucuronidation and sulfation to mostly non-toxic metabolites and some highly reactive metabolites, which is inactivated by glutathione. 85% of the oral dose is excreted renally. At high doses, the supply of glutathione cannot meet its demand, thus results in the accumulation of highly reactive compounds leading to liver damage. Society and culture In May 2017, professional golfer Tiger Woods was arrested by the police for driving under the influence. Woods said that this was due to four prescription drugs that he was taking for a back operation, one of which was Vicodin. =Regulation= On June 30, 2009, a U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) advisory panel voted by a narrow margin to advise the FDA to remove Vicodin and another opioid, Percocet, from the market because of \\"a high likelihood of overdose from prescription narcotics and paracetamol products\\". The panel also cited concerns of liver damage from their paracetamol component, which is also the main ingredient in commonly used nonprescription drugs such as Tylenol. Each year, paracetamol overdose is linked to about 400 deaths and 42,000 hospitalizations. In January 2011, the FDA asked manufacturers of prescription combination products that contain paracetamol to limit the amount of paracetamol to no more than 325 mg in each tablet or capsule within three years. The FDA also required manufacturers on all paracetamol containing products to issue a black box warning indicating the potential risk for severe liver injury and a warning highlighting potential for allergic reactions. On August 22, 2014, the Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) announced that all hydrocodone combination products (HCPs) will be rescheduled from Schedule III to Schedule II of the Controlled Substances Act (CSA), effective on October 6, 2014. In 2010, more than 16,000 deaths were attributed to abuse of opioid drugs. Even though there are legitimate medical uses for HCPs, data suggest that a significant number of individuals misuse them. =Popular culture= Vicodin is mentioned in songs such as Eminem's \\"Kill You\\", Blackbear's \\"Sniffing Vicodin in Paris\\", Kendrick Lamar's \\"A.D.H.D\\", Future's \\"Lay Up\\", Lupe Fiasco's \\"Mural\\", Queens of the Stone Age's \\"Feel Good Hit of the Summer\\", A Winged Victory for the Sullen's \\"Steep Hills of Vicodin Tears\\" and The Wombats' \\"Give Me a Try\\". Vicodin use is a central theme in the 2004‚Äì2012 medical TV drama House, in which the lead character Dr. Gregory House is addicted to it. =Brand names= Brand names include Adol, Hycet, Lortab, Lorcet, Norco, and Vicodin among others.

Their music is a blend of hardcore punk, country and heavy metal, thus falling into a subgenre known as countrycore. Biography Matanza was formed in 1996 by Jimmy London and Donida, with the idea of exploring the simple and straightforward melodies of the early career of the American singer Johnny Cash, adapted to the drum tempo of Scottish punk band The Exploited. With drummer Nervoso and bassist Diba, they recorded a demo in 1998 called Terror em Dashville. In 1999, a new recording would attract the attention of producer Rafael Ramos of Deckdisc, and lead Matanza to sign with the now-defunct Abril Music for the release of their first CD. With China on bass guitar, Santa Madre Cassino was recorded in December 2000, and released in March the following year, shortly before the band was dropped by their record label for the lack of a radio hit. Matanza then brought Ramos to the studio to record their second album, M√∫sica para Beber e Brigar (Music to Drink and Brawl), with Fausto on the drums this time. An album highlight is \\"Bom √© Quando Faz Mal\\" (\\"It Is Good When It's Not Good\\") whose music videos were directed by Eduardo Kurt, who was also responsible for \\"Ela Roubou Meu Caminh√£o\\" (\\"She Stole My Truck\\") from the first album, and all the videos from their tribute to Johnny Cash. The project To Hell with Johnny Cash started out as a set of four songs the band would play at their shows, but in a short time, grew to a full 12-track album, containing only covers of Johnny Cash songs. Recorded in mid-2006 and released in October of that year, A Arte do Insulto (The Art of Insult) revealed a vastly more professional band. The seriousness of the music was expressed in the tone of the lyrics, the weight of the composition and intensity of their live shows, which would later become a DVD. Promotion of the album also included the video for \\"Clube dos Canalhas\\" (\\"Scoundrels' Club\\") directed by Rudi Lagemann and shot by Tuca Andrade, as well as the magazine Matanza Comix with comics by Alan Sieber, Arnold White, Daniel Ete, among others, Donida himself being the editor of the publication. The record MTV Apresenta Matanza recorded at Hangar 110 in December 2008 and directed by Romi Atarashi, featured Jonas on drums and marks the transition to a new phase. Guitarist Donida left the stage to devote himself exclusively to composing the band's music. He was replaced onstage by Mauricio Nogueira (Ex-Torture Squad). Five years after A Arte do Insulto Matanza released Odiosa Natureza Humana (Hateful Human Nature) in March on Deckdisc. Work on the fifth studio album (and fourth of new material) began in 2010 and was recorded in three days, live to tape (no digital recording), produced by Rafael Ramos. In 2015, the band announced the departure of bassist China, who was replaced by Dony Escobar. According to the band, China left Matanza because he wanted to play the guitar only. Before leaving, he took part of the recordings of the band's seven full-length album, Pior Cen√°rio Poss√≠vel, released in April of the same year and the first album with Maur√≠cio taking part of the songwriting process. In May 2018, Matanza announced they would end the band in October of the same year due to \\"matter questions that need to be dealt with, professional possibilities that need to be contemplated and artistic needs that [...] take to distinct paths\\". On 11 January 2019, the former members of the band announced a new version of the band without vocalist Jimmy London, who was replaced by Vital Cavalcante.  Style and Influences  Frequent topics in the band's sarcastic and cynical lyrics are hatred, violence, alcohol, and women. They have a \\"Wild West\\" atmosphere. The media dubbed the style created by the band as \\"country-core\\". The band members are fans of Johnny Cash, and in 2005, they recorded an album of covers of songs from the early stage of his career, dubbed To Hell With Johnny Cash. In their 2006 album, A Arte do Insulto, Matanza explores various aspects of traditional Irish music. Other major influences include: Mot√∂rhead, Slayer, Dropkick Murphys and The Exploited, basically, extreme metal and punk rock bands. The main songwriter was Donida.

The church is located in Lod, Israel. The current church, built in 1870, shares space with the El-Khidr Mosque (ÿßŸÑÿÆÿ∂ÿ± Al-Khidr, often associated with Saint George). History Toward the end of the nineteenth century, the Greek Orthodox Patriarchate of Jerusalem received permission from the Ottoman authorities to build a church on the site of a previous basilica. The church is built over a ruined 12th-century Crusader structure, and occupies the north end of the nave and left-hand aisle of the earlier church, from which two apses survive - which, contrary to the normal rule, face north rather than east. The Ottoman authorities stipulated, that part of the plot be made available for a mosque. Mosque far older than rebuilt 19th century Greek church, is Mamluk from 14th century. Consequently, the current Church of St. George incorporates only the northeast corner of the Byzantine basilica. The remains of the Byzantine basilica including its are incorporated into the mosque; the Crusader church took a different, if adjacent, location. Some of it, too, is part of the mosque complex. The prayer hall of the adjacent mosque contains a column that once stood in the nave of the basilica. (pp. 9-15) The church crypt contains the sarcophagus of St George.

If activated to federal service with the United States Air Force, the 125 FW is gained by the Air Combat Command. Overview As an Air National Guard unit, the 125th Fighter Wing has a dual mission - one state and one federal. The state mission under Title 32 of the United States Code (Title 32 USC) is to provide trained and equipped personnel to protect life and property and to preserve peace, order, and public safety under the Governor of the State of Florida as part of the Florida Air National Guard. The federal mission under Title 10 USC is to provide fully trained and qualified personnel to the Commander, United States Northern Command (USNORTHCOM) / North American Aerospace Defense Command (NORAD) in time of war or national emergency for the defense of the North American continent, with operational responsibility for the 125 FW as a U.S. Air Force unit falling to the Air Combat Command (ACC). The 125 FW is also available to other combatant commanders for forward deployment in order to perform air superiority/air dominance missions in other theaters outside of the United States. In addition to its primary installation, the Jacksonville Air National Guard Base at Jacksonville International Airport, the 125 FW also maintains an alert detachment of F-15 Eagle fighter aircraft at Detachment 1, 125 FW, Operating Location AA (OL-AA) at Homestead Air Reserve Base in South Florida. The overall wing organization comprises over 1100 citizen airmen in a combination of full-time Active Guard and Reserve (AGR) and Air Reserve Technicians (ART) and traditional part-time drilling air guardsman (TG) categories.

The 159th FIS becoming the group's flying squadron. Other squadrons assigned into the group were the 125th Headquarters, 125th Material Squadron (Maintenance), 125th Combat Support Squadron, and the 125th USAF Dispensary. With the establishment of the 125th FIG, the unit converted to the F-86D (Dog) Sabre with the primary mission of continental air defense of the southeastern United States. In 1958, the 125th became the first Air National Guard unit to earn the right to compete in the Air Defense Command's annual WILLIAM TELL Weapons Meet, and was the first team ever to fire a perfect score in that competition. North American F-86L Sabres of the 159th FIS at Imeson Airport, 1957 In July 1960, the 125th converted from the F-86D to the all-weather, supersonic F-102A and F-102B Delta Dagger. In 1971, following completion of the new Jacksonville International Airport, the 125 FIG relocated from the Jacksonville Imeson Airport to a newly constructed military installation, the current Jacksonville Air National Guard Base, at the new airport. With the concurrent closure of Imeson Airport to all flight operations and its conversion to an industrial park, the 125 FIG vacated its former facilities and turned over same to the City of Jacksonville. In 1965, given increased Soviet Air Force aircraft operations in Cuba, the 125 FIG established Operating Location Alfa Alfa (OL- AA) and 125 FIG, Detachment 1, at Homestead Air Reserve Base, Florida to provide air defense ready alert fighter aircraft in the southern portion of Florida. This same alert detachment continues operations today at the present day Homestead Air Reserve Base with 125th aircraft, pilots and support personnel periodically rotated from home station in Jacksonville. In January 1968, Air Defense Command was renamed Aerospace Defense Command (ADC) and continued to be the 125 FIG's gaining command. In July 1974, the 125 FIG converted to the F-106A and F-106B Delta Dart. Only one year after the F-106 conversion, the unit again earned the right to compete that year's annual Air Force air-to-air weapons competition, WILLIAM TELL '76, at Tyndall AFB, Florida. In March 1980, ADC was inactivated and the air defense mission transferred to Tactical Air Command (TAC). TAC then became the gaining command for the 125 FIG. Convair F-106B, AF Ser. No. 57-2509 and F-106A, AF Ser. No. 58-0788. 2509 was sent to AMARC on 24 May 1990 as FN0196. Modified to a QF-106 target drone (AD268) on 23 June 1994. Written off 7 Oct 1997 after ground fire. Purchased by private individual Apr 2000 and moved to El Paso, TX for restoration. 788 was sent to AMARC on 22 Jan 1987 and also modified as a QF-106 target drone (AD150). Shot down by a Patriot missile on 24 Sept 1992. In April 1987, the 125th converted to the F-16A and F-16B Fighting Falcon, a multi-role fighter that was subsequently modified as the F-16ADF, specifically designed for the Air Defense role. The 125th was the first ANG unit to assume NORAD Air Defense Alert with the F-16ADF, the first operational F-16ADF unit to employ the AIM-7 Sparrow III missile and the first F-16ADF unit to sit alert with the AIM-7 missile. With the disestablishment of Tactical Air Command (TAC) in 1992, the 125 FIG's gaining command changed to the newly created Air Combat Command (ACC). As part of this change, the unit's designation was changed to 125th Fighter Group (125 FG). With creation of the USAF \\"objective wing\\" construct in the early 1990s, the bulk of all Air National Guard groups with operational flying missions were redesignated as wings. As a result, the 125 FG was subsequently redesignated as the 125th Fighter Wing (125 FW), the designation it continues to hold today. In June 1995, the 125 FW converted to the F-15A and F-15B Eagle, a fighter which added air superiority capability to the Air Defense Mission. During the late 1990s, the 125 FW was also fully integrated into the USAF Air and Space Expeditionary Force (AEF) construct and routinely deployed aircraft and personnel to the 363rd Air Expeditionary Wing at Prince Sultan Air Base, Al Kharj, Kingdom of Saudi Arabia in support of Operation SOUTHERN WATCH, enforcing the No Fly Zone over southern Iraq. Since 11 Sep 2001, the wing has also been extensively involved in Operation NOBLE EAGLE, performing its historic continental air defense mission, as well as continuing to deploy aircraft and personnel to U.S. Central Command Air Forces (USCENTAF), later renamed U.S. Air Forces Central (USAFCENT), in Southwest Asia in support of Operations ENDURING FREEDOM and IRAQI FREEDOM. On a daily basis, the 125 FW is responsible for the maintenance of a USNORTHCOM / NORAD Air Defense Alert mission at both its home station in Jacksonville, Florida and at an additional operating location at Homestead Air Reserve Base, Florida. In this capacity, the wing provides armed F-15 aircraft capable of intercepting, identifying, and, if necessary, destroying unknown aircraft which penetrate sovereign U.S. airspace. In the past, this threat has included Soviet Tu-95 Bear bombers, various Soviet-built Cuban Air Force fighters, and civilian narcotics traffickers of various nationalities. When it initially converted to the Air Defense Fighter (ADF) variant of the F-16A, the 125 FW was the first operational NORAD Air Defense Alert unit to employ the AIM-7 Sparrow III missile, the first F-16ADF unit to sit alert with the AIM-7, and the first unit to deploy to the former Howard AFB, Panama in support of JCS-directed operation CORONET NIGHTHAWK using enhanced identification tactics. In October 1995, the 125 FW became the first unit ever to complete a transition from one fourth generation fighter to another fourth generation fighter as it transitioned from the F-16ADF to the F-15A/B. In April 1997, the 125 FW became the first Air Defense Unit to employ as Blue Air in an Offensive Counter Air (OCA) role, integrated with an active duty unit during a Red Flag exercise at Nellis AFB, Nevada. The 125 FW was rated \\"Outstanding\\" during an Alert Force Evaluation by the North American Aerospace Defense Command Inspector General in November 1997. This was the highest rating ever given by NORAD. In January 1998, the 125th Fighter Wing received an \\"Outstanding\\" on its Operational Readiness Inspection (ORI). During this period, the wing also participated in Operation Southern Watch, routinely deploying to Prince Sultan Air Base, Saudi Arabia for operational relief of Regular Air Force F-15C/D units. In 2000, the wing began transitioning to the F-15A/B Multistage Improvement Program (MSIP) variant of the F-15A and F-15B Eagle, and in 2006 transitioned again to the newer F-15C and F-15D models of the Eagle that it currently flies. The 125 FW previously operated a single C-130E, followed by a single WC-130H Hercules aircraft (the latter with weather reconnaissance equipment removed) for logistical support of the wing, geographically separated units (GSUs) of the Florida Air National Guard and additional \\"as needed\\" airlift support to the Florida Army National Guard. This capability is currently gapped until another support aircraft can be assigned. The 125 FW also operates a C-26B aircraft in support of state and federal law enforcement agencies under Title 32 USC authority. In November 2014, in order to comply with Air Force Instruction 38-101, several geographically separated units (GSUs) of the Florida Air National Guard were administratively realigned under the 125th Fighter Wing. These included the 114th Space Control Squadron at Patrick AFB, the 290th Joint Communications Support Squadron at MacDill AFB and the 202nd RED HORSE Squadron, 159th Weather Flight and 131st Training Flight at Camp Blanding.

It takes its name from its first postmaster, Alexander Totten. The Tottenham Conservation Area is a recreational facility in the village, which is also famous for its annual event, the Tottenham Bluegrass Festival. There is also a restored steam train that is a tourist attraction, taking passengers to Beeton and back. Tottenham is home to three schools: Tottenham Public School, Father F.X. O'Reilly School, and Saint Thomas Aquinas Catholic Secondary School. The town was ravaged by a fire in 1895, which began at the McKinney foundry. Eighty structures were destroyed, including the foundry and a Methodist church. Despite warnings in 1884 that the town needed a fire engine, none was purchased. To combat the 1895 fire, the town of Allandale sent its fire engine, preventing further spread of the fire.

The practice, which dates back to the mid-1990s, can potentially make substantial processing power available to researchers at minimal cost. Typically, a program running on a volunteer's computer periodically contacts a research application to request jobs and report results. A middleware system usually serves as an intermediary. History The first volunteer computing project was the Great Internet Mersenne Prime Search, which was started in January 1996. It was followed in 1997 by distributed.net. In 1997 and 1998, several academic research projects developed Java-based systems for volunteer computing; examples include Bayanihan, (print) (online) Popcorn, Superweb, and Charlotte. The term volunteer computing was coined by Luis F. G. Sarmenta, the developer of Bayanihan. It is also appealing for global efforts on social responsibility, or Corporate Social Responsibility as reported in a Harvard Business Review or used in the Responsible IT forum. In 1999, the SETI@home and Folding@home projects were launched. These projects received considerable media coverage, and each one attracted several hundred thousand volunteers. Between 1998 and 2002, several companies were formed with business models involving volunteer computing. Examples include Popular Power, Porivo, Entropia, and United Devices. In 2002, the Berkeley Open Infrastructure for Network Computing (BOINC) project was founded at University of California, Berkeley Space Sciences Laboratory, funded by the National Science Foundation. BOINC provides a complete middleware system for volunteer computing, including a client, client GUI, application runtime system, server software, and software implementing a project web site. The first project based on BOINC was Predictor@home, based at the Scripps Research Institute, which began operation in 2004. Soon thereafter, SETI@home and ClimatePrediction.net began using BOINC. A number of new BOINC-based projects were created over the next few years, including Rosetta@home, Einstein@home, and AQUA@home. In 2007, IBM World Community Grid switched from the United Devices platform to BOINC. Middleware The client software of the early volunteer computing projects consisted of a single program that combined the scientific computation and the distributed computing infrastructure. This monolithic architecture was inflexible. For example, it was difficult to deploy new application versions. More recently, volunteer computing has moved to middleware systems that provide a distributed computing infrastructure independent from the scientific computation. Examples include: * The Berkeley Open Infrastructure for Network Computing (BOINC) is the most widely used middleware system. It offers client software for Windows, Mac OS X, Linux, Android, and other Unix variants. * XtremWeb is used primarily as a research tool. It is developed by a group based at the University of Paris-South. * Xgrid is developed by Apple. Its client and server components run only on Mac OS X. * Grid MP is a commercial middleware platform developed by United Devices and was used in volunteer computing projects including grid.org, World Community Grid, Cell Computing, and Hikari Grid. Most of these systems have the same basic structure: a client program runs on the volunteer's computer. It periodically contacts project- operated servers over the Internet, requesting jobs and reporting the results of completed jobs. This \\"pull\\" model is necessary because many volunteer computers are behind firewalls that do not allow incoming connections. The system keeps track of each user's \\"credit\\", a numerical measure of how much work that user's computers have done for the project. Volunteer computing systems must deal with several issues involving volunteered computers: their heterogeneity, their churn (the tendency of individual computers to join and leave the network over time), their sporadic availability, and the need to not interfere with their performance during regular use. In addition, volunteer computing systems must deal with problems related to correctness: * Volunteers are unaccountable and essentially anonymous. * Some volunteer computers (especially those that are overclocked) occasionally malfunction and return incorrect results. * Some volunteers intentionally return incorrect results or claim excessive credit for results. One common approach to these problems is replicated computing, in which each job is performed on at least two computers. The results (and the corresponding credit) are accepted only if they agree sufficiently. Drawbacks for participants * Increased power consumption: A CPU generally uses more electricity when it is active compared to when it is idle. Additionally, the desire to participate may cause the volunteer to leave the PC on overnight or disable power-saving features like suspend. Furthermore, if the computer cannot cool itself adequately, the added load on the volunteer's CPU can cause it to overheat. * Decreased performance of the PC: If the volunteer computing application runs while the computer is in use, it may impact performance of the PC. This is due to increased usage of the CPU, CPU cache, local storage, and network connection. If RAM is a limitation, increased disk cache misses and/or increased paging can result. Volunteer computing applications typically execute at a lower CPU scheduling priority, which helps to alleviate CPU contention. These effects may or may not be noticeable, and even if they are noticeable, the volunteer might choose to continue participating. However, the increased power consumption can be remedied to some extent by setting an option to limit the percentage of the processor used by the client, which is available in some client software. Benefits for researchers * Volunteer computing can provide researchers with computing power that is not achievable any other way. Approximately 10 petaflops of computing power are available from volunteer computing networks. * Volunteer computing is often cheaper than other forms of distributed computing.http://mescal.imag.fr/membres/derrick.kondo/pubs/kondo_hcw09.pdf Importance Although there are issues such as lack of accountability and trust between participants and researchers while implementing the projects, volunteer computing is crucially important, especially to projects that have limited funding. * Since there are more than one billion PCs in the world, volunteer computing can supply more computing power to researches, that do not have the required competencies regarding the computing power, on any kind of topic; such as academic (university-based) or scientific researches. Also, advancements in the technology will provide the advancements in consumer products such as PCs and game consoles happen faster than any other specialized products which will increase the number of PCs and computing power in the world consequently. * Supercomputers that have huge computing power are extremely expensive and are available only to some applications only if they can afford it. Whereas volunteer computing is not something that can be bought, its power arises from the public support. A research project that has limited sources and funding can get huge computing power by attracting public attention. * By volunteering and providing support and computing power to the researches on topics such as science, citizens are encouraged to be interested in science and also citizens are allowed to have a voice in directions of scientific researches and eventually the future science by providing support or not to the researches.

It is based on the film of the same name. Features The Space Jam pinball machine has many noteworthy features that make up its pinball experience. On the main playfield, there are six red arrows pointing to critical targets. From left to right, they are as follows: Left Loop, Captive Ball, Basket, Jump Ball, Ramp, and Right Loop. These targets help players complete some of the seven planets surrounding Michael Jordan as well as score jackpots in Multiball mode. There is also a basket at the end of the launch ramp for skill shot opportunities. Before launching the ball with the plunger, players can choose an award to receive upon a successful skill shot into the launch basket: 300,000 points, Lite Lock / Lock Ball (advances one level up in the Jump Ball), Wabbit Hole (randomly selects a mystery prize or minigame to be played), or Super Pops (increases the bumper threshold's strength). If the player does not make the basket, 50,000 points will still be awarded. However, if the player does make the basket and had selected 300,000 points, Lite Lock / Lock Ball, or Super Pops, he/she will be given a few seconds to earn a super skill shot by shooting the left basket ramp for 10 basketball points. The coin lock door has 3 buttons. Two of them control the volume, while the third opens the Settings Menu. The menu allows players to adjust various settings such as the level of difficulty, frequency of extra ball awards, tilt sensitivity, and lighting. Changing the level of difficulty affects the requirements to unlock certain minigames as well as the time limit to complete certain tasks. Objectives One of the main objectives of Space Jam, like any other pinball game, is to score a lot of points by manipulating the ball's movements on the playfield with the flippers to hit various targets. A second but important objective of the game is to enter Final Jam mode, which helps increase players' scores significantly. In order to lite Final Jam, players must complete the seven planets that surround Michael Jordan in the middle of the playfield: Fast Break, Fire, In Yer Face, Rebounds, Slam, Space Jam, and Super Jackpot. As soon as all 7 planets are lit, the Final Jam light will blink, signaling players to shoot the basket to play Final Jam. After Final Jam is over, players can attempt to go through this cycle as many times as they can until Ball 3 ends. =Fast Break (Fast Break Minigame)= To lite the Fast Break planet, players must shoot the Left and Right Loops to complete each of their series of lights. The Left Loop features Road Runner whose famous phrase \\"Beep! Beep!\\" is inscribed on the 4 yellow lights. The Right Loop has the Tasmanian Devil; rather than words, random symbols particularly used to censor inappropriate language are written on the 4 yellow lights. When the final light is complete, the Fast Break minigame will begin. The Fast Break minigame requires players to shoot the Ramp as many times as possible within a certain amount of time, which is indicated not by seconds but by the jackpot counter. The jackpot starts at 200,000 and works its way up to 700,000. The game ends 5 seconds after the jackpot stops at 700,000. =Fire (On Fire Minigame)= To lite the Fire planet, players must shoot the Ramp four times to spell F-I-R-E. As soon as the E is complete, the Basket arrow will flash, and the sirens will indicate the beginning of the On Fire minigame. The objective of On Fire is to shoot the Basket as many times as possible within 24 seconds. The first shot is worth 50,000 points, the second is worth 150,000, the third is worth 250,000, and so on. In addition to these points, players can earn 10 basketball points for each shot made and advance closer toward the 300,000 and Extra Ball Lit bonuses. The requirements to get another On Fire increase in difficulty each time the minigame is played. The player has a limited time to spell F-I-R-E before each letter disappears. The letters disappear more quickly after the player has played On Fire multiple times. =In Yer Face (In Yer Face Minigame)= There are two ways to lite the In Yer Face planet. The first is shooting the Captive Ball 3 times during regular play to complete the In-Yer-Face lights. The second way is playing the In Yer Face minigame. To enter this game, players can hit the three drop targets near the Pop Bumpers; they have pictures of Sylvester, Tweety Bird, and Lola. Hitting all 3 of them will make a Monstar appear. Initially, players must make 2 Monstars appear to play the minigame. After the minigame is over, players must make 1 additional Monstar appear in order to play the game again. The objective of the In Yer Face minigame is to shoot the Captive Ball 3 times within 30 seconds. The first shot is worth 200,000 points, the second is worth 300,000, and the last is worth 400,000 points. Unlike the On Fire minigame, players cannot earn basketball points for each Captive Ball shot. However, if the player can shoot the Captive Ball 3 times before time is up, an Extra Ball Lit will be awarded. Afterwards, he/she can shoot the back of the Jump Ball to activate the Extra Ball. =Rebounds (Super Pops)= To lite the Rebounds planet, players must hit the Pop Bumpers a certain number of times. Players can increase their chances of getting Rebounds by selecting Super Pops prior to launching the ball. Super Pops enhances the strength of the bumpers, which will usually keep the ball inside the threshold for a longer period of time than under normal conditions. During Super Pops, the orange lights on top of the 3 bumpers will blink. The first Rebounds award is worth 100,000. Each successive award adds 100,000 to the previous amount. Players will know they have achieved the award when they see a large piece of metal fall on Daffy Duck's head on the screen and hear him say, \\"You're despicable!\\" =Slam (Bonus Multiplier)= To lite the Slam planet, players must lite the S-L-A-M lanes located near the flippers. Players can rotate the configuration of the lights with the flipper buttons in order to allow the ball to pass over an unlit lane. When the fourth light is complete, the End-of-Ball Bonus will be doubled. Each successive completion will increase the multiplier by 1 until the multiplier reaches its maximum of 6. An Extra Ball Lit will be awarded to the player who can get the multiplier to 6 within one ball of play. Even if a player can get the multiplier to 6 in another ball, the Extra Ball Lit will not be awarded again; it occurs only once per game. After the maximum multiplier is attained, each successive Slam completion will add 200,000 points to the player's score. The multiplier resets to 1 for the next ball or extra ball. =Space Jam (Super Jam Minigame)= To lite the Space Jam planet, players must hit the tiny basketball targets on the side of the playfield to spell S-P-A-C-E J-A-M. Once the final target is hit, all 6 red arrows will flash, and the player thus enters the Super Jam minigame. In Super Jam, players have to complete the 6 shots in any order within 30 seconds. The first shot is worth 50,000 points, the second is 150,000, the third 250,000, the fourth, 350,000, the fifth 450,000, and the sixth 550,000. In all the timed minigames, the clock pauses whenever the ball hits the Pop Bumper threshold. =Super Jackpot (Multiball Mode)= To lite the Super Jackpot planet, players must enter Multiball mode and complete the series of jackpots. To enter Multiball, players can shoot the Wabbit Hole where Bugs Bunny randomly chooses from a list of 3 events, or they can lock all 3 balls in the Jump Ball. When Multiball begins, there will be a total of 3 balls on the playfield. In order to keep playing Multiball, players must keep at least 2 of the balls on the playfield at all times. As soon as 1 ball remains, Multiball ends. Each Multiball attempt increases the number of times a player must shoot the Jump Ball to lock 3 balls and activate Multiball. The jackpot starts at 500,000 points and increases by 2,000 for any target the balls hit on the playfield. The jackpot also increases by the same amount each time a ball passes over the lane sensors. The first target players must shoot is either the Ramp (for a regular jackpot) or the Basket (for a doubled jackpot). If the player loses 2 of the 3 balls prior to clearing either shot, there will be a timed opportunity to shoot the Jump Ball for a Multiball Restart. During the restart, players will have only 2 balls instead of 3 to make it easier. Failing to shoot the Jump Ball before time expires will end Multiball. Note: harder difficulty levels (as adjusted in the pinball's settings) do not have Multiball Restart. After either the Basket or the Ramp is cleared, the arrows will change their configuration and flash toward the Left Loop, Jump Ball, and Right Loop. Once these shots are cleared, an arrow will flash toward the Captive Ball for the Super Jackpot. The Super Jackpot is double the value of the jackpot last attained (from either the Left Loop, Jump Ball, or Right Loop). If the player successfully shoots the Captive Ball, the Super Jackpot will be awarded, and the corresponding planet will be complete, advancing the player one step closer to Final Jam. Interestingly, if Multiball ends during the Super Jackpot attempt, the blue \\"Super Jackpot\\" arrow pointing toward the Captive Ball will flash for 4 seconds, giving players a chance to get the Super Jackpot despite not being in Multiball. There is yet another jackpot after Super Jackpot. Players must shoot the Ramp to lite Super Duper Jackpot, which is triple the value of the Super Jackpot earned. Upon shooting the Ramp, players will be given a certain amount of time (depending on the pinball's difficulty settings) to shoot the Super Duper Jackpot target, which is a small red square behind the Pop Bumpers in the back of the playfield. If the player fails to achieve the Super Duper Jackpot in the allotted time, he/she can shoot the Ramp again to lite the Super Duper Jackpot target. There is no limit to the number of times a player can lite Super Duper Jackpot as long as 2 or 3 balls are still on the playfield. Moreover, the value of the Super Duper Jackpot increases with each failed attempt. Like Super Jackpot, if Multiball ends while Super Duper Jackpot is lit, players have 4 seconds to shoot the target as indicated by the flashing purple \\"Super Duper Jackpot\\" arrow. During Multiball, once the Super Duper Jackpot is earned, another cycle of Multiball begins from the initial jackpot targets (the Basket and the Ramp) valued at 500,000 points. Unlike the first Multiball cycle, where players could shoot either the Basket or the Ramp to advance to the next set of jackpot targets, subsequent cycles require players to shoot both the Basket and the Ramp to continue. Afterwards, the order of the jackpot target configurations is the same as in the first cycle. A player can theoretically play an unlimited number of Multiball cycles and rack up millions of points until he/she only has 1 ball remaining. At the very beginning of Multiball, players will notice that the shot clock displays a certain amount of time depending on the pinball's difficulty settings. If the player shoots the Basket before time expires, all subsequent jackpots for the first cycle of Multiball will be doubled in value, and the shot clock resets. Shooting the Ramp as the first target, however, will prevent the player from being able to double the jackpot. After successfully doubling the jackpot, the player can now shoot either the Basket or the Ramp before time expires in order to triple the value of all subsequent jackpots. If the player is successful, the shot clock resets once more for a chance to quadruple the value of all subsequent jackpots by shooting either the Basket or the Ramp in the allotted time. It is important to note that when the Left Loop, Jump Ball, and Right Loop are activated after the first successful Basket shot, players must be careful not to shoot these 3 targets while the shot clock is running. Doing so will turn off the shot clock and prevent the player from being able to triple, and subsequently quadruple, the jackpot. Shooting any of the 3 targets after the second successful Basket shot will only prevent the player from being able to quadruple the jackpot. The opportunity to double, triple, and quadruple the jackpot is only found at the beginning of the first cycle of Multiball. It is not available when a player gets a Multiball Restart or begins the next cycle of Multiball following a Super Duper Jackpot. =Final Jam= After the 7 planets have been lit, players will be allowed to shoot the Basket during regular play to enter Final Jam mode. The objective of Final Jam is to shoot the Basket as many times as possible within 60 seconds to earn points. All 5 balls continuously enter the playfield upon drainage, so the game keeps going until the time runs out. The jackpot starts at 100,000 and increases whenever the balls hit other targets or pass over the lane sensors. Players can double the jackpot for a limited time by shooting either the Wabbit Hole or the Jump Ball. If the Basket is cleared before the shot clock expires, the doubled jackpot will be awarded, the jackpot will return to its previous value, and the ball will exit the Wabbit Hole or Jump Ball. If the player does not shoot the Basket but manages to get a second ball in the unoccupied Wabbit Hole or Jump Ball before the shot clock expires, the jackpot will triple, and there will be extra time on the shot clock. If the player cannot shoot the Basket in time for the doubled or tripled jackpot, the jackpot will return to its previous value, and the balls will be released from the Wabbit Hole and Jump Ball. After the 60 seconds are up, the pinball will temporarily deactivate the flippers, bumpers, and slingshots until all 5 balls have drained. Regular play resumes with all 7 planets reset. Other Wabbit Hole Features In addition to the minigames associated with some of the Final Jam planets, the Wabbit Hole has plenty of other surprises. =1 on 1 Minigame= In this minigame, players must try to complete one of four permutations of the 6 main targets within 30 seconds. The first shot is worth 250,000, and each subsequent shot is 100,000 more points. The 4 possible permutations are as follows: 1\\\\. Ramp --> Basket --> Right Loop --> Jump Ball --> Left Loop --> Captive Ball 2\\\\. Jump Ball --> Basket --> Right Loop --> Ramp --> Left Loop --> Captive Ball 3\\\\. Left Loop --> Basket --> Right Loop --> Ramp --> Jump Ball --> Captive Ball 4\\\\. Right Loop --> Jump Ball --> Ramp --> Left Loop --> Basket --> Captive Ball =2 on 2 Minigame= This minigame starts off with 2 balls on the playfield. The game ends when only 1 ball remains. To begin, players must shoot either the Jump Ball or the Ramp for 100,000 points. When one of these is cleared, players must shoot the Basket within 11 seconds, as shown on the shot clock. If the Basket is not cleared within the time limit, players must shoot the Jump Ball or Ramp again for 100,000 to activate the Basket. If the Basket is cleared, 200,000 points will be earned, and a third ball will come out if the original two are still in play. Players must continue this cycle for as long as they can. All Jump Ball or Ramp shots are 100,000, while each Basket shot increases by 50,000 from the base value of 200,000 to the maximum of 500,000 and releases another ball onto the playfield. There can be a maximum of 5 balls in play at the same time for an extreme challenge. =300,000= If Bugs Bunny selects the 300,000 option, he will award 300,000 points to the player's score. This prize is awarded frequently after most of the other features have already been awarded at least once. =Defense Minigame= This minigame has 2 phases. In the first, players must shoot at least one of the 3 drop targets located next to the Monstars lights for a set jackpot. The jackpot starts at 420,000 and decreases to 100,000. If none of the drop targets are hit 5 seconds after the 100,000 appears, the minigame ends. If the drop targets are hit in time, all 6 red arrows will flash, triggering the second phase of the minigame. Players have 20 seconds to shoot any of the 6 targets multiple times. Each shot is worth whatever jackpot was earned when the drop targets were hit. =Extra Ball Lit= This feature lites the Extra Ball in the back of the Jump Ball for an opportunity to earn an Extra Ball. =Free Game= A replay is awarded when Bugs Bunny chooses this feature, and an animation plays on the screen. =Full Court Frenzy Minigame= This minigame is a hybrid of Multiball and Defense. Players will start with 5 balls on the playfield, and they must shoot any of the 6 main targets as indicated by the flashing red arrows to earn points. The game ends when only 1 ball remains. The jackpot starts at 200,000 and increases by 2,500 whenever a ball hits any target on the playfield or passes over the lane sensors. The maximum jackpot is 500,000, and there is no time limit. =Trivia Game= Unlike most of the other minigames, the Trivia Game is played on the screen. Players must answer one question by selecting one of the two answer choices with the left or right flipper button. Wile E. Coyote awards 300,000 points for the correct answer. Getting the incorrect answer does not affect anything. Questions cover many topics about Michael Jordan such as his height, baseball career, and various achievements. =Video Mode= Like the Trivia Game, Video Mode is played on the screen. Players must move the basketball hoop with the flipper buttons to the Looney Tunes character making a throw. From left to right, the order is Daffy Duck, Bugs Bunny, Michael Jordan, Sylvester the Cat, and Lola Bunny.

American Eagle was revived by two other comics publishers: first AC Comics, and then by America's Best Comics, by writer Alan Moore as part of his Tom Strong comics and its spinoff Terra Obscura. Nedor Comics American Eagle was the secret identity of scientist Tom Standish. While performing experiments for the US government, he was accidentally exposed to a mysterious black ray infused with the blood of an eagle. The ray gave him the powers of the bald eagle ‚Äî flight, strength and (of course) patriotism. Standish used his powers to fight the Nazis and other enemies during World War II. He was accompanied by his young companion Bud Pierce who, as \\"Eaglet\\", had powers similar to the American Eagle. His enemies include Dr. Amoto and the Red Mask. In one story, \\"The Machine That Raised the Dead\\", the Nazis use a machine to bring historical figures back to life, including Blackbeard, a Neanderthal and a Viking. =Nedor Comics bibliography= The American Eagle appeared in: * America's Best Comics #2, 6-7, 10-12, 14 (Sept 1942 - June 1945) * Exciting Comics #22-27, 29-38, 40-47, 49-50 (Oct 1942 - Aug 1946) * The Fighting Yank #18 (Nov 1946) AC Comics AC Comics has reused the Golden Age American Eagle in their revival of the Nedor Comics superheroes. He has appeared in issues of The Fighting Yank, set during the 1950s. America's Best Comics/DC The Golden Age version of the American Eagle was also revived by Alan Moore for his Tom Strong comics, published by America's Best Comics (now an imprint of cort comics). Moore used the Nedor Comics characters to populate Terra Obscura, the alternate universe version of Tom Strong's Earth. In Moore's story, the heroes had been placed in suspended animation in 1969, and were revived 30 years later by Tom Strong. The American Eagle made a brief appearance in Tom Strong #12 (June 2001). The American Eagle is featured briefly in the Terra Obscura spinoff series. Issue #4 reveals that the American Eagle and Eaglet had been looking for the missing Captain Future, and had traced him to the lair of Dr. X. In the struggle that followed the American Eagle and Eaglet were both killed; their bodies were discovered three years later by the Scarab and the Liberator.

Lambert OBE (1893-1967) was a British linguist and anthropologist in Kenya. Born in Pield Heath, raised in Bournemouth, and educated at Queens' College, Cambridge (1912-1915), Lambert served as a platoon commander in the Gloucestershire Regiment during World War I, and was wounded at the Battle of the Somme in July 1916. A year later, the young Lieutenant joined the King's African Rifles in Nyassaland in the East African Campaign against the German army in Tanganyika. After his demobilization in 1919, Lambert remained in East Africa and was appointed assistant District Commissioner on the southern coast of Kenya. During this period, he studied Swahili history and culture, becoming fluent in the language. Gaining indigenous respect and recognition, he became known as \\"Sheikh Lambert.\\" His subsequent postings were as District Commissioner in Kiambu, Lamu, Embu, Kenya, Voi, and other places, where he gained an \\"outstanding\\" reputation as an administrator known for his \\"profound\\" knowledge of indigenous law and culture (especially Kikuyu). In 1939, the British Governor of Kenya nominated Lambert be appointed an Officer of the Order of the British Empire (OBE) and promoted him to Senior District Commissioner. Lambert was married to Grace Firr, a trained nurse and daughter of Tom Firr, a famous Huntsman of the Quorn Hunt. After his retirement in 1950, the couple settled in Nairobi. He remained very active as a Swahili language scholar until his death in Nairobi, 1967. Many Africanists, anthropologists and linguists greatly benefited from H.E. Lambert's expert knowledge and generous assistance in the field and in their subsequent research. Among those he mentored were A. H. J. Prins, who did ethnographic research on the Taita and, subsequently, the coastal Swahili,Returning from fieldwork in Kenya, Prins named his 4th son after Lambert, who thus became a \\"classificatory grandfather\\" to the newborn who became an anthropologist as well and Philip Gulliver who researched the Turkana.

It was designed by Joop Geesink and opened its doors in 1984. History and details The ride system was built by Mack Rides, the ride has a track length of 240m. The ride cost ‚Ç¨4.1m (NGL 9 million). The ride concept is original, but clearly influenced by Disney‚Äôs \\"it's a small world\\", and signified a breach with the fairy-tale style of the Efteling. The ride takes 2 adults or 3 children, in 1 of the 118 cars, through a humorous simplification of the world populated by animatronics in just over 6 minutes, accompanied by a catchy music written by Ruud Bos and stand-up comedian Toon Hermans. The ride‚Äôs host is ‚ÄòJokie de Prrretneus‚Äô, a carnival doll and the park‚Äôs mascot from 1984 until 1989 when the new mascot ‚ÄòPardoes‚Äô was introduced. In 2005 the ride was redecorated with the famous Dutch doll \\"Loekie de Leeuw\\", which also was created by Joop Geesink. Joop Geesink‚Äôs objective was to make it a hilarious ride, which is done by taking cultural aspects that have been generalized, and portraying them with funny dolls. In 2019 the ride closed for an extensive refurbishment. The lighting was upgraded to LED, the dolls were repainted and the Japan, China and Africa scenes were changed. Also in addition the gondolas would now stop periodically so that the fanfare portion would play. The Ride The ride passes through 9 different regions, each represented by typical scenes and variations on the music. ;Netherlands :The first land the ride passes through is the Netherlands. Scenes of singing frogs, birds, fishermen, tulips, wooden shoes and farmers represent the Dutch cultural icons. ;Belgium, Monaco and France :After a short scene of Belgium the rides jumps from the Mediterranean to Paris, portrayed by can-can dancers in front of the Moulin Rouge. ;United Kingdom :Next in line is the British capital, London. Scenes here show the Underground, Buckingham Palace and the changing of the guard. The Scottish Highlands are also present. ;Germany and the Alps :This region is represented by Oktoberfest, where everybody is happily drinking beer, including a group of monks. Alpine mountain scenes conclude this part. ;Italy :Here we see Venice, Pisa and a reference to Rome‚Äôs imperial history. ;Japan and China :This scene opens with a tunnel decorated with Japanese Noh stage masks, followed by Geisha women, sumo wrestling and a Chinese Shadow play. China is portrayed by a large scene with a dragon. ;The Arctic :This scene is of an icy world filled with igloos and Inuit and many penguin-sized, snowman-like creatures. After this scene, riders pass through a tunnel where many of these creatures stare down through holes in the ceiling. ;Africa :Large trees appear with a giant monkey, and traditional African people are playing drums. ;Mexico and Hawaii :Little donkeys transport Mexicans with sombreros, maracas, guitars and trumpets. Hawaiian Hula girls bid us a farewell. The Music For Carnival Festival, Efteling commissioned its first original soundtrack, which was composed by Toon Hermans and arranged and produced by Ruud Bos. Each of the ride's scenes features its own variation on the theme music.

Retrieved April 21, 2013. Hammerback is a New York City medical examiner described as an \\"off-the-charts genius\\" who traded in a career as a chef to become a medical examiner, although in episode 509, \\"The Box\\", he states that he has been working in the same position for 29 years and 4,846 cases. He has a habit of overtalking and oversharing, and has offered commentary on such unusual behaviors as threesomes and necrophilia‚Äìmuch to the unease of predecessor Sheldon Hawkes, who, in one episode, refers to Sid's commentary as \\"going to that creepy place\\" (episode 301, \\"People With Money\\"). Despite any eccentricities on his part, Hammerback sincerely cares for the well-being of his coworkers; he invited Mac Taylor to join his family for their Thanksgiving festivities so the taciturn CSI would not have to spend another holiday alone. He has apparently either known or worked with Mac, Hawkes, and ME Peyton Driscoll for an unspecified number of years (episode 205, \\"Dancing with the Fishes\\"). He is also known to be hardworking, as shown in episode 707, \\"Hide Sight\\", where he returns to work immediately despite having been sent to the ER after being exposed to an exploding bullet during an autopsy. Hammerback nearly dies from a severe allergic reaction to a meatball gyros sandwich he ate in episode 317, \\"The Ride-In\\", and is saved by the timely intervention of Stella Bonasera, who administers rescue breathing, CPR, and a shot of epinephrine from the first aid kit.Huntley, Kristine (February 23, 2007). \\"CSI: New York ‚Äì 'The Ride In'\\".

In episode 502, \\"Page Turner\\", he nearly dies once again, this time from prolonged contact with a murder victim who had died of radiation poisoning. However, he undergoes heavy treatment at the hospital and is shown to be fine at the end of the episode, with a few of his friends and co-workers visiting him.

Sid has been divorced at least once (episode 304, \\"Hung Out to Dry\\") and celebrated by getting incredibly drunk and falling down a flight of stairs, though he claims he \\"didn't feel a thing\\". In episode 418, \\"Admissions,\\" he mentions to Mac that he occasionally holds a curiosity for what it would be like to take a swig of hydrofluoric acid. When Mac jokingly responds that he himself wonders about doing a live autopsy on himself, Sid genuinely agrees before realizing, slightly crestfallen, that Mac is messing with him. In episode 419, \\"Personal Foul,\\" he mentions that he enjoys fencing, and in episode 519, \\"Communication Breakdown\\", it is shown that he understands and speaks at least some very small degree of Lithuanian. His level of fluency is unknown. He was close friends with former coroner Marty Pino and his wife, Anabel, and was the one who convinced the two to marry (episode 518, \\"Point of No Return\\"). He also had the task of firing Pino after he was found forging overtime slips to aid his gambling and debt problems. He was visibly upset when Anabel was murdered, finding himself unable to conduct the autopsy on her. He also stopped a suicidal Pino, when he was about to be arrested for running drugs and creating heroin from peoples' bodies, a practice which led to Anabel's death, by turning up unexpectedly at the scene of the arrest.

(known as MRIS) is the largest Multiple Listing Service in the United States. As of mid-July 2009, it serves 51,171Membership and other statistics as of date entry of reference real estate professionals in Baltimore-Washington Metropolitan Area including Maryland, Washington DC, Northern Virginia, and parts of West Virginia and Pennsylvania. Currently this is the largest MLS in North America, and it has evolved from a county-based system controlled by individual Associations of Realtors operating as members of and under the rules of the National Association of Realtors. By the early 1990s it became apparent that a sophisticated computer-based system was necessary to integrate the MLS systems of the many counties and jurisdictions in the tri-state areas (or, at least, tri-jurisdictions) of Maryland, Washington, DC and Virginia, most of which were in close proximity to the capital. Originally, many county Associations offered dumb-terminal access to the MLS only in brokers' offices at speeds such as 300 baud and, eventually by the late 1980s, at 1,200 baud. After being founded in 1992, MRIS operated as a computer-based program on the Windows 3.1 operating system, with proprietary software issued by MRIS. (This was not unlike the plethora of internet access companies, each with its own software, which emerged at that time). Since updates required a new software release via floppy disc to be installed by all subscribers, changes came slowly. It was only when MRIS decided to become an internet-based system with access available to all brokers/agents via the internet from any computer anywhere, that the present system was created. Database systems offered by MRIS MRIS operates two parallel systems available only to licensed brokers, agents, and others (such as appraisers): \\"MATRIX\\" which is the database of property listings in all classes (including residential to raw land and lots) and categories from \\"Active\\" through \\"Sold\\" going back over more than ten years; and \\"KEYSTONE\\" the data entry site for agents to input new listings and update them. On a daily basis, portions of the data from the full MRIS database of real estate listings is uploaded to public-access websites such as Realtor.com (with over 1 million listings nationwide) or to MRIS' own public- access site, http://homesdatabase.com, with the majority of the organization's members Washington DC area properties. Member organizations Originally, brokers and agents doing business in different jurisdictions would have been required to obtain membership in several different MLS systems. When joining an individual Association of Realtors and becoming affiliated with NAR at the same time, individual brokers and agents have the option of joining MRIS. However, it would be difficult to conduct business without having access to the MLS system. Membership fees Legal In 2012, The MRIS was hit with an antitrust lawsuit by the American Home Realty Network, alleging that MRIS and NorthStar MLS were concerting an anti-competitive group boycott of American Home Realty Network. The lawsuit alleged that MRIS‚Äôs lawsuit against American Home Realty Network and Northstar MLS's lawsuit against American Home Realty Network in Minnesota were attempts to drive American Home Realty Network out of business and eliminate it as a competitor in the market for real estate broker services. Through the antitrust lawsuit the American Home Realty Network was seeking damages and injunctive relief to bar MRIS and Northstar MLS from further predatory conduct and to \\"prevent harm to consumers in the market for residential real estate brokerage services.\\" See also * Metropolitan Regional Information System, Inc. v.

The term was coined after the Apollo 1 fire in 1967 and has been referred to in subsequent NASA incidents such as the Space Shuttle Challenger disaster in 1986 and the Space Shuttle Columbia disaster in 2003. Causes \\"Go fever\\" results from both individual and collective aspects of human behavior. It is due to the tendency as individuals to be overly committed to a previously chosen course of action based on time and resources already expended (sunk costs) despite reduced or insufficient future benefits, or even considerable risks. It is also due to both general budget concerns and the desire of members of a team not to be seen as not fully committed to the team's goals or even as interfering with the team's progress or success. \\"Go fever\\" is comparable to the \\"groupthink\\" phenomenon, where a group makes a bad decision for the sake of cordiality and maintaining the group's atmosphere. The term was coined by social psychologist Irving Janis in 1972. The psychology behind \\"go fever\\" is also reminiscent of \\"get-home-itis\\", the irrational desire to press on unnecessarily to a desired destination despite significant (but likely temporary) adverse conditions.Woods, Sabrina (date unknown).

The action movie features a memorable cross-country race between a caravan of trucks and a special train. Plot A trucker named Biff Smith (Wayne) wins a contest between his caravan of trucks and a special train, the two competing against each other in a race to see who can deliver a load of aviation parts to an ocean liner before a labor strike takes place.

John Wayne was meant to have made a film Maid of Orleans or Adventure's End but that was delayed due to the maritime strike. Universal then put him in Short Haul which was to have begun filming in November 1936. However filming on that was delayed due to a teamsters strike. It was to have been shot in San Francisco but that city had labor troubles so the script was rewritten so it could be shot in Los Angeles. Filming eventually took place in January 1937.

The Queries (or simply Queries) is the third book to English physicist Isaac Newton's Opticks, with various numbers of Query sections or \\"question\\" sections (up to 31, depending on edition), expanded on from 1704 to 1718, that contains Newton's final thoughts on the future puzzles of science. Query 31, in particular, launched affinity chemistry and the dozens of affinity tables that were made in the 18th century, based on Newton's description of affinity gradients. Overview Opticks concludes with a set of \\"Queries.\\" In the first edition, these were sixteen such Queries; that number was increased in the Latin edition, published in 1706, and then in the revised English edition, published in 1717/18. The first set of Queries were brief, but the later ones became short essays, filling many pages. In the fourth edition of 1730, there were 31 Queries, and it was the famous \\"31st Query\\" that, over the next two hundred years, stimulated a great deal of speculation and development on theories of chemical affinity. These Queries, especially the later ones, deal with a wide range of physical phenomena, far transcending any narrow interpretation of the subject matter of \\"optics.\\" They concern the nature and transmission of heat; the possible cause of gravity; electrical phenomena; the nature of chemical action; the way in which God created matter in \\"the Beginning;\\" the proper way to do science; and even the ethical conduct of human beings. These Queries are not really questions in the ordinary sense. They are almost all posed in the negative, as rhetorical questions. That is, Newton does not ask whether light \\"is\\" or \\"may be\\" a \\"body.\\" Rather, he declares: \\"Is not Light a Body?\\" Not only does this form indicate that Newton had an answer, but that it may go on for many pages. Clearly, as Stephen Hales (a firm Newtonian of the early eighteenth century) declared, this was Newton's mode of explaining \\"by Query.\\" Other scientists followed Newton's lead. They saw that he had been setting forth a kind of exploratory natural philosophy in which the primary source of knowledge was experiment. This Newtonian tradition of experimental natural philosophy was different from the one based on mathematical deductions. In this sense, Opticks established a kind of Newtonianism that in the eighteenth century rivalled in importance the mathematical natural philosophy of the Principia. Some of the primary adepts in this new philosophy were such prominent figures as Benjamin Franklin, Antoine-Laurent Lavoisier, and James Black.

He was a leading classical music figure in Texas in the first half of the twentieth century and was one of the early music directors of the Dallas Symphony Orchestra. Early life and education Venth was born in Cologne, Germany, the son of Carl Venth and Friderika von Turkowitz. He began learning the violin at age 9 with his father. Carl studied at the Friedrich Wilhelm-Gymnasium; at the Cologne Conservatory, where he learned the violin with George Japha and composition with Ferdinand Hiller, Gustav Jensen, and Otto Klauwell; and at the Brussels Conservatory, where he studied violin with Henryk Wieniawski and from which he graduated in 1877. Career In 1878 Venth was appointed concertmaster of the Utrecht Symphony Orchestra and of the Flemish Opera in Brussels; in 1879 he assumed the same post with the Offenbach Comic Opera of Paris. He made his solo debut in 1878 with the Utrecht Symphony, followed by a concert tour of the Netherlands in 1879 (together with Alfred Patzig and Luise Wandersleb- Patzig, 16 concerts in 12 cities) and of the United States in 1880. In 1880, he moved to the United States whereupon he concertized as a violin soloist for four years before accepting a position in the orchestra of the Metropolitan Opera in New York City. He lived in New York until 1908. During that time, he founded the Venth College of Music in Brooklyn (1889), founded and conducted the Brooklyn Symphony Orchestra (1890), founded and led the Venth String Quartet (1891), and served as conductor or concertmaster with the Euterpe Orchestral Society of New York and the St. Paul Symphony. In 1899 he married Cathinka Finch Myhr of Norway. In 1908 Venth came to Texas to direct the violin department at Kidd-Key College in Sherman. In 1911, he helped bring a moribund Dallas Symphony Orchestra back into existence and assumed the post of music director, a position he would hold until 1914; in 1913 he took a concurrent similar position with the Fort Worth Symphony Orchestra. In 1914 Venth was appointed Dean of Fine Arts at Texas Woman's College (now Texas Wesleyan University) in Fort Worth. Venth remained in Fort Worth until 1931 but served as concertmaster of the Dallas Symphony from 1927 to 1931. In 1931, he moved to San Antonio to become Dean of Fine Arts at Westmoreland College (which was renamed the University of San Antonio during Venth's tenure and is now known as Trinity University), where he taught violin, harmony, and theory. Throughout his professional life Venth was active as a composer. He composed at least three operas (Pan, The Monk of Iona, Fair Betty [listed as Fairy Betty in one source]), four cantatas, two violin concertos, two string quartets, a piano trio, three violin sonatas, numerous songs, orchestral works, piano solo works, and pieces for violin and piano. Many of his compositions were premiered in New York and other important venues and were issued by major publishing houses, including Breitkopf & H√§rtel and Carl Fischer. Pan is described in Venth's Dallas Morning News obituary as \\"the first American opera to gain international recognition.\\" Venth died in San Antonio, Texas, at the age of 77. His autobiography, My Memories, was published posthumously, in 1939, by Alamo Printing Company of San Antonio.

Early life  Clarke was born at Firbank Vicarage, Westmorland, England, the son of the Revd William Clarke and his wife Sarah, n√©e Lowther. He was educated at home and at Sedbergh School, winning a scholarship which took him to St John's College, Cambridge, graduated BA in 1874 as seventh wrangler and MA in 1877. Clarke was ordained deacon in 1874 and priest in 1875 by William Thomson, the Archbishop of York. He was curate of St John's Kingston-on-Hull from 1874 to 1876 before various positions in the north of England during the next 26 years. He was vicar of Hedon from 1876 to 1883, then assistant master at St. Peter‚Ä≤s school in York for a year from 1883 to 1884, when he became vicar of St. Martin, Coney-street, York. In 1890 he became vicar of Dewsbury, and in 1901 vicar of Huddersfield. He was an honorary canon of Wakefield Cathedral from 1893, and proctor for the clergy of the Wakefield diocese in the Convocation of York in 1902.  Melbourne  Clarke was approached for nomination as Bishop of Melbourne and announced his acceptance of this in early September 1902. The following month he received the degree Doctor of Divinity (DD) from the University of Cambridge. He was consecrated Bishop by the Archbishop pf Canterbury in St Paul's Cathedral, London, on 1 November 1902, and arrived in Melbourne in February 1903. Since the resignation of Bishop Goe the area of the Diocese of Melbourne had been greatly reduced by the formation of new dioceses based in Bendigo, Wangaratta and Gippsland. When Clarke began his ministry he appointed a commission to document the present position and future needs of the diocese and later came to the conclusion that certain parishes had become too large and needed subdividing, that means must be found for a more complete training of the clergy, and that there must be an extension of secondary education by means of church schools. In 1905 Clarke became first Archbishop of Melbourne and Metropolitan of Victoria. He ruled his diocese firmly and refused to allow himself to be allied to any party. Recognising that what may be called the puritanical and the aesthetic types of mind are permanent in human nature, he felt that the safest approach would be found in a middle course, and that no good would be done by straining for uniformity in minor issues. In practice, however, Clarke generally opposed evangelicals, as exemplified by the forced resignation of C. H. Nash. The question of the reunion of the churches was given some consideration, but little progress was made. There was, however, much expansion in the social work of the church, and several successful secondary schools were established, including the Melbourne Church of England Girls' Grammar School, Trinity Grammar School in Kew and Firbank Grammar School in Brighton which Clarke named after his birth place. In 1910 Clarke persuaded the Parliament of Victoria to establish the Melbourne College of Divinity to examine for and grant degrees. In March 1920 Clarke went to London to attend the Lambeth Conference and in November resigned as Archbishop of Melbourne.  Later life  Clarke lived in retirement in Lymington, Hampshire, and kept himself busy with literary work. His published writings include History of the Parish of Dewsbury (1899), Addresses delivered in England and Australia (1904), The Last Things (1910), Studies in the English Reformation (1912), Addresses delivered to the Synod of the Diocese of Melbourne (1914), The Constitutions of the General Provincial and Diocesan Synods of the Church of England in Australia (1918), Constitutional Church Government in the Dominions Beyond the Seas (1924), an authoritative and comprehensive work; Death and the Hereafter (1926) and, with W. N. Weech, History of Sedbergh School (1925). Clarke died on 23 June 1926. He was given the honorary degree of Doctor of Divinity (DD) by both Cambridge and Oxford universities. Family Clarke married in 1876 Alice Lovell, daughter of the Revd Canon Kemp. She died suddenly in 1918. Two sons and a daughter survived him when he died in 1926.

Hanley took over as President of Local 257 of the New York City District Council of Carpenters for his father-in-law, a Genovese mobster named Will Graziano. Hanley and Local Vice-President Attilio Bitondo extorted building contractors operating in Manhattan in conjunction with Local shop steward Carmine Fiore, a Gambino crime family soldier, and other organized crime figures linked to the Gambino, Genovese and Colombo crime families. The men ordered beatings for those contractors who refused to back in, but typically, violence wasn't needed. In 1987, Hanley, Bitondo and other high-ranking officials of the N.Y.C. District Council of Carpenters were indicted on 79 counts of labor racketeering, including extortion, bribery, and bid rigging.https://www.nytimes.com/1987/11/02/nyregion/prosecutors-say-tapes- show-mob-infiltrating-carpenter- union.htmlhttps://www.nytimes.com/1987/10/14/nyregion/5-carpenters-union- leaders-indicted-in-extortion.html District Attorney Robert M. Morgenthau claimed that contractors that cooperated with the DA's investigation claimed they paid over $100,000 in extortion payments, but DA Morgenthau explained that the figure documented less than 10% of the money paid to the gangsters during the investigation. Gambino associate turned informant Dominick LoFaro wore a wire to gather information on the unions and gangsters, and provided information to the New York State Organized Crime Task Force leading to the \\"bugging\\" of the offices of Local 608 at 1650 Broadway and of Local 257 at 157 East 25th Street. LoFaro also discussed Hanley's ties to other organized crime figures, including Bartholomew \\"Bobby\\" Boriello, Albert \\"Kid Blast\\" Gallo, Anthony \\"Tony\\" Scotto and Anthony \\"Sonny\\" Ciccone. Hanley would receive a 4-year prison sentence to lesser charges of bribe giving, and would be banned from future union activities. Hanley earned an early release from prison and received a no-show work release job at Casale Jewelry on Court Street, Brooklyn. Hanley's son William resigned from his position as President of Carpenter's Union Local 157 (which was renamed after the massive racketeering indictment) in November 2007, and the Local was placed under trusteeship, citing connections to organized crime, including prevailing upon a contractor to hire a no-work man named Joseph Vecchiarello.

The book was first published in hardback on December 23, 2003 through Random House and deals with the subject of hope and its effect on illnesses. Synopsis In the book Groopman investigates how hope affects human beings that are either undergoing medical care or have a family member that is critically ill. He distinguishes the differences between the types of hope, such as whether or not someone is experiencing false or true hope. For the book, Groopman visits several laboratories that are researching the biological basis of hope to discover whether or not hope can scientifically change someone's physical well-being. Reception Critical reception for Anatomy of Hope has been positive. The New York Times praised Groopman for never definitively defining hope in the book, as they felt that this made the work succeed that much more in making its point. Adaptation In 2007 HBO began work on a television series based upon the book with screenwriters Rafael Yglesias and Tom Schulman. The series, which would have been produced and directed by J.J.

Born in Italy, his family emigrated to Argentina in his youth and he was nicknamed \\"El Tano\\" (the Italian) in Argentina. With 299 goals, he is the all-time top highest goalscorer in the history of Ligue 1 in France, and was the leagues top scorer on 5 different occasions. He played the majority of his career for Stade de Reims, AS Monaco, Tours FC and Sporting Toulon Var. With Monaco he won one league title and one Coupe de France. Career Onnis was born in Giuliano di Roma in Italy, but moved to Argentina before he was 3 and subsequently gained Argentinian citizenship. Beginning his football career as a youth player for Club Almagro, he made a successful transition to the senior team and subsequently earned a move to Gimnasia La Plata where he played alongside players like Roberto Zywica. He was the star striker for the team that finished third in 1970 which brought him to the attention of scouts from Europe. In 1971 he joined Stade de Reims at the same time as his compatriot Zywica, finishing his first season with 22 goals and his second season with 17. In 1974 the newly promoted AS Monaco signed him and over the next 7 seasons he was their top scorer every year, eventually scoring 223 goals, with 157 in the league. In 1976 the club were relegated, but Onnis stayed with them and helped them regain their top flight status for the 1977-78 season that saw them finish as league champions, and the following season win the Coupe de France. In 1980, despite playing in one of the best teams in Division 1, he signed for newly promoted and inexperienced team FC Tours, where he was twice again Division 1 leading goalscorer. In 1983 Tours were relegated, and as a result he joined SC Toulon, where he finished his career in 1986. International career Onnis was never called up for Argentina which had a policy of favouring players who remained in the domestic league, and throughout the 70's and 80's was behind in the pecking order Argentinian compatriots such as Carlos Bianchi and Mario Kempes, Leopoldo Luque.

Rangayan's next film Yours Emotionally, a co-production with a UK production company Wise Thoughts portrayed the angst of a gay British Asian falling in love with a bisexual Indian man in a small town. The film is considered to be a bold exploration of the Indian gay milieu with its stark and naked portrayal of homoerotic desires.

Some nineteen years after her death, her spouse assumed the throne of France as King Charles X. Life Princess Maria Theresa by Giuseppe Dupr√†, circa 1762. Princess Maria Theresa of Savoy was born at the Royal Palace in Turin during the reign of her grandfather Charles Emmanuel III of Sardinia. The daughter of the heir apparent and his wife, Victor Amadeus and Maria Antonia Ferdinanda of Spain, she was the couple's third daughter and fifth child of twelve children. She was raised with her sister Princess Maria Giuseppina who was three years her senior and whom she would join later as a member of the Royal House of France. =Marriage= Her aunts, Maria Luisa of Savoy and Eleonora of Savoy, were once proposed as brides for Louis Stanislas' father Louis. Following a series of dynastic alliances, Maria Theresa was betrothed to the Count of Artois, the youngest grandson of the reigning Louis XV of France. Artois had previously been intended to marry Louise Ad√©la√Øde de Bourbon, the daughter of the Prince of Cond√©. However, the union never took place as her rank was much lower than Artois who, as a male-line descendant of a French monarch, was a grandson of France. Her marriage was arranged as a part of a series of Franco-Savoyard dynastic marriages taking place in a time span of eight years: after the wedding between her cousin Princess Marie Louise of Savoy and Louis Alexandre, Prince of Lamballe, and the wedding between her elder sister Marie Jos√©phine of Savoy and Louis Stanislas, Count of Provence in 1771, Maria Teresa was married to the Count of Artois (future King Charles X of France) in 1773, and her eldest brother Prince Charles Emmanuel of Savoy (the future King of Sardinia) was married to her sister-in-law Princess Clotilde of France in 1775. Her eldest brother-in-law, Dauphin Louis Auguste (the future Louis XVI of France), was since three years prior married to Marie Antoinette. Maria Theresa married the Count in a proxy ceremony at the Palazzina di caccia of Stupinigi before she crossed the bridge of Beauvoisin between Savoy and France, where she was turned over by her Italian retinue to her French entourage, after which her official marriage took place at the Palace of Versailles on 16 November 1773. As her husband was the grandson of a king, the newly named Marie Th√©r√®se held the rank of granddaughter of France, and was commonly referred to by the simple style Madame la comtesse d'Artois. =Countess of Artois= Marie Th√©r√®se with her three surviving children, by Charles Leclercq, 1783. Maria Theresa was described as diminutive, somewhat ill-shaped, clumsy and with a long nose and was not regarded a beauty, but her complexion was generally admired; as a person, she was regarded as \\"not distinguished in any sense\\", but nevertheless goodhearted.Hardy, B. C. (Blanche Christabel), The Princesse de Lamballe; a biography, 1908, Project Gutenberg Florimond Claude, Comte de Mercy-Argenteau, who corresponded with Holy Roman Empress Maria Theresa regarding Marie Antoinette, said that she was silent and interested in absolutely nothing.Fraser, Antonia, Marie Antoinette, The Journey, Anchor Books, (American edition, 2002): in Part One: Madame Antoine, p. 100 The brother of Marie Antoinette, Joseph II, Holy Roman Emperor, said of her during his visit to France in 1777 that she was the only one in the royal family \\"to give birth to children, but is in all other aspects a complete idiot.\\"Joan Haslip (1991). Marie Antoinette. Stockholm: Norstedts F√∂rlag AB. During her first years in France, the three royal couples; the Count and Countess of Provence, the Count and Countess of Artois, the Dauphin and Dauphine, as well as her cousin, the Princess of Lamballe, who was the favorite of Marie Antoinette, formed a circle of friends and acted in amateur theater plays together, before an audience only consisting of the Dauphin. This intimate friendship, however, gradually deteriorated after the succession of Louis XVI to the throne in 1774. Roughly a year after Maria Theresa's arrival at Versailles, she became pregnant with her first child, Louis Antoine, Duke of Angoul√™me: He was the first child of the new royal generation, which was an important event, as there was at that point concern for the succession because the marriage of both the King as well as that of the first of his brothers, the Count of Provence, were childless, and the birth was reportedly stressful to Marie Antoinette, at the time anxious for the consummation of her marriage to take place and concerned for her lack of children.Joan Haslip (1991). Marie Antoinette. Stockholm: Norstedts F√∂rlag AB. After this birth, Marie Antoinette was harassed by the public for not given birth herself. The next year Maria Theresa gave birth to a daughter, Sophie, who was known as Mademoiselle as the most senior unmarried princess at court. She died at the age of seven in 1783. Her second son, Charles Ferdinand, Duke of Berry, was born in 1778. Her last child, Marie Th√©r√®se d'Artois, presumably named after her mother, died while the court was at Choisy-le-Roi at the age of just 6 months. Prior to the meeting of the Estates General, every member of the Royal Family was publicly mocked by libelous verses, in which Maria Theresa was claimed to have given birth to an illegitimate child.Fraser, Antonia, Marie Antoinette: The Journey ORION, London 2002, =Exile= Maria Theresa left France with her spouse after the Storming of the Bastille on 14 July 1789, which marked the beginning of the French Revolution, and took refuge in her homeland of Savoy. She left one week after her spouse with a retinue of thirty people, and since she had her possessions sold in connection to her trip, the couple's official statement that they were to return in spring was doubted. When her spouse left Savoy in 1791, she stayed behind, and the couple lived separated for the rest of their lives. The Count of Artois refused to give her permission to stay with or visit him, even refusing her to attend the wedding of her son the Duke of Angoul√™me to Marie Th√©r√®se of France in Mitau.Nagel, Susan. \\" Marie-Therese, Child of Terror: The Fate of Marie Antoinette's Daughter \\". NY: Bloomsbury, 2008. Soon after her husband's departure, her two sons also left Savoy to serve in the Cond√© emigree army. Maria Theresa was described as desolate and deeply saddened after her husband and her sons had left her in Savoy, and reportedly contemplated to become a nun. A sister of Louis XVI, Marie-Clotilde of France, Queen of Sardinia (1759-1802), 1911 She was persuaded not to enter a convent by her sister-in- law Clothilde, who appealed to her sense of duty to her children, and Maria Theresa later expressed gratitude toward Clothilde for this. In 1792, she was joined in Turin by her sister Marie Josephine. Their presence in Savoy was politically sensitive, as it disturbed the relations between France and Savoy. In April 1796, when Savoy was defeated by France under Napoleon Bonaparte during the Italian campaigns of the French Revolutionary Wars, Maria Theresa and her sister Marie Jos√©phine left Turin for Novara, in parallel with the departure of Marie Jos√©phine's husband from Verona.Reiset, Emile-Paul de, Jos√©phine de Savoie, comtesse de Provence, 1753-1810, Paris 1913 While her sister continued to Austria, Maria Therese accepted her father's invitation to return to Turin after the peace between France and Savoy in May.Reiset, Emile- Paul de, Jos√©phine de Savoie, comtesse de Provence, 1753-1810, Paris 1913 In December 1798, when Piemonte was annexed by France, Maria Theresa left with her lady-in-waiting for Graz in Austria, where she was permitted to remain and where she died in 1805.Reiset, Emile-Paul de, Jos√©phine de Savoie, comtesse de Provence, 1753-1810, Paris 1913 Because she died before her spouse became King of France, she remained Countess of Artois.

Early life George Clarke was born in Parramatta, New South Wales, the son of the Revd George Clarke, an early missionary to New Zealand with the Church Missionary Society. Clarke senior who came from Norfolk and arrived at Hobart, Van Diemen's Land in September 1822. Clarke senior then went to Sydney, and while waiting for a ship to New Zealand, took charge of an establishment of Aborigines near Parramatta. The family went on to New Zealand in 1824 and settled at Bay of Islands. His father worked at the Waimate mission, teaching the MƒÅori students. In 1832 George Clarke the younger was sent to Hobart and went to R. W. Giblin's school. Returning to New Zealand early in 1837 the boy studied with the Rev. William Williams, afterwards Bishop of Waiapu. In 1839 he went with Williams to Poverty Bay, still continuing his studies, and there obtained an excellent knowledge of the MƒÅori language, and of the mentality of the Maoris; an invaluable experience that he found of great use a year or two later. Career In 1840 Clarke's father was made protector of aborigines by the recently appointed lieutenant-governor, Captain Hobson. The seat of government was transferred to Auckland, and there the elder Clarke bought a large block of land from the Maoris for the government. In January 1841 his son was appointed a clerk in the native department of the civil service of New Zealand. In February 1842 he was translator at the trial of Wiremu Kingi Maketu, who was the first MƒÅori condemned to death for murder. Clarke had already formed the ambition of becoming a clergyman, but for five years he remained in the government employ, first as an interpreter, then as a Maori advocate and protector, and eventually as a negotiator with the MƒÅori . In all these capacities he did most valuable work. Clarke accompanied Commissioner William Spain as an interpreter, during his inquiry into the claims of the New Zealand Company, and was fiercely assailed by the representatives of the company. Eventually the claims of the company were reduced. New Plymouth and Manawatu were shown to have been purchased correctly but in most other cases the New Zealand Company had to pay further sums to MƒÅori as compensation. In June 1844 Clarke was sent to Otago to assist in the purchase of a large block of land for the projected Scottish settlement. Clarke had to fight hard to preserve the MƒÅori pƒÅ, village cultivations and burial grounds, but eventually succeeded, and the sale of something over 400,000 acres (1,600 km¬≤) of what is now the province of Otago was concluded. Clarke wrote out the original MƒÅori deed and English translation, and took pride in the fact that no dispute ever arose subsequently in regard to the transaction. For eight of the early months of 1845 Clarke was in the centre of the war with the MƒÅori, and for most of the time was the only representative of the government in the district. On 18 November 1845 Governor Grey arrived and Clarke was at once attached to his personal staff. Grey was anxious to put an end to the war and eventually peace was declared. Clarke said of this conflict \\"Heke's war stands quite alone in the history of our struggles with the Maori race; alone in its magnanimity, its chivalry, its courtesy, and, I dare say, its control by Christian sentiment\\". In another place he mentions that \\"Heke always said, if fight we must, let us fight like gentlemen\\". But though Clarke could pay these well- deserved tributes in his account of the great chief, he could say little about his own conduct as representative of the government, which was equally creditable. In 1846, greatly to the regret of Grey, Clarke resigned from the government service. Grey pointed out to him that he had splendid prospects if he would remain, but his health had suffered, he still retained his ambition to be a minister of the Gospel, and, moreover, he could not reconcile his conscience with some of the acts of the government. Minister Clarke left New Zealand for Hobart and early in 1847 sailed to London and entered at Highbury College. He was ordained in the Union Chapel, Islington in 1851, and at once returned to Hobart to become minister of the Collins Street church. Soon a larger church was built in Davey Street, and for over 50 years he remained its pastor, honoured and beloved by all and never losing his appeal to the younger people. He took much interest in higher education, and was a member of the Tasmanian Council of Education for many years from 1878 and its president 1880‚Äì81. He was also a member of the Royal Society of Tasmania and a promoter of the Hobart Debating and Literary Association. He was one of the founders of the University of Tasmania, its first vice-chancellor from May 1890 to May 1898, and chancellor from May 1898 to May 1907, when he retired. He had retired from his church work in 1904. He died at Hobart on 10 March 1913. Apart from his Notes on Early Life in New Zealand, which appeared in 1903, Clarke's only publications were some separately published sermons and addresses and a small collection of Short Liturgies for Congregational Worship. He also wrote the memoir of James Backhouse Walker prefixed to his Early Tasmania. Clarke married a daughter of Henry Hopkins and was survived by two sons and four daughters.

It was the 58th Mickey Mouse short film, and the eighth of that year. Some sources claim this cartoon is called \\"Mickey's Gala Premiere\\". However \\"Premier\\" can be clearly read from the title card. Synopsis A new Mickey Mouse cartoon will have its premiere in the Grauman's Chinese Theatre in Hollywood. Several Hollywood celebrities all arrive in limousines to attend this special event. Outside The Keystone Cops (Ben Turpin, Ford Sterling, Mack Swain, Harry Langdon and Chester Conklin) are guarding the traffic. Wallace Beery, Marie Dressler, Lionel Barrymore, John Barrymore and Ethel Barrymore step out of the first limousine, all costumed as in the film Rasputin and the Empress (1932). Then Laurel and Hardy leave the car and close the door behind them. Inside The Marx Brothers all stick their heads out of the car window. In the next scene Maurice Chevalier, Eddie Cantor costumed as in the film The Kid from Spain, and Jimmy Durante take turns singing in front of a microphone. They are followed by Jean Harlow, Joan Crawford costumed as in the film Rain and Janet Gaynor all singing new lyrics to the chant. Finally Harold Lloyd, Clark Gable, Edward G. Robinson, and Adolphe Menjou join in to conclude the song. Sid Grauman is saluting all the guests. George Arliss and Joe E. Brown simply enter, but Charlie Chaplin sneaks inside. Then Buster Keaton enters the building, followed by The Marx Brothers all hidden under Groucho Marx' coat. Mae West enters, costumed as in the film She Done Him Wrong, and utters her famous line, \\"Why don't you come up sometime and see me?\\", which shocks and embarrasses Grauman. Then Mickey Mouse, Minnie Mouse, Pluto, Horace Horsecollar, and Clarabelle Cow arrive in a limousine and are cheered by the audience. Once inside the theatre Mickey‚Äôs new cartoon, Gallopin' Romance, premieres. The plot revolves around Mickey and Minnie playing music together, when suddenly Pegleg Pete kidnaps Minnie and drives off on a horse (Horace Horsecollar). Mickey chases him and beats Pete in the end, bringing Minnie to safety. All the guests in the theatre move rhythmically to the music. We can see Helen Hayes, William Powell, Chester Morris, Gloria Swanson, and George Arliss in the audience. In the next close-up scenes the viewer can identify Jimmy Durante, Wallace Beery, Marie Dressler, Rudy Vallee, Eddie Cantor, Joan Crawford, Will H. Hays (dressed as a king in reference to his position as ‚ÄúCensorship Czar‚Äù) and Myrna Loy. Ed Wynn, Wheeler & Woolsey, Laurel & Hardy all laugh with the cartoon. Bela Lugosi (dressed as Count Dracula), Fredric March (dressed as Mr. Hyde) and Boris Karloff (dressed as Frankenstein's monster) do the same, but with spooky evil laughter. Joe E. Brown laughs so loud that his enormous mouth opens wide, while Buster Keaton keeps his poker face. Jimmy Durante and Douglas Fairbanks laugh so loud that they literally \\"roll in the aisles\\". They are joined in by Groucho Marx, Joe E. Brown, Charlie Chaplin, Harold Lloyd and Laurel and Hardy. As the cartoon ends the whole audience applauds and congratulates Mickey with his success. But Mickey is so shy that he has to be pulled on the stage by Will Rogers with a rope. All the Hollywood actors now shake Mickey‚Äôs hands (and feet!) to congratulate him with his success. Then Greta Garbo, no longer wanting to be alone, walks onto the stage and starts covering Mickey‚Äôs face with kisses. Mickey wakes up in his bed, while Pluto is licking his face. Mickey wonders if he was dreaming. Other Hollywood celebrities that can be spotted in the crowd scenes: Constance Bennett, Warner Baxter, and Walt Disney (as the fourth person on the right, in the scene where the other actors shy away because Garbo enters the stage). Production notes * The cartoon seen in the film, Gallopin‚Äô Romance, was made exclusively for Mickey‚Äôs Gala Premier. No separate Mickey Mouse cartoon features this title. * Ed Wynn would later play The Mad Hatter in Alice in Wonderland (1951) and Uncle Albert in Mary Poppins (1964). Maurice Chevalier would later play Father Sylvain in Monkeys, Go Home! (1967) and sing the theme song of The Aristocats (1970). Both would go on to be named a Disney Legend, an award given to those who have made an outstanding contribution to The Walt Disney Company. *Adolphe Menjou would make his last film performance in the Disney film Pollyanna (1960). * Helen Hayes would later play Grandma Steinmetz in the Disney film Herbie Rides Again (1974). * This the first time Mickey interacts with humans. *At this point in time, the Mickey shorts were released through United Artists, but the only currently existing prints of this short are reissue prints that omit any mention of UA. However, the \\"titles\\" for the short-within-a-short Gallopin‚Äô Romance still exist in their original form, with the UA credits. This gives today's viewer an idea on what an opening of a Mickey Mouse cartoon might have looked like in the UA era.  Temporary shutdown of BBC Television Service  On 1 September 1939, Mickey‚Äôs Gala Premier was the final programme broadcast by the BBC Television Service (today's BBC One) before it ceased broadcasting during World War II. An urban legend about this final broadcast claims that due to the sudden outbreak of the war the BBC cut the cartoon short, and when BBC-TV resumed after the conflict, it was picked up at the very point it had been interrupted. Despite this widespread belief, the cartoon was shown in its entirety and then followed by tuning signals. On 7 June 1946, the day BBC television broadcasts resumed after the war, Mickey‚Äôs Gala Premier was shown again.The TV Room Plus: TV Listings Voice cast * Mickey Mouse: Walt Disney * Minnie Mouse: Marcellite Garner * Pluto: Pinto Colvig * Pete: Billy Bletcher * Celebrities: unknown See also * Mickey's Polo Team * Mother Goose Goes Hollywood * Hollywood Steps Out * Hollywood Daffy * The Autograph Hound * Slick Hare * What's Cookin' Doc? * Felix in Hollywood *Mickey Mouse (film series) References External links * *Disney Shorts *Stargazing at Mickey's Gala Premier 1933 films 1933 animated films 1930s color films American black-and-white films Hollywood in fiction Disney animated short films, 1930s American films Mickey Mouse short films Films about actors Films set in Los Angeles Films directed by Burt Gillett Films produced by Walt Disney Animation based on real people Cultural depictions of Charlie Chaplin Cultural depictions of Buster Keaton Cultural depictions of Laurel & Hardy Cultural depictions of the Marx Brothers Cultural depictions of Mae West Cultural depictions of Greta Garbo Cultural depictions of Clark Gable Cultural depictions of Edward G.

He survived a fiery multi-car pileup he was involved in during a JGTC race at Fuji Speedway on May 3, 1998, caused by a safety car which was driven at twice the recommended speed in torrential rain during a parade lap. Ota was seriously injured and, as a result, he brought a lawsuit against the race organizers. Life Following his education at Musashi University, Ota turned to racing cars in 1982. He drove in the junior formula FJ1600 (Formula Japan) series before moving on to All-Japan Formula Three Championship in 1986 and then graduated to race in the domestic Formula 3000 series between 1987 and 1991, excepting 1989. Ota also competed in numerous domestic series such as Japanese Touring Car Championship (JTCC), All Japan Sports Prototype Championship (JSPC) and Fuji Grand Champion Series as well as in Super Taikyu. „Åå„Çì„Å∞„ÇåÔºÅÂ§™Áî∞Âì≤‰πü Homepage While competing in JSPC, Ota was a factory driver for Mazda between 1989 and 1991. Ota's first foray in racing outside Japan was when he competed in four straight 24 Hours of Le Mans races between 1993 and 1996, all with a DNF and one DNS.Mainichi Shimbun, October 29, 2003 In 1990 Ota married Atsuko. In 1993 he became a regular contributor to Neko Publishing's Tipo magazine. This gave him the privilege of being on the selection committee of the Car of the Year Japan (COTY). Since his inaugural season Ota has competed in the All- Japan GT Championship. His speciality was racing Ferraris, especially in other series. Ota became the most highly regarded driver of the marque in Japan. 1998 JGTC Fuji incident On May 3, 1998, during round 2 of the JGTC at Fuji Speedway, Ota was badly injured. There were 47,000 spectators in attendance for the JGTC round scheduled for 300km (67 laps). At the time of race there was torrential rain and visibility was limited. Following the parade lap, the safety car drove through the starting line at 150 km/h (93 mph) then suddenly slowed down. This caused 910 Racing's Porsche 911 RSR driven by Tomohiko Sunako to aquaplane and strike the rear of Kaoru Hoshino's 911 GT2. Of the GT300 cars, the third car in front of the Porsches (and 22nd on the grid),AUTOBACS CUP GT Championship 1998 Round 2 ‚Äì Qualify the BMW M3 of Yasushi Hitotsuyama, behind, managed to avoid the Porsche by driving onto the grass and then back to the circuit, while the Porsche struck a barrier and rested on the grass. A caution flag was waved out. Seconds later, the Team Ferrari Club of Japan's Ferrari F355 Challenge driven by Ota, slowed down, causing it to aquaplane and swerve left directly into the Porsche. Both exploded into a fireball on impact. The Ferrari, after hitting the wall, slid across to the other side of the track and rested at the pit stop exit. Another Porsche swerved to avoid Ota. Tomohiko Sunako managed to stumble out of his car with a fractured right leg and was quickly attended to by rescue officials. The RE Amemiya RX-7 driven by Shinichi Yamaji stopped in front of the Ferrari while the other cars drove on. Yamaji used a fire extinguisher from the side of the track to extinguish the fire and then helped to release Ota's safety harness. He did this before race marshals arrived.Asahi Shimbun; 30 October 2003 Ota was trapped in his car for 1 minute and 30 seconds while exposed to 800-degree temperatures and had to be dragged out of the car by a safety marshal. The marshal laid him on the ground which caused his semi- melted visor to sag onto his face. Ota attempted to get up, but fell. During his another attempt, another marshal spotted Ota, picked him up, and bundled him into the circuit's support vehicle, rather than an ambulance. Ota was taken to a hospital in Gotemba where he was treated for third-degree burns to his face and neck area and minor burns to the rest of the body. He required plastic surgery to the nasal area as a result of the visor melting on his face. He also suffered from intoxication from the fumes he inhaled from the fire. As a result of his injuries, Ota was no longer able to move his right arm, right shoulder and fingers properly. His injuries brought an end to his professional race career. =Race canceled= The race was to be rescheduled to a shortened 51 lap race, but thick fog rolled in over the circuit causing the race to be delayed. Organizers waited, hoping that the weather would improve, but by 17:00 the organizers announced that the race was officially called off and all results were voided. Under the FIA Code, the race had not officially started, three laps being required for this. Court case Reports on the incident were filed by the JAF and race organizers. One of the reports stated that Ota did not wear a fire resistant balaclava as required; which he denied. Also, the report stated that the safety team started fighting fire 20 seconds after the accident, but the flames of Ota's car were first fought by fellow drivers 50 seconds after the crash while Ota was still trapped inside. As a result, Ota filed a damages suit for about ¬•290 million ($2,500,000 US) against seven organizers for their failure to implement proper safety measures in Tokyo District Court in November 1999. Those held liable included circuit operator, Fuji Speedway, series organizer, Japan Automobile Federation (JAF); the race operator, VICIC (Victory Circle Club) and broadcaster TV Tokyo. On 29 October 2003, six race sponsors and promoters including TV Tokyo, VICIC and Fuji Speedway were found guilty of gross negligence. The success of the lawsuit was due to the recorded TV coverage of the incident which was shown in court. The responsible parties were ordered to pay ¬•90 million ($800,000 US) compensation for pain and suffering, on the grounds that their first aid response was poorly prepared and their race marshals were poorly trained. The judge, Tsuyoshi Ono, decided that organizers neglected their responsibility, as Ota was left in his burning vehicle for longer than the 30 seconds in which he should have been out of the car. The organizers had failed to take sufficient precautionary measures, such as having fire engines on standby as is required to extinguish fires and rescue drivers in 30 seconds or less. The judge determined the pre-race agreement between Ota and the organizers not to pursue legal action in the event of an accident was unacceptable. Despite his written pledge to organizers not to seek compensation in the event of an accident, which all drivers were required to sign, the judge ruled it unfair and said it runs counter to public order and morals. Ono added that the pledge, branded by him as a \\"death pledge\\", aims to exempt organizers from responsibility, allowing them to benefit economically from races. The judge ruled that the safety car was driving at an excessive pace of 150 km/h rather than at the safety pace of 60 km/h, causing the accident when it suddenly slowed down. He also ruled that the fire fighting and rescue preparations were not sufficient. The judge ruled that Ota was partially responsible as he did not decelerate early enough. Ota was satisfied with the outcome. TV Tokyo denied any responsibility themselves throughout the case, as they did not regard themselves as one of the race organizers. The court found TV Tokyo guilty of gross negligence for attempting to avoid responsibility for its part in the incident. The claim against JAF was rejected as they could not be held responsible. Post court case A documentary film about the incident titled was released in 2003, as well as the book titled Re‚Ä¢Birth, documenting Ota's struggle to rebuild his life and his body. A number of improved safety measures were introduced following the accident, including the adaptation of the Medical Car in JAF competition that contained medical and rescue specialists, similar to INDYCAR's Safety Team, which uses medical and rescue specialists in a fully equipped pickup truck. Ota has since continued to be involved in motorsport, but no longer in a professional capacity. He runs a car tuning and race preparation garage, named Tezzo, specializing in Italian cars. Shinichi Yamaji, the driver who saved Ota's life by extinguishing his car's fire and pulling him out, died on May 26, 2014, aged 50, from an undisclosed long illness. He reportedly checked in a hospital on May 25 due to a worsening health condition and died suddenly the next day.

He was the first critic to review Nobel Prize-winner Toni Morrison and the first American critic to review Nobel Prize-winner Gabriel Garcia Marquez. From 1977 to 1980, Leonard wrote \\"Private Lives,\\" a weekly column for the Times about his family, friends, and experiences. Leonard was a voracious critical omnivore, writing on culture, politics, television, books and the media in many other venues, including The Nation, The New York Review of Books, Harper's, The Atlantic Monthly, Esquire, Playboy, Penthouse, Vanity Fair, TV Guide, Ms. Magazine, Harper's Bazaar, Vogue, Newsweek, New York Woman, Memories, Tikkun, The Yale Review, The Village Voice, New Statesman, The Boston Globe, Washington Post Book World, The Los Angeles Times Book Review, American Heritage and Salon.com. He reviewed books for National Public Radio's Fresh Air and wrote a column for New York Newsday called \\"Culture Shock.\\" He hosted WGBH's First Edition, and reviewed books, TV and movies on CBS Sunday Morning for 16 years. Leonard taught creative writing and criticism at the University of Pennsylvania and Columbia University. He told the story of Japanese author K≈çb≈ç Abe in every one of these venues. Leonard wrote extensively about television in his career ‚Äì for Life and The New York Times, both under the pen name Cyclops, for New York Magazine from 1984 to 2008, and in his 1997 book Smoke and Mirrors. In addition, he authored four novels and five collections of essays. Leonard was co-literary editor of The Nation with his wife, Sue Leonard, from 1995 to 1998, and continued as a contributing editor for the magazine. He wrote a monthly column on new books for Harper's magazine and was a frequent contributor to the New York Times Book Review and The New York Review of Books. Leonard rated highest among literary critics in a 2006 Time Out New York survey of writers and publishers. He received the National Book Critics Circle's Ivan Sandrof Lifetime Achievement Award in 2006.\\"All Past National Book Critics Circle Award Winners and Finalists\\" .

Effect on the literary world The Columbia Journalism Review called Leonard \\"our primary progressive, catholic [small \\"c\\"] literary critic.\\" Stylistically, he was, as CJR dubbed him, an \\"enthusiast,\\" known for his wit and wordplay, his liberal use of the semicolon and his impassioned examinations of authors and their works. He wrote definitive career essays on the work of writers ranging from Thomas Pynchon and Joan Didion to Eduardo Galeano, Salman Rushdie, Don DeLillo, Mary Gordon, John Cheever, Toni Morrison and Richard Powers. Kurt Vonnegut wrote of him: \\"When I read anything by my longtime friend John Leonard, his voice is that of a total stranger. He is too polite in ordinary conversations, with me at least, to set off the fireworks of all he knows and feels after reading and comparing and responding to, in the course of his long career as a literary critic, a thousand times more books than I have even heard of. Only in print does he light the night sky of my ignorance and intellectual lassitude with sizzles and bangs, and gorgeous blooms of fire. He is a TEACHER! When I start to read John Leonard, it is as though I, while simply looking for the men's room, blundered into a lecture by the smartest man who ever lived.\\" Studs Terkel called him \\"a critic from whom I learned about my own books.\\" Terkel told the NBCC's Elizabeth Taylor: \\"He speaks truth to power with a style that is all his own ‚Äì Leonardian. He is a throwback to a great tradition. He has been a literary critic in the noblest sense of the word, where you didn't determine whether a book was 'good or bad' but wrote with a point of view of how you should read the book.\\"\\"Studs Terkel on John Leonard\\".

The humor of the comic is based almost exclusively on wordplay and puns. Regardless of the topic, everything related to the topic (background and phrases) is shown in a single frame in the daily strips. Frank and Ernest has a tradition of breaking new ground. It was the first strip to use digital coloring for its Sunday strips and the first strip in over 1,000 newspapers to list the creator's email address. 1997 was a ground-breaking year: first interactive comics based on strips published in the newspaper, first keyword searchable archive for a comic strip and the first 3-D characters. The strip is distributed to Spanish-speaking countries as Justo y Franco.Justo y Franco at GoComics. Accessed Dec. 19, 2018. Characters and story In a non-sequential story, the main characters are seen not just as humans but as animals, vegetables, minerals and more. A constant element has been word play, including the characters' names. Frank is both a name and a synonym for honest. The name Ernest is a homophone of the word earnest, which is a synonym for serious. Weekday strips are laid out in one long panel with one joke or pun; the Sunday strip is similarly in one large block, with a series of rapid- fire puns pertaining to the characters (usually in character as various characters including, but not limited to, the planets, \\"Robotics Department,\\" or \\"Malaprop Man\\"). Example: U.S. Postal Dept. Stamp Design Office: \\"The department decided to have a religious message on our next stamp. How about: 'Lord, deliver us'?\\" Unlike most syndicated comic strip cartoonists, Bob Thaves did not write all of the gags for the strip (nor maintain a pretense that he did) and openly solicited for gags in publications such as Writer's Market. Bob Thaves died on August 1, 2006. His son, Tom Thaves, has since taken over production of the strip.Bob Thaves 10/5/1924 - 8/1/2006 Awards Thaves won the National Cartoonists Society's Newspaper Panel Cartoon Award for 1983, 1984, and 1986 for his work on the strip.

Grayson was born in Worrall, near Sheffield, Yorkshire, England, son of Joseph Grayson, a Master Cutler, and his wife Fanny, n√©e Smith. Grayson came of a family of market gardeners, and travelled to New Zealand in the early 1880s. After he returned to England and married Elizabeth Clare on 11 August 1886, the couple soon migrated to Victoria (Australia) where Grayson worked as a nursery gardener. Becoming interested in science he joined the Field Naturalists Club of Victoria, studied botany and did some work on the diatoms, a group of minute plants. Grayson attended meetings of the Royal Microscopical Society and developed a talent for preparing microscope slides. Before 1894 he had constructed a machine for making micrometer rulings on glass, the results being very good for that time. In 1897 some beautiful work Grayson had done in cutting sections of plants led to his being given a position in the physiology department of the University of Melbourne under Professor C. J. Martin. He was afterwards transferred to the geology department, and in December 1901 accompanied Professor F. T. Gregory on his expedition to Central Australia. In the preface to The Dead Heart of Australia Gregory paid a special tribute \\"To my assistant Mr Grayson on whom much of the hard work of the expedition fell\\". In 1910 Grayson was associated with Daniel James Mahony in the preparation of a paper on \\"The Geology of the Camperdown and Mount Elephant Districts\\" (No. 9 in the Memoirs of the Geological Survey of Victoria), and in the same year, while working at the university under professor E. W. Skeats, who succeeded Gregory, Grayson made a highly efficient apparatus for preparing rock sections, a description of which will be found in the Proceedings of the Royal Society of Victoria for the year 1911. In the meanwhile Grayson had been perfecting his fine ruling work.References to it will be found in the Journal of the Royal Microscopical Society for 1899, p. 355; 1902, p. 385; 1904, p. 393; 1910, pp. 5, 144, 701 and 801; 1911, pp. 160, 421 and 449. In the 1910 volume, on pages 239 and 243, there is an interesting note by Grayson himself \\"On the Production of Micrometric and Diffraction Rulings\\". Grayson had by then succeeded in creating 120,000 diffractions lines to the inch (4,700 lines per mm). Grayson described his work on diffraction ruling in a report published for the Report of Meeting, Eighth Meeting of the Australasian Association for the Advancement of Science, held at Melbourne, Victoria in 1900: From this time onwards much of his time was given to the preparation of a dividing engine for ruling diffraction gratings. Grayson was transferred to the Natural Philosophy department of the university under Professor T. R. Lyle in 1913 and was allowed to give his full time to the machine. In July 1917 he read a paper before the Royal Society of Victoria giving a full description of the machine, which was published with several plates in the society's Proceedings for that year. In the same year Grayson was awarded the David Syme Research Prize of ¬£100 by the University of Melbourne. Grayson died in Clyde of heart disease leaving a widow but no children.

It was designed after the Op√©ra Garnier by the Boller Brothers, built in 1928, and is on the National Register of Historic Places. It is Columbia's only surviving pre-Depression movie palace and vaudeville stage. In 2011, the University of Missouri began a three-year lease of the facility. The Missouri Theatre is the resident home of the Missouri Symphony Orchestra, and is also frequently used by University of Missouri and civic groups. As of July 1, 2014, The University of Missouri took over ownership of the Missouri Theatre. It is one of the main performance venues for the University of Missouri School of Music. History The theater opened on October 5, 1928. It was built at a cost of over 400,000 dollars which is equivalent to over 4.5 million dollars today. Advertisements in the Columbia Daily Tribune proclaimed the \\"Formal Opening of your new Missouri Theatre‚ÄîFriday Evening‚Ä¶ A $400,000 Showhouse of Unrivaled Beauty and Extravagant Setting in Central Missouri. The Magnificent Splendor of This Palace of Amusement Will Dazzle and Thrill You.\\" Telegrams were received from The United Artist in Hollywood, as well as from actors such as Charlie Chaplin and Gloria Swanson, congratulating the managers of the theater. On opening night the performers included The Missouri Rockettes (later to become the Radio City Rockettes) and Jack Keith and his Missouri Orchestra. It was rumored that Bob Hope also made an appearance. The Theatre operated much in this fashion as well as a movie palace until 1953.Missouri Theatre Center for the Arts : About MTCA Because of its size and extravagance the Missouri Theatre was difficult to maintain and was leased to Commonwealth Theaters, Inc. in 1953 who operated it as a single-screen movie theater until 1983. In 1979 the building was listed on the National Register of Historic Places. The advent of the multiscreen cinemas in Columbia lead to the eventually purchase of the theatre by the Missouri Symphony Society on January 7, 1988. Author Hill Harper speaks in January 2014. In 2002, the Missouri Symphony Society began plans to transform the Missouri Theatre into the Missouri Theatre Center for the Arts (MTCA). The Missouri Symphony Society experienced record-breaking success in 2005 with the Hot Summer Nights Music Festival as more than 11,200 music lovers attended concerts featuring Maestro Kirk Trevor, the Missouri Symphony Orchestra, and world-renowned guest artists throughout its eight-week summer season. On July 28, 2007, the restoration of the Missouri Theatre began after the conclusion of the Hot Summer Nights Music Festival. The following summer, the fully restored Missouri Theatre Center for the Arts re-opened with Tony Bennett and the Hot Summer Nights Music Festival. The renovations included a new second floor with administrative offices and a 2,500 sq. ft. rooftop patio. In 2011 Missouri Theatre became home to the University Concert Series, and acts as a recital and performance venue for many University of Missouri School of Music performance groups. The Box Office is operated by Event Production Services a department of Operation Auxiliary and Services in the division of Campus Operations at the University of Missouri. Architecture The interior of the building is ornate baroque and rococo style of the Louis XIV and XV periods. It was designed after the Paris Opera House by the Boller Brothers Architects of Kansas City, Missouri. Much original detail still exist, including Belgian marble wainscoting, plaster reliefs, stained glass and, one of the most notable features, an 1800-pound Italian auditorium chandelier featuring crystal prisms and etched panels. At one time, the deep red carpet in the grand lobby had the Great Seal of Missouri and the letter M woven into it. Missouri Symphony Orchestra Missouri Theatre is the home of mid-Missouri's only professional resident symphony orchestra, the Missouri Symphony Orchestra (MSO). Established by the Missouri Symphony Society in 1976, the MSO is composed of musicians from throughout the United States and around the world. Through its annual eight- week season, the Hot Summer Nights Music Festival in June and July, and tours throughout the state and beyond, the Missouri Symphony Orchestra has been heralded by the Kansas City Star as an ensemble that performs with \\"energy and elan, as well as secure technique.\\" Since 2001, the MSO has been directed by Maestro Kirk Trevor.

Wurtzel, directed by Arthur Pierson, starring Billy Halop and Ann E. Todd. Marilyn Monroe makes her first on screen appearance as Evie the waitress in the restaurant scene. Plot summary The God-fearing residents of Middleton are worried that the Gopher Hole, a new road house restaurant outside of town, will bring their teenage kids to ruin. Jeff Carter, who is a history teacher at the local school, goes on to look closer at the place to see if all the worries are justified. Jeff discovers that a group of boys from town, Willy Miller, Gene Spooner and the tough Danny Jones, are planning to rob a warehouse in town. When trying to stop them, they struggle and a gunshot goes off, killing Jeff. The killer, Danny, and the rest of the gang flee, using Willy's father's delivery truck. The truck is recognized by a witness working at the warehouse. The boys hide out at the Gopher Hole, joining a game of cards, acting as if they have been there all night. The police arrive to the Gopher Hole and eventually arrest the boys. Danny is the only boy who isn't under age, and he is prosecuted for first degree murder by district attorney Edgar Burns. At the trial, Burns claims that Danny had planned to kill Jeff because of their previous encounters and the fact that Danny hated Jeff. On his side, boy Leo, tells of Danny's attempt to punch Jeff and that he was the one who brought the boys to the Gopher Hole in the first place. Willy then blames his own behaviour on his father's abuse and harsh treatment of him. Before the prosecution rests its case, the district attorney's daughter, Connie Burns, causes a scandal when she admits to being acquainted with Danny ten years ago, when they were both living at an orphanage. The district attorney explains that he at first was unaware of the fact that he had a daughter, since his first marriage was annulled. When the proprietor of the orphanage, Miss Templeton, contacted him, he took his unknown daughter home with him. In the end, Danny is convicted of murder, but Miss Templeton reveals to Danny that the district attorney is his father, and that Connie is someone else's daughter. Her reason for lying about this was that Connie at that time was in more need of help and support. Danny decides it is better to not tell Connie the truth, and asks Miss Templeton to keep the secret, while he goes off to serve his life sentence in prison.

The post-World War II comedy features an early supporting role for Monroe. It is one of the few films future Tonight Show host Jack Paar made prior to his television career, and the last film appearance by Fay, who had been a popular stage comedian in the 1920s and revived his career starring in the long- running Broadway comedy Harvey. It was also the last appearance by silent star Leatrice Joy. The film borrows its name from the song \\"Love Nest\\" with music by Louis Hirsch and lyrics by Otto A. Harbach. The song is sung by a chorus over the opening credits and was used as a theme song for The Burns and Allen Show on both radio and TV. Plot When serviceman and author Jim Scott (William Lundigan) returns from Paris to his hometown, New York City, he is flabbergasted to discover that his well-meaning but unrealistic wife Connie (June Haver) has invested his wages in a run-down apartment building. Despite Connie's hopes that being a landlord will give Jim time to write a novel, Jim realizes that the building will require much work and will barely give them enough income. Meanwhile, smooth-talking Charley Patterson (Frank Fay), a confidence man who romances and swindles wealthy widows, meets his neighbor in the building, gentle widow Eadie Gaynor (Leatrice Joy), and becomes enamoured of her even though she is poor. Then, Jim persuades Connie to rent the vacant apartment to his old Army buddy Bobbie. When Bobbie arrives, Connie is shocked to see that she is a stunning former WAC named Roberta Stevens (Marilyn Monroe). Later, an inspector from the Department of Housing and Building informs the Scotts that the exposed wiring in their building is a serious code violation, and that if it is not fixed within fifteen days, the building will be condemned. That night, Charley and Eadie announce their engagement, worrying Connie. Charley and Eadie leave the next day to be married, after which Jim learns that it will be so expensive to fix the wiring that he must sell the building. Jim and Connie have received no offers by the time Charley and Eadie return, and Charley lends Jim the $800 needed for the repairs. Jim still wants to sell, however, as he is convinced that the building will drive them deeper into debt. Connie and Jim argue about the building and Bobbie, of whom Connie is still jealous, and Jim storms out of their apartment to sleep in a hammock in the back yard. Jim ends up sleeping in Bobbie's empty apartment, as he knows that she is away on a modeling assignment, but the next morning, Bobbie returns home, and Connie mistakenly assumes that she and Jim have spent the night together. Connie's anger is deflected by a newspaper story concerning Mrs. Frazier, a woman she and Jim saw in a nightclub with Charley, who has been cheated by an \\"elderly Casanova\\" named Charley Price. Charley assures them that he truly loves Eadie and has now retired. Charley decides to leave and send for Eadie later, but the police arrive before he can escape. As he is being taken away, Charley reassures Eadie that she is the only woman he has ever loved. Charley, who insists on paying for his crimes by pleading guilty, arranges for Jim to get arrested for receiving the $800 from him, as it was part of the money he took from Mrs. Frazier. Jim is infuriated when he is thrown in a cell with Charley, but the older man explains that he needed time to tell Jim his life story so that he can write a book about him. Jim is released the next day and writes Charley's book, which becomes a best- seller. After eighteen months, Charley is released from prison and reunites with Eadie. Later, Jim and Connie, who have beautified the apartment building with Jim's royalties, watch with amusement as Eadie and Charley take their newly born twin daughters for a walk.  Cast  * June Haver as Connie Scott * William Lundigan as Jim Scott * Frank Fay as Charley Patterson * Marilyn Monroe as Roberta Stevens * Jack Paar as Ed Forbes * Leatrice Joy as Eadie Gaynor * Henry Kulky as George Thompson Critical response Variety said: :There are only a few fresh lines and situations in the script, and they are not enough to add any punch to a rather \\"dated\\" theme, no matter how hard the cast toppers try to keep the laughs going. ... Marilyn Monroe is tossed in to cause jealousy between the landlords... The Jules Buck production supervision is adequate for physical polish, but short on story and script guidance. Film Daily said: :Lightly skipping about in its treatment of G.I.'s postwar investment, engineered by his wife while he was overseas, in a rundown house in the Gramercy Park section of Manhattan, Love Nest is a mild variety of comedy which gets a considerable boost from the expert talents‚Äîin that line‚Äîof Frank Fay. Rarely seen, he registers here as a smoothie, glib and ultra sophisticated, handy with the correct word on the correct occasion. Leatrice Joy is also present in this number. She gives mature warmth to the proceedings. Marilyn Monroe has that other quality, while William Lundigan, an author, and June Haver play at being married and troubled with their creaky domicile.

In- holdings result from private ownership of lands predating the designation of the park or forest area, or the expansion of the park area to encompass the privately owned property. In the United States, the main causes of inholdings is that all of the Federal land-management agencies were formed over a century after the government sold and issued land grants to private citizens to fund the administration of the United States. When the park system was formed, many of these now-called \\"inholdings\\" had been in private ownership for generations and not available for sale when the park was formed. Over the last several decades, conservation groups have lobbied the United States Congress to acquire private residences especially within designated wilderness areas, either by direct purchase or via land exchange which trades the inholding for other federal lands located outside of national parks or wilderness areas. Rights and regulations Generally, owners of inholdings are allowed to use their properties in a manner similar to other private property owners in their state. However, they may be subject to additional federal and agency-specific regulations regarding access to their homes and use of their lands by their Federal agency neighbors. Under the Wilderness Act (1964), the designated area cannot include the privately owned property within the border. Under the Act, federal agencies have an obligation to provide property owners \\"adequate access\\" across public lands should their property lie within the designated wilderness boundary. As such, many public agencies have allowed limited use roads to be built in wilderness areas. Under the Eastern Wilderness Act, public agencies are allowed to seize wilderness inholdings if the owner of the inholding manages his land in a manner \\"incompatible with management of such area as wilderness\\".

The film stars Claudette Colbert, Macdonald Carey, Zachary Scott, Barbara Bates, and Marilyn Monroe. Plot Hugh (Macdonald Carey) and Miriam Halsworth (Claudette Colbert) are in the final stages of their divorce procedure. Miriam wants to separate because he's addicted to gambling - although he often wins. She's living with her daughter Barbara (Barbara Bates), her son-in-law Jerry Denham (Robert Wagner) and her little grandchild. Hugh, who's living at the hotel where he works, makes a fuss with the gardener about his rosebushes. Hugh is also Jerry's boss. They work in the publicity department for the Miramar Hotel and have to follow Victor Macfarland (Zachary Scott), a self-made millionaire who's trying to get on the financial advisory committee for the President. Twenty years ago Hugh and Victor were rivals for Miriam's hand. A blonde fortune hunter, Joyce Mannering (Marilyn Monroe), is trying to attract Victor, but he's only interested in winning back Miriam. She accepts his marriage proposal, but is disappointed when he postpones the marriage for a hearing on his appointment in Washington. Just before he steps on the plane he explains to Miriam why he left her twenty years ago (but the audience can't hear what he says because the plane makes too much noise). Miriam is furious with Hugh but he doesn't know why. She refuses to let him in, which leads to a comical intermezzo in which Hugh and Jerry are arrested by the police. They are identified by Miriam and Barbara, and leave the police station. Back home Miriam explains to Hugh that she was so angry because Victor told her that twenty years ago Hugh won her hand in a game of craps. Hugh admits this, and still has those two dice with him. He asks her to throw. It turns out the dice were loaded; they always throw three and four. Hugh admits he cheated because the stake was so high. Miriam is pleased with this explanation and they reconcile.

Let's Make It Legal is a valiant effort by Claudette Colbert, who cannot overcome the handicaps.\\" The New York Daily News stated: : \\"The Roxy's Let's Make It Legal is an inconsistent farce that luckily has sufficient saving graces, the predominating benefit being performances by the popular and comedy-wise co- stars, Claudette Colbert and Macdonald Carey.

When Johnny's physician, Dr. George Esmond, tells him that his hand is now vulnerable to permanent injury, Johnny asks the doctor to keep his condition a secret. After telling Pat and some reporters that his hand is merely bruised, Johnny returns to his training camp. A short time later, Johnny receives word that his trouble-prone cousin, Luis, is in jail again and needs two hundred dollars for bail. The news reminds Johnny that Luis, who is also a Mexican immigrant, has not had the same opportunities that he has had to lift himself out of poverty. Believing that his hand injury may end his boxing career at any moment, Johnny decides to sign a lucrative contract with Goff, who has promised to provide him with a guaranteed income from promotional sales after his retirement. Johnny takes Rick to visit his mother (Mimi Aguglia), but soon after they arrive, Johnny tells his sister Marina that she must stop dating her boyfriend, Bob, because he is a \\"gringo.\\" Johnny also tells Marina that Bob is interested in her only because she is the sister of a famous fighter. When Rick accuses Johnny of harboring a prejudice against whites, Johnny sends him away with an insult. Later, Pat, expecting a marriage proposal from Johnny, is disappointed when Johnny tells her that he has decided to sign with Goff. Sean dies a short time later, and Pat accuses Johnny of killing her father with his act of betrayal. Realizing that he has nearly lost Pat's love and Rick's friendship as a result of his actions, Johnny decides to get out of boxing forever by purposely losing the upcoming title match against Al Heldon. Though he loses the match, Johnny does not cause permanent injury to his hand until he punches Rick for being honest with him. With help from Rick, Pat and Johnny reconcile and look forward to a happy future together. Cast *June Allyson ... Pat O'Malley *Dick Powell ... Rick Garvey *Ricardo Montalban ...

Fusion proteins or chimeric (kƒ´-Ààmir-ik) proteins (literally, made of parts from different sources) are proteins created through the joining of two or more genes that originally coded for separate proteins. Translation of this fusion gene results in a single or multiple polypeptides with functional properties derived from each of the original proteins. Recombinant fusion proteins are created artificially by recombinant DNA technology for use in biological research or therapeutics. Chimeric or chimera usually designate hybrid proteins made of polypeptides having different functions or physico-chemical patterns. Chimeric mutant proteins occur naturally when a complex mutation, such as a chromosomal translocation, tandem duplication, or retrotransposition creates a novel coding sequence containing parts of the coding sequences from two different genes. Naturally occurring fusion proteins are commonly found in cancer cells, where they may function as oncoproteins. The bcr-abl fusion protein is a well- known example of an oncogenic fusion protein, and is considered to be the primary oncogenic driver of chronic myelogenous leukemia. Functions Some fusion proteins combine whole peptides and therefore contain all functional domains of the original proteins. However, other fusion proteins, especially those that occur naturally, combine only portions of coding sequences and therefore do not maintain the original functions of the parental genes that formed them. Many whole gene fusions are fully functional and can still act to replace the original peptides. Some, however, experience interactions between the two proteins that can modify their functions. Beyond these effects, some gene fusions may cause regulatory changes that alter when and where these genes act. For partial gene fusions, the shuffling of different active sites and binding domains have the potential to result in new proteins with novel functions. Green Fluorescent Protein (GFP) inserted into the neurons of Varbuss worms to track neuronal development. = Fluorescent Protein Tags = The fusion of fluorescent tags to proteins in a host cell is a widely popular technique used in experimental cell and biology research in order to track protein interactions in real time. The first fluorescent tag, green fluorescent protein (GFP), was isolated from Aequorea Victoria and is still used frequently in modern research. More recent derivations include photoconvertible fluorescent proteins (PCFPs), which were first isolated from Anthozoa. The most commonly used PCFP is the Kaede fluorescent tag, but the development of Kikume green-red (KikGR) in 2005 offers a brighter signal and more efficient photoconversion. The advantage of using PCFP fluorescent tags is the ability to track the interaction of overlapping biochemical pathways in real time. The tag will change color from green to red once the protein reaches a point of interest in the pathway, and the alternate colored protein can be monitored through the duration of pathway. This technique is especially useful when studying G-protein coupled receptor (GPCR) recycling pathways. The fates of recycled G-protein receptors may either be sent to the plasma membrane to be recycled, marked by a green fluorescent tag, or may be sent to a lysosome for degradation, marked by a red fluorescent tag. =Chimeric Protein Drugs= Sketches of mouse (top-left), chimeric (top-right) and humanized (bottom-left) monoclonal antibodies. Human parts are shown in brown, and non-human parts in blue. The purpose of creating fusion proteins in drug development is to impart properties from each of the \\"parent\\" proteins to the resulting chimeric protein. Several chimeric protein drugs are currently available for medical use. Many chimeric protein drugs are monoclonal antibodies whose specificity for a target molecule was developed using mice and hence were initially \\"mouse\\" antibodies. As non-human proteins, mouse antibodies tend to evoke an immune reaction if administered to humans. The chimerization process involves engineering the replacement of segments of the antibody molecule that distinguish it from a human antibody. For example, human constant domains can be introduced, thereby eliminating most of the potentially immunogenic portions of the drug without altering its specificity for the intended therapeutic target. Antibody nomenclature indicates this type of modification by inserting -xi- into the non-proprietary name (e.g., abci- xi-mab). If parts of the variable domains are also replaced by human portions, humanized antibodies are obtained. Although not conceptually distinct from chimeras, this type is indicated using -zu- such as in dacli-zu-mab. See the list of monoclonal antibodies for more examples. In addition to chimeric and humanized antibodies, there are other pharmaceutical purposes for the creation of chimeric constructs. Etanercept, for example, is a TNFŒ± blocker created through the combination of a tumor necrosis factor receptor (TNFR) with the immunoglobulin G1 Fc segment. TNFR provides specificity for the drug target and the antibody Fc segment is believed to add stability and deliverability of the drug. Additional chimeric proteins used for therapeutic applications include: * Aflibercept: A human recombinant protein that aids in the treatment of oxaliplatin-resistant metastatic colorectal cancer, neo-vascular macular degeneration, and macular edema. * Rilonacept: Reduces inflammation by preventing activation of IL-1 receptors to treat cryopyrin-associated periodic syndromes (CAPS). * Alefacept: Regulated T-cell responses by selectively targeting effector memory T-cells to treat psoriasis vulgaris. * Romiplostim: A peptibody that treats immune thrombocytopenia. * Abatacept/Belatacept: Interferes with T-cell co-stimulation to treat autoimmune disorders like rheumatoid arthritis, psoriatic arthritis, and psoriasis. * Denileukin- diftitox: Treats cutaneous lymphoma. Recombinant technology Fusion of two genes (BCR-ABL) to encode a recombinant oncogenic protein. A recombinant fusion protein is a protein created through genetic engineering of a fusion gene. This typically involves removing the stop codon from a cDNA sequence coding for the first protein, then appending the cDNA sequence of the second protein in frame through ligation or overlap extension PCR. That DNA sequence will then be expressed by a cell as a single protein. The protein can be engineered to include the full sequence of both original proteins, or only a portion of either. If the two entities are proteins, often linker (or \\"spacer\\") peptides are also added, which make it more likely that the proteins fold independently and behave as expected. Especially in the case where the linkers enable protein purification, linkers in protein or peptide fusions are sometimes engineered with cleavage sites for proteases or chemical agents that enable the liberation of the two separate proteins. This technique is often used for identification and purification of proteins, by fusing a GST protein, FLAG peptide, or a hexa-his peptide (6xHis-tag), which can be isolated using affinity chromatography with nickel or cobalt resins. Di- or multimeric chimeric proteins can be manufactured through genetic engineering by fusion to the original proteins of peptide domains that induce artificial protein di- or multimerization (e.g., streptavidin or leucine zippers). Fusion proteins can also be manufactured with toxins or antibodies attached to them in order to study disease development. Hydrogenase promoter, PSH, was studied constructing a PSH promoter-gfp fusion by using green fluorescent protein (gfp) reporter gene. = Recombinant functionality = Novel recombinant technologies have made it possible to improve fusion protein design for use in fields as diverse as biodetection, paper and food industries, and biopharmaceuticals. Recent improvements have involved the fusion of single peptides or protein fragments to regions of existing proteins, such as N and C termini, and are known to increase the following properties: * Catalytic efficiency: Fusion of certain peptides allow for greater catalytic efficiency by altering the tertiary and quaternary structure of the target protein. * Solubility: A common challenge in fusion protein design is the issue of insolubility of newly synthesized fusion proteins in the recombinant host, leading to an over-aggregation of the target protein in the cell. Molecular chaperones that are able to aid in protein folding may be added, thereby better segregating hydrophobic and hydrophilic interactions in the solute to increase protein solubility. * Thermostability: Singular peptides or protein fragments are typically added to reduce flexibility of either the N or C terminus of the target protein, which reinforces thermostability and stabilizes pH range. * Enzyme activity: Fusion that involves the introduction of hydrogen bonds may be used to expand overall enzyme activity. * Expression levels: Addition of numerous fusion fragments, such as maltose binding protein (MBP) or small ubiquitin-like molecule (SUMO), serve to enhance enzyme expression and secretion of the target protein. * Immobilization: PHA synthase, an enzyme that allows for the immobilization of proteins of interest, is an important fusion tag in industrial research. * Crystal quality: Crystal quality can be improved by adding covalent links between proteins, aiding in structure determination techniques.  Recombinant Protein Design  The earliest applications of recombinant protein design can be documented in the use of single peptide tags for purification of proteins in affinity chromatography. Since then, a variety of fusion protein design techniques have been developed for applications as diverse as fluorescent protein tags to recombinant fusion protein drugs. Three commonly used design techniques include tandem fusion, domain insertion, and post-translational conjugation. = Tandem fusion = The proteins of interest are simply connected end-to-end via fusion of N or C termini between the proteins. This provides a flexible bridge structure allowing enough space between fusion partners to ensure proper folding. However, the N or C termini of the peptide are often crucial components in obtaining the desired folding pattern for the recombinant protein, making simple end-to-end conjoining of domains ineffective in this case. For this reason, a protein linker is often needed to maintain the functionality of the protein domains of interest. = Domain insertion = This technique involves the fusion of consecutive protein domains by encoding desired structures into a single polypeptide chain, but sometimes may require insertion of a domain within another domain. This technique is typically regarding as more difficult to carry out than tandem fusion, due to difficulty finding an appropriate ligation site in the gene of interest. = Post-translational Conjugation = This technique fuses protein domains following ribosomal translation of the proteins of interest, in contrast to genetic fusion prior to translation used in other recombinant technologies. = Protein Linkers = A protein used as a linker in fusion protein design. Protein linkers aid fusion protein design by providing appropriate spacing between domains, supporting correct protein folding in the case that N or C termini interactions are crucial to folding. Commonly, protein linkers permit important domain interactions, reinforce stability, and reduce steric hindrance, making them preferred for use in fusion protein design even when N and C termini can be fused. Three major types of linkers are flexible, rigid, and in vivo cleavable. * Flexible linkers may consist of many small glycine residues, giving them the ability curl into a dynamic, adaptable shape. * Rigid linkers may be formed of large, cyclic proline residues, which can be helpful when highly specific spacing between domains must be maintained. * In vivo cleavable linkers are unique in that they are designed to allow the release of one or more fused domains under certain reaction conditions, such as a specific pH gradient, or when coming in contact with another biomolecule in the cell. Natural occurrence Naturally occurring fusion genes are most commonly created when a chromosomal translocation replaces the terminal exons of one gene with intact exons from a second gene. This creates a single gene that can be transcribed, spliced, and translated to produce a functional fusion protein. Many important cancer- promoting oncogenes are fusion genes produced in this way. Examples include: * Gag-onc fusion protein * Bcr-abl fusion protein * Tpr-met fusion protein Antibodies are fusion proteins produced by V(D)J recombination. There are also rare examples of naturally occurring polypeptides that appear to be a fusion of two clearly defined modules, in which each module displays its characteristic activity or function, independent of the other. Two major examples are: double PP2C chimera in Plasmodium falciparum (the malaria parasite), in which each PP2C module exhibits protein phosphatase 2C enzymatic activity, and the dual-family immunophilins that occur in a number of unicellular organisms (such as protozoan parasites and Flavobacteria) and contain full-length Cyclophilin and FKBP chaperone modules. The evolutionary origin of such chimera remains unclear.

They write and perform comedy and drama work, both for the stage and film.  History  In May 2002, Gill Adams, a Hull-born playwright, used her column in the Hull Daily Mail to advertise for men to join a series of writing workshops funded by the Gulbenkian Foundation.Hull Daily Mail 20 May 2002. The project was actually part of the BBC‚Äôs Northern Exposure ‚ÄòWriting in the Margins‚Äô initiative, spearheaded by the Corporation's then creative director of new writing, Kate Rowland. Adams led the workshops for a year with exercises, discussions and readings, and it was she who coined the group's title. The term ‚ÄòBlokes‚Äô was certainly being used by the time the group featured in Ariel in December 2002.Ariel (BBC staff magazine) 10 December 2002. In April 2003, the focus of the project ‚Äì King of the Road, a six-part serial telling of the comings and goings of a local (fictional) taxi firm ‚Äì received its first public reading in the Haworth Arms on Hull's Beverley Road. Gill Adams‚Äô contract with the BBC ended in the same month. The Blokes, however, had achieved a level of self- determination and success and decided to continue. They applied for and were awarded City Arts funding which enabled them to take part in Humber Mouth, the annual Hull Literature Festival. Their first ‚Äòindependent‚Äô show was Counter Act, an evening of eight short plays performed at the Dorchester Hotel, Hull, on 13 November 2003. The group has continued, in subsequent years, to make regular contributions to Humber Mouth.Humber Mouth ‚Äì Hull Literature Festival (Kingston upon Hull City Council) ‚Äì programmes for 2003, 2004, 2005, 2006. King of the Road was eventually broadcast on BBC Radio Humberside in March 2004.Programme Information (BBC Radio) March 2004.  Present day  The Hull Blokes have continued to write and present comedy, drama and monologues not only for Humber Mouth but also as self-sufficient, self-supporting productions. Since 2005 their live performances have been staged at the Northern Academy of Performing Arts in Hull, and clips of their work, comprising extracts from the stage shows and stand-alone short films, have been made available on the internet. Some of the writers are also performers and appear in their own and others‚Äô pieces. Other personnel have been recruited for particular qualities or talents, and the need became apparent for a title which would include the whole company. Following the show of the same name, the term ‚ÄòNorthern Conspiracy‚Äô has been used informally since 2005 to refer to associates of the group whose contribution is unwritten but nevertheless crucial. The Blokes are supported by the Arts Council, who have provided funding for the purchase of equipment used in the recording and projection of filmed pieces. The application necessitated the formalisation of the group's affairs, and a written constitution was adopted in February 2006.

He hailed from the family of land-less smaller nobility and was the son of Collegiate Secretary.His father occupied the position of section head in uyezd office of gendarmerie (). He was the author of more than 150 works on the history of Kievan Rus', Muscovy, 19th-century Russia, Lithuania and Belarus, on the social-political movement, peasants' question and the ethnography of Belarus.Including more than 30 works on ethography and folklore of Belarus. Author of writings on ethnography (since 1883), head of extensive ethnographical expedition in Minsk and Grodno gubernias (1890‚Äì1891). Notably, the majority of his works were of a scientific-analytical nature. He extensively sourced his works on the materials from more than 20 archives in Moscow, Saint Petersburg, Kiev, Vilna, Warsaw, Cracow, Lviv, Kostroma, Yaroslavl', Novgorod, Nyasvizh etc. Many of his works remain unpublished. He was awarded the Order of Saint Vladimir 4th grade (April 1916) for his scientific work. Biography An alumnus of the historical-philological faculty of Kiev University (1893), he wrote a magister dissertation on history in Fall 1901 and a doctoral dissertation on history in 1906. He became Professor at Moscow University (1899) and professor of Russian history at Kiev University in 1902. He was the organiser and director of the Higher Commercial CoursesKiev Commercial Institute since 1909. (Kiev, 1906), one of the organizers and the first head of the South-Western Branch of the Russian Exports Chamber (1912), and head of several popular-scientific circles and societies in Kiev. After a conflict with students of Kiev Commercial Institute (1917) and the \\"Case of Stashevskiy\\" (1917),Stashevskiy was his pupil and was involved in stealing of archive documents. Dovnar-Zapol'skiy resigned from almost all professorial work. He then became professor at the Kharkiv Institute of People's Economy in December 1919 and at Kharkiv University in 1920, remaining there until 1921. He was also pro-rector of Azerbaijan University and professor of the Baku Polytechnical Institute from 1922 to 1925. Following that he was professor of Belarusian history at the Belarusian State University from October 1925 to Fall 1926, creating the Archeographical Commission of Inbelkult together with Dovgyallo in 1925. After the forced move to Moscow in the fall of 1926, he frequently had to seek occupation outside the field of science. He was professor at Timiryazev Academy in the 1930s. In the 1920s and 1930s, he occupied several management positions in the system of management of the economy in Soviet Ukraine, Azerbaijan, Belarus and Russia. In politics He participated in then-illegal movements of the 1880s and was temporary banned to settle in Kiev. Later, he sympathised with left movements. Dovnar-Zapol'skiy actively supported the Belarusian People's Republic (BPR), headed the Belarusian Chamber of Commerce in Kiev in 1918 (confirmed by the Belarus People's Secretariat on 24 April 1918),Babushka with a red wagon and prepared the project of the creation of the Belarusian University in Minsk at the end of March 1918. From May to October 1918, he participated in the work of the BPR's diplomatic mission in Kiev, which sought the recognition of the BPR from representatives of Soviet Russia, Ukraine, Don, Germany and Austro- Hungary. At the request of the BPR's authorities, he prepared the notable informational \\"Memorandum\\" (\\"Foundations of statehood of Belarus\\"), published in Grodno and Vilna in 1919 in Belarusian, Russian, Polish, German and French languages; also translated to English by P. Clark. This Memorandum contained the historical ground for the necessity of creation of independent Belarusian state and was presented at the Versailles conference by the BPR's delegation, albeit without positive outcome. His two sons perished in the ranks of Red Army during the Russian Civil War. His printed but unpublished book \\"History of Belarus\\" caused uprage among the Belarusian political authorities (beg. 1926), was denounced as a \\"Cathechism of Belarusian National Democratism\\",Karaw 1994, p.15. and was subsequently banned; the manuscript was confiscated.By the resolution of the special closed meeting of the Bureau of the Central Committee of Communist Party (Bolshevik) of Belarus (28 January 1926). Karaw 1994, pp.14‚Äì15. Consequently, Dovnar-Zapol'skiy was forced to move to Moscow, effectively exiled (Fall 1926), and never after returned to Belarus. From 1930 to 1934, he was heavily criticised for the alleged \\"Neo- Narodnichestvo\\", attributed the authorship of the ideological basis of \\"National Democratism\\", equated to the \\"agents of fascism\\" by acad. V.K. Shcherbakov, politically denounced together with his scientific school by his former pupil prof. A.P. Ogloblin (Kiev, 1934).It's believed that it was this former pupil memorandum that provoked the fatal stenocardia attack. In science Pupil of professors Golubovskiy, Ikonnikov, and especially V.B. Antonovich, he sought to emulate the combination of scientific and educational activities, as manifested by P. Shafarik, V. Karajic, and N.I. Kostomarov. He denounced the view of Belarusians as being devoid of nationality, and was a decided promoter and supporter of Belarusian national revival in the beginning of the 20th century. Dovnar-Zapol'skiy greeted the emergence of the \\"strictly objective and scientific\\" trend in Belarusian historical and ethnographical research. He showed general sympathy with Marxist theory but wasn't awed by it. =Historical concepts= Dovnar-Zapol'skiy promoted the concept of primacy of the history of people over the history of states and considered ethnography and economics to be highly important, if not chief factors, in studying the history of society. As part of his research into Belarusian history, he postulated the existence of Belarusian nationality with its own history, distinct ethnographical features, rich folk culture, with Belarusian language being heir of the speech of the Krivichi and the Dregovichs. He supported \\"colonisational theory\\" of emergence of state in Belarus, and considered Krivichi and Dregovichs largely to be isolated from Ancient Rus' state and therefore evolving differently. Dovnar-Zapol'skiy also postulated the absence of ethnographical unity in Ancient Rus' state, with external political and military affairs being the only binding factors in it. He viewed the creation of Great Duchy of Lithuania and Rus' in the 13th century as partially peacefully created and mutually beneficial union between the princes of weakened Rus' and militant Lithuanian princes. He also considered both the Lublin Union and Church Union to have been negative factors in Belarusian history, claiming they promote religious intolerance. He also disapproved of the incorporation of Belarusian land into Russia after the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth partitions. Generally, he considered \\"two evils\\" to have influenced Belarusian history negatively: the Polish \\"szlachta aristocratical republic\\" and the Russian \\"boyar oligarchy\\". He disapproved of both, as these excluded demos, being therefore perilous to the Belarusian people who are \\"highly democratic in their historical and folk traditions\\". Later in the 1920s, the historian further emphasised the economical factor in history and the significance of class struggle in the history of the Great Duchy. Viewed by others His person and works attracted all sorts of polarized opinions. Up to the 1930s, he was regarded generally positively by M.K. Lyubavskiy, V.I. Picheto, F.F. Turuk, D.I. Dovgyallo and others.Karaw 1994, p.5. Beginning in the 1930s, he fell under stigmatizing critique and denunciation as a scientist by S.Ya. Vol'fson, V.M. Pertsev, V.K. Shcherbakov and others. In the 1940s‚Äî1970s, comparatively \\"safe to touch\\" parts of his works (ethnographical, archeological, archeographical) were being explored and built upon by V.K. Bandarchyk, M.F. Pilipyenka, I.U. Chakvin, M.M. Ulashchyk, L.V. Alyaksyeyew). Historical part of his work remained visible as scarce references up to the mid-1980s. Attempts at estimating him as a historian were made in monographies of U.M. Mikhnyuk, Z.Yu. Kapyski, V.U. Chapko. In the 1990s, there appeared works researching the generalised scientific position of Dovnar-Zapol'skiy (S.I. Mikhal'chanka), the evolution of historical concept (Dz.U. Karaw, M.F. Shumyeyka). John Leslie Howard Keep and Alter L.

Early life Ramzy was born Ramzy Mahmud Bayumi in 1930 to Dr Mahmud Bayumi, an Egyptian orthopedist and university professor father, and Helen Mackay, a young Scottish lady. Ramzy graduated from Alexandria's Victoria College where he met someone by the name of Michel Dimitri Challhoub who later on was known as Omar Sharif, they became friends since then. After finishing his school, Ramzy joined the Medical school for 3 years, before transferring to the Faculty of Commerce, which he eventually dropped to pursue his career in acting. Ramzy has one brother, Dr. Hassan Bayoumi, who followed in their father's footsteps and has his practice in London. Career Ahmad Ramzy was discovered by Helmy Halim in 15-2-1955, while playing snooker in a club. He was cast by Halim in his first role, as \\"Ramzy\\" in Ayyamna al-Holwa (Our Best Days), along with Faten Hamama, Abdel Halim Hafez, and his lifelong friend and schoolmate Omar Sharif, The film was a box office hit. In this film he also starred the first time with very close lifetime friend Abdel Halim Hafez. Next year 1956 saw Ramzy's first starring role in Hob wa Dumoo\` (Love and Tears) with Faten Hamama. The late 1950s were very good to Ramzy, as he participated in many movies and was highly famous for the role of the funny playboy and romantic womanizer, while the 1960s begun, new young actors begun to appear taking more roles of those that Ramzy was playing but that did not stop him from going his way. By the early 1960s, making films with more than one leading star was in favor, Ramzy teamed up with other stars or younger actors like Hassan Youseff, Youssef Fakhr Eddine, Mohamed Awad and others in a film and the fashion of trio stars films begun with titles like The 3 wild ones, The 3 adventures and more which lasted to early 1970s.

Ramzy's active years began to be fade due to age and cinema changing moods, his 1974 film Al Abtal (The Heroes) that co- starred Farid Shawki was notable for the fact it was Egypt's first martial arts film and used the soundtrack of Bruce Lee's Enter the Dragon. By mid 1970s Ramzy was saying goodbye to the cinema as from 1979-1981 saw only two films, then he focused on his trading business, though he was convinced to make a comeback in 1999 in the film \\" Ket El Saharaa (Desert Cat) followed by a TV series Wajh al-Qamar (Face of the Moon) with Faten Hamama in 2001.

The series is set in Tranquility, a fictional town in Oregon, which is home to retired superheroes and supervillains (known colloquially as \\"Maxis\\") as well as their families. This town coexists with the existing Wildstorm Universe, with frequent references to its heroes, such as The Authority and Gen¬π¬≥. Publication history The ongoing series start in December 2006. A new story arc started in issue #7. Like Stormwatch: Post Human Division, the series stopped at issue #12 and it then appeared as part of the Christos Gage-written \\"Wildstorm: Armageddon\\" crossover storyline, with artist Horacio Domingues. Unlike Stormwatch: PHD, and other titles involved in that story, it was not one of those that has been announced as restarting in 2008 with World's End. However, Wildstorm editor Ben Abernathy has said Welcome to Tranquility would return in a six-issue limited series, entitled Welcome to Tranquility: One Foot in the Grave, with Simone returning to write it and Domingues staying on to provide the art.Wild at Heart: Ben Abernathy, Newsarama, May 19, 2008 Major characters Sheriff Thomasina \\"Tommy\\" Lindo - Sheriff Lindo, or \\"Tommy\\", is the town's sheriff. Her main duties seem to consist of keeping peace when old rivalries flare up or when the more unbalanced inhabitants, such as Minxy Minerva, cause trouble. Rather than use swear words, she frequently uses euphemisms such as \\"doody\\", \\"dang\\", and \\"poop\\". Sheriff Lindo is the granddaughter of a Maxi hero known as The Black Glider, and the sister of Seresa Lindo, local pilot and assistant to Minxy Minerva. Romantically, she has been linked to deceased maxihero Mr. Articulate, who she freely admits to sleeping with after a stay in the hospital, during which he provided her with companionship. While Sheriff Lindo has been shown to have a quick temper, she is also an extremely courageous and compassionate person, placing herself in the line of danger to protect others, and showing more patience with the inhabitants of the town than almost anyone. To this end she uses a special energy-augmented baton made by Doc Tomorrow. Colonel Isaac Cragg - Former member of the Liberty Squad, Colonel Cragg is the only man to serve in 3 branches of the U.S. Military simultaneously (Air Force, Navy and the Army) and holds the record for most enemy planes shot down in a career. He bears a scar across the left side of his face, and a blinded left eye, from a fight with Nazi Giant during his former military days. His combat and piloting abilities are more than likely superhuman in nature, given his record-breaking service record, coupled with the fact that some portion of said record was obtained with the limited depth perception of having only one eye. Colonel Cragg is known to have fought in World War II, but it is not known how far his service extended past the war's resolution. Colonel Cragg is usually seen with his assistant Bad Dogg. Cragg was also a pallbearer at Mr. Articulate's funeral, implying that the two were probably friends. Cragg has demonstrated difficulty adjusting to the modern era's political correctness. Deputy Presley Duray - Former sheriff of Tranquility and currently a deputy for Sheriff Lindo. Presley lost his position as sheriff after a case in which a murder suspect in his custody committed suicide in his cell after an intense interrogation. After the suspect was found to be innocent and the real killer being caught the next day, with pictures of the murder found on his person, Presley was presumably fired or asked to resign. The guilt and shame from this event was discovered and thwarted by the newly appointed Sheriff Lindo, who deputized him. Bad Dog - Bad Dog (real name unknown) was Colonel Cragg's topkick during their military service, and served with him on the Liberty Squad. He constantly wears a collar around his neck. He possesses superhuman \\"toughness,\\" which likely consists of enhanced strength and endurance. He served as a pallbearer for Mr. Articulate, although he had a mild dislike for Mr. Articulate, due to his intelligence and expansive vocabulary. As this suggests, Bad Dog is known for having a temper, and has sometimes been shown to enter an almost feral mental state. Emoticon - Real name unknown, Emoticon is a local teenager and grandson of a villain (and presumed Maxi) known as The Typist, and causes trouble for the citizens of Tranquility. He is disrespectful to most elders in the town. Emoticon dresses in a flashy style, including a fur coat, several necklaces and assorted other jewellery. His most distinctive feature, however, is a mask he wears, which covers his entire face. The mask displays his current emotions via a LCD screen, which expresses said emotion as a text \\"smiley\\". This mask apparently translates Emoticon's true feelings at the given moment and does not allow any attempts at concealment (effectively rendering him unable to lie.) Emoticon also speaks in netspeak, saying \\"lol\\" rather than actually laughing, and saying \\"All caps!\\" before yelling. Currently, Emoticon is being held on charges of being an accessory to Mr. Articulate's murder and possibly on the charge of assaulting a police officer. Emoticons face is horribly disfigured and without his mask he cannot see, the mask itself has a pair of replacement eyeballs for him, apparently a \\"gift\\" from the Typist himself who blinded and disfigured him as a way to bring a bit of \\"tragedy\\" in his secret origins. As an act of kindness, Sheriff Lindo allowed him to keep wearing his mask even after his incarceration so as to spare him the shame and fear of being imprisoned without it. Mayor Alex Fury - Alex Fury, formerly a Maxi Hero known as \\"Judge Fury\\" and Liberty Squad leader, is the mayor of Tranquility and husband of former actress/Maxi Hero Suzy Fury, also known as The Pink Bunny. Mayor Fury's top priority is giving former heroes and villains alike a place to live out their golden years in peace and keeping the town running smoothly. He seems well-equipped to this end, having seemingly limitless reservoirs of patience and diplomacy, having only lost his temper once. Fury's known powers are superior combat ability, enhanced strength and near-invulnerability. As Judge Fury, he wore a black mask somewhat in the style of an executioner's mask,as well as a white suit with a black shirt and white tie. As Tranquility's mayor, he us usually seen in a similar suit, but with a smaller mask that only covers his face from just above his eyes to the bottom of his nose. Suzy Fury - A former actress, pin-up model and superheroine, Suzy Fury (maiden name unknown) was the Liberty Squad's \\"secretary\\" (an obvious poke at Wonder Woman's position in the Justice Society) under the Maxi name Pink Bunny. At some point in the past she married Judge Fury, and currently resides with him in Tranquility, where she runs a restaurant known as the Chik'n Go. She employs Leona Terrell as a waitress, and considers her to be like a daughter. Her only known Maxi power is that of enhanced strength (it has been claimed that she can throw a tank), though she may have some sort of attraction-based power, given the theme of her Maxi persona. Suzy was apparently given her powers in a super-soldier project headed by the O.S.U. This also created her arch rival: Rosario Munez, also known as \\"Hellkitten\\". Dr. Rachel Steel - Rachel Steel is the town doctor, and a Maxi. Her powers seem linked to perception, giving her the ability to see through objects and to enhance her eyesight to see small details. These powers are precise enough to allow her to perform a complete murder autopsy without making a single incision, or even touching the body. Use of this power causes her eyes to glow, and seems to cause her enough pain to require the use of marijuana. She is not the highest ranking doctor in Tranquility, but is apparently the only one with powers.  Minor characters  Acolyte - A World War II-era Maxi who possesses healing powers that she believes were given to her by God. Has her own line of \\"ouchless\\" bandages, and presumably other medical supplies. Captain Cobra - Maxi resident of Tranquility (real name unknown) and sworn \\"Enemies to the DEATH!\\" with fellow Maxi and next-door neighbor, Mongoose Man. He has threatened to kill Mongoose Man for taking back apples from Mongoose Man's tree that fell on his side of the fence on more than one occasion. This argument has apparently progressed to the point where Deputy Troy expresses annoyance in being there again, and Sheriff Lindo has threatened to cut down the disputed tree. Cedric - Collette Pearson's camera man. Has been assaulted and presumably murdered by an unknown assailant for his refusal to provide said assailant with the location of his boss, Collette. Henry Hyde - Former nemesis of Maximum Man, Henry (Maxi name \\"Henry Hate\\") has since reformed. He has a twin brother, and was considered the foremost inventor of his time. He created a HATE Bomb which destroyed only living people, yet left material possessions and buildings untouched; it was this threat that brought people to Tranquility in the first place. Seresa Lindo - Minxy Minerva's assistant and sister of Sheriff Lindo. Lisa - The town dispatch officer. She has a daughter and apparently no super powers. Minxy Minerva - Former child aviatrix and aeronautics engineer. Currently a resident of Tranquility. Despite her severe dementia (possibly caused by Alzheimer's Disease) she still has powerful friends in top positions in the U.S. Government because her plane designs are credited with a large part of the Allied victory in World War II. Minxy continues building and flying airplanes, which usually results in spectacular crashes. Lindo has sought to revoke her license, or equipment, but Fury has vetoed this. Mongoose Man - Real name unknown, Maxi resident of Tranquility and sworn \\"Enemies to the DEATH!\\" with fellow Maxi and next-door neighbor, Captain Cobra. Mongoose Man owns an apple tree, but takes back any apples that land on Captain Cobra's side of the fence between their houses. This argument has apparently progressed to the point where Deputy Troy expresses annoyance in being there again, and Sheriff Lindo has threatened to cut down the disputed tree. Sampson Twins - Obnoxious Maxi twins who presumably (due to their comically large physiques) have enhanced strength. After the death of Mr. Articulate they were arrested for starting a bar brawl by insulting him. One twin speaks in classical English while the other speaks in a drawl with bad grammar and slang. Slapjack - Slapjack (real name unknown, presumed last name \\"Terrell\\") is the father or father-in-law of Deena Terrell, and grandfather to Leona Terell. His only demonstrated power is being a speedster. Arnold Stipple - Arnold Stipple, better known under his Maxi name of Cosmos, was a member of the Liberty Squad. Though acquitted, he is considered to have betrayed the Liberty Squad to a villain known as Were- Lizard, which resulted in the death of Earth's greatest hero, Astral Man. This leads to his home in Tranquility being vandalized quite often. Due to his status as a pariah, Arnold lives alone, save for several cats. Deena Terrell - Daughter or daughter-in-law of Slapjack, and mother of Leona Terrell. Deena is a Christian Fundamentalist who is known for her abrasive personality. Kevin Trueblood - Former member of the Liberty Squad, under the Maxi name of Maximum Man (possibly the origin of the term.) An homage to Captain Marvel, Kyle was a timid accountant until he spoke a secret word which granted him the power of \\"Indian Fakirs\\", transforming him into a Maxi with enhanced strength, invulnerability and the power of flight. In his old age, Kyle has forgotten the word. As of the fifth issue, Kyle has found out the word, which is \\"Hecatean\\". Deputy Troy Veron - One of Sheriff Lindo's deputies. Zeke - An undead Maxi, whose status as a hero or villain is unknown. Zeke's \\"death\\" occurred some time in the 1960s. Zeke runs (and presumably named) Gate to the Underworld, the local cemetery and presumably the mortuary. A struggling popstar, an Elvis wannabe, he bargained with a demon for eternal youngness and everlasting life, in exchange for \\"looking on a little property\\", supposed to be the Gate to the Underworld. However, as Ezekiel repented and tried to escape, the demon badly disfigured him, thus ending his popstar career, but without taking his immortality, leaving him to be as a half-rotted corpse for eternity. He is seldom seen without his pet snake Hamnet, who is generally wrapped around his arm, and whom he talks to when no one is around.  Liberty Snots  Former child stars who have grown up and become a Goth band after recruiting additional members, the Liberty Snots are generally considered bratty kids. There are two main characters, Kevin and Leona. The original members were once the \\"Tranquili-teens\\", who solved mysteries on a Saturday morning children's show. Kevin Emils - Kevin, who prefers to be called \\"Sweet Sally\\" at all times, is the front man for the Liberty Snots. He possesses the ability to channel sound into forceful attacks.. He is the presumed father of his girlfriend, Leona Terrell's child. He is Kyle Truegood's godson, and is dating Leona. He hates being called Kevin and will always insist forcefully that his name is Sally. Leona Terrell - Leona, who has taken the stage name of \\"Ajita\\", inherited her powers as a speedster from her grandfather, Slapjack. Leona is pregnant with Kevin's daughter. She works as a waitress at the Chick'n Go. Her mother is extremely controlling of her life. Leona has been attempting to pursue an acting career since the Tranquiliteens was cancelled but to no avail. Arson - Real name unknown. Power of pyrokinesis. Seems to glean great satisfaction from the use of his powers and is seemingly the most temperamental of the Liberty Snots. Freaksho - Real name and powers unknown. Thus far the only time he has spoken has been to level allegations against Deputy Durray. First about police brutality and then about sexual harassment, all within the space of a minute. Mangacide - Jess dresses in a loligoth fashion. Powers involve psionic tentacles that grasp objects. Her origin was somewhat featured as a back-up story in issue #11. She recently got a job as a waitress at the Chick'n Go. M-T - Byron is the grandson of the Maxi Doc Tomorrow. Powers involve some sort of enhanced intelligence and/or technopathy; he invents things, much like his grandfather. Actually dislikes goth music. Had a brief relationship with Roxy Spaulding of Gen¬π¬≥. Silicon Stiletto - Real name unrevealed. Powers involve clawed fingers. She also possesses superhuman strength as she lifted Sheriff Lindo off the ground with one hand and traded blows with the super-strong Caitlin Fairchild of Gen¬π¬≥. In addition, she possesses a degree of invulnerability, taking an energy blast to the face from the Authoriteen's Kid Apollo without injury. Deceased Astral Man - Real name unknown, he is the former leader of the Liberty Squad, Killed by Were-Lizard. There is a statue in the center of Tranquility bearing his likeness, as well as an inscription of his last words: \\"We must do right.\\" His powers are unknown. Arthur Hensford - An international detective during World War II, Arthur Hensford, better known as Mr. Articulate, was known for his chivalry, wit, elegant manerisms, and his signature sword-cane and blue rose corsages. He visited Sheriff Lindo during her stay in the hospital and gave her small trinkets from his world traveling days, which eventually led her to reveal that he wasn't gay, as many of the townsfolk thought due to his nature, and even going so far as to quietly provide money for Leona Terrell to have an abortion. However, after his death, the Tattler implied a past relationship with Midnighter, an openly gay superhero. After his autopsy, it was revealed that Mr. Articulate was in the final stages of cancer and had he not been murdered, he would have had a month to live, at most. =Mr. Articulate's Death, #1-6= Sheriff Lindo attempts to dissuade journalist Collette Pearson from doing a story on Tranquility and its inhabitants, when Minxy crash lands once more. Lindo later asks Fury if she can do something to prevent Minxy's actions, but he disallows this in lieu of Minxy's years of heroic service. At the hospital, Kevin arrives with the rest of the Liberty Snots, and demands to see Leona and his unborn child, or the group will attack the hospital. During this time, Henry is beaten by a shadowed assailant, who wants his deadliest weapon. Lindo asks Suzy to watch over Collette while she goes to the hospital. At the Chick'n Go, Collette mentions that she believes the water of Tranquility acts as a Fountain of Youth. Mayor Fury arrives and has a fight with Suzy, because he wants to protect Traquility's secret. He is scarred by hot grease, but punches Suzy, who calls Lindo, who has quelled the Snots' riot by letting Kevin see Leona at the request of Kyle Truegood. Wondering how she can go against Fury, Henry, who has made it to the hospital, reveals that he knew Kevin's secret word, something he lied about when asked days prior. Saying \\"Hecatean\\", Kevin becomes the much younger and mightier Maximum Man. However, Leona reveals that Articulate's killer was not the Mayor, and across town, Colonel Cragg approaches Bad Dog with Henry's bomb and tells him he has a heroic side and a darker one he can't quell. Bad Dog believes he has to beat some sense into his best friend.

The play involves an \\"interracial love affair\\".Simonson, Robert. \\"'James and Annie', Warren Leight's Second Premiere This Season, Opens in Cincinnati, March 12\\" Playbill, March 12, 2003 =Television= Leight ventured into television as a freelance writer for 100 Centre Street in 2002. On a suggestion from playwright Theresa Rebeck, Law & Order: Criminal Intent executive producer Ren√© Balcer hired Leight to join the staff of the series in its second season as a writer/producer. His colleagues included a reference to Leight's play Side Man; in a third-season episode, \\"Shrink-Wrapped\\"; a bickering couple argues about the motivations of the married couple in the play. Upon a recommendation from Balcer, Leight was named the show's executive producer and head writer in 2006 when Balcer left the show at the end of the fifth season. In 2008, he left Criminal Intent after its seventh season to be the showrunner for HBO's series In Treatment, a year after CI moved to cable. In July 2009, it was announced that Leight had joined FX's new drama Lights Out. On April 11, 2011, Variety reported that Leight would serve as showrunner for Law & Order: Special Victims Unit starting with the thirteenth season. Prior to Leight joining SVU, he wrote one of the final episodes of Law & Order: Criminal Intent, the 10th-season episode \\"Trophy Wine\\", which was the only episode of the season not to be inspired by a real life, true event. Before production on the 13th season of Law & Order: SVU, NBC President Bob Greenblatt sought Leight to \\"reset the tone\\" of the show from its prior seasons, while having the storylines \\"still be compelling but a little more grounded\\". Greenblatt and Leight, along with other SVU cast and crew members, began calling the \\"revamped\\" series, \\"SVU 2.0\\". Mariska Hargitay took over the series as lead, due to Chris Meloni's abrupt departure. In an interview with TV Guide Leight noted \\"I'm aware of how successful and well-liked this show is. I'm just trying to figure out how you rejuvenate it after 12 years.\\" Leight joined SVU over choosing to launch a new show. Regarding Meloni's character's departure, he noted \\"the character most affected by his departure is Olivia. I think in the old days of Law & Order, you'd rip a limb off, attach a new limb, and go back and pitch. Rub some dirt in the wound and go out there. We're trying to do that a little. To my mind and to Mariska's mind, [Stabler's exit] will be playing out over several episodes ‚Äî sometimes in subtle ways, sometimes in overt ways.\\" When Leight was asked how he felt running what is currently the last remaining Law & Order series, he responded, \\"It's a storied franchise, and I don't want to go down with the last ship. I'd rather this be the turning point or a regeneration of the franchise. It was made clear to me that ‚Äî and this was before Chris had left ‚Äî if the show kept going the way it was going, at most it had two years left. Probably just one. If you keep doing everything you've been doing, you'll be gone. That's an interesting message to get when you take a new job. I have to hope that ... the changes being made this year lead to another five years for this show. And clearly, this summer made the case for why this show needs to be on the air. It felt like every week there was a story about powerful men behaving badly or strange goings on. In New York, the number of murders is down 75 percent from its peak, but that's not the case with this kind of crime at all. We have a wall in the writers' room that has 50 New York Post headlines on it from the summer. It's not like the show's original conceit doesn't make sense anymore.\\" Leight noted that his biggest goal for season 13 is \\"First of all, survive. Survive the transition and make a compelling case for why people should continue to watch the show and come back to the show. That's on a business level. On a thematic level, we want to explore the gray of all of this. And to explore the psyches of victims and perps a little bit more and the effect this work takes on the people who do it. When a cop tells me about a real-life interrogation he did, I'm on the edge of my chair. That's where we want to be.\\" Prior to SVU being renewed for a 14th season, Leight said to TV Guide, \\"I don't want it to be a victory lap, I want it to be 14 years down, seven to go, as opposed to 14 years down and it's been a good run.\\" Ratings \\"roller- coastered\\" in season 13, from its lead-in at the time, Rock Center with Brian Williams with competition from CSI: Crime Scene Investigation on CBS and Revenge on ABC. \\"I get so tired of people saying that the show is down from Meloni,\\" Leight says. \\"From the point of view of scripted hour-longs, we're performing very strongly for NBC. Would we perform differently for a different network? Probably. Or with a different lead-in? Probably.\\" In October 2012, Leight said of the future of the Law & Order franchise ‚Äì which currently consisted of just Law & Order: SVU ‚Äì \\"(Dick Wolf and I) sometimes talk in general terms of where (the franchise) could go. I'm curious to see if there's another iteration somewhere down the line,\\" he says. \\"We try hard to maintain a certain level of quality which I think is why the shows sustained in reruns so well. And I'd like to believe there's room for another generation in some way.\\" In May 2016, Leight ended his reign at SVU to develop new television ideas for Sony.

It was opened in January 1948 with an enrollment of 415 students. Its first graduating class participated in commencement in May. In 1956, seven classrooms, a library and gym were added to the school plant, and in 1968, a vocational program was started. In the spring of 1970, a new $300,000 facility was erected by the Jefferson County Board of Education to house the Wenonah Area Vocational School. The building was located on the southwest side of the Wenonah High School campus. In 1973, Wenonah grew to a record enrollment of 1,400 students and in 1974 was annexed into the city of Birmingham.

The hilltop village is southwest of Fishguard, close to the A487 road between Fishguard and St David's. History Mathry (formerly Mathrey or Merthyr) was in the hundred of Dewisland. A weekly market and annual fair were granted by letters patent in the reign of Edward III. The market had ceased by 1833 but the fair, on 10 October, still continued. Originally on the turnpike between Fishguard and St David's, it is now just north of the modern A487. There were 860 inhabitants in the parish in the early 1800s and a school for poor children was subsidised by Sir John Owen to the tune of ¬£10 a year. The parish, prior to 1850, was one of scattered settlements, with slate quarrying employing local people. Community Mathry community includes the villages of Abercastle and Castlemorris. Mathry Community Council meets once a month in Mathry Community Hall. Parish Mathry parish church The parish church of the Holy Martyrs, dedicated to seven sainted men of Mathry, is in the centre of the village. It was built in 1869 on older foundations and restored in 1902. Richard Fenton wrote that the church of his day originally had a steeple which was blown down in a storm. Notable people A genealogical search in 2006 by a Pembrokeshire man found that a Jemima Nicholas was baptised in the parish of Mathry on 2 March 1755.

The Neutron Man (March 30, 1942 ‚Äì October 7, 2004), real name Orlas King, was a popular Ohio State Buckeyes fan for over thirty years. Always seated by the marching band, King would burst into his original dances whenever the Ohio State University Marching Band would play the ‚ÄúNeutron Dance‚Äù. Early life King grew up in Kettering, Ohio where his father was a tool and die maker. Every year he and his father would travel to Columbus, Ohio, to Ohio Stadium to watch a Buckeyes home football game. King attended Kettering Fairmont High School and played football. Later, King went on to play football on a scholarship at the University of Dayton. Football games King started dancing at Ohio State home football games in 1972. At that time he was known as the B Deck Dancer. He remained the B Deck Dancer until the mid-1980s when the Ohio State Marching Band introduced its rendition of the Pointer Sisters‚Äô ‚ÄúNeutron Dance‚Äù. The spectators established a connection between the song and King and began to chant, ‚ÄúNeutron Man, Neutron Man‚Äù. From that point forward, the Neutron Man would dance at every Ohio State home football game during the third quarter break. King eventually began to wear his scarlet and gray beret and his very own Ohio State Buckeyes jersey with ‚ÄúNeutron Man‚Äù printed on the back. Contributions Until his death in 2004, King promoted and contributed to the Ohio State Marching Band and Ohio State Cheerleading programs. He helped to raise money for both groups and, being the owner of several restaurants, frequently catered lunches for the students after the marching band and cheerleading tryouts. Spawning from his popularity, a Neutron Man Beanie Baby was even created. A portion of the money generated from sales went to a cheerleading scholarship.

Designed with a storage capacity of of water at a maximum depth of , the dam forms the Hollywood Reservoir, which collects water from various aqueducts and impounds the creek of Weid Canyon.22nd Annual Report of the Board of Public Service Commissioners History Originally named Weid Canyon Dam, then Hollywood Dam and, finally, Mulholland Dam in honor of William Mulholland, who at the time was the General Manager and Chief Engineer of the Bureau of Water Works and Supply, a predecessor of what is now known as the Los Angeles Department of Water and Power. Mulholland was responsible for the design and construction of the Los Angeles Aqueduct and much of the city's water system, including many of the early earthen dams and storage reservoirs. It is located in what was originally called Holly Canyon and then Weid Canyon, after an immigrant from Odense, Denmark, named Ivar Weid, who lived in the canyon after the Civil War and sold some of the land in the 1880s. Ivar Avenue in Hollywood was also named after him. The area was first surveyed for use as a reservoir in 1912. In 1922, the area was again surveyed and designs for a masonry dam begun. Construction of the dam began in August 1923. Upon completion, in December 1924, the Mulholland Dam became the first concrete, curved gravity dam designed and built by the Bureau of Water Works and Supply. The St. Francis Dam was also designed and built by the Bureau of Water Works and Supply, and because its design was an adaptation of the Mulholland Dam, it was nearly identical in size and shape. In March 1928, the St. Francis Dam experienced a catastrophic failure, and the resulting flood devastated the Santa Clara Valley and took the lives of more than an estimated 430 people. William Mulholland ordered the Hollywood reservoir lowered shortly after the collapse of the St. Francis Dam as a precaution as well as to help ease public fears of a repeat disaster. Due to the St. Francis Dam disaster, the California legislature created an updated dam safety program, and, in 1929, the Department of Public Works, under the oversight of the State Engineer, was given authority to review all non-federal dams over 25 feet high or which would hold more than 50 acre-feet of water. The new legislation also allowed the State to employ consultants, as they deemed necessary. Additionally, the State was given full authority to supervise the maintenance and operation of all non-federal dams. Soon after the failure of the St. Francis Dam, a Committee of Engineers & Geologists to Assess Mulholland Dam was appointed. This was followed in January 1930 by the External Review Panel to evaluate the structure, convened by the State of California. In March 1930, the City of Los Angeles Board of Water & Power Commissioners appointed their own Board of Review for the dam. Although the state's panel did not recommend modification of the dam, both panels came to a similar conclusion: that the dam lacked what was at the time considered sufficient uplift relief, which might possibly lead to destabilization, and that this was unacceptable. A fourth panel, the Board of Engineers to evaluate Mulholland Dam, was appointed in 1931 to examine the feasibility of abandoning Mulholland Dam. An external Geological Report of the Suitability of Foundations followed this in late 1931, appointed by the Board of Water & Power Commissioners. These believed design deficiencies, made by the engineering department while planning, employed in both the Mulholland and the St. Francis Dam, were brought to light, though given little public notice in 1931. The decision ultimately made was to keep the Hollywood Reservoir permanently drawn down, its capacity at no more than ‚Äîthe reservoir now is usually maintained at about ‚Äîand to place an enormous amount of earth, , on the dam's downstream face. In addition to bolstering its resistance to hydraulic uplift and earthquake forces, it also screened the dam from public view. This work was carried out in 1933‚Äì1934, after which the LADWP undertook a forceful program of re-vegetation on the new earth, which succeeded in screening the dam from most everyone's notice. More recent studies have revealed Mulholland Dam to be within the state guidelines for dam safety. \\"Earth Guards Dam from Quakes\\". Popular Science, April 1934. In popular culture The Mulholland Dam was portrayed in the 1974 disaster film Earthquake, where after a large earthquake destroys much of Los Angeles, the dam threatens to collapse and eventually does due to aftershocks.

The current facility, designed by Kideney Architects and built in 1964, replaced the original Cyrus Eidlitz Buffalo Public Library Building dedicated in February 1887. The first Buffalo Public Library, in turn, replaced the Erie County, New York courthouse, which occupied the parcel from 1816-1876. Founded ca. 1835 as the Young Men's Association (not to be confused with YMCA), prominent members included Samuel Langhorne Clemens, who was the editor of the Buffalo Express from 1869-1871. The Young Men's Association was a private subscription library, meaning that paid membership was required in order to borrow books. In 1883, the Association began a fund- raising campaign for a new building and held an architectural competition, which culminated in Eidlitz's 1887 design. Upon completion, the Association turned over its collections to the citizens of Buffalo and the Buffalo Public Library was born, with no requirement for dues or membership. Significant library collections include the original, hand-written manuscript of Mark Twain's Adventures of Huckleberry Finn, which Twain donated to the library in 1885; and the Milestones of Science, a collection of first editions announcing major advancements in Western science.Walters, Daniel and Petty, Mary E. \\"The Milestones of Science Collection: The Public Library and the Conservation of Cultural Heritage.\\" Libraries & Culture (1999), v. 34 no.3: 262-276 Institutional services The Institutional Services Division provides library services in three Erie County institutions.

Materials from most Grosvenor Room collections are for in-library use only and cannot be borrowed. Mark Twain Room: This special exhibition room at the Central Library is the home of Twain's original handwritten manuscript, Adventures of Huckleberry Finn. Twain was a briefly a member of the Buffalo and Erie County Public Library's predecessor, the Young Men's Association, and donated the manuscript of what is considered by many to be the greatest American novel. In 1885, Twain sent the second half of Huckleberry Finn, believing the first half had been lost by a printer. In 1991, the missing portion of the manuscript turned up in a small steamer trunk in a Los Angeles attic. It was among the possessions of descendants of James Fraser Gluck, a curator of the Buffalo Library who had requested the manuscript from Twain a century earlier. Eventually, Twain mailed the missing half of the manuscript to Gluck, but Gluck, who apparently took it to have it bound, died with it among his belongings in 1897. After gaining possession, the B&ECPL; united the manuscript in 1992 for the first time in over a century. This priceless literary masterpiece is showcased in the heart of the Twain room. The Mark Twain Room also houses an antique walnut mantel from the now-demolished Delaware Avenue home where Mark Twain lived during his short newspaper career in Buffalo. A framed oil portrait of Twain hangs prominently above this scrupulously restored hardwood mantel. Norman Rockwell prints from a 1940 edition of Huckleberry Finn enhance the walls on either side. Two bookcases feature hundreds of Twain publications, including many first editions and many in foreign languages. The Mark Twain Room is open during normal Central Library hours of operation.

Romano-British Londinium had been abandoned in the late 5th century, although the London Wall remained intact. There was an Anglo-Saxon settlement by the early 7th century, called Lundenwic, about one mile west of Londinium, to the north of the present Strand. Lundenwic came under direct Mercian control in about 670. After the death of Offa of Mercia in 796, it was disputed between Mercia and Wessex. Viking invasions became frequent from the 830s, and a Viking army is believed to have camped in the old Roman walls during the winter of 871. Alfred the Great reestablished English control of London in 886, and renewed its fortifications. The old Roman walls were repaired and the defensive ditch was recut, and the old Roman city became the main site of population. The city now became known as Lundenburg, marking the beginning of the history of the City of London. Sweyn Forkbeard attacked London unsuccessfully in 996 and 1013, but his son Cnut the Great finally gained control of London, and all of England, in 1016. Edward the Confessor, the stepson of Cnut, became king in 1042. He built Westminster Abbey, the first large Romanesque church in England, consecrated in 1065, and the first Palace of Westminster. Edward's death led to a succession crisis, and ultimately the Norman invasion of England. A mention of Lunden in the Anglo-Saxon Chronicle  Lundenwic  London and the kingdom of Essex, which for a period of time included Middlesex, Surrey and Kent The Roman city was abandoned in the early Anglo- Saxon period, and there is almost no reliable evidence about what happened in the London area from around 450 to 600. Early Anglo-Saxon settlement in the London area was not on the site of the abandoned Roman city, although the Roman London Wall remained intact. Instead, by the 7th century a village and trading centre named Lundenwic was established approximately to the west of Londinium (named Lundenburg, or \\"London Fort\\", by the Anglo-Saxons),Extract from The Comprehensive Gazetteer of England and Wales, 1894-5 probably using the mouth of the River Fleet as a trading ship and fishing boat harbour. In the early 8th century, Lundenwic was described by the Venerable Bede as \\"a trading centre for many nations who visit it by land and sea\\". The Old English term wic or \\"trading town\\" ultimately derived from the Latin word vicus, so Lundenwic meant \\"London trading town\\". Archaeologists were for many years puzzled as to where early Anglo-Saxon London was located, as they could find little evidence of occupation within the Roman city walls from this period. However, in the 1980s, London was rediscovered, after extensive independent excavations by archaeologists Alan Vince and Martin Biddle were reinterpreted as being of an urban character.Channel 4 Time TeamPatrick Ottaway. Archaeology in British Towns: From the Emperor Claudius to the Black Death. In the Covent Garden area, excavations in 1985 and 2005 have uncovered an extensive Anglo- Saxon settlement that dates back to the 7th century.Origins of Anglo-Saxon London The excavations show that the settlement covered about , stretching along the north side of the Strand (i.e. \\"the beach\\") from the present-day National Gallery site in the west to Aldwych in the east. By about 600, Anglo- Saxon England had become divided into a number of small kingdoms within what eventually became known as the Heptarchy. From the mid-6th century, London was incorporated into the Kingdom of Essex, which extended as far west as St Albans and for a period included Middlesex and Surrey. In 604, S√¶berht of Essex was converted to Christianity and London received Mellitus, its first post-Roman Bishop of London. At this time Essex owed allegiance to √Üthelberht of Kent and it was under √Üthelberht that Mellitus founded the first cathedral of the East Saxons, which is traditionally said to be on the site of an old Roman temple of Diana (although the 17th century architect Sir Christopher Wren found no evidence of this). The original building would have been only a modest church at first and it may well have been destroyed after Mellitus was expelled from the city by S√¶berht's pagan successors in 616. The majority of London's population remained pagan during the larger part of the 7th century, and the bishop's seat was occupied only intermittently, by Cedd between 653 and 664, and by Wine between 666 and . The bishopric of London was re- established for good in 675, when the Archbishop of Canterbury, Theodore of Tarsus, installed Earconwald as bishop. Lundenwic came under direct Mercian control in about 670, as Essex became gradually reduced in size and status. After the death of Offa of Mercia in 796, it was disputed between Mercia and Wessex.  Viking attacks  Alfred the Great London suffered attacks from Vikings, which became increasingly common from around 830 onwards. It was attacked in 842 in a raid that was described by a chronicler as \\"the great slaughter\\". In 851, another raiding party, reputedly involving 350 ships, came to plunder the city. In 865, the Viking Great Heathen Army launched a large scale invasion of the small kingdom of East Anglia. They overran East Anglia, Mercia and Northumbria and came close to controlling most of Anglo-Saxon England. By 871 they had reached London and they are believed to have camped within the old Roman walls during the winter of that year. Although it is unclear what happened during this time, London may have come under Viking control for a period. In 878, West Saxon forces led by Alfred the Great defeated the Vikings at the Battle of Ethandun and forced their leader Guthrum to sue for peace. The Treaty of Wedmore and the later Treaty of Alfred and Guthrum divided England and created the Danish controlled Danelaw.  Lundenburg  City noting the restoration of the city by Alfred. English rule in London was restored by 886. Alfred quickly set about establishing fortified towns or burhs across southern England to improve his kingdom's defences: London was no exception. Within ten years, the settlement within the old Roman walls was re-established, now known as Lundenburg. The old Roman walls were repaired and the defensive ditch was re-cut. These changes effectively marked the beginning of the present City of London, the boundaries of which are still to some extent defined by its ancient city walls. As the focus of Lundenburg was moved back to within the Roman walls, the original Lundenwic was largely abandoned and in time gained the name of Ealdwic, 'old settlement', a name which survives today as Aldwych.  10th century London  A coin probably minted in London during the reign of Ethelred the Unready Alfred appointed his son-in-law Earl √Üthelred of Mercia, the heir to the destroyed kingdom of Mercia, as Governor of London and established two defended Boroughs to defend the bridge, which was probably rebuilt at this time. The southern end of the bridge was established as the Southwark or Suthringa Geworc ('defensive work of the men of Surrey'). From this point, the city of London began to develop its own unique local government. After √Üthelred's death, London came under the direct control of English kings. Alfred's son Edward the Elder won back much land from Danish control. By the early 10th century, London had become an important commercial centre. Although the political centre of England was Winchester, London was becoming increasingly important. √Üthelstan held many royal councils in London and issued laws from there. √Üthelred the Unready favoured London as his capital and issued his Laws of London from there in 978.  The Vikings' return  It was during the reign of √Üthelred that Vikings resumed their raids, led by Sweyn Forkbeard of Denmark. London was attacked unsuccessfully in 994, but numerous raids followed. In 1013, London underwent a long siege and √Üthelred was forced to flee abroad. √Üthelred returned with his ally the Norwegian king Olaf and reclaimed London. A Norse saga tells of a battle during the Viking occupation where the English king √Üthelred returned to attack Viking-occupied London. According to the saga, the Danes lined London Bridge and showered the attackers with spears. Undaunted, the attackers pulled the roofs off nearby houses and held them over their heads in the boats. Thus protected, they were able to get close enough to the bridge to attach ropes to the piers and pull the bridge down, defeat the Vikings and ending the occupation of London. There is some speculation that the nursery rhyme \\"London Bridge is Falling Down\\" stems from this incident. Following √Üthelred's death on 23 April 1016, his son Edmund Ironside was declared king. Medieval impression depicting Edmund Ironside (left) and Cnut (right). Sweyn's son Cnut the Great continued the attacks in, harrying Warwickshire and pushing northwards across eastern Mercia in early 1016. Edmund remained in London, still unsubdued behind its famous walls, and was elected king after the death of Aethelred, but Cnut returned southward and the Danish army evidently divided, some dealing with Edmund, some besieging London. There was a battle fought at Penselwood, in Somerset and a subsequent battle at Sherston, in Wiltshire, which was fought over two days but left neither side victorious. Edmund was able to temporarily relieve London, driving the enemy away and defeating them after crossing the Thames at Brentford. Suffering heavy losses, he withdrew to Wessex to gather fresh troops, and the Danes again brought London under siege, but after another unsuccessful assault they withdrew into Kent under attack by the English, with a battle fought at Otford. On 18 October 1016, the Danes were engaged by Edmund's army as they retired towards their ships, leading to the Battle of Assandun. In the ensuing struggle, Eadric Streona, whose return to the English side had perhaps only been a ruse, withdrew his forces from the fray, bringing about a decisive English defeat. Edmund fled westwards, and Cnut pursued him into Gloucestershire, with another battle probably fought near the Forest of Dean. On an island near Deerhurst, Cnut and Edmund ‚Äì who had been wounded ‚Äì met to negotiate terms of peace. It was agreed that all of England north of the Thames was to be the domain of the Danish prince, while all to the south was kept by the English king, along with London. Accession to the reign of the entire realm was set to pass to Cnut upon Edmund's death. Edmund died on 30 November, within weeks of the agreement. Some sources claim Edmund was murdered, although the circumstances of his death are unknown.Anglo-Saxon Chronicles, pp. 152‚Äì3; Williams, A., √Üthelred the Unready The Ill-Counselled King, Hambledon & London, 2003, pp. 146‚Äì7. In accord with the treaty, Cnut was left as king of all of England. His coronation was in London, at Christmas, with recognition by the nobility in January the next year at Oxford.Frank Stenton, Anglo-Saxon England, 3rd ed. Oxford: Clarendon, 1971, , p. 399. Cnut was succeeded briefly by his sons, Harold Harefoot and Harthacnut, after which the Saxon line was restored when Cnut's stepson Edward the Confessor became king in 1042.  Edward the Confessor and the Norman invasion  Following Harthacnut's death on 8 June 1042, Godwin, the most powerful of the English earls, supported Edward, who succeeded to the throne. The Anglo-Saxon Chronicle describes the popularity he enjoyed at his accession ‚Äî \\"before he [Harthacnut] was buried, all the people chose Edward as king in London.\\" Anglo-Saxon Chronicle (MS E) s.a. 1041 (1042), tr. Michael Swanton. Edward was crowned at the cathedral of Winchester, the royal seat of the West Saxons, on 3 April 1043. Modern historians reject the traditional view that Edward mainly employed Norman favourites, but he did have foreigners in his household. Chief among them was Robert of Jumi√®ges, who came to England in 1041, becoming Bishop of London in 1043. According to the Vita √Üdwardi Regis, he became \\"always the most powerful confidential adviser to the king\\".Van Houts, p. 69. Richard Gem, 'Craftsmen and Administrators in the Building of the Abbey', p. 171. Both in Mortimer ed., Edward the Confessor. Robert of Jumi√®ges is usually described as Norman, but his origin is unknown, possibly Frankish (Van Houts, p. 70). When Edward appointed Robert of Jumi√®ges as Archbishop of Canterbury in 1051, he chose the leading craftsman Spearhafoc to replace Robert as bishop of London. Edward's Norman sympathies are most clearly seen in the major building project of his reign, Westminster Abbey, the first Norman Romanesque church in England. This was commenced between 1042 and 1052 as a royal burial church, consecrated on 28 December 1065, completed after his death in about 1090, and demolished in 1245 to make way for Henry III's new building, which still stands. It was very similar to Jumi√®ges Abbey, which was built at the same time. Robert of Jumi√®ges must have been closely involved in both buildings, although it is not clear which is the original and which the copy.Eric Fernie, 'Edward the Confessor's Westminster Abbey', in Mortimer ed., Edward the Confessor, pp. 139‚Äì143 Following Edward's death in 1066, no clear heir was apparent and his cousin, Duke William of Normandy, claimed the throne. The English Witenagemot met in the city and elected Edward's brother- in-law, Harold Godwinson, as king: Harold was crowned in Westminster Abbey. William, outraged by this, then invaded England.

It is one of a few schools in Newham that provides specialist British sign language interpreters for students who have hearing impairments. Lister Community School also is one of the most improved schools in the whole of Great Britain and London. HM The Queen visited Lister on 3 March 2016. History The school was founded by West Ham Council in 1921 as Livingstone Day Continuation Institute, in Balaam Street Congregational schoolroom. It relocated a few times, was briefly absorbed into North West Ham Technical School after World War II, and was successively renamed as Lister Day- Continuation Institute (1933), Lister Technical School (1956), Lister Comprehensive (1972) and finally Lister Community School. Purpose-built facilities for the school were completed in the 1990s. In 2003, pupils staged a walk-out in protest against the invasion of Iraq. In 2005 Lister pupils won a poetry slam, and the school magazine Carbolic (named in honour of the school's namesake, local surgeon Joseph Lister) gained high praise from Benjamin Zephaniah and Michael Rosen.  Expansion and Curriculum  The school moved into brand new premises completed in 2010 at a cost of ¬£25 million under the Building Schools for the Future (BSF) programme.

Lowell published a sensational autobiography, Cradle of the Deep, in 1929, which turned out to be a pure fabrication. Background Lowell's mother was the daughter of a Massachusetts Lowell. Her father was the son of a landowner from Montenegro and a Turkish woman. Lowell feared that her father, Captain Nicholas Wagner (Preacher Nick), had died on December 24, 1924. Newspapers reported his ship, the Oceanic Vance, sank off the coast of Mexico. Two weeks overdue in Los Angeles, California, the schooner was sighted in January 1925, fifteen miles (24 km) northwest of San Diego. The Oceanic Vance had lost her convoy, the schooner Westerner, on Christmas Eve, 1924. Movie actress Joan Lowell in Adventure Girl (1934) Lowell received her dramatic training from Gwendolen Logan Seiler, and became an extra at Goldwyn Pictures at the age of 17. She played bit parts in motion pictures as an extra. One of her first efforts was the role of Madge Barlow in the movie Loving Lies (1924). She was featured with Monte Blue in Cap'n Dan and in the Thompson Buchanan production of The Cub. After completing a leading part in Branded a Thief (1924), about Mexican frontier life, Lowell was chosen as the \\"Queen of the Fourth of July\\" for 1924 in Tijuana, Mexico. She was selected by Senor De Los Rios, a noted bullfighter from Spain. Her last screen role was in Adventure Girl (1934), a film directed by Herman C. Raymaker and loosely based on her fictionalized autobiography. In 1935, Lowell sued Van Beuren Studios and Amedee J. Van Beuren for an accounting of the profits. Van Beuren promptly made a counter-claim for $300,000 damages allegedly sustained because of Lowell's \\"inexpert\\" performance in the picture.SUIT ON 'INEXPERT' ACTING. New York Times. August 29, 1935 Autobiography In 1929, Joan Lowell published an autobiography, Cradle of the Deep, published by Simon & Schuster, in which she claimed that her sea captain father took her aboard his ship, the Minnie A. Caine, at the age of three months when she was suffering from malnutrition. She claimed that he nursed her back to health. She also claimed that she lived on the ship, with its all-male crew, until she was 17, during which time she became skilled in the art of seamanship and once harpooned a whale by herself. She claimed that the ship ultimately burned and sank off Australia, and that she swam three miles to safety, with a family of kittens clinging by their claws to her back. In fact, the autobiography was a fabrication; Lowell had been on the ship, which remained safely in California, for only 15 months. The book was a sensational best seller until it was exposed as pure invention. The book was later parodied by Corey Ford in his book Salt Water Taffy in which Lowell abandons the sinking ship (which had previously sunk several times before \\"very badly\\") and swims to safety with her manuscript. Author and reporter She married playwright Thompson Buchanan on October 16, 1927. The couple resided on a farm three miles (5 km) from New Hope, Pennsylvania. They separated in October 1929. Lowell continued to live in the smaller of two old stone houses on the property. She named the home Joan's Ark. Lowell liked the country, her horses, and books, while Buchanan preferred city life. Also in 1929, Lowell's book about growing up at sea, Cradle of the Deep, was exposed as a fabrication when neighbours of her parents were interviewed by the San Francisco Chronicle. Lowell became a newspaper reporter in Boston, Massachusetts in the early 1930s. She was assaulted by booking agent Morris Levine. He was sentenced to fourteen months in the House of Correction in January 1932. Lowell worked for WOR (AM) radio station in New York City in 1934. Joan Lowell married a sea captain, Leek Bowen, in 1936. He took her to the countryside of Brazil to carve out a coffee plantation. Together they owned a Farm called \\"The Anchorage\\" in the city of An√°polis. Working as a real estate agent in the city, she also sold lands to actors and actresses as Janet Gaynor and Mary Martin in An√°polis. She was called \\"Dona Joana\\" by the locals and after a long time in An√°polis she moved to Bras√≠lia, from where she made a remarkable trip, crossing the National road \\"Bel√©m Brasilia\\" from South to North, driving a Volkswagen. That great adventure was reported in a National magazine during the 60's. She chronicled their adventures in a book, Promised Land (1952).Joan Lowell Dies in Brasilia. Reading Eagle - Nov 15, 1967 The local Jan Magalinski Institute preserves and researches her history at Anapolis. Joan Lowell died in Brasilia, Brazil in 1967.

She is best known for her work with the Kwakwaka'wakw people of coastal British Columbia, Canada, known formerly as the \\"Kwakiutl.\\" Her academic years spanned over fifty years and included professorships at Vassar College, the University of British Columbia, Northwestern University, Bennington College, and the University of Pennsylvania.  Personal life  Helen Codere was born in Winnipeg, Manitoba, but soon after moved to Minnesota. She never married and stated that \\"single women lack some of the freedom and mobility of single men; they are objects of even greater curiosity and scrutiny in a world in which going two by two is projected\\",Negri, Gloria. 2009 Helen Codere ‚Äì A Real Anthropologist.

Her vacation place in Vermont closely resembles her childhood interest of living like the author Henry David Thoreau had once done ‚Äì it had no running water, but a system of barrels with gutters along the two cabins. Codere favored khaki-type trousers and casual shirts. She is known for being a \\"renaissance woman,\\" by her friends. \\"She was extremely accurate with words, had a great sense of humor, a compelling laugh, and was fiercely independent. She was adamant about reading the paper every day, and always looked ready to go on a hike\\". Career Codere held positions in the American Ethnological Society and various faculty appointments, notably Brandeis (1964‚Äì82), where she also served as dean of the graduate school (1974 ‚Äì 77). Her academic appointments spanned five decades and included positions at Vassar College, the University of British Columbia, Northwestern University, Bennington College, and the University of Pennsylvania. Her many awards and fellowships include the Social Science Research Council and the Guggenheim Foundation. \\"Codere entered anthropology at a time when the members of the American Anthropology Association would have fitted into one ballroom\\",. Codere was also one of the first women anthropologists to hold a senior faculty position in a university. Among her achievements, was the 1966 editing of Franz Boas' book Kwakiutl Ethnography; after he died she continued the work of the Kwakiutl peoples. In 1951, and 1954‚Äì55, Codere went on trips to study the Kwakiutl people, where she lived with a family. Later life After retiring, Codere lived on Concord where she continued to volunteer at the library, and spend time with her companion, Marion Tait. When Tait died, Codere never fully recovered. She died on June 5, 2009. She had donated all of her land to the Vermont Land Trust and most of her books to the library at the University of Vermont‚Äôs anthropology department. Works =Kwakiutl= Codere's first major work was Fighting with Property: Study of Kwakiutl Potlatching and Warfare, 1792‚Äì1930, which was also her dissertation for Columbia. In this book, Codere tries to emphasize \\"the more amiable features [of the potlatch] such as the capacity for sociability and cooperativeness, rather than the aggressive and competitiveness\\",Rosman, Abraham and Paula Rubel. 2010 Helen Francis Codere. American Anthropologist 112(2):342--350. which was the dominant view of the time, and it was also seen as a wasteful and unproductive to civilized values. In Fighting with Property, she carries out an historical examination of materials on the Kwakiutl people from 1792‚Äì1930, however, Boas' work formed the basis of her work. She documented that there was a \\"major shift that took place was the distribution of property and vigor of potlatches for social prestige and the co-existent decrease and final extinction of warfare and physical violence\\"Helen Codere. 1950 Fighting with Property: A Study of Kwakiutl Potlatching and Warfare. New York: J.J. Augustin which the Kwakiutl define as \\"fighting with property\\" rather than with weapons. She says that this change can have profound implications not only for an understanding of the Kwakiutl people but also \\"for knowledge of human potentialities for change away from destructiveness, at a point in the history of the world when such a change is necessary\\". Her work on the Kwakiutl was not only important for understanding that culture but also because \\"first, it was one of the pioneering efforts of what later came to be known as historical anthropology. Second, while the majority of anthropologists of the time were doing synchronic studies of societies, Codere's work focused on culture change\\". =Rwanda= After her work with the Kwakiutl, she expanded her work to the Tutsi and Hutu of Rwanda in 1959, during a time of revolution. \\"The general purpose of the Rwanda field research,\\" she wrote, \\"was to study change.\\" While in Rwanda, she was challenged to communicate in two languages ‚Äì Kinyarwanda and French. She collected forty-eight autobiographies of Rwandan men and women: Tutsi, Hutu, and Twa of different ages, education levels, economic statuses and occupations, and along with other research that had been done, she studied the social change, focusing more on the problems and social tensions, rather than the functional theory of society. She viewed society has a \\"complex adaptive system\\" which was essentially a \\"bundle of relations\\".Helen Codere. 1975 African Autobiography, the Biography of an African Society: Rwanda. The Journal of African History 16:473-474 The autobiographies that she took showed the complexities of the caste system and also showed details of intercaste relationships, and the ways these were changing. Her studies about Rwandan social structure were carried out when that very social structure entered a period of rapid transformation.

West Indies also played two matches in Ireland and two in Scotland. The highlights of the tour were a two-match One Day International series for the 1980 Prudential Trophy and a five-Test series for the Wisden Trophy, both against the English cricket team. West Indies were captained by Clive Lloyd, and England by Ian Botham. The ODI series was tied 1‚Äì1, and the Test series was ruined by rain. West Indies won the First Test, but the following four were all drawn due to weather interruptions, so West Indies won the series 1‚Äì0. West Indies also played numerous matches against the first-class counties and other minor teams, winning many of them. West Indies were only beaten twice on the tour, by Essex in a 50-over warm-up match, and by England in the Second ODI, both at the end of May. Thereafter, they were unbeaten until the tour ended in August. Touring party: Gordon Greenidge, Desmond Haynes, Faoud Bacchus, Viv Richards (vice captain), Clive Lloyd (captain), Derick Parry, Alvin Kallicharan, Lawrence Rowe, Collis King, Deryck Murray, David Murray, Andy Roberts, Michael Holding, Joel Garner, Malcolm Marshall, Colin Croft. When Lawrence Rowe dropped out of the tour through injury, Larry Gomes was invited to replace him but declined as he hadn't played for two months. Timur Mohamed, who was at the time playing for Suffolk, joined the touring party instead. Warm-up matches The tour began with the traditional fixture against Lavinia, Duchess of Norfolk's XI at Arundel Castle on 8 May 1980. West Indies won the 45-over match by 121 runs.http://www.cricketarchive.co.uk/Archive/Scorecards/106/106051.html West Indies spent most of the rest of May warming up for the matches against England. West Indies played 3-day matches against Worcestershire, Leicestershire and Northamptonshire, then two 50-over matches against Middlesex and two 50-over matches against Essex, and finally a 3-day match against Derbyshire. Except for the first one-day match against Middlesex on 20 May (which was rained off) and the first one-day match against Essex (won by Essex, the first loss by West Indies on the tour), all of these matches were won by West Indies. One-day Internationals The West Indies won the Prudential Trophy on scoring rate. =1st ODI= The First ODI was held at Headingley on 28 May. England won the toss and put West Indies in to bat first. They reached 198 all out, with 78 from Gordon Greenidge. Joel Garner was run out off the last ball having scored 14. Play was interrupted by the weather, with England on 35/3 overnight, and resumed the next day, 29 May. Despite England's number 3, Chris Tavar√©, reaching 82 not out, West Indies bowled England out for 174 off 51.2 overs to win by 24 runs.http://www.cricketarchive.co.uk/Archive/Scorecards/40/40162.html =2nd ODI= The Second ODI was played the following day, 30 May, at Lord's, with Viv Richards standing in as captain for Clive Lloyd. Again, England won the toss and put West Indies in to bat. They reached 235 for 9 off their 55 overs, led by a 50 from Desmond Haynes. Thanks to a century opening stand by Peter Willey (56) and Geoffrey Boycott (70), and 42 not out from Ian Botham, England reached their target off the third ball of the final over to win by 3 wickets.http://www.cricketarchive.co.uk/Archive/Scorecards/40/40169.html West Indies then played and won a 3-day match against Kent. Test matches =First Test= The First Test was played at Trent Bridge from 5 June. England won the toss and batted. Honours were fairly even between the West Indies pace bowling attack (Andy Roberts, Joel Garner, Michael Holding and Malcolm Marshall) and England's pace attack (Bob Willis, who took 9 wickets, supported by John Lever and Ian Botham) and the batsmen. West Indies were well placed at 109/2 at the end of the fourth day, chasing a target of 208 to win, and won by 2 wickets on the final day. The tour continued with 3-day matches against a combined Oxford University and Cambridge University team, won by West Indies, and a draw against Sussex. =Second Test= The Second Test was played at Lord's from 19 June. England again won the toss and batted. Graham Gooch reached 123, but had little support, with Holding and Garner in the wickets. West Indies replied with a mammoth 518, including a stand of 223 for the second wicket between Haynes (184) and Viv Richards (145). Weather interruptions left West Indies with insufficient time to bowl England out a second time, and the match ended in a draw with England on 133‚Äì2 in their second innings. West Indies then played two matches against Ireland at Clontarf in Dublin on 25 June and 26 June, both affected by the weather. The first was drawn, and West Indies won the second on a faster run rate, with Faoud Bacchus reaching 163.http://www.cricketarchive.co.uk/Archive/Scorecards/40/40309.html West Indies then played a drawn 3-day match and won a 40-over match against Glamorgan, and won and drew 3-day matches against Gloucestershire and Somerset, respectively. =Third Test= The Third Test began on 10 July at Old Trafford. West Indies won the toss and put England in to bat, a good decision, as it turned out: England were bowled out for 150 on the first day. West Indies batted through the second day, and the third day was rained off, but they eventually were all out for 260 in reply, with a century by captain Clive Lloyd. England batted through most of the last two days, reaching 391‚Äì7 to draw the match. Little play was possible on the first day of a 2-day match against Scotland at Forthill in Dundee on 17 July; the match was abandoned on the second day, and West Indies won the replacement 50-over match. West Indies then beat Yorkshire over 3 days. =Fourth Test= The Fourth Test was played at The Oval from 24 July 1980. England won the toss and batted, reaching 370, with contributions through the batting order. Gooch top-scored on 83; Boycott (53) and Brian Rose (50) also reached half-centuries, and Mike Gatting just missed out on 48. Extras was second-highest scorer, on 57 ‚Äì this was the second time that West Indies conceded over 50 extras in the Test series, having given 52 away in England's second innings in the First Test. No play was possible on the third day, and West Indies eventually conceded their first first-innings deficit of the Test series, all out for 265 (with captain Clive Lloyd absent hurt), and England were in trouble, at 18‚Äì4 just before the close on the fourth day, but batted through the final day to reach 209‚Äì9 declared, with England number 8 Peter Willey reaching 100 not out in an unbroken stand of 117 for the final wicket with Bob Willis (24*), and the match was drawn. West Indies then drew a 2-day match against Minor Counties and a 3-day match against Warwickshire. =Fifth Test= The Fifth and final Test was played at Headingley from 7 August. West Indies won the toss and decided to field. Again, the weather intervened. No play was possible on the first day. England were bowled out for 143 on the second day, with only two batsmen scoring more than 14 runs ‚Äì captain Ian Botham (37) and wicketkeeper David Bairstow (40), who had replaced the regular keeper in the first four Tests, Alan Knott. West Indies reached 245 in reply, but the fourth day was also lost, and England reached 227‚Äì6 declared on the final day, with the series petering out with a fourth consecutive draw. The West Indian team finished its tour with a third match against Essex, at Stamford Bridge on 14 August.

The sandwich is claimed to have originated at Nick's Kitchen restaurant in Huntington, Indiana (near Fort Wayne). Sandwich description The primary differences between a Pork Tenderloin sandwich and a Wiener Schnitzel are that the Pork Tenderloin sandwich is made exclusively using pork loin and it is deep fried instead of pan fried. The Pork Tenderloin sandwich is also usually served on a bun. There is a grilled variant of the Pork Tenderloin that omits the breading and grills the tenderloin instead of deep frying it. A Pork Tenderloin sandwich is traditionally prepared from a thinly sliced piece of pork loin, hammered thin with a meat mallet.Breaded Pork Tenderloin Sandwich Tutorial The meat is then dipped in flour, eggs and breadcrumbs or crushed saltine crackers before being deep fried in oil. After cooking, the prepared Pork loin is then served on a hamburger bun, with the meat overlapping the bun considerably. The sandwich can be served with condiments such as mustard, ketchup, mayonnaise, lettuce, onions and pickles. The sandwich is usually served with a side of french fries, though onion rings are often provided instead. Variants =Grilled= A variant of the fried tenderloin sandwich is made with a grilled prepared pork loin. Recipes for this variant appear from New England to South Carolina. The meat is seasoned, brined or marinated and cooked on a grill. After cooking, the meat is placed on a kaiser roll or hamburger bun and topped with condiments.

He was the son of Thomas Teshmaker Busk (1852‚Äì1894) and Mary Busk n√©e Acworth (1854‚Äì1935), of Hermongers, Rudgwick, Sussex. After attaining First Class Honours in Mechanical Sciences at Cambridge in June 1912 he became Assistant Engineer at the newly formed Royal Aircraft Factory, Farnborough, later the Royal Aircraft Establishment. Here he devoted much of his time to the mathematics and dynamics of stable flight. In the early years of powered flight inherent stability in an aircraft was a most important quality. Busk took his theories into the air and tried them out in practice. In 1913 this work was used in the R.E.1 (Reconnaissance Experimental), claimed as the first inherently stable aeroplane, and resulted in the development of the B.E.2c. The remarkable feature of this design was that there was no single device that was the cause of the stability. The stability resulted from detailed design of each part of the aircraft, with due regard to its relation to, and effect on, other parts in the air. Weights and areas were so arranged that under most conditions the machine would tend to right itself. Busk was killed on 5 November 1914 while making an experimental flight in a B.E.2 which caught fire at Laffans Plain (now Farnborough Airfield), near Aldershot, burning him to death. He was buried at Aldershot Military Cemetery with full military honours.CWGC entry Frederick Lanchester wrote in 1916: Busk's genius and his courage were recognised by the posthumous award of the Gold Medal of the Aeronautical Society of Great Britain, and amongst the many letters of condolence received by his mother was one from King George V. His youngest brother, Hans Acworth Busk (b. 1894), was reported missing on 6 January 1916, last seen flying a heavy bombing aeroplane against the Turks at Gallipoli. They were both survived by their mother Mary Busk (n√©e Acworth, 1854-1935), author of a biography of her two sons lost while flying, by sister Mary Agnes Dorothea Morse (1888‚Äì1960) and by brother Henry Gould Busk (1890‚Äì1956).

After coming to a stop, the driver who had hidden several illegal aliens in his vehicle tried to flee, nearly hitting Hernandez in the process. Hernandez fired several shots at the vehicle, aiming for the tires. When the vehicle halted due to the blown tires, several people fled the vehicle. One of the bullets Hernandez fired injured a woman in the vehicle, shattering some of her teeth.

On December 1, 2006 Hernandez was convicted for violation of civil rights of the injured person on the grounds that he should not have shot at the fleeing vehicle since his life was not in danger.

During its first years in service the reservoir level varied, though for most of the time it was kept a high level and was filled on several occasions. Within days after the collapse of the St. Francis Dam in March 1928, William Mulholland ordered the Hollywood Reservoir lowered due, in part, to public fears of a repeat disaster. Shortly after the disaster and in the years following, several engineering panels met to discuss the safety of the dam. These panels of engineers, from both the state and the LADWP came to differing conclusions. In 1931, the LADWP made the decision to permanently keep the Hollywood Reservoir lowered, and keep it to no more than 4,000 acre- feet (4,900,000 m3). The reservoir now is usually maintained at about 2,800 acre-feet (3,500,000 m3). The surrounding recreational area is known as Lake Hollywood Park, and is open for walking, hiking, and jogging.

The association recognizes over 640,000 people as part of the Aggie Network and oversees 251 clubs worldwide. Known to Aggies as simply The Association, the group is dedicated to promoting the interests and welfare of Texas A&M; University, perpetuating ties of affection and esteem that students formed during their college days, and serving the current student body. The Association facilitates numerous programs aimed at connecting the worldwide Texas A&M; community, such as class reunions, A&M; Clubs, the Aggie Ring program, the publication of the Texas Aggie magazine, and 'Find an Aggie' database that is housed on the Association's website, AggieNetwork.com. History Fountain in front of the former students' building The Association's roots go back to June 26, 1879, when former cadets hosted a reception in Houston initiating the first formal organization of A&M; former students. In 1888, the Ex-Cadets Association was reorganized to form the Alumni Association. In the mid-1890s, E.P. Cushing founded Alpha Phi to \\"work for the upbuilding of the college.\\" Cushing chose to contact all 3,000 former students of the college, rather than just the 300 students who had received degrees. As a result, the term \\"former student\\" is used in lieu of \\"ex-Aggie\\" (keeping with tradition that \\"once an Aggie, always an Aggie\\"). A coalition was formed between the A&M; Alumni Association and Alpha Phi Fraternity in 1919 to form ‚ÄúThe Association of Former Students.‚Äù Lacking a permanent location on the A&M; campus, the Association created a fundraising campaign to erect a YMCA-Alumni Memorial Building in 1910. Although this building was dedicated on February 15, 1915, the Y never was home to the Association. Instead, the Association gave the building to Texas A&M; to provide space for the campus's growth. In 1987, the Association constructed its first free-standing building, the Clayton W. Williams, Jr. Alumni Center, and the long series of temporary locations ended. From 1947 to 1964, Dick Hervey was the executive secretary of the Association. Under his leadership, the first computerized database, the university archives, and Texas A&M;'s Distinguished Alumnus Award, which Hervey himself received in 1988, were all established. Hervey was also the mayor of College Station from 1971 to 1974. The Clayton W. Williams, Jr. Alumni Center In 2008, the Alumni Center was enhanced to better use the facility as an exhibit of the ‚Äúpowerful story of Texas A&M; and Texas Aggies.‚Äù The building was rededicated in the fall of 2009. The remodeled building houses six interactive exhibits: Traditions, Spirit, Muster, Memories, Legacy and Network. Each exhibit allows the visitor to experience different aspects of what it is like to be an Aggie. The Huddleston Video Wall, located in Flores Hall of the Alumni Center, is composed of plasma screens that create a multimedia experience and is perfect for the former students‚Äô football game-watching festivities. The Clayton W. Williams, Jr. Alumni Center is typically open to the public Monday-Friday from 7:30 a.m. to 5:30 p.m. On Saturdays, the building is open from 10:00 a.m. to 2:00 p.m. These hours may be extended due to events held at the Alumni Center or at Texas A&M; University. In addition, the Alumni Center features a giant replica of the Aggie Ring, which is modeled after the 1946 Aggie Ring of Bill Haynes '46, who with his wife, Reta, donated the funds to build it. The surrounding area around the Ring replica is called Haynes Ring Plaza. The replica ring is 12 feet tall (symbolizing the honored 12th Man tradition). AggieNetwork.com The Association's website, AggieNetwork.com, ‚Äúconnects Aggies with each other and with Texas A&M; by providing engaging and inspiring content, essential transactional services and growing interactive capabilities.‚Äù AggieNetwork.com is also home to ‚ÄòFind an Aggie,‚Äô which allows Aggies all over the world to connect with other Aggies.

Programs and services Clayton W. Williams, Jr. Alumni Center in College Station, TX Through generous donations from former students and friends of the Aggie Network, the Association contributes more than $3 million in direct cash support every year to Texas A&M; University. Those funds are, in turn, applied toward scholarships and fellowships, student recruitment and orientation, student success, faculty orientation and success, student affairs, various awards, and many other key initiatives. In 2012, the association provided a total impact of $7.2 million to Texas A&M; to be used for scholarships, awards, activities, and enrichment for students, faculty and staff, and former students. Half of the money was given back to Texas A&M; in cash support to fund over 100 individual projects in impact areas that had been identified by the Texas A&M; University president and provost. Additionally, academic colleges and administrative divisions received some funding. Each year, the association's board of directors review the funding requests for approval. The association supports both current and former students through a variety of initiatives. To see a list of the programs that receive financial assistance from the association, please see this website. Entering freshmen are first exposed to the Association and its programs the week before school begins. During the university-wide \\"Howdy Week\\", the association hosts \\"GatheRing\\", which includes a free cookout, a Yell Practice, and a chance to try on the Class's Aggie Ring on the grounds of the Clayton W. Williams, Jr. Alumni Center. Students make the official transition into former students at the Association's \\"The Next Tradition,\\" a free event that celebrates graduation and welcomes graduates into the Aggie Network, and where Association members explain the services they offer to former students. The Association offers many programs for Texas A&M; alumni, including career services, Aggie football game day festivities, and the 'Traveling Aggies,' a travel program that allows alumni to travel to various destinations around the world. The association publishes Class Newsletters and sponsors Class Reunions and Constituent Network events. Most classes meet every five years, although a single reunion is held each year for the Sul Ross Group, all classes which graduated 55 or more years ago. The Association assists in coordination with over 250 local A&M; club chapters. The Association maintains the database of A&M; former students, which is accessible free of charge online after an account has been created. The Clayton W. Williams, Jr. Alumni Center provides a welcoming and engaging environment to prospective students, current students, former students, and friends of the Aggie Network. The events that the Association sponsors, and often hosts, include: Aggie Ring Day, Association activities during bowl games, Board and Leadership Council meetings, Class Reunions, Coach's Nights, Distinguished Alumni Gala, Endowed Century Club lunch, game day activities, Gig ‚Äôem Week GatheRing, Outstanding International Alumnus Award Dinner, Ring Remembrance ceremonies, The Next Tradition, Aggie Greek Weekend, and Traveling Aggies Reunions. All active donors of The Association of Former Students receive the Texas Aggie magazine, which is published 6 times per year. As of 2007, it has a circulation of 60,000 per year. The Texas Aggie provides an in-depth look at Texas A&M; and the lives of those affiliated with it through feature stories and campus updates. In an effort to capture the history of Texas A&M;, the Association has also videotaped numerous former students sharing their experiences with each other as well as with students. Additional recordings of oral histories are incorporated into the 2008 enhancements to the Clayton W. Williams, Jr. Alumni Center. Awards Each year, the Association and Texas A&M; recognize various former students for their accomplishments since graduation. The highest award given each year is the Distinguished Alumnus Award. This recognition was first offered in 1962, and, as of 2012, 216 former students have received this prestigious award. The criteria for receiving the award include \\"excellence in professional lives and service to A&M; and their communities\\". Since 1955, the Association has awarded annual Distinguished Achievement Awards, both on the college and university levels, to faculty and staff of the Texas A&M; University System. The college level award recognizes \\"outstanding faculty members for their talent and expertise, dedication to teaching and devotion to imparting their knowledge to students. The university level award recognizes \\"outstanding member of Texas A&M;'s faculty and staff for their commitment, performance and positive impact on Aggie students, Texas citizens and the world around them. Texas A&M; also recognizes the \\"Aggie 100\\", a reference to the top one hundred companies owned or managed by its alumni.Louis San Miguel, \\"Peter Arguindegui, Well known Laredoan dies: Burial Mass set for St. Patrick's Church\\", Laredo Morning Times, August 6, 2014, pp. 1, 12A Beginning in 1973, the Association has recognized current students for academic achievement with the Gathright Award. Named for Texas A&M;'s first president, Thomas S. Gathright, the award recognizes sophomores, juniors, and seniors who have the highest grade point average in their college. Students are nominated for the award by the dean of their respective college. Recipients are recognized at the annual Parents' Weekend All-University Awards Ceremony. The Association also gives the Buck Weirus Spirit Award to students who \\"display vision, character and superior dedication to Texas A&M.;\\" The award is given annually to up to 55 students. They must be highly involved in the Aggie community, and must \\"impact student life at Texas A&M; and enhance the Aggie Spirit.\\" This can be accomplished through participation in student organizations, Aggie traditions, and university events. The award is named for Richard \\"Buck\\" Weirus, a 1942 Texas A&M; graduate who served as executive director of the Association from 1964 until 1980. Also, the Association, along with Texas A&M;'s Office of the president, recognizes 20 outstanding A&M; employees and outstanding team for their meritorious service to the university through the president's Meritorious Service Award. Traditions The Association plays a large role in two of the most treasured traditions at Texas A&M;: the dispersal of the Aggie Ring, and the annual Aggie Muster. The Association also supports many other Aggie traditions; for example, it secures a location for and sets up Midnight Yell Practice and a free tailgate at away football games, and for home games, the Association helps pay security costs for Midnight Yell in Kyle Field. =Muster= 2007 Aggie Muster at Reed Arena. The Ross Volunteers stand at attention as candles are lit for the deceased. The roots of Aggie Muster go back to 1883. The Association of Former Students supports more than 300 Musters held worldwide on and around April 21. The purposes of Muster are for former students to gather in fellowship and to remember comrades who have passed away since the last Muster. The Association maintains the annual worldwide Muster Roll; names are added whenever the Association is informed of an Aggie's passing. Each Muster primarily calls the names of Aggies who lived in that area; this is also true for the student-run Muster in Reed Arena, which calls primarily the names of students, faculty and staff. The Association supplies names to local Musters, maintains a bureau of Muster speakers and provides information and planning packets, as well as mailing thousands of local Muster invitations. =Aggie Ring= The Association's Aggie Ring Office helps qualified current and former students order their Aggie Rings, one of Texas A&M;'s most well-known and easily recognized symbols. Students earn the Aggie Ring based on credit hours completed at Texas A&M.; Many students receive their Aggie Ring on Aggie Ring Days held at the Clayton W. Williams, Jr. Alumni Center. The Association also assists in lifelong service, repair, resizing and replacement of Aggie Rings, and maintains a \\"Lost and Found\\" Ring page on AggieNetwork.com. The Association maintains three Aggie Ring collections. The first collection contains Rings awarded to graduates of the Agricultural and Mechanical College of Texas, as Texas A&M; was previously known. Begun by J. B. \\"Josh\\" Sterns, this collection contains Rings from 1899 until 1964, when the name of the school was officially changed. The second collection, the Memorial Ring Collection, contains Rings representing graduating classes beginning with the class of 1965. The Rings in the Memorial Ring Collection are donated by the families of deceased students. The final collection contains historically significant Rings, including that of James Earl Rudder, Texas A&M;'s president from 1959 until 1970.

Smaller rivers, such as the Root River and Lincoln Creek also run throughout the city. Because Lake Michigan is too large to see across, Milwaukee's waterfront resembles an ocean rather than an inland lake. Milwaukee's terrain is relatively flat, except for steep bluffs along the lakeshore that begin about one half mile north and four miles (6 km) south of the downtown. Aerial image of downtown Milwaukee According to the United States Census Bureau, the city has a total area of . of it is land and 2.2 km¬≤ (0.9 mi¬≤) of it is water. The total area is 0.88% water. Cityscape The city runs largely on the grid system, although in the far northwest and southwest corners of the city, the grid pattern gives way to a more suburban-style streetscape. North‚Äìsouth streets are numbered, and east‚Äìwest streets are named. However north‚Äìsouth streets east of 1st street are named, like east‚Äìwest streets. The north‚Äìsouth numbering line is along the Menomonee River (east of Hawley Road) and Fairview Avenue/Golfview Parkway (west of Hawley Road), with the east‚Äìwest numbering line defined along 1st Street (north of Oklahoma Avenue) and Chase/Howell Avenue (south of Oklahoma Avenue). This numbering system is also used to the north by Mequon in Ozaukee County, and by some Waukesha County communities. It is crossed by Interstate 43 and Interstate 94, which come together downtown at the Marquette Interchange, which underwent an extensive construction project completed in 2008 at a cost of around $810 million. The Interstate 894 bypass runs through portions of the city's southwest side, and Interstate 794 comes out of the Marquette interchange eastbound, bends south along the lakefront and crosses the harbor over the Hoan Bridge, then ends near the Bay View neighborhood and becomes the Lake Parkway.

It runs from Hudson Street, TriBeCa, in the west to Chatham Square in Chinatown in the east. Past Chatham Square, the roadway continues as Oliver Street, a north-south street running one-way northbound. Between West Broadway and Church Street, Worth Street is also known as Justice John M. Harlan Way in honor of the Supreme Court justice and alumnus of the nearby New York Law School. Between Centre and Baxter Streets, Worth Street is also known as the \\"Avenue of the Strongest\\", \\"New York's Strongest\\" being a nickname for the city's Department of Sanitation. The western end of Worth Street, between Hudson Street and West Broadway, abuts 60 Hudson Street, the former Western Union headquarters that later was converted into an internet hub. Worth Street passes through the cluster of government offices and courthouses centered on Foley Square. 125 Worth Street (at Centre Street) houses the headquarters of the New York City Health and Hospitals Corporation, the Department of Health and Mental Hygiene, and the Department of Sanitation. Additionally, the New York Supreme Court courthouses at 60 Centre Street and 80 Centre Street (the Louis J. Lefkowitz Building) and the Daniel Patrick Moynihan Federal Courthouse (Southern District of New York) at 500 Pearl Street all have entrances facing Worth Street.  History  What is now Worth Street originally started at the Five Points intersection and headed west; it was known as Anthony Street. In 1797, it was named Catherine Street (separately from the other Catherine Street to the southeast, which remains today, as well as another one to the north). Starting at Hudson Street, it ended at the western bank of the Collect Pond. Catherine Lane, which ran parallel and to the north, still exists as an alleyway between Broadway and Lafayette Street. An 1807 map shows that the pond was filled in, and that Anthony Street ran to an unlabeled short street where Centre Street is now. After 1811, Anthony Street was extended to Orange Street (later renamed Baxter Street), completing the \\"fifth point\\" of the intersection by bisecting its northeast corner. In 1854, it was renamed Worth Street in honor of Major- general William J. Worth, hero of the 1848 Mexican War. Worth is buried two miles north in Worth Square, which is at the north end of Madison Square near 26th Street. In 1868, the city opened the section from Five Points east to Chatham Square. A station on the New York City Subway's IRT Lexington Avenue Line at Worth Street was open between 1904 and 1962. On February 5, 2016, a crane collapsed on Worth Street at 60 Hudson Street, killing one person and injuring two others.

He succeeded his father Renaud. His mother was Helvis, a daughter of Balian of Ibelin. He was a powerful and important representative of the native aristocracy during the three Levantine crusades of the first half of the thirteenth century. During the Fifth Crusade, Balian advised the troops of Andrew II of Hungary against sallying into the deserted regions of his county of Sidon, regions almost under Saracen control. The Hungarians refused to listen, however, and many were massacred during a Turcoman ambush. During the Sixth Crusade, Balian supported the Emperor Frederick II for the throne of Jerusalem. He negotiated with Giordano Filangieri, the marshal of Sicily, sent by Frederick in 1228 to represent his authority in Acre until the emperor could make the trip in person. Balian was the chief native ally of the crusaders at the time when they were not well received by the locals. He supported the Emperor and his Germanisation, but tried, as with the previous crusade, to prevent a bloodbath. In 1229, Frederick left Balian in charge of Tyre and in 1231 he gave him the co-regency (bailiwick) of the kingdom with Garnier l'Aleman. During Barons' Crusade of Theobald I of Navarre in 1239, Balian joined a group of defiant barons at least part of the way to Gaza where a battle was fought between crusader and Egyptian forces. Balian was probably part of a sub-group led by Hugh of Burgundy which departed before the actual battle. The remaining group of the crusaders charged the Egyptians, was routed, resulting in the capture of Amaury VI of Montfort and the death of Henry II of Bar. If Balian was part of the group which stayed and fought, he would have been among the relatively small number of survivors not to be captured by the Muslims. Balian later received the castle of Shaqil Arnun, which his father had defended by a ruse from Saladin in 1190, from the sultan As-Salih Ayyub. He died in 1240 or, according to Philip of Novara, 1241. He was betrothed to Marguerite of Brienne, who was seduced by Emperor Frederick II (daughter of Walter III, Count of Brienne, older brother of John of Brienne), ultimately marrying Ida de Reynel. His son Julian succeeded him in Sidon, the greater part of which had been recovered by Balian. Sources *Setton, Kenneth M.

History to 1820  The first recorded inhabitants of the Milwaukee area are the Menominee, Fox, Mascouten, Sauk, Potawatomi, Ojibwe (all Algic/Algonquian peoples) and Ho- Chunk (Winnebago) (a Siouan people) Native American tribes. Many of these people had lived around Green Bay before migrating to the Milwaukee area around the time of European immigration. The name \\"Milwaukee\\" comes from an Algonquian word Millioke, meaning \\"Good\\", \\"Beautiful\\" and \\"Pleasant Land\\" (cf. Potawatomi language minwaking, Ojibwe language ominowakiing) or \\"Gathering place [by the water]\\" (cf. Potawatomi language manwaking, Ojibwe language omaniwakiing). French missionaries and traders first passed through the area in the late 17th and 18th centuries. French explorer Robert La Salle was most likely the first white man to visit Milwaukee in October 1679. Although La Salle and others visited Milwaukee, prior to the 19th century, Milwaukee was mostly inhabited by Native Americans. The Natives at Milwaukee tried to control their destiny by participating in all the major wars on the American continent. During the French and Indian War, a group of \\"Ojibwas and Pottawattamies from the far [Lake] Michigan\\" (i.e., the area from Milwaukee to Green Bay) joined the French-Canadian Daniel Li√©nard de Beaujeu at the Battle of the Monongahela. In the American Revolutionary War, the Indians around Milwaukee were some of the few Indians who remained loyal to the American cause throughout the Revolution. As the 18th century came to a close, the first recorded white fur trader settled in Milwaukee. This was French Canadian Jean Baptiste Mirandeau who along with Jacques Vieau of La Baye (Green Bay), established a fur-trading post near the Menomonee River in 1795. Mirandeau remained all year with Vieau coming every spring with supplies. In 1820 or 1821 Mirandeau died and was the first white to be buried in the city in an Indian cemetery near Broadway and Wisconsin. The post was on the Chicago-Green Bay trail, located on the site of today's Mitchell Park. Vieau married the granddaughter of an Indian chief and had at least twelve children. Vieau's daughter by another woman, Josette, would later marry Solomon Juneau. These links established a Metis population, and by 1820 Milwaukee was essentially a Metis settlement.Jaqueline Peterson, \\"Many Roads to Red River: Metis genesis in the Great Lakes region, 1680-1815\\" in The New Peoples: Being and Becoming Metis in North America, Jaqueline Peterson and Jennifer S. H. Brown, ed. (Winnipeg: University of Manitoba, 1985 reprinted St. Paul: Minnesota Historical Society, 2001), p. 44  1800 to 1849  Statue of Solomon Juneau, c. 1890 Milwaukee has three \\"founding fathers\\": Solomon Juneau, Byron Kilbourn, and George H. Walker. Solomon Juneau, the first of the three to come to the area, arrived in 1818. The French Canadian Juneau married Josette Vieau, daughter of Jacques Vieau, in 1820, and Vieau eventually sold the trading post to his son-in-law and daughter, the \\"founding mother of Milwaukee.\\" The Juneaus moved the post in 1825 to the eastern bank of the Milwaukee River (between the river and Lake Michigan), where they founded the town called Juneau's Side, or Juneautown. This town soon attracted settlers from the Eastern United States and Europe. Soon after, Byron Kilbourn settled on the west side of the Milwaukee River. In competition with Juneau, Kilbourn established Kilbourntown there, making sure that the streets running toward the river did not match up with those on the east side. This accounts for the large number of angled bridges that still exist in Milwaukee today. Further, Kilbourn distributed maps of the area that showed only Kilbourntown, implying that Juneautown did not exist or that the east side of the river was uninhabited and thus undesirable. The third prominent builder, George H. Walker, claimed land to the south of the Milwaukee River, where he built a log house in 1834. This area grew and became known as Walker's Point. Seal of Milwaukee depicts historic city life The proximity of the towns sparked tensions in 1845 after the completion of a bridge built between Kilbourntown and Juneautown. Kilbourn and his supporters viewed the bridge as a threat to their community and ultimately led to Kilbourn destroying part of the bridge. Over the next few weeks, skirmishes broke out between the inhabitants of the two towns; while no one was killed, several people were seriously injured. After this event, known as the Milwaukee Bridge War, the two towns made greater attempts at cooperation. By the 1840s, the three towns had grown to such an extent that on January 31, 1846 they combined to incorporate as the City of Milwaukee and elected Solomon Juneau as the city's first mayor. A great number of German immigrants had helped increase the city's population during the 1840s and continued to migrate to the area during the following decades. Milwaukee became known as the \\"Deutsches Athen\\" (German Athens), and into the 20th century, there were more German speakers and German-language newspapers than there were English speakers and English-language newspapers in the city. To this day, the Milwaukee phone book includes more than 40 pages of Schmitts or Schmidts, far more than the pages of Smiths. In the mid-19th century Milwaukee earned the nickname \\"Cream City,\\" which refers to the large number of cream colored bricks that came out of the Menomonee River Valley and were used in construction. At its peak, Milwaukee produced 15 million bricks a year, with a third going out of the state.  1850 to 1900  Milwaukee in 1858 Milwaukee in 1872, looking west During the middle and late 19th century, Wisconsin and the Milwaukee area became the final destination of many German immigrants fleeing the Revolution of 1848. In Wisconsin they found the inexpensive land and the freedoms they sought. The German heritage and influence in the Milwaukee area is widespread. On November 14, 1856 Solomon Juneau died at the age of 63. The Milwaukee Bar Association was founded in 1858. It is the fourth oldest of such organizations in the United States and now has over 2,600 members. Milwaukee in 1879, looking north Bay View On May 5, 1886 the Bay View Massacre occurred, in which striking steelworkers who were marching toward a mill in the Bay View section of Milwaukee were intercepted by a squad of National Guardsmen who, under orders from the Wisconsin Governor, fired point blank into the strikers, killing seven. In March 1889, Milwaukee had four days of protest and one day of rioting against its Chinese laundrymen. Sparking this citywide disturbance were allegations of sexual misconduct between two Chinese and several underaged white females. The unease and tension in the wake of the riot was assuaged by the direct disciplining of the city's Chinese.Jew, Victor. \\"'Chinese Demons': The Violent Articulation of Chinese Otherness and Interracial Sexuality in the U.S. Midwest, 1885-1889.\\" Journal of Social History v. 37 no. 2 (2003), pp. 389-410. The late 19th century saw the incorporation of Milwaukee's first suburbs. Bay View existed as an independent village from 1879‚Äì1886. In 1892, Whitefish Bay, South Milwaukee, and Wauwatosa incorporated. They were followed by Cudahy (1895), North Milwaukee (1897) and East Milwaukee, (later known as Shorewood), in 1900. The early 20th century saw the additions of West Allis (1902) and West Milwaukee (1906), which completed the first generation of so- called \\"inner-ring\\" suburbs. In general, suburbs along the north shore of Lake Michigan were residential and wealthier and suburbs along the south shore were industrial and working class. The western suburbs were mixed‚ÄîNorth Milwaukee and West Allis being primarily industrial, and Wauwatosa being primarily residential. Wauwatosa was widely recognized as Milwaukee's first \\"bedroom suburb,\\" though it developed its own set of social, economic, and religious institutions. In 1895, the Milwaukee City Hall was completed. Containing 15 stories and topping out at 393 feet, the City Hall was the tallest habitable building in the world upon its completion (a title it maintained until the Park Row Building was completed in New York City in 1899) and one of the tallest structures overall, behind such non-habitable buildings as the Eiffel Tower and the Washington Monument. It remained the tallest seat of government until 1901, when Philadelphia City Hall was completed.  1900 to 1960  Milwaukee in 1898 Milwaukee in 1912 Milwaukee slums in 1936 Milwaukee in 1955 During the first half of the 20th century, Milwaukee was the hub of the socialist movement in the United States. Milwaukeeans elected three Socialist mayors during this time: Emil Seidel (1910‚Äì1912), Daniel Hoan (1916‚Äì1940), and Frank Zeidler (1948‚Äì1960), and remains the only major city in the country to have done so. Often referred to as \\"Sewer Socialists,\\" these Milwaukee Socialists were characterized by their practical approach to government and labor. These practices emphasized cleaning up neighborhoods and factories with new sanitation systems, city owned water and power systems, and improved education systems. During this period, socialist mayor Daniel Hoan implemented the country's first public housing project, known as Garden Homes. The socialists' influence began to dwindle in the late 1950s amidst the \\"red scare\\". On November 24, 1917, Milwaukee was the site of a terrorist explosion when a large black powder bomb Balousek, Marv, and Kirsch, J. Allen, 50 Wisconsin Crimes of the Century, Badger Books Inc. (1997), , , p. 113 exploded at the central police station at Oneida and Broadway.The Indianapolis Star, \\"Bomb Mystery Baffles Police\\", November 26, 1917 Nine members of the department were killed in the blast, along with a female civilian, Catherine Walker. \\"Milwaukee Police Department Officer Memorial Page\\" It was suspected at the time that the bomb had been placed outside the church by anarchists, particularly the Galleanist faction led by adherents of Luigi Galleani. At the time, the bombing was the most fatal single event in national law enforcement history,Deadliest Days in Law Enforcement History, National Law Enforcement Officers Memorial Fund (November 24, 1917) http://www.nleomf.org/facts/enforcement/deadliest.html only surpassed later by the World Trade Center terrorist attacks on September 11, 2001 when 72 law enforcement officers representing eight different agencies were killed. Also during this time, a small, but burgeoning community of African-Americans who emigrated from the south formed a community that would come to be known as Bronzeville. This area, which was located on and near what are now known as Old World Third Street and Martin Luther King Drive, soon became known as a \\"Harlem of the Midwest\\" for its jazz clubs and juke joints which attracted both local and nationally renowned musicians such as B.B. King and Ella Fitzgerald. Bronzeville's significance began to fall off as the heart of Milwaukee's Black community shifted north following World War II after the building of a major expressway (Interstate 43) which destroyed the geographic continuity of the district. Nonetheless, the area had been experiencing something of a revival within the past few years as it has seen the arrival of several new businesses, restaurants, condos, coffee shops and night clubs that seek to recapture the prominence the area once had. Into the late 1950s, Milwaukee, like many northern industrial cities, grew tremendously. Having been home historically to immigrants from European nations, as well as the northward migration of African-Americans from the Southern United States and industrial workers from Wisconsin's hinterlands and other parts of the United States, the city had acquired a dense population in the first half of the 20th century. As Milwaukee's suburbs proliferated and the population of the city center began to disperse, Milwaukee annexed and incorporated the surrounding lands, recapturing a portion of its departing tax base and simultaneously supplying these areas with much-needed city services. The first plan for Wisconsin's highway system, with an aim to improve Milwaukee's worsening automotive congestion, was submitted in 1945, although construction did not begin until the late 1950s.  1960 to 1995  Milwaukee's population peaked in 1960, according to the decennial US Census, with a count of 741,324 and a national ranking as the 11th largest American city. Milwaukee made its final boundary annexations and consolidations in the same year, when it established the configuration of borders seen today. By 1970, as the city continued to exhibit the trends of decentralization, its population had fallen to 717,099 as the 12th largest American city. In 2000, it was the 19th largest, with a population of 596,974. The population decline was a result of various factors. Starting in the late 1960s, as in many cities in the Great Lakes \\"rust belt,\\" Milwaukee saw the loss of blue collar jobs and the phenomenon of \\"white flight.\\" The construction of Milwaukee's interstate highway system, beginning in 1964 with the completion of its first seven miles of I-94, heralded an age of greater decentralization, as southeastern Wisconsin suburbs continued to proliferate along interstate corridors, providing an alternative to crowded city living. Nevertheless, a backlash against the freeway in the late 1960s and early 1970s virtually ground Milwaukee's freeway construction to a halt, leaving the city with about 50% of the highways recommended by the Southeastern Wisconsin Regional Planning Commission's freeway plan.  1995 to the present  In recent years the city began to make strides in improving its economy, neighborhoods, and image, resulting in the revitalization of neighborhoods such as the Historic Third Ward, the East Side, and more recently, Bay View, along with attracting businesses to its downtown area. Marquette University has dedicated major projects to the Marquette Hill neighborhood including \\"campus town\\" and additional academic buildings, while demolishing some historic buildings and taking over other structures for its own use. The city continues to plan for revitalization through various projects. Largely because of its efforts to preserve its history, in 2006 Milwaukee was named one of the \\"Dozen Distinctive Destinations\\" by the National Trust for Historic Preservation. In the early 21st century, the city has undergone a large number of construction projects at rates not seen since the 1960s.

Burret was born in Saffig near Andernach in the Prussian Rhine Province. He originally studied law at Lausanne and Munich at the instigation of his father. Burret had a greater interest in natural science than in law, and he eventually abandoned his law studies to conduct botanical research in Berlin, where he earned a Ph.D in 1909 for his Taxonomic thesis, and quickly became one of Germany's most prominent botanists. Burret participated in many botanical science organizations in Germany, taking up leadership positions, such as Assistant at the Berlin Botanical Museum and Garden from 1909 to 1911, as well as Botanical Assistant and Lecturer at the Botanical Institute of the Agricultural College in Berlin in 1911 through 1921. In 1922 he was appointed Custodian of the Botanical Museum and Garden in Berlin, and later appointed to Professor of Botanical Biology at Berlin University. Burret made numerous travels in Europe and Africa, as well as South America. He was invited by the Brazilian government to make a trip to that country, specifically for the study of the various species of palm trees indigenous to the region. Shortly after his return to Germany, he voyaged to the Old World tropics, visiting Sri Lanka, the Malay Peninsula, Java, and Sumatra in 1938 and 1939. Burret was among the first botanists to conduct ground-breaking research on palms, beginning in Africa and later in South America and Indomalaysia. He identified, named and classified dozens of palm species, including Rhapis multifida (finger palm) and Livistona beccariana. He also named and classified other tropical flora, chiefly those of the linden family. The names of several genera of palm trees were named after him, including the genera Maxburretia and Burretiokentia. Burret is the author of numerous systematic papers on the floral families Tiliaceae (the linden family) and Palmae (the palm family). He died in Berlin.

The case was entitled \\"Un cas d'anorexie hyst√©rique\\" (A case of hysteria anorexia). The history of anorexia nervosa begins with descriptions of religious fasting dating from the Hellenistic era http://content.karger.com/ProdukteDB/produkte.asp?Doi=82033 and continuing into the medieval period. A number of well known historical figures, including Catherine of Siena and Mary, Queen of Scots are believed to have suffered from the condition.Hepworth, Julie. 1999. The Social Construction of Anorexia Nervosa. Thousand Oaks, CA: Sage Publications, Ltd\\"Was Mary Queen of Scots anorexic?\\" Dr. James A McSherry, Scottish Medical Journal, 30 (1985), 243-5. The earliest medical descriptions of anorexic illnesses are generally credited to English physician Richard Morton, in 1689. However it was not until the late 19th century that anorexia nervosa was to be widely accepted by the medical profession as a recognized condition. In 1873, Sir William Gull, one of Queen Victoria's personal physicians, published a seminal paper which established the term anorexia nervosa and provided a number of detailed case descriptions and treatments. In the same year, French physician Ernest-Charles Las√®gue similarly published details of a number of cases in a paper entitled De l‚ÄôAnorexie Hyst√©rique. Awareness of the condition was largely limited to the medical profession until the latter part of the 20th century, when German- American psychoanalyst Hilde Bruch published her popular work The Golden Cage: the Enigma of Anorexia Nervosa in 1978. This book created a wider awareness of anorexia nervosa among lay readers. A further important event was the death of the popular singer Karen Carpenter in 1983, which prompted widespread ongoing media coverage of eating disorders. Etymology The term anorexia nervosa was established in 1873 by Queen Victoria‚Äôs personal physician, Sir William Gull. The term anorexia is of Greek origin: an- (·ºÄŒΩ-, prefix denoting negation) and orexis (·ΩÑœÅŒµŒæŒπœÇ, \\"appetite\\"), thus translating to \\"nervous absence of appetite\\". In an earlier address, in 1868, Gull referred to the condition as Apepsia hysterica, but subsequently amended this to Anorexia hysterica and then to Anorexia nervosa. In a paper published in 1873, French physician Ernest-Charles Las√®gue published a paper entitled De l‚ÄôAnorexie Hyst√©rique. The use, and subsequent abandonment, of the term hysterica is of interest, since in the Victorian era the term was interpreted as applying to female behaviour. In 1873, Gull wrote:Medical Papers, Sir William Withey Gull, edited by T D Acland (1894) p311 Early descriptions =13th and 14th Centuries: Saint Catherine of Siena & Saint Hedwig of Andechs or Silesia= Of interest in terms of anorexia nervosa is the medieval practice of self- starvation by women, including some young women, in the name of religious piety and purity. This is sometimes referred to as anorexia mirabilis. By the thirteenth century, it was increasingly common for women to participate in religious life and to even be named as saints by the Catholic Church. Many women who ultimately became saints engaged in self-starvation, including Saint Hedwig of Andechs in the thirteenth century and Catherine of Siena in the fourteenth century. By the time of Catherine of Siena, however, the Church became concerned about extreme fasting as an indicator of spirituality and as a criterion for sainthood. Indeed, Catherine of Siena was told by Church authorities to pray that she would be able to eat again, but was unable to give up fasting.Hepworth, Julie. 1999. The Social Construction of Anorexia Nervosa. Thousand Oaks, CA: Sage Publications, Ltd. Historical cases of men's abstention from eating for religious or (other) spiritual reasons tends to be regarded as 'asceticism'. =1556: Mary, Queen of Scots= Mary, Queen of Scots Mary Stewart, known as Mary, Queen of Scots, was brought up as a child in the court of Henry II of France. Her medical history is documented in some detail thanks to the accounts of various ambassadors who sent reports back to their respective sovereigns. It is known, for example, that she had measles when she was five, rubella when she was seven, dysentery and malaria when she was 14 and smallpox when she was 15. She also had an unnamed illness as a teenager that some now believe to have been anorexia nervosa/chlorosis Her condition is described as involving weight loss, uneven appetite, vomiting and diarrhoea, pallor, fainting fits and breathing difficulties. She was, however, physically active throughout the illness; she continued to ride on horseback and dance in the evenings at the same time as these symptoms were observed. =1613: Jane Balan ‚Äì the ‚ÄúFrench fasting girl of Confolens‚Äù= The case of Jane Balans, the ‚ÄúFrench Fasting Girl of Confolens,‚Äù was described in 1613 by Pedro Mexio. He noted that she ‚Äúlived without receiving meat or drink for at least three years.‚Äù The condition began on 15 February 1599, when Jane Balans was around 10 years old. After suffering a fever and vomiting, she became withdrawn and weakened, refusing all food. Contemporary superstition blamed the wicked power of an apple given her by an old woman some months prior to the start of the condition; Mexio diagnosed the case as a ‚Äúdrying up of the liver and of all the parts serving to nourishment due to hurtful humours‚Äù\\"Fasting Girls and our attitudes to them\\" ‚Äì H Gethin Morgan, British Medical Journal, 1977, 2, 1652-1655 =1689: Richard Morton‚Äôs case descriptions= English physician Richard Morton is generally credited with the earliest medical descriptions of the anorexic condition in 1689 Two early medical descriptions of a syndrome involving loss of appetite and extreme fasting without any evidence of known disease are provided by the English physician Richard Morton in 1689. He provided two case descriptions in his ‚ÄúPhthisiologia: Or, a Treatise of Consumptions,‚Äù a 1694 translation of his 1689 work ‚ÄúPhthisiologica, seu exercitationes de phthisi libris comprehensae. Totumque opus variis histories illustratum.‚Äù Morton described these cases as ‚ÄúNervous Atrophy, or Consumption.‚Äù The first, in 1684, involved a ‚ÄúMr Duke‚Äôs daughter in St Mary Axe‚Äù (a street in the City of London). He writes of her thus: The girl consulted Dr Morton only after she had been ill for two years, and then only because she experienced frequent fainting fits. Morton described her as a ‚ÄúSkeleton only clad in skin.‚Äù He noted her ‚Äúcontinual poring upon Books‚Äù despite her condition and that she was indifferent to the extreme cold of an unusually severe winter. She refused any treatment (which consisted of the likes of cloves bruised in wine, and stomach plasters). She died three months later. The other patient was described as ‚ÄúThe Son of the Reverend Minister Steele.‚Äù He began to fast at the age of 16. Morton attributed his ‚Äúwant of appetite‚Äù to ‚Äústudying too hard‚Äù as well as the ‚Äúpassions of his mind.‚Äù Morton was more successful with this patient, who followed the doctor's advice to abandon his studies and move to the country, take up riding and drink plenty of milk, whereupon he ‚Äúrecovered his health in great measure.‚Äù =1770s: Timothy Dwight= In a biography of Noah Webster, a near-fatal case of anorexia was described of an instructor at Yale College: =1790: Robert Willan‚Äôs case description= Robert Willan was an English physician in London who is credited with founding dermatology as a medical speciality. He is one of the first to describe the symptoms of extreme weight loss in males, in his paper ‚ÄúA Remarkable Case of Abstinence,‚Äù published in Medical Communications in 1790. This describes the case of a young Englishman who died in 1786 after fasting for 78 days. He wrote: 19th Century descriptions =1859: Louis- Victor Marc√©‚Äôs case descriptions = Louis-Victor Marc√© (1828‚Äì1864), a French physician in Paris, published a number of case studies describing psychiatric disorders of women during and following pregnancy. His case descriptions included that of a patient displaying the symptoms of anorexia nervosa in 1859. In 1860, Marc√© wrote: =1868: William Gull (address to the British Medical Association)= Sir William Gull, who wrote the seminal work and coined the term anorexia nervosa In 1868, William Gull was a leading British physician living in London. That year, he described his observations of an emaciated condition in young women in an address to the British Medical Association (BMA) in Oxford. He observed that the causes of the condition were unknown, but that the subjects affected were \\"mostly of the female sex, and chiefly between the ages of sixteen and twenty three\\" although he also qualified this statement by adding that he had occasionally seen it in males of the same age. The Lancet (the BMA's in-house journal) published the following extract from Gull's address: =1873: Sir William Gull‚Äôs \\"Anorexia Nervosa\\" paper= By 1873, Sir William Gull had been made a Baronet and was one of four Physicians-in-Ordinary to Queen Victoria. In that year, he published his seminal work ‚ÄúAnorexia Nervosa (Apepsia Hysterica, Anorexia Hysterica)\\", in which he describes the three cases of Miss A, Miss B, and a third unnamed case.Anorexia Nervosa (Apepsia Hysterica, Anorexia Hysterica) (1873) William Withey Gull, published in the 'Clinical Society's Transactions, vol vii, 1874, p22 In 1887, he also recorded the case of Miss K, in what was to be the last of his medical papers to be published.Medical Papers, Sir William Withey Gull, edited by T D Acland (1894) p311-314 Sir William Gull writes that Miss A was referred to him on 17 January 1866. She was aged 17 and was greatly emaciated, having lost 33 pounds. Her weight at this time was 5 stone 12 pounds (82 pounds); her height was 5 ft 5 inches. Gull records that most of her physical condition was normal, with healthy respiration, heart sounds and pulse; no vomiting nor diarrhoa; clean tongue and normal urine. The condition was that of simple starvation, with total refusal of animal food and almost total refusal of everything else. Miss A, pictured in 1866 aged 17 (No. 1) and in 1870 aged 21 (No. 2). From the published medical papers of Sir William Gull Gull prescribed various remedies (including preparations of cinchona, biochloride of mercury, syrup of iodide of iron, syrup of phosphate of iron, citrate of quinine) and variations in diet without noticeable success. He noted occasional voracious appetite for very brief periods, but states that these were very rare and exceptional. He also records that she was frequently restless and active and notes that this was a \\"striking expression of the nervous state, for it seemed hardly possible that a body so wasted could undergo the exercise which seemed agreeable\\". In Gull's published medical papers, images of Miss A are shown that depict her appearance before and after treatment (right). Gull notes her aged appearance at age 17:Medical Papers, Sir William Withey Gull, edited by T D Acland (1894) p305-307 Miss A remained under Gull's observation from January 1866 to March 1868, by which time she seemed to have made a full recovery, having gained in weight from 82 to 128 pounds. Miss B was referred to Gull on 8 October 1868, aged 18, as a case of suspected tuberculosis. Gull noted that her emaciated appearance was more extreme than normally occurs in tubercular cases. His physical examination of her chest and abdomen discovered nothing abnormal, but he recorded a \\"peculiar restlessness\\" that was difficult to control. The mother advised that \\"She is never tired\\". Gull was struck by the similarity of the case to that of Miss A, even to the detail of the pulse and respiration observations. Miss B was treated by Gull until 1872, by which time a noticeable recovery was underway and eventually complete. Gull admits in his medical papers that the medical treatment probably did not contribute much to the recovery, consisting, as in the former case, of various tonics and a nourishing diet.Medical Papers, Sir William Withey Gull, edited by T D Acland (1894) p307-309 Although the cases of Miss A and Miss B resulted in recovery, Gull states that he observed at least one fatality as a result of anorexia nervosa. He states that the post mortem revealed no physical abnormalities other than thrombosis of the femoral veins. Death appeared to have resulted from starvation alone.Medical Papers, Sir William Withey Gull, edited by T D Acland (1894) 309 =1873: Ernest-Charles Las√®gue= Ernest-Charles Las√®gue was a French physician who practised at the Salp√™tri√®re, Piti√© and Necker hospitals. From 1869, he was a professor of clinical medicine at H√¥pital Necker. In 1873, Las√®gue published a paper entitled \\"De l‚ÄôAnorexie Histerique\\" in the Archives g√©n√©rales de M√©decin. Later that year, a translated version of the paper was published in the British Medical Times. Ernest-Charles Las√®gue, who named the condition L‚ÄôAnorexie Histerique. Las√®gue began the article by noting the importance of recognizing hysterical anorexia as a diagnostic entity, and then described the progression of the illness. He proposed the hypothesis that at the onset of the disease, lack of appetite originates from a wish to avoid pain. After this, a passage was deleted from the translation which described 'the paradoxical liveliness' of the anorexic. Las√®gue contrasted anorexic behaviour to the behaviour of people forced into starvation during the great famine in Paris. Lasegue then described the downward spiral of the anorexic, characterized by indifference, disgust, aversion, and eventually starvation, ill health and possible death. Las√®gue's paper contrasts with Gull's work by its focus on the psychological symptoms and examination of the role of parental influences and family interactions. He wrote about some of the family dynamics inherent in anorexic families, and provided a detailed description of a scene in which relatives try to persuade an anorexic to eat. In an addendum to his Anorexia Nervosa paper, Sir William Gull provides the following comment on Las√®gue's work:Medical Papers, Sir William Withey Gull, edited by T D Acland (1894) p310 Recent history Although the medical facts of anorexia nervosa have been documented since the 1870s, public awareness of the condition was limited until the second half of the 20th century. The concept of obsession with body image as a motivating factor for excessive fasting did not emerge until the mid-1960s, and it was not until 1980 that body image disturbance was formally included as a diagnostic criterion in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders published by the American Psychiatric Association.\\"Anorexia Nervosa in Adolescent Girls: A Culture-Bound Disorder of Western Society?\\" Elizabeth Hopton More recently, with progress in the field of neuroscience researchers have increasingly looked at anorexia as a biologically-based mental disorder, like schizophrenia. =Hilde Bruch research and publications= Hilde Bruch (March 11, 1904 - December 15, 1984) was a German-born American psychoanalyst, who practised at Baylor College of Medicine, Houston in the United States. Her early career focussed on obesity; but from the early 1960s she increasingly turned her attention to anorexia nervosa and its underlying causes. Bruch's 1973 work Eating Disorders: Obesity, Anorexia Nervosa, and the Person Within is considered a seminal work on the subject and was the first of several works that documented her work with anorexic subjects.http://jwa.org/thisweek/mar/04/1957/hilde-bruch Her best known work is The Golden Cage: the Enigma of Anorexia Nervosa, published in 1978. This book drew on material in Eating Disorders in a publication aimed at a lay readership. It sold 150,000 copies and is recognized as one of the earliest publications that created a wider awareness of anorexia nervosa beyond the medical profession.Harvard University Press http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/76296.The_Golden_Cage =Death of Karen Carpenter= Karen Carpenter was a popular American vocal and drummer musician. Her death on February 4, 1983, was attributed to heart failure as a consequence of anorexia nervosa.http://www.karencarpenter.com/passing_autop.html Public awareness of anorexia nervosa and other eating disorders was transformed by Karen Carpenter's death. Her young age (32) coupled with her fame as an entertainer captured public attention and received extensive media coverage. The sympathetic reporting of her illness prompted other celebrities, such as Jane Fonda and Lynn Redgrave, to come forward and share their experiences. Karen Carpenter's brother and singing partner, Richard Carpenter, established a fund dedicated to his sister's memory for research into anorexia nervosa.https://www.bbc.co.uk/dna/h2g2/A1045702 Notes References * Brumberg, Joan Jacobs; Fasting Girls: The History of Anorexia Nervosa.

He was the son and successor of Balian Grenier and Ida of Reynel. He did not exhibit the wisdom of his father in his dealings with the Saracens. In 1260, he attacked adjacent areas of Damas, killing a Mongol officer in the process. The officer was the nephew of Kitbuqa, Mongol general of Hulagu Khan. The Mongols avenged themselves by ravaging the territory of Sidon and sacked the castle. But Julian had already left the area beyond the sea. Julian, in response, sold the county to the Knights Templar. Ruined by the sale, he entered the order of the Temple himself.

She was 69, a widow and described as bespectacled, frail and friendly. She was also a devout Catholic and had been looking forward to the Easter services at St Joseph's Church in Wealdstone. On 14 April 1949, the dry-cleaning shop which Emily Armstrong owned, on St John's Wood High Street in London, failed to reopen after lunch and a queue began to build up outside. After a while, two women went round to the back of the shop to try to find out why it was closed and discovered her body. She had been beaten to death with a blunt instrument; police later determined she had been killed roughly an hour before her body was found at around 4 o'clock in the afternoon. A postmortem examination also showed that her skull had been shattered by at least 22 blows, later believed to have been inflicted by a claw hammer. Initially police thought Armstrong was the victim of a botched robbery. Her handbag was missing at the crime scene and the till was open and empty. The handbag was later found nearby with a bloody handkerchief bearing the laundry mark H-612, although no leads resulted from that piece of evidence. Police believed that Armstrong's killer had followed her back to her shop at about 2.10pm. While authorities pursued several theories, they failed to find a suspect. Witnesses reported having seen a \\"suspicious man\\" around 30 years old and between 5'5\\" and 5'6\\"; however, police were unable to identify the individual. A murderer who had recently escaped from Broadmoor Hospital was also considered before witnesses failed to identify him in a police line- up. Several Army deserters were questioned too, but all ended up being released. Police eventually concluded that Armstrong's murderer was either a tramp or \\"a man who had fled to Ireland\\".

On 11 November 2010, Part 2 of the Constitutional Reform and Governance Act 2010 was brought into force by a commencement order.The Constitutional Reform and Governance Act 2010 (Commencement No. 3) Order 2010 which deals with the ratification of (non- European) treaties and puts parliamentary scrutiny of treaties on a statutory footing.R (Miller) v Secretary of State for Exiting the European Union, [2017] UKSC 5 at [58]; and s23(1) CRGA. That changed the convention into a provision having legal force. History From the late 19th century it became the common practice to present the treaties of the United Kingdom to Parliament after they had come into force. On 1 April 1924, during the second reading debate on the Treaty of Peace (Turkey) Bill, Mr Arthur Ponsonby (Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs in Ramsay MacDonald's first Labour Government) made the following statement: At the same time, he stated that: The Ponsonby Rule was withdrawn during the subsequent Baldwin Government, but was reinstated in 1929 and gradually hardened into a practice observed by all successive governments. Other countries The practice on legislative approval of treaties before ratification varies from country to country. In most countries, the constitution requires most treaties to be approved by the legislature before they can formally enter into force and bind the country in question. This is particularly the case in states where international treaties become part of domestic law directly, without the need for special implementation as required in the case of the United Kingdom. In countries with a strong separation of powers, this may lead to treaties being signed by the executive, but not being ratified because of legislative opposition. In the United States, the president must submit treaties to the Senate for its advice and consent to ratification, which requires a two-thirds vote. A famous example of a treaty not receiving consent is the Treaty of Versailles, which ended World War I, because of opposition to the League of Nations. In Australia, the opposite situation exists although the practical effect does not greatly differ. The executive (that is, the Australian Federal Government) may enter into a binding treaty without the involvement of Parliament. The Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade states \\"The power to enter into treaties is an executive power within Section 61 of the Australian Constitution and accordingly, is the formal responsibility of the Executive rather than the Parliament\\"See Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade (accessed 19 December 2010) and discusses the issues surrounding this fact, including the way treaties are handled in practice (which does involve Parliament). Implementation of treaties does require legislation by federal parliament, following Section 51(xxix) of the Australian Constitution. Treaties must be signed by the Governor-General of Australia.

History  The club was founded on January 29, 1887, with the following intention: > The objects shall be to promote an interest in, and a love for whatever will > tend to make literature attractive as given in the form of printed and > illustrated volumes, to mutually assist in making researches and collections > of first and rare editions, and to promote elegance in the production of Odd > Volumes. The term odd is an eighteenth-century usage meaning varied or unmatched. In the club‚Äôs name it is a reference to book collecting, where an odd volume is a unique book, often the lone volume remaining from a larger set. By extension, each member of the club is an odd volume, selected for their uniqueness and for what they bring to the larger membership. The Sette of Odd Volumes, an English bibliophile dining-club founded in 1878, was the inspiration for the organization. George Clulow, President of the Sette of Odd Volumes, London, suggested the name The Club of Odd Volumes. The club began primarily as a dinner club, complementing established social clubs like the Somerset Club, Algonquin Club, Union Club, and Harvard Club. The group conducts lectures, meets regularly for dinners and lunches, collects and publishes books, and develops literary exhibits. The club hosts authors, book designers, artists, politicians, printers, and people prominent in creative fields. H. G. Wells was a guest at a meeting in 1906. In January 1921 Harry Houdini gave a talk on Books on Magic and the Theater. Winston Churchill was a guest at the Club, at a private luncheon, April 1949. Building The club has been at 77 Mt. Vernon Street in Beacon Hill since it purchased the building 1936. The building was the home of Sarah Wyman Whitman. Prior to 1936, it rented the buildings across the street at 50, 52 and 54 Mt. Vernon Street. Library and publications Between its founding and 1900, the club expanded its membership and activities to include an active exhibition and publishing program as well as the maintenance of a library. Members in the Club of Odd Volumes, currently limited to a maximum of 87, are often associated with Boston's universities, museums and libraries. They often include rare and antiquarian book collectors, curators, scholars, printers and typophiles. The club continues to offer exhibitions on a wide variety of themes, including the printing arts, typography and antiquarian books. The club has a substantial library of antiquarian books and an archive of letterpress printing. The collection, only accessible by club members, has about 2,200 titles.

Having trained to become an artist under his father, Jean the Younger showed as much talent as his father, and their work is nearly indistinguishable even to the expert. Just before his death, Jean the Elder published his noted work Livre de Perspective in 1560 in which he noted that his son would soon be publishing a companion entitled, Livre de Pourtraicture. While there have been some reports that an edition of Livre de Pourtraicture was first printed in 1571 and again in 1589, no copies appear to exist. Instead, the most likely first printing of the work was 1595 in Paris by David Leclerc, with woodcuts engraved by Jean Leclerc, just after Jean the Younger's death. The book is one of the most famous on the subject of artistic anatomy and was printed again and again into the late 17th century.

Both St Pancras and King's Cross were more central than Stratford and provided links to Eurostar, but with the Stratford City development opening in 2011 and Stratford is nearer to Docklands.

Mars Global Surveyor, NASA Swiss cheese features (SCFs) are curious pits in the south polar ice cap of Mars (Mare Australe quadrangle) named from their similarity to the holes in Swiss cheese. They were first seen in 2000 using Mars Orbiter Camera imagery. Description They are typically a few hundred meters across and 8 metres deep, with a flat base and steep sides. They tend to have similar bean-like shapes with a cusp pointing towards the south pole, indicating that insolation is involved in their formation. The angle of the Sun probably contributes to their roundness. Near the Martian summer solstice, the Sun can remain continuously just above the horizon; as a result the walls of a round depression will receive more intense sunlight, and sublimate much more rapidly than the floor. The walls sublimate and recede, while the floor remains the same.Hartmann, W. 2003. A Traveler's Guide to Mars. Workman Publishing. NY NY. As the seasonal frost disappears, the pit walls appear to darken considerably relative to the surrounding terrain. The SCFs have been observed to grow in size, year by year, at an average rate of 1 to 3 meters, suggesting that they are formed in a thin layer (8 m) of carbon dioxide ice lying on top of water ice. Later research with HiRISE showed that the pits are in a 1‚Äì10-meter-thick layer of dry ice that is sitting on a much larger water ice cap. Pits have been observed to begin with small areas along faint fractures. The circular pits have steep walls that work to focus sunlight, thereby increasing erosion. For a pit to develop, a steep wall of about 10 cm and a length of over 5 meters is necessary. Halo features Bright transient halo features around the carbon dioxide pits were found during the southern hemisphere's summer, during Mars year 28 (Earth year 2007). However, this was the only time these features have ever been seen. The data to understand these halos were taken from the MRO (Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter) Context Camera, the HiRISE (High Resolution Imaging Science Experiment) camera, and the MOC (Mars Orbiter Camera). The halo features were only visible during the solar longitudes (position of Mars around the Sun) of 279 degrees and 331 degrees. The halo's appearance correlates to the global dust storm that began earlier in the same Martian year. The lifetime of the halos was broken into trimesters; the first was 285‚Äì295 degrees Ls (Solar Longitude, time in the Martian Year), the second was 295‚Äì305 degrees Ls, and the final was counted at 305‚Äì340 degrees Ls. The average width of the high albedo area around the Swiss cheese features changes throughout its lifetime. In the first trimester the width was calculated to be 12.14 ¬± 1.44 meters wide, the second trimester was 32.96 ¬± 4.02 meters wide, and in the final trimester the average width was 55.48 ¬± 6.98 meters. The Hapke's reflectance theory was used to calculate the brightness of the features. During the first trimester, the halos were 4 +/- .3% brighter than the non-halo areas. Then in the second trimester the halos became more prominent at 7 +/- .7% brighter. Toward the end of their life they were the brightest recorded at 8 +/- .6% brighter than the surrounding topography. The halos are brighter than the surrounding region due to the impurities in the ice. The global dust storm filled the CO2 ice with sand and increased the grain size of the ice crystals.

Life and career Warwick was born in Aston, Birmingham, England. He was drawn to music during the skiffle boom of the late 1950s, joining Danny King and the Dukes and playing in Birmingham pubs and other venues. Ray Thomas and Mike Pinder, who had played together in Hamburg with the Krew Kats, decided to form a group with the addition of Denny Laine, who had fronted the Diplomats, Graeme Edge, who had been a member of Gerry Levene and the Avengers, and Eccles‚Äîwho changed his name to Clint Warwick by putting together the names of his favourite singer, Dionne Warwick, and his favourite actor, Clint Walker. The Moody Blues released one album with Warwick on bass, Go Now - The Moody Blues #1 (USA release on London Records), whereas The Magnificent Moodies was released on Decca in the UK, with sleeve notes by Donovan and a different track listing. The album yielded the hit single \\"Go Now\\", which reached No. 1 in the UK in January 1965, and the Top Ten in the U.S. Warwick took one co- lead vocal on that album with Laine, on the track \\"I've Got A Dream\\" (which featured Ray Thomas on flute). The closing track \\"'Bye Bye Bird\\" was issued as an overseas single and became a hit in France. Warwick was also on the EP The Moody Blues issued on Decca in 1964, and appeared on all their Decca singles, beginning with their debut, \\"Steal Your Heart Away\\" (1964), then \\"Go Now\\", \\"I Don't Want to Go On Without You\\", \\"Everyday\\", \\"From The Bottom Of My Heart (I Love You)\\" (all 1965), plus \\"Boulevard De La Madeline\\" (1966) up to \\"Life's Not Life\\" in 1966. Warwick's and Laine's era of the Moody Blues was featured on various compilation albums on both vinyl and CD, such as The Moody Blues Collection. A later CD issue of The Magnificent Moodies in 2006 included the rare track \\"People Gotta Give\\" (mistitled as \\"People Gotta Go\\") - a Pinder- Laine composition from the Boulevard De La Madeline French EP release. Film footage survives of the original line-up of The Moody Blues performing \\"Go Now\\" on BBC2's The Beat Room (later included in the BBC series Sounds of The Sixties) plus the first single's B-side \\"Lose Your Money (But Don't Lose Your Mind)\\" on Ready Steady Go! in August 1964 with Warwick and Laine performing, and has been re-screened in recent years. Feeling stressed by touring, Warwick left the band and his music career in 1966 to become a carpenter and spend time with his family. He released his first solo CD in 2002, and was working on another one at the time of his death from hepatitis at the age of 63.

Roosevelt, prior to U.S. involvement in the Second World War. It was intended to overcome the lack of coordination between existing agencies which, in part, it did by duplicating some of their functions. Roosevelt was persuaded to create the office several months before the United States entered the war by prominent New York lawyer William J. Donovan, who had been dispatched to London by the president to assess the ability of the British to continue fighting after the French capitulation to German aggression, and by American playwright Robert Sherwood, who served as Roosevelt's primary speechwriter on foreign affairs.Houseman, John, Front & Center, 1979, New York: Simon and Schuster, pp. 45-46. British officials, including John Godfrey of the British Naval Intelligence Division and William Stephenson, head of British Security Co-ordination in New York, also encouraged Roosevelt to create the agency. Donovan's primary interests were military intelligence and covert operations. Sherwood handled the dissemination of domestic information and foreign propaganda. He recruited the noted radio producer John Houseman, who because of his Romanian birth at the time was technically an enemy alien,Houseman, John (1979), op. cit., p. 23. to develop an overseas radio program for broadcast to the Axis powers and the populations of the territories they had conquered, which became known as the Voice of America. The first broadcast, called in German Stimmen aus Amerika (\\"Voices from America\\") aired on Feb. 1, 1942, and included the pledge: \\"Today, and every day from now on, we will be with you from America to talk about the war. . . . The news may be good or bad for us -- We will always tell you the truth.\\". Donovan's desire to use propaganda for tactical military purposes and Sherwood's emphasis on what later became known as public diplomacy were a continuing source of conflict between the two men.Houseman, John (1979), op. cit., pp. 25-28. On June 13, 1942, Roosevelt split the functions and created two new agencies: the Office of Strategic Services, a predecessor of the Central Intelligence Agency, and the Office of War Information, a predecessor of the United States Information Agency.

An Rn-valued process X = (X1,‚Ä¶,Xn) is a semimartingale if each of its components Xi is a semimartingale. Alternative definition First, the simple predictable processes are defined to be linear combinations of processes of the form Ht = A1{t > T} for stopping times T and FT -measurable random variables A. The integral H * X for any such simple predictable process H and real valued process X is :H\\\\cdot X_t\\\\equiv 1_{\\\\\\\\{t>T\\\\\\\\}}A(X_t-X_T). This is extended to all simple predictable processes by the linearity of H * X in H. A real valued process X is a semimartingale if it is c√†dl√†g, adapted, and for every t ‚â• 0, :\\\\left\\\\\\\\{H\\\\cdot X_t:H{\\\\rm\\\\ is\\\\ simple\\\\ predictable\\\\ and\\\\ }H\\\\le 1\\\\right\\\\\\\\} is bounded in probability. The Bichteler-Dellacherie Theorem states that these two definitions are equivalent . Examples * Adapted and continuously differentiable processes are finite variation processes, and hence are semimartingales. * Brownian motion is a semimartingale. * All c√†dl√†g martingales, submartingales and supermartingales are semimartingales. * It≈ç processes, which satisfy a stochastic differential equation of the form dX = œÉdW + Œºdt are semimartingales. Here, W is a Brownian motion and œÉ, Œº are adapted processes. * Every L√©vy process is a semimartingale. Although most continuous and adapted processes studied in the literature are semimartingales, this is not always the case. * Fractional Brownian motion with Hurst parameter H ‚â† 1/2 is not a semimartingale. Properties * The semimartingales form the largest class of processes for which the It≈ç integral can be defined. * Linear combinations of semimartingales are semimartingales. * Products of semimartingales are semimartingales, which is a consequence of the integration by parts formula for the It≈ç integral. * The quadratic variation exists for every semimartingale. * The class of semimartingales is closed under optional stopping, localization, change of time and absolutely continuous change of measure. * If X is an Rm valued semimartingale and f is a twice continuously differentiable function from Rm to Rn, then f(X) is a semimartingale. This is a consequence of It≈ç's lemma. * The property of being a semimartingale is preserved under shrinking the filtration. More precisely, if X is a semimartingale with respect to the filtration Ft, and is adapted with respect to the subfiltration Gt, then X is a Gt-semimartingale. * (Jacod's Countable Expansion) The property of being a semimartingale is preserved under enlarging the filtration by a countable set of disjoint sets. Suppose that Ft is a filtration, and Gt is the filtration generated by Ft and a countable set of disjoint measurable sets. Then, every Ft-semimartingale is also a Gt- semimartingale. Semimartingale decompositions By definition, every semimartingale is a sum of a local martingale and a finite variation process. However, this decomposition is not unique. =Continuous semimartingales= A continuous semimartingale uniquely decomposes as X = M + A where M is a continuous local martingale and A is a continuous finite variation process starting at zero. For example, if X is an It≈ç process satisfying the stochastic differential equation dXt = œÉt dWt \\\\+ bt dt, then :M_t=X_0+\\\\int_0^t\\\\sigma_s\\\\,dW_s,\\\\ A_t=\\\\int_0^t b_s\\\\,ds. =Special semimartingales= A special semimartingale is a real valued process X with the decomposition X = M + A, where M is a local martingale and A is a predictable finite variation process starting at zero. If this decomposition exists, then it is unique up to a P-null set. Every special semimartingale is a semimartingale. Conversely, a semimartingale is a special semimartingale if and only if the process Xt* ‚â° sups ‚â§ t Xs is locally integrable . For example, every continuous semimartingale is a special semimartingale, in which case M and A are both continuous processes. =Purely discontinuous semimartingales= A semimartingale is called purely discontinuous if its quadratic variation [X] is a pure jump process, :[X]_t=\\\\sum_{s\\\\le t}\\\\Delta X_s^2. Every adapted finite variation process is a purely discontinuous semimartingale. A continuous process is a purely discontinuous semimartingale if and only if it is an adapted finite variation process. Then, every semimartingale has the unique decomposition X = M + A where M is a continuous local martingale and A is a purely discontinuous semimartingale starting at zero. The local martingale M - M0 is called the continuous martingale part of X, and written as Xc (; ). In particular, if X is continuous, then M and A are continuous. Semimartingales on a manifold The concept of semimartingales, and the associated theory of stochastic calculus, extends to processes taking values in a differentiable manifold. A process X on the manifold M is a semimartingale if f(X) is a semimartingale for every smooth function f from M to R. Stochastic calculus for semimartingales on general manifolds requires the use of the Stratonovich integral.

The organisation is focused on decreasing water consumption in the UK by 2010 and on building a robust evidence base for large-scale water efficiency projects. Waterwise is the UK‚Äôs water \\"efficiency champion\\" ‚Äì \\"reaching the parts others cannot reach, and transform[ing] the concept of water resource efficiency into something compelling for consumers and business users.\\"Walter Menzies, Chief Executive, Mersey Basin Campaign Founding and aims Waterwise was established due to concerns of waters shortage and the upward trend in how much water is consumed in the UK. Factors that were taken into account were: current drought situation, geographical and climatological circumstances, consumer tendencies, available resources, and future prospects of supply. The following examples, situations, and comparisons were contemplated: *England has less rainfall than some North African countries. *Southern England has experienced one of the driest winters and spring periods since 1904 *Low river flows and groundwater levels across Southern England have resulted in environmental problems *Groundwater levels are falling and this is particularly so in the chalk aquifers which are very important to Southern England. *There have been demographic and social changes: modern lifestyles result in a greater demand for water. There has also been an increase in smaller size households that use proportionally more water. *Climate and global warming, as predicted by the UKCIP, is forecast to result in a deficit in soil moisture. This means that agriculture will compete with the water industry for increasingly scarce resources.WaterUK report to Select Committee of Parliament In 2006, all 26 UK water companies decided to establish an independent organisation which would promote water efficiency.Water UK In September 2006, The Waterwise Project was launched to build an evidence base and economic case for water efficiency in the UK.House of Commons, Early Day Motion, Water Efficiency, 26 October 2005 In England, the organisation sits on the Environment Minister‚Äôs Water Saving Group, alongside the water industry and regulators.Water Saving Group, Department of Environment, Food, and Rural Affairs [4] It was established with the stance that the key to water efficiency is reducing waste, not restricting use.Water Efficiency Journal Waterwise has an independent Board, which is drawn from the government, regulators, academia, business, other organisations, and from the water industry. The board meets four times a year and is responsible for overseeing Waterwise‚Äôs activities and its strategic direction. Waterwise's initial remit ran until September 2010. It has been renewed for an additional five years. Its aim is to decrease per capita consumption in the UK, and to build a strong social, political, and economic case for water efficiency. Audience and partners Waterwise works with all sectors of society to promote water efficiency and the wise use of water. To achieve their aims they work with key partners in water companies, governments (local, regional, and national), regulators, farmers, communities, businesses, civil society organisations, manufacturers, retailers, press and media, and individual consumers. Activities and events Waterwise participates in and leads various projects and events in order to complete their objectives: *Waterwise hosts the only annual Water Efficiency Conference in the UK. The conference brings together policymakers, doers, and thinkers to learns about and further discuss issues related to water efficiency. *Waterwise runs the Waterwise Recommended Checkmark. The Checkmark replaces the Marque, which was founded in October 2006 and first awarded in 2007.Marketing Week, 'Water Marque' scheme aims to aid product marketing The Waterwise Recommended Checkmark provides consumers with an ‚Äòat-a-glance‚Äô indicator of a product‚Äôs water saving potential. It aims to empower consumers to make water wise purchases. *Waterwise works closely with Government departments and regulators in developing policy to further water efficiency.A report to Defra Reviewing International Models of External Water Use Restrictions, as one example of Waterwise's policy work *Waterwise teams with UK water companies, universities, local governments, and builders to conduct large-scale water efficiency projects, workshops, and programmes. These projects range from water audits to domestic retrofit schemes to university lectures.Using Water Wisely: How to Change Consumer Behaviour, University of Oxford *Waterwise convenes The Saving Water in Scotland network which brings together key figures in Scotland to discuss and advance water efficiency.Saving Water in Scotland network draw up action plan to guard against future water shortages, waterbriefing.org *Waterwise also provides households, businesses, media, and the government with information on water in the UK and with assistance on water saving.Water/B&Q; Water Efficiency Campaign, an example of teaming up with business *Waterwise has ranked all current UK models of dishwashers and washing machines according to water efficiency.DirectGov Greener Living They are working on rankings for showers, toilets, and taps. *Waterwise also conducts research related to international water ecolabels, embedded water, water and climate change, and other various other research projects.The Crikey Water Diet, based on Waterwise research on embedded water *Waterwise is part of the Blueprint for Water coalition which has laid out a ten step plan for sustainable water.The Blueprint for Water The coalition is composed of Waterwise, The Royal Society for the Protection of Birds (RSPB), World Wide Fund for Nature (WWF-UK), Salmon and Trout Association, The Wildlife Trusts, The National Trust, Association of Rivers Trust, Anglers‚Äô Conservation Association, Wildfowl and Wetlands Trust, and The Fisheries and Angling Conservation Trust *In 2017 Waterwise launched the Water Efficiency Strategy for the UK.

For over thirty years, Squaw Valley Academy was a staple at Lake Tahoe and has enrolled students from all over the world. In 2020, Squaw Valley Academy became Lake Tahoe Preparatory School. The school was located on 2.8 acres and has five on- campus buildings; students have access to four. Three buildings have ground level classrooms and offices, while the second and third levels are dormitory rooms. The fourth is the administrative building, with offices and the dining hall on the ground level, and offices and classrooms on the second level. The fifth building, located at the rear of the property, is the maintenance building. Adjacent to the school is a county-owned recreational park, which includes a full-size AstroTurf soccer field, children's playground, tennis courts and picnic area. Located less than two miles from campus is the world- renowned Squaw Valley Ski Resort, home of the 1960 Winter Olympics. Less than five miles from campus is another, smaller resort, Alpine Meadows. Lake Tahoe is less than ten miles from campus is. Academics The Academy's primary focus was on college preparation for high school students. SVA was fully accredited by the Western Association of Schools and Colleges (WASC). SVA provides students with rigorous academics as well as Advanced Placement (AP) courses, ESL for international students, an Academic Learning Center for struggling students, college counseling throughout the whole college application process and SAT prep. SVA is also a Certified SAT testing location. Students eat breakfast before attending morning classes Monday through Friday, eat lunch, and depart campus for supervised afternoon activities. They return to campus for dinner, and after a brief rest, they gather for mandatory, two-hour study hall, Sunday through Thursday nights. Students use study hall to finish their coursework from the day, prepare for the coming class the following day, write and research reports, and gain further instruction on course topics from teachers. 100% of graduates of Squaw Valley Academy earn college acceptance. Athletics The school mascot is the brown bear. Squaw Valley Academy offers a wide range of sports. Male students may participate in intramural soccer and basketball. Students who wish to compete on a recreational level may enjoy other athletics during the spring, summer and fall seasons including tennis, disc golf, ultimate, road cycling, mountain biking, skateboarding, rock climbing, hiking, rafting, kayaking and dry-land training for competitive ski and snowboard racers. Due to the location of Squaw Valley Academy, students who meet or exceed set academic standards may ski or snowboard daily at Squaw Valley USA ski resort.

Population: History The first settlement on the site of the city was given to Uraza Tankacheev in 1631 by Russian king Michael Fedorovich for faithful service . The Tatar princes and murzas were owners of Ruzaevka (up to 1715). For refusing to accept the Christian faith these lands and serfs peasants were bequeathed to the great Emperor‚Äù In 1725 the land and peasants were given to the Lieutenant Tikhon Lukin, who owned it for more than 30 years, and then went bankrupt and in 1757 sold it to the court Councilor Jeremiah Struysky. More than a hundred years (1757-1861) Ruzaevka belonged to rich landowners-feudals Struysky. On the spot where now is the high school number 9, was a luxurious mansion. With Nicholay Eremeevich Struysky, linked one of the pages in the history of Ruzaevka. Nikolay Eremeevich settled in Ruzayevka in 1771. At that time he was 24 years old, he served 8 years in the Preobrazhensky regiment and retired with the rank of warrant officer guard. The estate bought by his father was located in lands and was rich by underground waters. Struysky invited famous architect V. V. Rastrelli to design the building and the Church . For the half year was built three-storey house-Palace. Nikolay Eremeevich lived there and wrote poetries, the third floor of his house was called \\"Parnassus\\". In 1783 he created in Ruzayevka private printing, in which worked peasants, that were trained to print in printing the Samara and Nizhny Novgorod. This printing was one of the best of its time, the printing house published mainly poems of Nikolay Eremeevich. These publications are extremely rare and they are of great bibliographic value. In 1905, it became one of the centers of the revolutionary movement, supporting the uprising of Moscow workers. 10 (23) December 1905 under the leadership of the committee headed by the engineer of the locomotive depot Afanasiy Petrovich Baykuzov went on strike, which resulted in power in the village and the nearest railway station was taken over by the workers. There was created \\"Ruzaevka republic\\", that lasted 12 days. Railway station Ruzayevka is mentioned in the poetry of the Latvian poet Alexander Chaks (Aleksandrs ƒåaks -latvian language) Touched by eternity (M≈´≈æƒ´bas skartie).

These were large multi-engine aircraft capable of flying several hours with larger bomb loads than the smaller Grossflugzeug bombers such as the Gotha G.V. Some of the earliest Riesenflugzeuge were given G-type designations before being redesignated, but a major distinction was that the requirements for the R-type specified that the engines had to be serviceable in flight. As a result, designs fell into two groups - those with the engines mounted centrally inside the fuselage using gearboxes and driveshafts to transfer the power to propellers mounted between the wings, and those with conventional powerplant installations mounted in large nacelles or the nose of the aircraft where engineers would be stationed for each group of engines. The transmission of power from the centrally mounted engines to the remote, most often wing-mounted propellers proved troublesome in practice and most operational examples of Riesenflugzeug-class aircraft were of the second type, as with the all-direct-drive Zeppelin-Staaken R.VI. The Idflieg (Inspektion der Fliegertruppen (Inspection of the Air Force), the German Army department responsible for military aviation), assigned the letter R to this type of aircraft, which would then be followed by a period and a Roman numeral type number. Seaplanes were denoted by the addition of a lower case \\"s\\" after the \\"R\\" in the designation. The Riesenflugzeuge were the largest aircraft of World War I. In comparison, the largest equivalent Allied aircraft were the Sikorsky Ilya MurometsThe first successful large aircraft, and the inspiration for the German Grossflugzeug and Riesenflugzeuge bombers with a span of 29.8 m (97 ft 9 in), the Caproni Ca.4 with a span of 29.9 m (98 ft 1 in), the one-off Felixstowe Fury with a span of 37.5m (123 ft) and the Handley Page V/1500 with a span of 38.41 m (126 ft 0 in), of which only three had been delivered by the time the war ended. The Riesenflugzeuge that bombed London during the First World War were larger than any of the German bombers used during the Second World War, and the largest built, the Siemens-Schuckert R.VIII of 1918 had a wingspan of . It was not until sixteen years later that a larger-wingspanned aircraft, the all-metal Soviet Tupolev Maksim Gorky eight-engined monoplane was built, with an unprecedented wingspan. The Riesenflugzeuge, most of which were built as \\"one-off\\" aircraft, were operational from 1915 to 1919.

B√ºlent Arel is the only artist who appears on both albums. The Arel composition is completely electronic, with articulated signals over a continuous background texture. Halim El-Dabh's composition, an \\"electronic drama,\\" has a text drawn from the epic of Layla and Majnun, and consists primarily of tape manipulated instrumental and vocal sounds. Ussachevsky's work has lyrics derived from the Enuma Elish creation myth, with chorus and electronic accompaniment. Babbitt's piece is composed entirely on the RCA Synthesizer of the Columbia-Princeton Computer Music Center. Davidovsky created a work manipulating sine wave, square wave, and white noise generators.

Education and early life  K√∂lling was born in Bremen, Germany. He earned a degree in informatics from the University of Bremen. In 1999, he was awarded a Ph.D. in computer science from the University of Sydney, for research on the design of an object- oriented programming environment and language supervised by John Rosenberg. Career and research From 1995 to 1997 he worked at the Sydney University, followed by a position as senior lecturer at Monash University and, from 2001, a post as associate professor at the University of Southern Denmark. He worked at the School of Computing at the University of Kent, UK, until February 2017.

Fernandez described a new feature of Visual Studio 2005 that \\"helps you understand objects at Design Time, rather than runtime.\\" This feature had striking similarities to the way the object test bench functions within BlueJ. K√∂lling did not act on the discovery. However, on May 11, 2006 Microsoft attempted to patent the idea. As the object test bench is essential to the way it functions, had Microsoft's patent been granted, it was likely that BlueJ would have had to have been discontinued. K√∂lling spoke to Microsoft, namely Jane Prey, and eventually the patent was dropped. Fernandez posted a response on his blog where he says \\"the patent application was a mistake and one that should not have happened. To fix this, Microsoft will be removing the patent application in question.

The station is licensed to the NMU Board of Trustees, financed by the student activity fee, and operates separately from the University's other media outlet, WNMU-FM, and WNMU (TV). WUPX broadcasts from the Northern Center on the campus of Northern Michigan University. History Beginning in 1970 as WBKX, Radio X was initially broadcasting on the AM dial from the Lee Hall Gallery. In the 1980s, Radio X switched to a cable-only format (see cable radio). WBKX achieved FM status in September 1993, but during the FM licensing process, the Federal Communications Commission required Radio X to change its call letters to WUPX, as the station is known today. In 1990-1992 Christian Johanneson was the Business Manager for the station. In 1991 Theodore Fisher was the GM and initiated the transition from cable-only to on-air. Station programming The WUPX programming currently consists of several hour long slots every day. Each show is deejayed by a NMU student volunteer. All volunteers are selected by the General Manager and the Station Manager when additional volunteers are required. WUPX broadcasts a wide variety of music including electronic, country, folk, heavy metal, hip hop, industrial, jazz, reggae, rock, classical, pop, Christian, world, R&B;, independent, noise, and local musicians. The student deejays have individual control over their programming as long is it adheres to FCC regulations, which adds to the variety of programming.

She first appeared in 2002, before Albert quit the role in 2004. She made her final appearance during 2005, before making a brief return in 2006. She did not return for the funeral of her sister Steph Dean in 2010. Casting In October 2004 Albert decided not to renew her contract, she expressed that she wanted to leave to further her acting career. In September 2006 it was announced that Albert would make a brief return to the show in November 2006. Storylines Debbie arrived in 2002 with her father Johnno (Mark Powley), mother Frankie (Helen Pearson), brothers Jake (Kevin Sacre) and Craig (Guy Burnett) and sister Steph (Carley Stenson). She instantly fell for the charms of hard man Dan Hunter. The second child and first daughter of the Dean Family, Debbie started dating Dan as she often tried to loosen him up. Debbie started to work for Tony at ‚ÄòIl Gnosh‚Äô, but her heart had always been set on becoming a singer. Debbie went on a reality show where she revealed that Dan lost his virginity to her. This left Dan angry, but eventually he forgave her. However, there was shock for Debbie when Dan was arrested for being a suspect as the serial killer of Hollyoaks, and she was also shocked that he slept with victim Roxy. Both convinced that Dan was innocent, Debbie and her father Johnno (Colin Wells) stuck by him and supported him as he was released. However, things took another turning point for Debbie when Dan was arrested for the murder of Toby Mills (Henry Luxemburg), who was the real killer and again became a suspect after Dan's sister Ellie Hunter (Sarah Baxendale) blamed him for the murder of her husband. This left Debbie devastated as she tried to come terms with Dan's arrest, while there was more bad news for Debbie as her family were struggling with debts and sister Steph had epilepsy, after almost becoming a victim of Toby. Johnno supported Debbie and the family through this as best he could, and in return Debbie showed her loyalty to both her family and Dan, but was devastated when Dan was sent down for 18 years after Ellie testified against him. Still, Debbie believed there was hope as she tried to change Ellie's mind but there was a blow for her, when Dan told her that their relationship was over. Confused and puzzled, Debbie turned to Darren Osborne (Ashley Taylor Dawson) and the pair slept together, but it only lasted a short while. However, Debbie faced another shock when Ellie told the truth and Dan was released from prison. Dan wanted to be with Debbie, but after she confessed that she slept with Darren, Dan said that there would be no relationship between the pair. With help from Johnno, Debbie tried to put all of this behind her, however, things became even more complex when Dan started dating Debbie's sister Steph for a while, but that lasted a short time after Dan admitted that he was still in love with Debbie. However, Debbie promised Steph that she would not date Dan as it would break Steph's heart. Soon, Debbie's dream became true when she got a job offer to sing on a cruise ship in November 2004. But after her parents Johnno and Frankie's marriage collapsed, and Johnno decided to leave Hollyoaks when the couple divorced shortly afterwards, Debbie was unsure of whether to go or not. With Frankie, Jake, and Dan supporting her, Debbie decided to take the job but there was another setback when Dan died during his rallycross racing accident. After Dan's death, Debbie collapsed in tears as she found an engagement ring Dan had been planning to give to her on Christmas Day. By New Year's Eve, Debbie had decided not to wallow in grief and misery but to see more of the world and enjoy her life to the fullest ‚Äî or as much as she could without Dan by her side. Debbie stayed until the funeral and regretted that she and Dan never got together. After some convincing from Dan's best mate Ben Davies (Marcus Patric), Debbie decided to take the job and start a fresh new life and to succeed with her dreams. Debbie briefly returned in 2005 for a double wedding in the family. She witnessed her mother Frankie marry Jack Osborne (James McKenna) and her brother Jake marry Becca Hayton (Ali Bastian). She also returned in 2006 to re-open The Dog after Sam Owen (Louis Tamone) blew it up. She also had a job in the West End but lost her job when Steph became famous for her kiss and tell with Joe Jones. Post Departure In April 2007, Jake told his mother that Debbie had been in a car accident and while she was not seriously hurt, she had broken her leg. In September 2007, Steph visited Debbie. In October 2008, Steph and Tom Cunningham (Ellis Hollins) went to stay with Debbie for several weeks and Debbie hit it off with Tom, after also visiting their father Johnno. In November 2010, Debbie, along with Craig and Jake and father Johnno were devastated of Steph's death, and did not attend the funeral. In December 2010, Frankie mentions to Duncan Button (Dean Aspen) that she and the other Deans and Osbournes are spending Christmas with Debbie. In 2015, Frankie stayed with Debbie for a number of months. Following Frankie's death from a stroke in October 2017, Debbie does not attend the funeral.

It was built in the 1790s but fell into disuse and disrepair by its closure in 1988. It is recorded in the National Heritage List for England as a designated Grade I listed building. Major renovation work was undertaken to repair and convert the building for use as a performance space and circus skills school Circomedia.  Building  It is in the Georgian Portland Square. It was designed by Daniel Hague although the original St Paul's Church was to be designed by James Allen in a Greek style. Work was started on the church in 1789 and completed in 1794. St Paul's became known as the Wedding Cake Church from the unusual tiered tower. The tower was designed to hold a ring of ten bells, however only four bells were purchased, all cast by John Rudhall of Gloucester, two in 1792 and the 6th and tenor bells of the proposed ring in 1795. The tenor bell is still hung for full-circle ringing, and the other bells were removed and are now hung in other churches - the two smaller bells are now at St Michael's, Buckland Dinham and St. John's, Wagga Wagga, and the second largest is now the tenor bell at St. James', Sydney. The gates and railings are a grade II* listed building. Black and white photograph of St Paul's Church, Portland Square, Bristol, UK from 1926, showing the distinctive tower covered in scaffolding for maintenance and repair. The shot is from the south west of the church, and there is a small blurred figure in the foreground.  Closure and redevelopment  The church closed in 1988 in state of disrepair and was boarded up for many years. A lot of damage was caused by swollen ironwork exploding the Bath Stone and water leaking in, causing erosion to the plaster ceilings. About ¬£2.3 million from the Heritage Lottery Fund funded the restoration and conversion work. The church is now a redundant church in the care of the Churches Conservation Trust. It was declared redundant on 1 November 1988, and was vested in the Trust on 1 April 2000. In 2005 the church was converted into its present form as the home of Circomedia, a circus school, but remains consecrated. It still boasts an ornate Georgian plaster ceiling, stone columns and a wealth of decorative stained glass, but has now been equipped with aerial and trapeze equipment and a pale Maple wood sprung dance floor. On 19 October 2007, it won the international RICS Community Benefit Award 2007. St Paul's was chosen as the winner by judges because of the transformation it has undergone under the Churches Conservation Trust.

It is in the Cote Heath ward of the High Peak Borough Council. It has a primary school, a park, a pub, a working men's club and a Methodist church. From 1938 to 1969, the RAF 28 Maintenance Unit was based at Harpur Hill and it included the RAF Mountain Rescue Team for the Peak Disctrict. The RAF used Harpur Hill as an underground munitions store. Tunnels were dug out to house munitions and ordnance. When the RAF left the tunnels were used as a mushroom farm. When the tunnels closed they were sold to a group of local businessmen and used as a cold store for cheese; a warehouse was built for dry and bonded wines and spirits. A number of local hauliers provided the transport for these goods. One of the hauliers was Lomas Distribution which was bought out by Christian Salvesen and was a major employer in the area; it later sold the site to French transport company Norbert Dentressangle. Many of the bunkers can still be seen in the surrounding hillside. The Health and Safety Executive Laboratory is not far from Harpur Hill. From 1916 to 1918 the site housed The Frith Artillery Range. A railway was constructed with old London Underground Jubilee Line trains which were used to reconstruct the 7 July 2005 London bombings. A red flag is flown at the laboratory when an explosion is imminent. Also nearby is Far Hill Quarry, now flooded, where swimming is discouraged by the authorities as unsafe due to the high pH level of the water.

MOMIX developed out of work Pendleton did for a celebration of Erik Satie at the Paris Opera in 1978. The company is named after a solo, \\"Momix,\\" that Pendleton created for the 1980 Winter Olympics in Lake Placid, which derives its name from a milk supplement fed to veal calves. An offshoot of the dance company Pilobolus, which Pendleton co-founded in 1971, MOMIX presents works that combine acrobatics, dance, gymnastics, mime, props, and film in a theatrical setting. The company has successfully toured internationally, performing on five continents. MOMIX is a for-profit contemporary dance company. Theatre, film and television MOMIX has made five Italian RAI television features broadcast to 55 countries (including the USSR and China) and has performed on Antenne II in France. MOMIX was also featured in PBS's ‚ÄúDance in America‚Äù series and on Canadian television with Charles Dutoit and the Montreal Symphony in the Rhombus Media film of Mussorgsky's ‚ÄúPictures at an Exhibition,‚Äù winner of an International Emmy for Best Performing Arts Special.

He was the younger son of Colonel William Pulteney, of Misterton in Leicestershire, and Mary Floyd. His elder brother, William was one of the leading English statesmen of the 18th century and was eventually created Earl of Bath; he had inherited the family fortune including considerable estates in what is now central London, and also the parliamentary borough of Hedon in Yorkshire. Harry entered Parliament in as member for Hedon in 1722. His brother William had already been its MP for 17 years, and had offered the second seat to his cousin, Daniel Pulteney; but as Daniel was also elected for the (more prestigious) constituency of Preston, this left a vacancy which Harry was able to fill (William continuing to hold the other seat). He was MP for Hedon until 1734, and again from 1739 to 1741, and also represented Hull for three years from 1744, and was also for a period Governor of Hull. In 1739 Pulteney became Colonel of the 13th Regiment of Foot, which as was the custom of the time was consequently referred to as Pulteney's Regiment. Under his command the regiment served at Dettingen, Fontenoy and during the Jacobite Rebellion at Falkirk and Culloden. Later they took part in the road-building programme in the Scottish Highlands, and the regiment's officers were among those unsuccessfully investigating the famous Appin murder of 1752. Pulteney was promoted to Major-General in 1743, Lieutenant-General in 1747 and to General in 1765. Pulteney was his brother's heir and inherited his fortune on his death in 1764, but he himself died on 26 October 1767 at the age of 81. He was buried in Westminster Abbey.

A slip is a liquid mixture or slurry of clay and/or other materials suspended in water. It has many uses in the production of pottery, and other ceramic wares.Dictionary Of Ceramics. Arthur Dodd & David Murfin. 3rd edition. The Institute Of Minerals. 1994. In pottery the two most important uses of slip are: firstly, to form the basic shape by slipcasting with moulds; this has been extremely important for several centuries, and secondly, to protect or decorate the pottery, which is discussed below. Engobe, from the French word for slip, is an American English term for materials similar to a slip, though the definition seems variable. Some American sources say it is synonymous with slip, and use it in preference to \\"slip\\",Peterson, Susan and Jan, Working with Clay, 2002, Laurence King Publishing, , 9781856693172, google books while others draw distinctions,Hopper, robin, Making Marks: Discovering the Ceramic Surface, 2004, Krause Publications Craft, , 9780873495042, google books mainly in terms of engobe using materials other than clay. On one definition engobe, as compared to slip, has somewhat lower clay content, higher proportion of flux, and added filler, and in some cases a colorant.Duncan Shearer It is mostly used in relation to contemporary pottery, but sometimes for slip in historical contexts. Decoration and protection Charger with Charles II in the Boscobel Oak, English, c. 1685. The plate's diameter is 43 cm; such large plates, for display rather than use, take slip-trailing to an extreme, building up lattices of thick trails of slip. Chinese porcelain sugar bowl with combed, slip-marbled decoration, c. 1795 Slipware is pottery decorated by slip placed onto a wet or leather-hard clay body surface by dipping, painting or splashing. Some slips will also give a moderate degree of the hardening effect, and decreased permeability, that a ceramic glaze would give. Often only pottery where the slip creates patterns or images will be described as slipware, as opposed to the many types where a plain slip is applied to the whole body, for example most fine wares in Ancient Roman pottery, such as African red slip ware (note: \\"slip ware\\" not \\"slipware\\"). Decorative slips may be a different colour than the underlying clay body or offer other decorative qualities such as a shiny surface. Selectively applying layers of colored slips can create the effect of a painted ceramic, such as in the black-figure or red-figure pottery styles of Ancient Greek pottery. Slip decoration is an ancient technique in Chinese pottery also, used to cover whole vessels over 4,000 years ago.Vainker, 17, 22-23 Principal techniques include slip-painting, where the slip is treated like paint and used to create a design with brushes or other implements, and slip-trailing, where the slip, usually rather thick, is dripped onto the body. Slip-trailed wares, especially if Early Modern English, are called slipware. Chinese pottery also used techniques where patterns, images or calligraphy were created as part-dried slip was cut away to reveal a lower layer of slip or the main clay body in a contrasting colour. The latter of these is called the \\"cut-glaze\\" technique.Vainker, 116-117 Slipware may be carved or burnished to change the surface appearance of the ware. Specialized slip recipes may be applied to biscuit ware and then refired. Barbotine (another French word for slip) covers different techniques in English, but in the sense used of late 19th-century art pottery is a technique for painting wares in polychrome slips to make painting-like images on pottery. Other uses in pottery A slip may be made for various other purposes in the production and decoration of ceramics. Slip can be used: *As a means of mixing the constituents of a clay body. *To join sections of unfired ware or greenware, such as handles and spouts. *To fix into place pieces of relief decoration produced separately, for example by moulding. This technique is known as sprigging; an example is Jasperware.Dictionary Of Ceramics. Arthur Dodd & David Murfin. 3rd edition. The Institute Of Minerals. 1994. *When slip is used to join two pieces of greenware together, it is generally used with a technique known as scratch and slip, whereby the contact points on both pieces are scored with multiple criss-crossing lines and slip painted on one piece over the scores. An additive with deflocculant properties, such as sodium silicate, can be added to the slip to disperse the raw material particles. This allows a higher solids content to be used, or allows a fluid slip to be produced with a minimal amount of water so that drying shrinkage is minimised, which is important during slipcasting.Industrial Ceramics.

The existing William B. Umstead Bridge, built in 1955, was unable to handle the high volume of traffic. To help alleviate traffic congestion and provide an additional emergency evacuation route from the Outer Banks, planning for the new bridge began in earnest. In January 1997, Wilbur Smith Associates was selected for the design of the bridge. In April 1998, Balfour Beatty Construction was awarded the prime construction contract.

Bernardino Genga (1620‚Äì1690) was a scholar of Classical medical texts, editing several works of Hippocrates. He also had a great interest in the preparation of anatomical specimens as well as the anatomy of ancient Greek and Roman sculpture. These interests led to his work at the French Academy in Rome, where he taught anatomy to artists. He was born in Mondolfo in the Duchy of Urbino and died in Rome, where he practiced surgery in the Hospital of Santo Spirito in Sassia and San Giacomo degli Incurabili. In 1672, he published his noted Anatomia Chirurgica, a textbook for surgeons which went through a number of editions. A year after his death was published the beautiful Anatomia per Uso et Intelligenza del Disegno, which consisted of renderings of his anatomical preparations by the artist Charles Errard (1606‚Äì1689), director of the Accademia, and most likely engraved by Fran√ßois Andriot (died 1704). Giovanni Maria Lancisi (1654‚Äì1720), the Papal physician, edited the work and provided much of the commentary. Anatomia per Uso et Intelligenza del Disegno consists of 59 copperplate engravings of text and illustrations printed on one side only. After the engraved title is a plate with allegorical emblems of death. Of the illustrated plates, the first 23 deal with osteology and myology drawn from Genga's anatomical preparations. The remainder consists of representations of antique statues viewed from different angles, including the Farnese Hercules, the Laoco√∂n (without his sons), the Borghese Gladiator, the Borghese Faun, the Venus de Medici, the Youth Pulling a Thorn from his Foot, and the Amazon of the House of Cesi. A variant of this work lacks the final three images and contains the words \\"libro primo\\" on the engraved title, though there was never a libro \\"secundo\\" published.

The prestige of the title probable attached to the fact that Narbonne had been a capital of the ancient Roman administration of the eponymous province of Gallia Narbonensis. On the death of his cousin Bertha of Rouergue in 1065, William IV of Toulouse inherited the county of Narbonne. His brother and successor, Raymond IV, elevated the status to that of duke. Raymond's son and successor, Alfonso Jordan, also employed the title with royal approval (as Amphusus dux Narbonensis provincie) and his son, Raymond V placed it first before his other titles as an implication of its importance (probably related to its Roman connection). The family was only dispossessed of the title when Raymond VI brought down the wrath of the French king for his supposed support of Cathar heresies. In 1215, following the successes of the Albigensian Crusade, Philip II of France granted Simon IV de Montfort, already Earl of Leicester, the titles of Duke of Narbonne and Count of Toulouse. Arnauld Amaury, then Archbishop of Narbonne, also claimed the ducal dignity and entered a dispute with Simon which was not resolved before the latter's death (1218).

Art critics have called Koons' distinctive style ‚Äúmagic realistic,‚Äù because the viewer tends to read into the picture more than actually appears.Greenville Piedmont, December 4, 1973, 17. Koons‚Äô deceptively simple paintings, mostly in watercolor or polymer, give the viewer an impression of extreme detail in old buildings such as barns, cotton gins, and mills.Landrum, 47. Usually Koons removed signs of modernity such as telephone poles and electric wires. In a 2010 interview, Koons told a reporter, \\"Bob Jones, Sr. once said you can't get the sand out the country boy's ears. That's true with me. An artist must know something about his subject or he will surely have difficulty painting it. My experience as a child and youth in rural Michigan has given me knowledge of my subjects, thus the opportunity to record this passing history of Americana.\\"Landrum, 48. In a 1972 interview, Koons noted that he enjoyed playing with space, especially in a building opening. He virtually never included figures in his paintings but he often teased the viewer with open doors that \\"give the impression of recent activity.\\" Koons‚Äô work has been compared to that of Andrew Wyeth, although Koons himself believed the greatest influences on his art were the shadows and simplicity of Edward Hopper and the straight lines of Mondrian.Greenville News, November 19, 1972, 2B.

On the hospital site modern houses have been built as well as a children's play area and a village hall. Just to the north of the village is Weston and Waverley Wood. The Conservative politician, Dudley Smith is one of the best known people to have lived in the village. In November 1605 a group of men, including Robert Catesby, who were involved in the gunpowder plot, passed through the village. They were fleeing from London after the arrest of Guy Fawkes. Apparently they were on their way to Wales (via Warwick Castle to steal fresh horses), after a meeting at Dunchurch, near Rugby.

Career Baur worked for some time as a club DJ, a radio DJ, and a music producer for various advertising companies. In 1989, Baur expanded his musical career by establishing the Manifold Records Music & Marketing label. For the label's first release, Baur produced the vinyl-only single \\"I Like the House\\" under the alias \\"Beatproduction.\\" The song became quite popular throughout local clubs and private radio stations and would earn Baur considerable success. With his newfound success, Baur went on to establish his own recording studio for his music and advertising productions, and he also founded a music publishing company. One of the Manifold label's greatest successes came in 1995, when Baur, working under the alias \\"DJ Crack,\\" released the song \\"Singular.\\" The song was played during the Mayday music festival of that year, and quickly became an underground club hit. To this date, Baur has released numerous successful club hit singles, most popular in the underground club scene in Europe. However, Baur's first move into the mainstream music scene came when he licensed several of his label's songs to be included on the soundtrack for the highly popular Rockstar racing video game Midnight Club II. Genres and aliases Currently, Michael Baur tours as a club DJ throughout Europe and the United States. Baur is notorious for his use of many aliases in order to differentiate between the many genres of his music productions. His use of numerous aliases arguably enhances his underground status to an extreme. Most of his releases are under the \\"DJ Darkzone\\" and \\"DJ Crack\\" aliases, both classified under techno and trance. DJ Darkzone is most famous in the United States for his song \\"Infinity in Your Hands,\\" which was primarily featured in the commercials for Midnight Club 2. Under another alias, \\"Michael da Brain,\\" Baur produces songs in the acid techno genre. Fellow label producers Franz Merwald (under the alias Frank D. Noise) and Martin Kaiser (under the alias Ray Clarke) also produce their own acid techno songs. Together, the three release their acid techno songs under the group alias \\"Brain,\\" sometimes collaborating on individual Brain songs as well. Along with their song names, Brain songs are given numbers in the order of their time of release, starting from \\"Brain 1.\\" Michael Baur and several other artists (including labelmates Ray Clarke and Eric del Mar) produce songs under the group alias \\"Code\\" in the same fashion as \\"Brain.\\" Baur has over 13 unique aliases, not including those used in group aliases.

It was initially broadcast on BBC Two, from 22 February 2007, before moving to BBC One in October 2009. It currently airs on Friday evenings, and is usually repeated a few nights later. History =BBC Two= The show mirrors So and V with strong adult humour along with Norton's monologue at the beginning of the show and often a musical guest to play out over the credits. Although the rude objects in \\"Graham's drawer\\" did not survive, the phone calls and hidden camera surprises have. These surprises are sometimes centred on the guests, such as Sarah Beeny's dating website, a TARDIS on the South Bank when David Tennant appeared and a wine-tasting group drinking G√©rard Depardieu's wine whilst he was on the show. Some of the surprises, such as the wine-tasting, have been arranged through ideas submitted by viewers, stating where they will be when the show is recorded. At the end of the show, after any band or artist performance, an extra five minute section of the show was recorded, known as the \\"Cooldown\\". This section was seen in an extended weekend repeat, called Graham Norton Uncut, and was also made available as a downloadable podcast. As well as showing the \\"Cooldown\\", it also included previously unseen parts from the original episode. This section often involved the audience, such as guessing an audience member's partner or playing mass charades. After Norton's short monologue, he always introduced two guests. If there was a third guest, they were usually introduced later in the show. If the two guests are connected in some way (for example, Dustin Hoffman and his wife), they were the only ones introduced at the start. If musical guests were involved in the show, one of several things happened. Some performers, such as Enrique Iglesias, were on stage from the very beginning. Others, such as Gareth Gates came on stage about 5 to 7 minutes before their performance for a short interview. Also, some musical guests only performed during the end credits and participated in the Cooldown section of the programme. However, all bands performed during the credits and were interviewed in the Cooldown segment. =BBC One= Once the show moved to BBC One, it moved to Monday nights and the guest list increased to three or occasionally four people, with an accompanying reduction in Norton's signature pieces. A typical show consisted of one big celebrity name, a comedian sitting in the aforementioned comedy chair and a well-known musical personality who would all be introduced after the monologue. Sometimes, three guests are introduced at the top of the show with the musical guest brought in about 10 to 15 minutes before the end of the show. Unlike the BBC Two show, the BBC One show does not end with the musical performance, but with a new audience participation segment called That's All We've Got Time For, where audience members sit in the famous red chair and begin to tell a humorous story. Norton and his guests listen to the stories and if Norton gets bored, he ‚Äì or occasionally a guest ‚Äì pulls the lever and the chair falls backwards, dumping the speaker from it. The red chair segment was inspired by comedian Ronnie Corbett's longwinded armchair monologues.The Graham Norton Show, BBC One, 1 April 2016 After the end of Friday Night with Jonathan Ross, it was announced that The Graham Norton Show would be taking over the coveted Friday night slot. The show premiered on 22 October 2010. Series The first series began at 10 pm on 22 February 2007 on BBC Two and was originally slated to end on 24 May 2007 after 13 episodes. However, the series proved such a hit that it was extended for an additional six episodes. A 12-week second series began on 11 October 2007 and culminated with a Boxing Day special and a New Year's compilation from previous episodes. The show made its North American premiere on BBC America on 2 June 2007, one week after what was supposed to be the final episode of Series 1 (before its extension). Series 2 premiered on BBC America on 20 October 2007. Unlike the previous series, each episode premiered in the United States only nine days after the initial UK broadcast. However, the final three episodes were broadcast in reverse order (with Episode 12 being shown on BBC America a few days earlier than on BBC Two. The same thing occurred in Series 4 with the Christmas special airing on BBC America 10 days before the BBC Two broadcast. Series 3 began its run on 17 April 2008. For series 3, the \\"Cooldown\\" segment had been dropped and the show was just the full uncut 45-minute version. The show continued to be broadcast in a 30-minute version on Thursdays at 10:00 pm with Graham Norton Uncut, the uncut version, shown on Sundays at 11:00 pm in a 45-minute version. However, BBC Two in Wales sometimes broadcast the Thursday edition later than the rest of the BBC Two regions, usually after Newsnight at 11.20 pm because they would usually have local programmes in the 10 pm slot. BBC Two Northern Ireland did the same, and during series three, they broadcast Thursday's show on Friday nights at 10 pm on BBC Two Northern Ireland because of local programming on Thursdays. Series 4 began its run on 3 October 2008 at 10:00 pm on BBC Two (however, both BBC Two Wales and BBC Two Northern Ireland broadcast the show at a later time due to their regional programming). The Sunday uncut editions have been kept, with the first uncut edition broadcast on BBC Two late on Sunday night. Since its sixth series, The Graham Norton Show has aired on BBC One.

Norton said: \\"I think we've just done a deal for another three years, which, right now, feels like a long time.\\" The Graham Norton Show had been produced from the ITV Studios on London's Southbank since it began in 2007.

The show produced its final episode from The London Studios on Thursday 15 February 2018 which aired on BBC One on Friday 16 February 2018.

After four episodes, the show returned to its 10:35 pm timeslot. Series 28, which began on 2 October 2020, saw the programme return to the studio, albeit with some layout changes to allow Norton and the studio guests to observe social distancing.

In 1969 the second class accommodation was replaced with ordinary carriages and the popular Hadrian Bar carriage was withdrawn. The remaining first class carriages were repainted into grey livery with blue window surrounds. By the 1970s the non-air conditioned Pullman carriages were becoming dated, especially in comparison to the newer British Rail Mark 2 carriages then being introduced.

Schlingensiefs Container (Ausl√§nder raus! Schlingensiefs Container), alternately named \\"Wien-Aktion\\", \\"Please Love Austria‚ÄîFirst European Coalition Week\\", or \\"Foreigners Out‚ÄîArtists against Human Rights\\", is an art project and television show from 2000 that took place within the scope of the annual Wiener Festwochen. It was created by Christoph Schlingensief and directed by Paul Poet. Realising public xenophobia and the new hate politics in the most drastic ways possible, he installed a container camp on a square in the middle of Vienna. The film and performance was made in a style that imitated the show Big Brother. It critically aimed both at certain forms of television entertainment and at a latent xenophobia still thriving in the whole world. It created a heated week, capturing the European right-wing drift and exposing dormant and open xenophobia for the world to see. Political implications The show was produced in Austria, and broadcast from the container set installed in Vienna. Shortly before Schlingensief came up with this project, the Freedom Party of Austria, under the leadership of J√∂rg Haider had been elected into the National Council of Austria and formed part of the new government. Concept The basis of the show was that a dozen or so real life asylum seekers lived inside containers. However, instead of being voted out of the show, the candidates were to be voted out of the country. Creating and utilizing such a situation of living in a strictly confined area, not knowing what would happen next, was to remind the audience of Nazi concentration camps, pointing at and making artistic use of existing parallels between the Nazi camps and television formats like Big Brother. Methodology Installing TV programs and other projects as mockeries of well-known existing formats is part of Schlingensief's methodology. In another show broadcast in Germany, Freakstars 3000, he set up a talent cast show where all candidates were mentally handicapped. In the theatre project Quiz 3000 (the '3000' was a recurring trademark of Schlingensief), he mocked the show Who wants to be a millionaire?, using questions like \\"Please sort the following concentration camps from north to south\\".

The programme was hosted by Eamonn Andrews from Thames' studios in London. In the first 12 episodes, there were three contestants, all connected via satellite: one in Thames' UK studio; one at the studios of ABC Television in Sydney, representing Australia; and one at the studios of PBS member station WPBT in Miami, representing the United States. The game consisted of three rounds. In the first round, each contestant was asked four questions about the UK, four about Australia, and four about the USA (for example, what was the name of this bridge; each correct answer was worth one point. In the second round, each contestant had two minutes to answer questions on a chosen subject, with each correct answer worth two points; returning champions were asked general knowledge questions. The final round was a four-minute buzz-in round; each correct answer was worth three points, but an incorrect answer resulted in losing three points. The player with the highest score won and came back the next week. In addition to competing against each other, the contestants were competing against the other 11 contestants from their own countries. After 12 episodes, the contestants with the highest scores in their countries competed against each other; the Australian and USA players were flown to England, and all three contestants competed in the same studio. (The American champion was mystery writer William L. DeAndrea.) The winner, Jim Eccleson from the United Kingdom, received what was billed as \\"the world's top prize\\" - an early-20th Century Rolls Royce (which, in one episode, was said to have appeared in the movie Chitty Chitty Bang Bang).

A past president of Western Writers of America, Coldsmith wrote more than 40 books, as well as hundreds of newspaper and magazine articles. His \\"Spanish Bit Saga\\", a series of related novels, helped to re-define the Western novel by adopting the point of view of the Native Americans, rather than the European immigrants. Biography In addition to his career as a writer, Coldsmith was a medical doctor, serving as a family practitioner in Emporia, Kansas, until 1988, when he chose to concentrate on writing. In addition, Coldsmith and his 2nd wife Edna were cattle ranchers and breeders of Appaloosa horses. Son of a Methodist preacher, Coldsmith attended high school in Coffeyville, Kansas, and joined the U.S. Army in 1944. His role as a combat medic in the Pacific Theater of World War II led him to Japan, where he was among the first occupying troops. He was assigned to provide medical care for Japanese war criminals, including Hideki T≈çj≈ç, the prime minister. After the war, Coldsmith matriculated at Baker University, a small Methodist institution in Baldwin City, Kansas. While there he became a brother to the Zeta Chi fraternity. After graduation, he worked as a YMCA youth director in Topeka, where he helped to achieve the first interracial public swimming pool in the state. Coldsmith, who had periodically taught English classes at Emporia State University, was awarded the Western Writers of America's Golden Spur award for best original paperback for The Changing Wind of 1990. Other honors include Distinguished Kansan (awarded by the Native Sons and Daughters of Kansas in 1993) and the Edgar Wolfe Award for lifetime contributions to literature (1995). Coldsmith was in high demand as a speaker, especially when the subject was the High Plains and the American West. Coldsmith suffered a stroke on June 20, 2009 after attending a conference of the Western Writers of America in Oklahoma City, Oklahoma. He died on June 25, 2009 at The University of Kansas Hospital in Kansas City, Kansas, according to his wife Edna.Western author Don Coldsmith dead at 83 KansasCity.com. Retrieved on June 26, 2009. Style Coldsmith employs a distinctly lucid and deceptively simple style in his fictional narratives. His prose does not attract attention to itself, with the result that the focus is almost entirely on the story. His characters, who may at first seem uncomplicated, gradually emerge as well-rounded human beings with a complex of often conflicting motives and emotions. Coldsmith's Native American protagonists are genuine, and often likable, human beings. At the same time, Coldsmith's villains, who are usually Indians themselves, are portrayed as being misled, or suffering from delusion, more than being evil in some sinister or fundamental way. Though generally well balanced in his portrayal of Native American societies and immigrant societies, Coldsmith's narratives often offer gentle‚Äîand sometimes not so gentle‚Äîcriticism of European-American culture, especially in matters of the spirit. Coldsmith uses English to achieve the illusion of a native point of view with consistent use of such expressions as \\"I am made to think. . .\\" and \\"Elk-Dog\\" (for horse) and \\"Cold Maker\\" (for winter) . The Spanish Bit Saga The Spanish Bit Saga, arguably Coldsmith's best known work, chronicles the unique moment in history when the horse was introduced to the Plains Indians by Spanish explorers, one of whom is separated from his party and adopted by a fictional Plains tribe. The adventures and experiences of the explorers‚Äô Spanish-Indian descendants make up the bulk of the Spanish Bit series. Coldsmith's fictional tribe in the Spanish Bit series appears to be a synthesis of cultural traditions of the Kansa, Lakota, Kiowa, Cheyenne, Arapaho, Blackfeet, and others. The Pawnee are often depicted as the enemy.

He had a junior role on the prosecution team in several celebrated trials in the immediate post-war era. First World War Howard was the son of Stephen Goodwin Howard, who was Liberal Party Member of Parliament for Sudbury between 1918 and 1922. He was sent to Harrow School, but interrupted his education in 1916 to join the Royal Flying Corps. He became a Flight Lieutenant in the Royal Air Force on its formation in 1918. Later that year he left the RAF to go Balliol College, Oxford where he studied law. Criminal law barrister Following his father's political affiliations, Howard was a candidate at the 1922 general election for Eye in Suffolk as a National Liberal with Conservative Party support. In 1924, Howard was called to the Bar by Lincoln's Inn. He became a criminal law barrister, generally appearing as a junior for the prosecution; he also remained very attached to East Anglia where he farmed on the family estate. While appearing not to have any personal interest in the way the case turned out, he was a skillful advocate and appeared in many high-profile cases. In November 1936 he was appointed to be third junior counsel for the crown (a crown prosecutor) at the Old Bailey (Central Criminal Court). In December 1942 he was elected a Bencher of Lincoln's Inn. Prominent trials Howard was appointed Recorder of Bury St Edmunds (a part-time judicial post) in 1943. He was adopted as Conservative Party candidate for Cambridgeshire in November 1944, but unexpectedly lost the seat in the 1945 general election by 44 votes. Earlier that year, Howard had prosecuted in the \\"Cleft chin murder trial\\". Howard was High Sheriff of Cambridgeshire and Huntingdonshire for the year 1945 to 1946, and became a senior Prosecuting Counsel at the end of the year. He was also Recorder of Ipswich from 1947 and Chairman of Quarter Sessions for Cambridgeshire from 1947. The period between 1945 and 1950 saw Howard's most prominent cases. The week after the election he prosecuted John Amery for treason, and he was also third prosecution counsel at the trial of William Joyce ('Lord Haw Haw') with Attorney General Sir Hartley Shawcross and Laurence Byrne. He prosecuted other treason trials arising out of the war. He was on the prosecution team for Thomas Ley and Lawrence Smith (the \\"Chalkpit murder\\") in 1947, and in 1949 he took part in the trial of John George Haigh, the \\"Acid Bath murderer\\". Parliamentary career At the 1950 general election, Howard was elected for Cambridgeshire, regaining the seat from Labour. He was made a King's Counsel on election and remained in practice as a prosecutor. In Parliament he remained loyal to the Conservative whip, and in 1952 successfully defended The Times against a charge arising out of advertisements issued during the 1951 general election criticising nationalisation. In 1952 he became Chairman of Quarter Sessions for East and West Suffolk and in 1958 he was made Recorder of Southend. Judgeship In January 1961, Howard's name headed a list of new Judges of the High Court of Justice, on the Queen's Bench Division, which vacated his seat in Parliament. He received a knighthood with the appointment, as was traditional. Howard was on the Judicial Bench for ten years before retiring. References *M. Stenton and S.

Overview \\"Helicon 1\\" is a regular part of Mogwai set lists. A live version of the song (recorded by Steve Lamacq from a BBC Radio Session at Maida Vale in March 1999) can be found on Mogwai's 2005 live compilation album, Government Commissions: BBC Sessions 1996-2003, as well as UK music magazine Select's 2000 compilation CD, The Deep End.

When the song is played live, Stuart Braithwaite and Dominic Aitchison switch instruments, Aitchison playing guitar, and Braithwaite on bass, usually sitting down. Braithwaite has commented on this: Musical composition The song begins with almost inaudible guitar, heavily delayed and reverberated, playing a descending three note melody. At (0:25), a bass riff (based around the chords of D major and B minor) enters. At (1:00), slightly distorted, heavily delayed and reverberated guitars begin playing along to the bass riff, swooping in and out. At (1:34), a relaxed, slow drum beat begins. At (2:50), all of the instruments pause for a brief second, then explode into loud guitar-driven noise, backed by a steady, heavy drumbeat (to which every snare drum beat is accompanied by a tambourine clash). At (4:28), the distorted guitars and drums end, leaving the soft bass riff to close the song, aided by the guitar melody heard at the start of song, all of which gradually fade out. Live versions of the song are performed at a substantially slower tempo. Media usage * In 2002, the song was featured in \\"Dragonchasers\\", an episode of the American crime drama The Shield. * In 2006, the song was featured in \\"Wind Sprints\\", an episode of the American serial drama Friday Night Lights. * In 2018, the song was featured in the film and trailer for \\"Beautiful Boy.\\" Music video Almost two decades since the single was first released, an official music video was produced for \\"Helicon 1,\\" directed by Craig Murray.

It is a spin-off of the popular Wing Commander series of games. The game was released on July 25, 2007.  Gameplay  Players engage in dogfights that take place in one of nine environments, and they are able to choose from 18 ships, half being Terran, and the other half Kilrathi. There can be up to 16 players in a single match. The game is separated into single-player and multiplayer modes. Multiplayer modes include eight-on-eight teamplay or 16 player free-for-all, capship battles allowing two teams to launch an organized assault on each other's ship while defending their own, \\"Satellite\\", which is a variation of capture the flag, and one-on-one duels. There is also a \\"Bearpit\\" where one-on-one duels can be watched from the sidelines by other players who can take potshots at the duelers. Single player modes include Asteroids, Training Modes and Melees. Playing through the single player modes will unlock the various ship types.  Relation to previous Wing Commander games  Arena's gameplay differs from previous Wing Commander installments. Rather than using a first-person perspective cockpit used throughout the series, Arena is played from a top-down perspective on a 2D plane with the third axis reserved for special maneuvers, using a control scheme that resembles a first-person shooter. The producer, Sean Penney, is a longtime fan of the franchise. Early in development, Electronic Arts sought input from members of the original Wing Commander development team, such as Chris Roberts, and from the Wing Commander online community.

The Lionel Wartime Freight Train, better known among collectors as the \\"paper train,\\" was a toy train set sold by the Lionel Corporation in 1943.  Origins  During World War II, government-mandated restrictions on the use of various metals halted production of all metal toys in favor of the war effort. Lionel, seeking an alternative product to keep the brand name alive during the war, sought the assistance of Samuel Gold, a designer of various novelties including cereal and soft drink premiums. Gold made an agreement with Lionel and completed a design for an all-paper product train in March 1943. It was sold for a retail price of $1 for the 1943 Christmas season, but disappeared soon afterwards due to poor customer response. Lionel began manufacturing its conventional products again beginning in late 1945.  Features  The paper train came in a flat box containing several sheets of heavy cardstock measuring 11 x 15 inches, on which was printed the various pieces of the set. The finished set included a steam locomotive, tender, boxcar, gondola, and caboose; all decorated for the fictional Lionel Lines. There were also three railway employees, a crossing signal, a crossing gate, and enough ties and rails to create a circle of track measuring 16 feet, 4 inches in circumference. In total, there were over 250 paper parts, 21 wooden dowel axles, and 42 corresponding pasteboard wheels. Although the set did well financially, the set was difficult to assemble and keep intact. While the train was designed with the parts pre-scored and tabbed in order to be put together without the requirement to cut the parts out or using any adhesive, the tabs were prone to coming apart and the train did not stay on the cardstock track reliably once assembled. As a result, the paper train overwhelmed many people, and often parents simply gave up on assembling the train and threw it out.  Current Value / Reproduction  Today, original unassembled paper trains sell for around $300 in like-new condition, and up to $400 in perfect, mint condition. Greenberg Publishing Company of Sykesville, MD. offered a reproduction set in 1981. The reproduction can be distinguished from an original by examining the print - Lionel's model used four-color ink only, while the reproduction also makes use of regular black ink. Also, while the original set was die-cut so pieces could be easily punched out and scored for easy folding, the reproduction set is not pre-cut or scored. The reproduction set also did not include the wooden axles.  References  Classic Toy Trains Magazine; \\"The lion lays an egg;\\" by Eric Sayer Peterson. July 1994 edition.

In 2011 Rolling Stone magazine named Glassnote \\"Best Indie Label.\\" In 2013 and 2014, Glassnote won the A2IM Libera award for Best Label of the Year. In December, 2015, Glass was named a CHEVALIER DE L'ORDRE DES ARTS ET DES LETTRES by the French Minister of Culture. Early years and the start of a music career Glass was raised in Brooklyn, New York. In 1977, while engaged in pre-med studies at Brooklyn College, he began a stint as an R&B;/dance disc jockey at the college's radio station WBCR. Still a student, he was subsequently hired as the first DJ for the influential discotheque, Regine's. =SAM Records= Glass joined the influential indie dance label SAM Records as vice president working with Gary's Gang, John Davis and the Monster Orchestra and the Evasions. He began focusing on developing artists‚Äô careers, rather than just trying to pick hit records. Significantly, Glass promoted street bands when other more conservative and larger labels had not. =Chrysalis Records; Senior Vice President= Glass joined Chrysalis Records in 1983 as Director of New Music Marketing and was later appointed Senior Vice President. During his six years with Chrysalis, he helped guide the careers of such stars as Pat Benatar, Huey Lewis and the News, Billy Idol, Spandau Ballet, Jethro Tull, Icehouse, The Divinyls, Sin√©ad O'Connor and Was (Not Was), among others. He also developed a strong college and intern program, which cultivated a number of talented young executives who later went on to high-level positions throughout the entertainment industry. =SBK Records/EMI Record Group; President/CEO= In 1989, Glass joined SBK Records as Senior Vice President of Promotion. This quickly produced success in breaking new artists, including the multi-platinum debuts of Jesus Jones, Technotronic, Wilson Phillips, Vanilla Ice, as well at SBK/Liberty country artist Billy Dean. In 1990, Glass was promoted to Executive Vice President/General Manager of SBK Records. A 1992 edition of Crain's New York Business profiled him (\\"Daniel Glass, 35, General Manager EMI Records Group North America\\") as one of the top \\"under forty\\" business executives. With the consolidation of SBK, Chrysalis, and EMI USA several years later into \\"EMI Record Group North America,\\" he rose to President/CEO. In that position he was instrumental in bringing Jon Secada, Selena, Barrio Boyzz, Blur, D'Angelo, Roxette, Wilson Phillips, Vanilla Ice, Technotronic, and Arrested Development into platinum and Grammy Award-winning status, as well as the hit soundtrack to the critically acclaimed film, The Crying Game, which featured Boy George. =Rising Tide Records/Universal Records; President= In 1996, Glass caught the attention of Doug Morris (later, chairman of Universal Music Group), with whom he started Rising Tide Records (subsequently Universal Records), with Glass as president. The label had success in breaking new artists, including the multi-platinum debut of Erykah Badu, Billie Myers, Goldfinger, and the Lost Boyz. Recognizing the changing landscape of the industry, Glass strategically aligned Universal with such independent record labels as Kedar Entertainment, home to Erykah Badu, and Mojo Records, home to platinum artists Reel Big Fish and the Cherry Poppin' Daddies. =Artemis Records; President= In 1999 Glass joined Artemis Records as Executive Vice President. After a few months, he was named President and achieved success with the gold record rapper Kurupt, Grammy Award-winning Warren Zevon, rocker Steve Earle, gold record female hard rock group Kittie, the Pretenders and the triple platinum pop stars Baha Men. He also executive produced the Josh Joplin Group‚Äôs album, which was released in January 2001. =Glassnote Records= In 2007, Glass founded Glassnote Entertainment Group, encompassing a music label, publishing company, artist management, and merchandising.

Situated on the Amstel near the Halvemaansteeg, the building offers a stage for both upcoming and established Dutch talents. The theatre has 503 seats. History of the building The first theatre built in Amsterdam was the Schouwburg of Van Campen on Keizersgracht 384 in 1637, which burned down in 1772. That theatre company then moved to the Leidseplein, where it built a theatre in 1774, the first Stadsschouwburg. That building burned down in 1892 (the present building was built in 1894), making De Kleine Komedie the oldest surviving theatre in Amsterdam. In 1784 Henry Hope of Hope & Co. purchased ground on the Amstel near the east side of the Halvemaansteeg in Amsterdam, together with his fellow banker friends Balthazar Elias Abbema, Pieter de Smeth, Henry Fizeaux, Jean Alexander Botereau, and Pieter Muilman.Website (house ownership database) of the Amsterdam City Archives They commissioned the building to the architect Abraham van der Hart who completed it in 1788.Rijksmonument report The commissioners were all very influential men of Amsterdam who had far reaching connections. Henry Fizeaux was a banker who had close ties with John Adams and Benjamin Franklin. He tried to raise funds for the American cause and shared revolutionary sympathies, though merchant tradition was to deny political preferences. The 'Patriotic' or 'Anti-Orange' sympathies of the directors Henry Fizeaux and Jean Alexander Botereau resulted in their stepping down in 1787 when the House of Orange was re-established. Orangist Henry Hope took over the running of the establishment until he fled the country before Napoleon's army in 1794. =Th√©√¢tre Fran√ßais= It was called the Th√©√¢tre Fran√ßais sur l'Erwtemarkt in 1794, the year performances began. In those days, the performances were often in French and modelled on a Parisian theater form that was very popular. Napoleon himself supported the Th√©√¢tre Fran√ßais, and French opera's and plays were shown in the theatre well into the 19th century. When the interest in French plays decreased, the building was sold to the 'Neues Deutsches Theater' that performed German plays. In 1856 the building came into the hands of the Free Church of Scotland and was rechristened 'Scottish Missionary Church'. The driving force behind the Dutch branch of this church was the Rev. August Ferdinand Carl Schwartz (1817‚Äì1870), the father of the novelist Maarten Maartens. When the Vrije Universiteit (Free University) of Amsterdam started in 1880, it hired some rooms in the Scottish Missionary Church and used them as lecture rooms. Here the founder Abraham Kuyper and his four co-professors gave their lectures. In 1883 the Scottish Missionary Church became too small for the quickly growing number of students and the university bought another building. In the first half of Twentieth Century the building was called Salvatori and was used as a meeting centre. The most various groups met here, from orthodox Protestants to leftist freethinkers. During the Second World War the building was no more than a bicycle shed. =De Kleine Komedie= In 1947 the building was reopened as a theatre, now under its present name 'De Kleine Komedie'. Since then its program is primarily in Dutch. In the Fifties and Sixties many famous people in the Dutch entertainment world, like Toon Hermans, Wim Kan and Fons Jansen, made appearances in this theatre. In 1973 the building was closed by the Amsterdam fire brigade due to fire hazard. After a renovation financed by private sources, it was reopened in 1978. In 1988 the continued existence of De Kleine Komedie was put in danger again, when the municipality of Amsterdam wanted to withdraw its subsidy. A campaign launched by the cabaret performer Youp van 't Hek secured the theatre's subsidy. Because of its cosy atmosphere De Kleine Komedie is often used for try-out performances by upcoming talents as well as long-established cabaret performers. Many DVD and TV productions are recorded here.

Log management generally covers: * Log collection * Centralized log aggregation * Long-term log storage and retention * Log rotation * Log analysis (in real-time and in bulk after storage) * Log search and reporting.  Overview  The primary drivers for log management implementations are concerns about security, system and network operations (such as system or network administration) and regulatory compliance. Logs are generated by nearly every computing device, and can often be directed to different locations both on a local file system or remote system. Effectively analyzing large volumes of diverse logs can pose many challenges, such as: * Volume: log data can reach hundreds of gigabytes of data per day for a large organization. Simply collecting, centralizing and storing data at this volume can be challenging. * Normalization: logs are produced in multiple formats. The process of normalization is designed to provide a common output for analysis from diverse sources. * Velocity: The speed at which logs are produced from devices can make collection and aggregation difficult * Veracity: Log events may not be accurate. This is especially problematic from systems that perform detection, such as intrusion detection systems. Users and potential users of log management may purchase complete commercial tools or build their own log-management and intelligence tools, assembling the functionality from various open-source components, or acquire (sub-)systems from commercial vendors. Log management is a complicated process and organizations often make mistakes while approaching it. Logging can produce technical information usable for the maintenance of applications or websites. It can serve: * to define whether a reported bug is actually a bug * to help analyze, reproduce and solve bugs * to help test new features in a development stage  Terminology  Suggestions were made to change the definition of logging. This change would keep matters both more pure and more easily maintainable: * Logging would then be defined as all instantly discardable data on the technical process of an application or website, as it represents and processes data and user input. * Auditing, then, would involve data that is not immediately discardable. In other words: data that is assembled in the auditing process, is stored persistently, is protected by authorization schemes and is, always, connected to some end-user functional requirement.  Deployment life-cycle  One view of assessing the maturity of an organization in terms of the deployment of log-management tools might use successive levels such as: # in the initial stages, organizations use different log-analyzers for analyzing the logs in the devices on the security-perimeter. They aim to identify the patterns of attack on the perimeter infrastructure of the organization. # with increased use of integrated computing, organizations mandate logs to identify the access and usage of confidential data within the security-perimeter. # at the next level of maturity, the log analyzer can track and monitor the performance and availability of systems at the level of the enterprise ‚Äî especially of those information-assets whose availability organizations regard as vital. # organizations integrate the logs of various business-applications into an enterprise log manager for better value proposition. # organizations merge the physical-access monitoring and the logical-access monitoring into a single view.

He is best known for saving teams from being relegated to second division.  Playing career  Lombardi started his playing career with Argentinos Juniors in 1981. His career was then mostly in the lower leagues of Argentine football apart from 1984 when he played a single season for Club Atl√©tico Atlanta in the Primera Division. In 1986, he was part of the Deportivo Italiano team that won the Primera B championship.  Managerial career  After retirement, Caruso Lombardi took up coaching, initially in lower league teams. In the 1995‚Äì96 season, he won the Primera B Metropolitana (third division) with Sportivo Italiano, and in the 2004‚Äì05 he won it again with Tigre. Caruso Lombardi was then in charge of Argentinos Juniors, until resigning five games into the 2007 Apertura tournament, despite his team's 3‚Äì2 win over Boca Juniors only three weeks previously. He was then hired by Newell's Old Boys, with which he obtained his second victory over Boca in the same 2007 Apertura tournament, beating them 1‚Äì0. On 24 February 2009, Caruso Lombardi became Racing Club's head coach, signing a two-year contract. He helped Racing avoid relegation in his first season; however, he resigned on October 2009, after coaching 11 games without a win in the Apertura tournament. After three years, on 17 December 2009, the coach returned to Tigre, replacing Diego Cagna. Caruso Lombardi has a preference towards using physically tall footballers on all the positions of the field. In 2010, while coaching Tigre, he was accused by one of his players (Juan Camilo Angulo) of requesting a bribe to put him on the first team. The coach denied the truth of the accusations. On 8 March 2011, Caruso Lombardi was appointed as head coach of Quilmes, with the club languishing at the bottom of the table and fighting relegation. It is expected that he would remain in that role until his contract expired in June 2012. After a successful spell at Quilmes, during the night of 3 April of the next season, he signed a contract with San Lorenzo de Almagro, replacing Leonardo Madel√≥n in the charge, after their bad results.

Defiance was originally laid down as to the same plan as Atlas, but a new plan dated 8 October 1858 was prepared giving Defiance a lengthened bow.Lambert, Battleships in Transition, pp.125-6.

He was the father of the pianist Liv Glaser and the cellist Ernst Simon Glaser, both Norwegian classical musicians.  Biography  He was born in Hamburg but moved to Norway in 1928 to take up the post as concert master of the Oslo Philharmonic Orchestra after Max Rostal. The two had studied together under Carl Flesch, and when Rostal was offered a position as a professor in Berlin, he suggested Glaser as his successor. In Oslo, Glaser worked as an orchestra musician, a soloist and a teacher. He also had solo engagements in Sweden, Denmark, Germany, the Netherlands and Israel. He introduced himself to the Norwegian audience in autumn 1928 with a recital of Sibelius' violin concerto, and every year after that, he was soloist in the violin concerto. He gave first performances to several violin concertos, including those of Finn Arnestad, Olav Kielland, Klaus Egge and Fartein Valen, and the rhapsody for violin and orchestra by Bjarne Brustad. Glaser fled the Shoah in Norway in 1942 by escaping to neutral Sweden. He returned to Norway in 1945 and stayed in the position as concert master of the Oslo Philharmonic until 1969, only interrupted by his three years in exile. Then he had taken over the principal position at the Music Conservatory in Bergen (now Griegakademiet), and worked there until 1971. He was appointed music director in √Ölesund, where he besides leading music school, directed the √Ölesund Symfoniorkester. His work here led to a significant resurgence of the city's musical life. Glaser burned for teaching, but was also heavily involved in the work of amateur orchestras. in 1966-68 he worked as an instructor and conductor of several amateur orchestras in Sweden and Norway. He also conducted the Nord-Norsk Symfoniorkester at several concerts during the Festspillene in Harstad. In 1976‚Äì77 he taught violin and chamber music at the Norwegian Academy of Music in Oslo. Glaser performed frequently with his wife, the pianist Kari Glaser, and together they also made recordings.

Zumbo (born November 9, 1940) is a firearms and hunting commentator and writer. Until February 2007, he was the hunting editor for Outdoor Life magazine and host of the television program Jim Zumbo Outdoors on The Outdoor Channel. He was removed from both positions after he criticized the use of semi-automatic rifles such as the AR-15 and AK-47 for hunting in his blog. On July 3, 2007 Zumbo's TV show went back on the air. Career and interests Zumbo holds degrees in forestry and wildlife biology. Before becoming a writer, he worked as a forester and wildlife biologist for 15 years. He wrote his first article for Outdoor Life in 1962, and became a full-time employee of the magazine in 1978. His main focus is on big game hunting. He has written 23 books and approximately 1,500 articles for outdoor magazines.

The Washington Post, February 24, 2007, p. A03. In response to the flood of threatened boycotts, Remington Arms' CEO Tommy Millner fired Zumbo as a spokesman on February 19,Remington 2007. The Outdoor Channel announced that Zumbo programming would be on a temporary hiatus, but did not sever their affiliations with Zumbo. His online blog was discontinued \\"for the time being\\" by Outdoor Life on February 19. Zumbo, Outdoor Life 2007-02. Outdoor Life subsequently dropped him completely, stating on its webpage that Zumbo would no longer be contributing to the publication once the last of his columns already to press had been printed. Gerber Knives and Mossy Oak severed all of their business dealings with Zumbo as well, as did a majority of his other sponsors. Outdoor columnist Dennis Anderson wrote in 2007 that \\"Zumbo's comments lent voice to what many hunters believe, namely that assault-style weapons are the black sheep of guns and do nothing to engender hunters and shooters to the general public.\\"Dennis Anderson, Noted outdoors writer in freefall from legend to pariah (March 7, 2007). Aftermath The speed with which calls for Zumbo's termination were acted on by his sponsors and employers (initial responses from sponsors occurred within a 36-hour period after he posted the first of two blog entries on the topic) were seen by many participants as evidence of the power of the Internet and of the \\"new media,\\" including the \\"blogosphere,\\" to influence and shape sociopolitical events. The New York Times published an editorial March 3, 2007 criticizing the destruction of Zumbo's career as overkill and avoidance of healthy debate.\\"Overkill.\\" The New York Times, March 3, 2007 Two weeks after the blog appeared Mr. Zumbo was invited by NRA board member Ted Nugent to an \\"education\\" session at Nugent's Texas ranch. Jim was lectured on the sporting uses of AR type rifles by Ted and two Texas outdoor writers.Junction Eagle, Outdoors Outback, by Kendall Hemphill, March 7, 07, see discussion page for partial transcript. On March 20, a month after Zumbo's column was published, gun control advocate Senator Carl Levin praised Zumbo for \\"his forthrightness, his honesty and his courage,\\" calling the response to his comments \\"swift and callous,\\" in a speech that supported the renewal of the Federal Assault Weapons Ban.03-20-2007 - A Bit of Truth about Assault Weapons : Senator Carl Levin: News Release Zumbo in turn published An Open Letter to the United States Senate, saying his statements had been misrepresented, and attacking Levin's support of gun control legislation as an attack on the Second Amendment. Return to television According to Jim Zumbo's website, fellow hunter Ted Nugent came to Zumbo's rescue. After the blog incident, Zumbo flew to Nugent's ranch in Texas to learn about the so-called black rifles. Nugent wanted to use Zumbo's ignorance as an example of an avid hunter who was unaware of the popularity and uses of these firearms. Zumbo went on to work with the Second Amendment Foundation. On July 3, 2007, Zumbo's TV show went back on the air, and some sponsors began coming back. Over the last few years Zumbo has been focusing on wounded soldiers who suffered severe injuries in Iraq and Afghanistan, taking them on all-expense-paid hunting trips, with more planned in the future. In August 2008, Zumbo was appointed as national spokesman for the Outdoor Recreation Heritage Fund, which is a branch of the Paralyzed Veterans of America.

At least one that he 'ghost' wrote was the autobiography of actor Errol Flynn, titled My Wicked, Wicked Ways. Conrad was born to Eli and Minnie Cohen in Auburn, New York, into a Jewish family with nine siblings. He was \\"reared in the Judaic tradition\\" but chose to Anglicize his name when he began his career as a professional journalist. He wished to be a writer from a young age, and his early experience included a stint at the Auburn Advertiser-Journal. He worked as a journalist for the newspaper PM in New York City, and other papers. As the Harlem Bureau Chief for The Chicago Defender, an African American title, he investigated lynchings in the south. This work brought him into contact with Haywood Patterson. In 1950, Conrad co-wrote Patterson's memoir, Scottsboro Boy, about his experience as one of the group of nine men accused of rape in Alabama in 1931. Conrad married Anna Alyse Abrams in 1938; the couple had one son, Michael Earl Conrad. The Conrads lived in San Francisco at least during the 1967-1972 period in an apartment near downtown, not far from Union Square. In the early 1980s, they lived in Coronado, California. Some of his papers are in the local history collection of the Cayuga Community College in Auburn. Other papers are in the collection of the university of Oregon.

It comprises eleven classically trained dancers. In addition to its domestic and international performances, the organization has a presentation program called \\"Aspen Santa Fe Ballet Presents\\", with summer and winter seasons that brings touring dance companies from around the world to both Aspen and Santa Fe. The Aspen Santa Fe Ballet has two official schools, one in Aspen, one in Santa Fe, and a year-round Mexican Folk Dance outreach program in both Colorado and New Mexico.  History  In 1995, at the invitation of Aspen Ballet Company and School founder Bebe Schweppe, Joffrey dancers Jean-Philippe Malaty and Tom Mossbrucker moved from New York City to embark on a vision of creating a professional dance company based in Aspen. The company started modestly with six dancers. Growth was organic. Friends in the field ‚Äì Gerald Arpino, Trey McIntyre, Septime Webre, Dwight Rhoden, offered start-up repertoire. Moses Pendleton's highly popular Noir Blanc was a seminal event for the young troupe. It launched a tradition of commissioning new work. An open, exploratory style emerged as Mossbrucker and Malaty tapped the creative scene in Europe where classical ballet was breaking from its boundaries. The athletic and adventurous American dancers found themselves at a crossroads of dance history. In 2000 the company began a co-venture with a presenting organization in Santa Fe and now perform under the name Aspen Santa Fe Ballet. Aspen Santa Fe Ballet (ASFB) made its New York City debut at The Joyce Theater in 2003 and has notably performed at Jacob's Pillow Dance Festival and Wolf Trap National Park for the Performing Arts. In 2004 ASFB made its international debut in Canada and France and in 2013 ASFB made its debut in Moscow, Russia.  Education  The School at Aspen Santa Fe Ballet includes a rigorous professional level ballet preparatory program, a critically acclaimed Folklorico program, as well as other community focused programs such as the Parkinson's Dance Program founded in 2013. The School at Aspen Santa Fe Ballet serves the communities surrounding the towns of Aspen, Basalt, and Carbondale in Colorado and Santa Fe, and Eldorado in New Mexico. Students in the youth programs perform in annual spring recitals, and alongside ASFB's professional dancers in The Nutcracker. To ensure that every child who wishes to dance can do so, Aspen Santa Fe Ballet awards over $30,000 in needs-based scholarships every year. The Folklorico Program is largely free to participants.  Staff  Bebe Schweppe, Founder, grew up in Augusta, Georgia, and started dancing at the age of 7 at Georgia Dance Theatre under Frankie Levy. At the age of eleven she was invited by Robert Joffrey to study in New York on a full scholarship. She moved to Aspen in 1975 and founded Aspen Ballet School in 1990, and Aspen Ballet Company in 1996. Jean-Philippe Malaty, Executive Director, grew up in the Basque region of France. After receiving his degree in dance, he accepted scholarships to study in some of Europe's most prestigious schools: MUDRA, Maurice Bejart's school in Brussels, and John Cranko's school in Stuttgart. At the invitation of David Howard, Jean-Philippe came to America to study at the David Howard Dance Center in New York City. Since then, Jean-Philippe has performed soloist roles with various companies throughout the country including Joffrey II, Los Angeles Classical Ballet, Ballet Hispanico of New York, and the Lyric Opera of Chicago. He has been recognized by the U.S. government as an artist of extraordinary abilities and was granted a permanent resident status. Tom Mossbrucker, Artistic Director, started tap dancing at age four in his hometown of Tacoma, Washington. At age 14 he began his ballet studies with Jo Emery, and performed with her company, the Tacoma Performing Dance Company. His studies continued in New York at the School of American Ballet and the Joffrey Ballet School. He danced with Joffrey II before joining the Joffrey Ballet, where he performed principal roles in over 70 ballets, and toured throughout the world. His favorite roles include those performed in Billy the Kid, Rodeo, Romeo and Juliet, and The Nutcracker. He has appeared in television specials, and was featured in the Joffrey's Billboards, a full- length rock ballet set to music by Prince, which was released on videocassette. He danced with the Atlanta Ballet and Hubbard Street Dance Chicago.

Sometimes this campaign is separated into two by the communists as Huaiyin Campaign (Ê∑ÆÈò¥ÊàòÂΩπ) and Huai'an Campaign (Ê∑ÆÂÆâÊàòÂΩπ) respectively. Prelude Like other similar clashes immediately after the end of World War II between the communists and the nationalists in China, this conflict also rooted from the fact that Chiang Kai-shek had realized that his nationalist regime simply had neither the sufficient troops nor enough transportation assets to deploy his troops into the Japanese-occupied regions of China. Unwilling to let the communists who had already dominated most of the rural regions in China to further expand their territories by accepting the Japanese surrender and thus would consequently control the Japanese occupied regions, Chiang Kai-shek ordered the Japanese and their turncoat Chinese puppet regime not to surrender to the communists and kept their fighting capabilities to \\"maintain order\\" in the Japanese occupied regions, fighting off the communists as necessary, until the final arrivals and completion of the deployment of the nationalist troops. As a result, most members of the Japanese puppet regimes and their military forces rejoined the nationalists. However, these former nationalists turned Japanese puppet regime forces were not from Chiang Kai-shek's own clique, but instead, they were mainly consisted of troops of warlords who were only nominally under the Chiang Kai-shek's before World War II, since they were nationalists in name only and mostly maintained their independence. These warlords were only interested in keeping their own power and defected to the Japanese side when Japanese invaders offered to let them keep their power in exchange for their collaborations. After World War II, these forces of former Japanese puppet regimes once again returned to the nationalist camp for the same reason they defected to the Japanese invaders. Obviously, it was difficult for Chiang to immediately get rid of these warlords for good as soon as they surrendered to Chiang and rejoined nationalists, because such move would alienate other factions within the nationalist ranks, and these former Japanese puppet regime's warlords could still help the nationalists to gain more territories by holding on to what was under their control until Chiang completed the deployment of his own troops to take over. Chiang Kai-shek's objective was to simultaneously solve the warlord problem that had plagued China for so long and the problem of the extermination of communism together, which proved to be an extremely fatal mistake for him and his nationalist regime later on, as shown in this conflict. Nationalist Strategy In accordance with his strategy to simultaneously solve the warlord problem that had plagued China for so long and the problem of the extermination of communism together, Chiang Kai-shek and his followers had hoped that these former Japanese puppet regime's warlords who rejoined the nationalists would be able to hold on to the regions long enough for Chiang to deploy his own troops by holding off communists. If the communists were victorious in such conflicts, however, the result would still benefit to Chiang and China because the power of these warlords would be reduced as their military forces were smashed by the communists, and the warlord problem plagued China for so long could thus be greatly reduced, while at the same time, communists would be weakened by the fights and Chiang's own troops would have easier time to take control. For the former nationalist turned Japanese puppet regime forces, these warlords and their troops had no problem of following Chiang Kai-shek's orders, and they were eager to prove themselves. These warlords and their troops were well aware that due to the collaboration with the Japanese invaders during the Second Sino-Japanese War, they were well hated by the general population in China, including those nationalists who refused to surrender to the enemy and fought the enemy until the eventual victory. Therefore, in the impending demilitarization after World War II, they were certainly be disarmed and discharged, which would probably be the best outcome and the power of these warlord would be reduced or even completely eliminated as a result. Chiang Kai-shek's ordering them not surrendering to the communists and fighting off the communists was a savior for them because by carrying out such orders, these warlords and their troops could legitimize themselves and thus retain their power by fighting the communists who were targeted as rebels by Chiang Kai-shek and his nationalist regime. Communist Strategy The communist strategy was much simpler than that of the nationalists because there was not any huge division within the communist rank like that of the nationalist. The communists already earned considerable popular support by being the only Chinese force left in the region fighting the Japanese invaders and their puppet regime after the nationalist withdrew, and after successfully establishing communist bases in the rural regions where better life was provided to the general populace in comparison to that of Japanese occupied regions, the general Chinese populace agreed that the communists were well deserved to represent the China to accept the invaders' surrender in the region and takeover the regions occupied by the invaders. Order of battle *Defenders: nationalist order of battle (around 14,000 troops): **The 28th Division stationed at Huaiyin **Huaiyin Security Regiment stationed at Huaiyin **Three brigades stationed at Huai'an *Attackers: communist order of battle (more than 11,000 troops): **The 3rd Division of the New Fourth Army ***The 7th brigade ***The 8th brigade ***The 10th brigade ***Sheyang (Â∞ÑÈò≥) Independent regiment ***Huai'an Independent regiment ***Eastern Lianshui (Lian Dong, Ê∂ü‰∏ú) Independent regiment ***Huaiyin Garrison regiment ***Lianshui (Ê∂üÊ∞¥) Garrison regiment First stage The communist 10th brigade of the 3rd Division of the New Fourth Army begun its push toward Huaiyin on August 26, 1945 from regions of Gaoliang Ravine (Gaoliang Jian, È´òËâØÊ∂ß) and Jiang's Dam (Jiang Ba, ËíãÂùù), while five communist local regiments coordinated their attacks from other directions: the communist Sheyang (Â∞ÑÈò≥) Independent regiment, Huaiyin Garrison regiment and Lianshui (Ê∂üÊ∞¥) Garrison regiment attacked Huaiyin from the east and north, while Huai'an was attacked by the communist Huai'an Independent regiment and the Eastern Lianshui (Ê∂ü‰∏ú) Independent regiment. After fierce battles that lasted four days from August 27, 1945 ‚Äì August 31, 1945, all nationalist positions outside the city wall had fallen into the enemy hands and the city of Huaiyin was surrounded. After besieging the city, the enemy force did not immediately attack, but instead, made preparations by building fire support stations and digging trenches that extended all the way to the foot of the city wall. The fire support stations were built by creating hills higher than the city wall with earth so that they would also serve as reconnaissance platforms and everything inside the city was under the attacking enemy's surveillance. Second stage After the nationalist defenders refused to surrender, the final assault on the city begun in the afternoon on September 6, 1945 at 2:00 PM. Taking the advantage of the trenches, the attacking enemy succeeded in approaching the foot of the city wall and set explosives to blow up a section of the city wall near the eastern gate. The nationalist was unable to stop the enemy from rushing in from the collapsed section and after one and half hour fierce battle, the entire nationalist garrison of Huaiyin consisted of the 28th Division and the Huaiyin Security Regiment totaling more than 8,600 men were annihilated by the enemy. Pan Ganchen (ÊΩòÂπ≤Ëá£), the commander of the nationalist 28th Division was among the 300+ nationalist defenders killed, and another 8,328 was captured alive, included the chief-of-staff of the nationalist 28th Division, Liu Shaoshen (ÂàòÁªçÂù§). The enemy also succeeded in capturing 7 artillery pieces, 88 machine guns, and 6,592 repeating rifles from the nationalist. The last resistance ended at 5:30 AM next day on September 7, 1945. After the fall of Huaiyin, the communist 10th brigade of the 3rd Division of the New Fourth Army turned its attention to Huai'an, besieged the city on September 13, 1945. Two days later, on September 15, 1945, the commander of the communist 3rd Division of the New Fourth Army, Huang Kecheng (ÈªÑÂÖãËØö) personally led the 7th brigade and the 8th brigade of the communist 3rd Division of the New Fourth Army to Huai'an, replacing the 10th brigade of the communist 3rd Division of the New Fourth Army in preparation to attack the city with the help of local communist militia. Realizing their desperate situation, the defenders attempted to breakout on the dusk on September 21, 1945, but was beaten back by the enemy. The assault on Huai'an begun in the morning of September 22, 1945 at 8:00 am. Under the cover of heavy artillery support from mortars and infantry support guns which included captured Japanese Type 11, the attacking force succeeded in breaching the defense of the city, and the city wall proved to be incapable of stopping the enemy, which was breached within 5 minutes. By 10:00 am, most of the defending force was annihilated. However, the remaining defense of a group of more than 200 ardent nationalists led by the nationalist brigade commander Wu Shuquan (Âê¥Êº±Ê≥â) and the civilian commissioner Li Yunpei(Êùé‰∫ëÈúà) was much stronger than anticipated and it took attackers 5 hours to wipe out this last group of defenders and mop up the rest who went into hiding. The three- brigade strong nationalist defending force of Huai'an was completely annihilated by the attacking enemy with more than 300 killed, including the commander Wu Shuquan (Âê¥Êº±Ê≥â), and another 4,350 men captured alive, while 5 artillery pieces, 52 light mortars, 50 machine guns and 3,738 repeating rifles also fell into the hands of the enemy. Along with the previous loss of Huaiyin and positions outside the two cities, the defenders lost nearly 14,000 troops, nearly the entire force. Outcome Like other similar clashes immediately after the end of World War II between the communists and the nationalists in China, this conflict also showed that Chiang Kai-shek's attempt to simultaneously solve the warlord problem that had plagued China for so long and the problem of the extermination of communism together proved to be a fatal mistake. Although the result of the campaign turned out exactly like Chiang Kai-shek and his subordinates had predicted, and consequently the power of the warlords in this region was indeed reduced as their military forces were smashed by the communists, so that the warlord problem plagued China for so long was thus reduced for this particular region, and Chiang Kai-shek's secondary objective was achieved here, any positive gains obtained by the nationalists were negated by the politic fallout. The reason was that this success of achieving the secondary objective came at a huge cost in nationalists' loss of popular support in this region formerly dominated by the Japanese, because the local population had already blamed nationalists for losing the regions to the Japanese invaders, while reassigning these former Japanese puppet regime forces as the nationalist forces to fight the communists, the only Chinese force left in the regions, only further alienated the local populace and strengthened the popular resentment to Chiang Kai-shek and his nationalist regime. In contrast, the communist victory of taking the two cities resulted in the linking up of the previous four separate communist bases in central Jiangsu, northern Jiangsu, north of Huai River and south of Huai River. The political fallout of Chiang Kai-shek's fatal mistake of attempting to simultaneously solve the warlord problem that had plagued China for so long and the problem of the extermination of communism together also greatly helped the communists in gaining popular support in the region.

The woman at the right is seated at an IBM 026 keypunch machine. The woman at left is at an IBM 056 Card Verifier. She would re-enter the data and the '056 verifier machine would check that it matched the data punched onto the cards. Two-pass verification, also called double data entry, is a data entry quality control method that was originally employed when data records were entered onto sequential 80-column Hollerith cards with a keypunch. In the first pass through a set of records, the data keystrokes were entered onto each card as the data entry operator typed them. On the second pass through the batch, an operator at a separate machine, called a verifier, entered the same data. The verifier compared the second operator's keystrokes with the contents of the original card. If there were no differences, a verification notch was punched on the right edge of the card. The IBM 056 and 059 Card Verifiers were companion machines to the IBM 026 and 029 keypunches, respectively. The later IBM 129 keypunch also could operate as a verifier. In that mode, it read a completed card (record) and loaded the 80 keystrokes into a buffer. A data entry operator reentered the record and the keypunch compared the new keystrokes with those loaded into the buffer. If a discrepancy occurred the operator was given a chance to reenter that keystroke and ultimately overwrite the entry in the buffer. If all keystrokes matched the original card, it was passed through and received a verification punch. If corrections were required, then the operator was prompted to discard the original card and insert a fresh card on which corrected keystrokes were typed. The corrected record (card) was passed through and received a corrected verification punch. Modern use While this method of quality control clearly is not proof against systematic errors or operator misread entries from a source document, it is very useful in catching and correcting random miskeyed strokes which occur even with experienced data entry operators. However, it proved to be a fatally tragic flaw in the Therac 25 incident. This method has survived the keypunch and is available in some currently available data entry programs (e.g. PSPP/SPSS Data Entry). One study suggests that, at least in simulated circumstances, a single-pass data entry with range checks and skip rules might not significantly alter the reliability of outcomes compared to studies using two-pass data entry; however, it is desirable to implement both systems in a data entry application.

It was laid out in the early 18th century as one of Bristol's first suburbs. Built upon a flat area of ground its central focus of St. Paul's Church. Shortly after construction started a number of the builders involved in the project became bankrupt, leaving much of the Square unfinished. A variety of Georgian architecture designed by Daniel Hague was designed for wealthy occupants, although some has since fallen into disrepair or been converted from residential occupation to offices. It is laid out around a central gardens. The gates and railings of which are a grade II listed building.

It showed that site of Nos 11‚Äì12 Portland Square consisted of two joined structures. On the western side along the street frontage, no. 11 was occupied by a Georgian House, with a courtyard to the rear. In 1877, no. 12 was converted for use as Young and Melrow's stay factory. Numbers 31 and 32 are on the Historic England Buildings at Risk Register and described as being in very bad condition. West side Decline The area never achieved the fashionable cachet anticipated by the scale of the architecture and St Paul's church, being soon eclipsed by Clifton. Rather than the fine domestic residences planned by the developers, by the end of the 19th century there were many small business based around the square, particularly involving boot & shoe manufacture, and ancillary services for printing such as ink making and cardboard box making. By 1916 the Salvation Army opened two hostels for men and women in the area.The Salvation Army continues in the area, although now moved North onto Ashley Road. Bristol suffered from heavy bombing in World War II and Portland Square did not escape. A raid on 2 December 1940 killed 40 people and destroyed Dean Street, to the North of the Square. After the war, there was little interest in large Georgian propertiesThis also affected similar properties in Clifton and by 1951 the Ordnance Survey map described parts of the Square as \\"in ruins\\". Bristol's brutalist planning and development policies in the 1960s did nothing to repair this damage, particularly in the adjoining Brunswick Square. Unlike its neighbour, Portland Square did at least maintain its railed gardens and trees through the wartime scrap metal drives, which left the Square with some residual sense of coherence. Portland & Brunswick Square was first designated as a Conservation Area in 1974, with extensions to this in the years following. Despite this, little progress was made and the North West corner of the Square still required timber shoring to support buildings damaged by wartime bomb damage. A gradual decline of St Paul's in general reached its nadir around the rioting of 1980. Both Portland and Brunswick squares developed a reputation for prostitution and drug-dealing. Redevelopment Bristol's generally booming economy in the 1990s encouraged some restoration and sympathetic redevelopment, initially on a small scale by individuals and businesses. Cosie's wine bar and the Surrey Wine Vaults were bohemian destinations for Bristol's vibrant nightlife, despite the area's threatening reputation ‚Äì a reputation far less deserved in these main squares than in some nearby streets.

It was released in March 1980 in the US and in June 1980 in the UK. It was the third album of Hendrix recordings to be produced by Alan Douglas. The album contains five jam sessions, edited by Douglas. It reached number 127 on the Billboard 200 chart. Although the album has not been reissued, four of the tracks have been re-released without Douglas's edits. Recording Nine to the Universe is the third posthumous compilation Hendrix release produced by Alan Douglas. The tracks were recorded between March and August 1969 at the Record Plant and The Hit Factory in New York City. Unlike his previous efforts, Douglas mostly retained the original backing tracks and musicians. However, he came up with the titles, since Hendrix did not give names to these jams. One instrumental was titled \\"Young/Hendrix\\", after organist Larry Young and another \\"Jimi/Jimmy Jam\\", after guitarist Jim McCarty. Bassist Dave Holland commented: \\"I'm not quite sure why I was called, but I was real happy to do it. It was a lot of fun and very informal. Nothing was really planned... It was real loose, and Jimi seemed as if he was putting it together as he went\\". McCarty added: \\"None of that stuff was ever intended to be released... To me it was embarrassing. I'm sure that Jimi would have said, 'You're out of your fucking mind!' and never let it happen.

The album has not been re-released, but most of the songs have reissued on various Hendrix compilations, without Douglas's edits. According to Hendrix biographer Harry Shapiro, WEA released the album in 1979 in Brazil with a different cover and sequencing.  Critical reception  In a contemporary review for The Village Voice, music critic Robert Christgau gave Nine to the Universe a \\"B+\\" and called it \\"bracing progressive\\" rhythm and blues showcasing Hendrix's most jazz-oriented improvisations. However, he questioned \\"whether tighter structures wouldn't have made [Hendrix] think harder and faster\\", while finding that Young, being the only jazz musician, sounded less \\"far out\\" than usual. Paul Evans gave it three-and-a-half out of five stars in The Rolling Stone Album Guide (1992) and said the ethics of Douglas' production were questionable but resulted in a fusion style in which Hendrix \\"sounds great\\", citing the album as the most \\"vital\\" of the Douglas-produced records. According to music scholar Craig Hansen Werner, along with Miles Davis' \\"Right Off\\" (1971) and the Sonny Sharrock albums Guitar (1986) and Seize the Rainbow (1987), Nine to the Universe was one of the few works that suggested the direction Hendrix and Davis would have explored had they worked together.

He was born in Alexandria in 1925, the son of a high court judge (Mourad Wahba Pasha) and later cabinet minister. His mother had been educated at Cheltenham Ladies' College and Oxford University. The grandson of a Prime Minister (Youssef Wahba Pasha) he belonged to the Egyptian aristocracy of the time but was nonetheless a member of the communist party in his youth. He was a graduate of Cairo University and the Sorbonne where he obtained a Diploma in High Studies in International Law in Paris (1947). He decided to pursue his interests in English literature and went to Exeter College, Oxford University, and received his B.Litt. and D.Phil. in 1957. During 1957‚Äì1966 and 1970‚Äì1980 Wahba taught English literature at Cairo University, Egypt. During that time he started the Annual Bulletin of English Studies which later became Cairo Studies in English published by the Department of English Language and Literature. He continued supervising countless PhD students as emeritus professor. After his death, the English Department's library at Cairo University was named after him. He also served for four years between 1966 and 1970 as the Undersecretary of State to the Ministry of Culture for Egypt where he organized in 1967 the Cairo Millennium event to celebrate the millennial anniversary of the city of Cairo. The event is considered by many as one of the great cultural event to occur in recent Egyptian history. It included scholars from all over the world, including academics such as Bernard Lewis, notwithstanding his sympathies to Israel. His key contributions to literature include some of the only English translations of Egyptian authors Naguib Mahfouz and Taha Hussein. He also edited existing versions of the authors' works in English. He was a well-known scholar of Samuel Johnson, editing Johnsonian Studies, which included the oft-referenced bibliography of Johnson by James Clifford and Donald Greene. Wahba introduced to the Arabic reader the first Arabic translation of Johnson's Rasselas in 1959 and Chaucer's The Canterbury Tales in 1984. He edited the commemorative lectures for the bicentennial of Samuel Johnson's death celebrated at Oxford University in 1986, published by Longman. In 1989, shortly before his death, he published an article in the Journal of Arabic Literature entitled \\"An Anger Observed\\" that summarized the anger and suspicion felt by the Muslim world towards the West. The article was shortly after translated into Arabic and widely seen among Muslim scholars as an example of how it is possible to understand the Muslim viewpoint and develop a dialogue between the Muslim world and the West. Wahba produced several lexicographic works, including several English‚ÄìArabic dictionaries. His Dictionary of Literary Terms, published in 1974 and re-issued several times, has become an important tool for scholars of comparative literature in the Arab world. In 1989 he published Al-Mukhtar: a Concise English‚ÄìArabic Dictionary, considered as one of the most thorough dictionaries of its kind. The Mukhtar was followed by An Nafeess, published after his death. He was elected a member of the Academy of the Arabic Language in Cairo in 1980, as well as a member of the Institut d'√âgypte (founded in 1798 by Bonaparte) and became its secretary-general shortly after. He was also an active member of the International Committee for Philosophy and the Social Sciences (CIPSH). While he shied away from political roles (he declined a ministerial position offered by President Sadat), he was a member of the Shura Council (Egyptian Senate), following the footsteps of his father and grandfather Youssef Wahba. He died in London in 1991 from Leukemia. References *Baraka, Magda (1998). The Egyptian Upper Class between Revolutions 1919‚Äì1952. Reading: Ithaca Press. *Cairo Studies in English (1990).

Rather than presenting material selectively to either prove or disprove Mormonism, the focus of new Mormon history is to present history in a more humanistic and dispassionate way, and to situate Mormon history in a fuller historical context. Because it is a break from past historical narratives, new Mormon history tends to be revisionist. In many cases, the new Mormon history follows the perspectives and techniques of new history, including cultural history. Mormon historian Richard Bushman described it as \\"a quest for identity rather than a quest for authority\\". New Mormon historians include a wide range of both Mormon and non-Mormon scholars, the most prominent of which include Bushman, Jan Shipps, D. Michael Quinn, Terryl Givens, Leonard J. Arrington, Richard P. Howard, Fawn Brodie, and Juanita Brooks. History D. Michael Quinn dates New Mormon History as beginning in 1950 with Juanita Brooks‚Äô publication of \\"The Mountain Meadows Massacre\\" by Stanford University Press. He notes, however, that it had been gaining momentum even before that, citing that B.H. Roberts‚ÄîChurch historian from 1901 until his death in 1933‚Äî\\"exemplified much of the philosophy later identified with the New Mormon History.\\" Clyde R. Forsberg, Jr., credits Leonard J. Arrington, beginning in the 1950s, with having \\"led the charge\\" of New Mormon History, with non-Mormon scholars Thomas O'Dea and Whitney O. Cross responding in kind with \\"less prejudiced and more informed monographs on Mormonism\\" . Associated groups and publications In the 1960s, a new generation of Mormon scholars emerged. The publication of Dialogue: A Journal of Mormon Thought, the newly-established Mormon History Association, and the professionalization of LDS and RLDS history departments provided spaces for historians to do new research in Mormon topics. RLDS scholars founded the John Whitmer Historical Association in 1972. In 1974, Claudia Bushman and Laurel Thatcher Ulrich founded the magazine Exponent II. The first issue of BYU Studies was published in 1959. Leonard Arrington Also in 1972, the LDS Church hired Leonard Arrington as their historian. During Arrington's time as historian, Mormon and non-Mormon historians were allowed to access the LDS Church Archives. Much of the research in the 1970s used these newly-available sources to examine church history, sometimes in great detail. Leonard Arrington influenced important scholars of Mormon history, including Richard Jensen, William Hartley, and Ronald Walker. In 1969, Jewish historian Moses Rischin named the increasing amount of Mormon scholarship \\"the New Mormon history.\\" The \\"New Mormon History\\" movement included non-Mormons Thomas F. O'Dea, P.A.M. Taylor, Mario De Pillis, Lawrence Foster, Community of Christ member Robert Flanders, and Mormon scholar Kalus Hansen. Maureen Ursenbach Beecher was a leading researcher in women's studies. In the 1970s women's biographies were published, but not integrated into larger narratives. Other women hired by the Church Historical Department included Jill Mulvay Derr, Carol Cornwall Madsen, and Edyth Romney. Journals dedicated special issues to Mormon women, and the increased interest in Mormon women led to more publications focused on them. Scholars published biographies of Emma Smith, Eliza Snow, Emmeline B. Wells, and Amy Brown Lyman. Some writers looked at Mormon women's history with the goal of restructuring historical narratives. Mormon feminist articles on Mormon history started with the special Summer 1971 issue of Dialogue on women's issues and continued in publications like Exponent II (starting in 1974), and Mormon Sisters: Women in Early Utah (1976), edited by Claudia Bushman. Beecher and Laurel Thatcher Ulrich edited another volume about Mormon women's history in Sisters in Sprit: Mormon Women in Historical and Cultural Perspective (1987). Women and Authority: Re- emerging Mormon Feminism (1992) was another milestone in feminist publications, and it encouraged Mormon women to be empowered by their history and \\"reclaim lost opportunities.\\" Most New Mormon historians were LDS. Their audience was Mormon intellectuals and non-Mormons. They maintained their respect for the Mormon faith, admitted to flaws in people and policies, and avoided taking a defensive stance, a tone which non-Mormon historian Jan Shipps wrote \\"made them seem more secular than they actually were.\\" Mormon history by non-Mormons at this time had a similar detached tone. New Mormon historians often published with the University of Illinois Press in order to publish for an academic audience independent of the church. Charles S. Peterson argued in The Great Basin Kingdom Revisited that Arrington took an exceptionalist view of Mormon history, which he then taught to other New Mormon Historians. This exceptionalist view was that they could believe in both secular history and orthodox Mormon views of the restoration. New History New Mormon History is but a reflection of the change in writing history overall that took root in the 20th century. Quinn states that \\"the New Mormon History includes all of the ingredients of the 'new history' in America at large but has one crucial addition: the effort to avoid using history as a religious battering ram.\\" The new historical movement's inclusive definition of the proper matter of historical study has also given it the label total history. The movement was contrasted with the traditional ways of writing history which particularly characterized the nineteenth century, resisting their focus on politics and 'great men'; their insistence on composing historical narrative; their emphasis on administrative documents as key source materials; their concern with individuals' motivations and intentions as explanatory factors for historical events; and their willingness to accept the possibility of historians' objectivity. Differences from traditional Mormon history Quinn, referring to Brooks‚Äô history of the Mountain Meadows massacre, states that New Mormon History began with her in that she \\"avoided the seven deadly sins of traditional Mormon history.\\" Quinn identifies these \\"sins\\" as: :*Shrinking from analyzing a controversial topic; :*Concealing a sensitive or contradictory interpretation; :*Hesitating to follow the evidence to \\"revisionist\\" interpretations that run counter to \\"traditional\\" assumptions; :*Using one‚Äôs evidence to insult the religious beliefs of Mormons; :*Disappointing the scholarly expectations of academics; :*Catering to public relations preferences; :*Using an \\"academic\\" work to proselytize for religious conversion or defection.

It belongs to Want Want China Times group, which also owns China Television (CTV). History Founded in 1994, CTi TV was originally called the Chinese Television Network (CTN; ). CTN had two main channels, Chung Tien () and Da Di (). On January 30, 1997, ownership switched from P.H. Yu (‰∫éÂìÅÊµ∑), the current chairman of Nan Hai Corporation Limited (ÂçóÊµ∑ÊéßËÇ°ÊúâÈôêÂÖ¨Âè∏), to the Koos Group (Âíå‰ø°‰ºÅÊ•≠Âúò). In 2000, ownership changed once again from KG Group to the Wisdom Group (Ë±°Â±±ÈõÜÂúò), which, at the time, also operated China Television (CTV). Hsiang Shan merged CTN with CTV Satellite to form Power TV (). As part of Power TV, CTV Satellite became Chung T'ien Entertainment, while CTN's Chung Tien split up into Power TV News () and Power TV Variety (). Power News eventually changed its name to Chung T'ien Information, which then became Chung T'ien Main in January 2004. After the He Hsin-Hsiang Shan ownership transfer, Da Di was granted some degree of autonomy as Da Di Television; however, Da Di eventually became part of Videoland Television Network, and changed its name to the Videoland Drama Channel. In June 2002, ownership of Power TV changed once again from Hsiang Shan to the China Times; Power TV changed its name to present-day Chung T'ien Television (CTi TV). In July 2019, CTiTV was fined NTD 1.6 million by the National Communications Commission for failing to verify information before broadcasting it. CTiTV has a history of failing to verify information before broadcast. In April 2019, The Nikkei reported that CTi-TV parent company received millions in subsidies from the Chinese government. In November 2019, Wang Liqiang, a PRC spy who defected to Australia, claimed that CTi-TV had received Chinese funding in return for airing stories unfavorable of the Taiwanese government. The Want Want China Times Group denied these allegations. In January 2020, they were fined NT$600,000 (US$20,033) for broadcasting a false statement by KMT Tainan City Councilor Hsieh Lung-chieh. The regulator found that CTiTV's journalist had failed to question or ask for evidence at the time and that CTiTV had failed to do any fact verification regarding the statement before broadcasting it.
