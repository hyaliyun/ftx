The battle was fought between the royalist forces loyal to the Spanish crown and the Mexican rebels fighting for independence from the Spanish Empire. The Mexican insurgents were commanded by General Jos√© Mar√≠a Morelos y Pav√≥n and the Spanish by Rosendo Porlier y Asteguieta. The battle resulted in a victory for the Mexican rebels. The battle Rosendo Porlier y Asteguieta initially met with success in this campaign, defeating the forces of Hermenegildo Galeana at the Battle of Tecualoya. His victorious army then marched to Tenancingo de Degollado. Porlier was initially in a position to enter the town and recapture it for the Spanish crown, but he failed to do so. General Jos√© Mar√≠a Morelos y Pav√≥n and his forces arrived at the city from the south after receiving pleas for help from Tenango del Valle and from Heroica Zit√°cuaro and proceeded to give battle. After a bitter fight, Morelos' army proved to be victorious. Initially, Morelos was going to continue his march towards Mexico City, but news had reached him of the insurgent defeat at the Battle of Zit√°cuaro and the flight of the \\"Suprema Junta Nacional Gubernativa\\" from that city.

He also coached Argentina and Kenya, and Otago in NZ domestic cricket. He was appointed head coach of New Zealand on 20 July 2012, taking over from John Wright in August for their tour of India, and later extensions to his contract would have taken him through to the end of 2019 Cricket World Cup, but Hesson announced his resignation on 7 June 2018, ending his tenure as one of the most successful coaches in the history of the national side.He was selected as Director of cricket for Royal Challengers Bangalore in the IPL. Prior to his appointment by New Zealand, he had served as Kenya‚Äôs coach, citing \\"security concerns\\" as the reason for his resignation. Hesson was criticised for his controversial recommendation that Ross Taylor should surrender the captaincy in favour of Brendon McCullumhttp://tvnz.co.nz/cricket-news/hesson-s-advice-laughable-ross- taylor-5273821 However, in 2013‚Äì14, Hesson mended the relationship with Taylor and took the BlackCaps to series wins in England and South Africa away, and West Indies and India at home.

The BlackCaps' culture and style of play cultivated by Hesson and McCullum was transformative for cricket in New Zealand. In the 2015 Queen's Birthday Honours Hesson and McCullum were appointed Officers of the New Zealand Order of Merit for services to cricket. In the 2017/2018 New Zealand summer the BlackCaps were inundated with plaudits as they achieved a New Zealand-record 13-match winning streak in completed games across all formats. From August 2012 to April 2018, when his reign culminated in a Test series win at home against England, Hesson's team played 53 Tests, won 21, lost 19 and drawn 13. By comparison, the 1980s had 59 Tests of which 17 were won, 15 lost and 27 drawn. In completed ODIs, Hesson oversaw 112 for 65 wins, 46 losses and a tie; the 1980s results were 122 played, 56 won and 66 lost.. In Twenty20 internationals (not played in the 1980s), the figures were 56 completed games, with 30 wins, 24 losses and two ties. Hesson was New Zealand's longest serving cricket coach. He developed a reputation for being a paragon of calm and a brilliant man- manager, and for developing and maintaining an admirable team culture, all the while taking the BlackCaps to unprecedented success. In May 2018 Hesson was appointed as a coach representative on the International Cricket Council Cricket Committee. Despite his contract running until the end of 2019 Cricket World Cup, Hesson announced his resignation in June 2018.

History The Great Slump occurred in England between approximately 1440 and 1480.Hicks, p.40. The economic slowdown began in the 1430s in the north of the country, spreading south in the 1440s, with the economy not recovering until the 1480s.Hicks, p.50. The Great Slump took place against a wider trading crisis in Northern Europe, driven by shortages of silver, essential for the money supply, and a breakdown in trade. Some accounts refer to the event as a \\"credit crunch\\". Some scholars blamed the slump on the effects of the Hundred Years' War and the economic blockades suffered by England due to its predations in France and its wars with Spain and the Hanseatic League. It was also said to be driven by multiple harvest failures in the 1430s and disease amongst livestock, that drove up the price of food and damaged the wider economy.Hatcher, p.246. The impact of the Great Slump was far reaching across England. Certain groups were particularly badly affected: cloth exports fell by 35 percent in just four years at the end of the 1440s, for example, collapsing by up to 90 percent in some parts of the South-West.Hicks, p.51. Prices of remaining trade goods fell dramatically as well.Hatcher, p.243. Popular rebellions ensued in 1450 under Jack Cade, and the events contributed to the outbreak of the Wars of the Roses in the 1460s.Hicks, pp.52‚Äì54. One of the ways English merchants survived the Great Slump was through the formation of merchant networks, which enabled them to organize into large conglomerates. This allowed access to needed bullion and well-guarded credit.

History  Sailors and fishermen from the port of Fano (PU) may have created the drink, as they used similar ingredients to warm and invigorate themselves in the workplace. In the past, the poor economised, so leftovers were gathered together as a liquor. Over time, these ingredients became the basis for moretta. In 2004, AIBES (Associazione Italiana Barman e Sostenitori) recognised moretta as an official cocktail.Confesercenti PU  Preparation  The hot cocktail is a blend of anise, rum and brandy in roughly equal parts. The type of alcohol used can vary according to personal taste and individual recipes. For example, one variant uses cognac instead of brandy. The liquor is heated with steam, together with sugar and lemon or orange zest, and poured directly into the glass, if possible, in order to dissolve the sugar. Then, warm coffee, preferably espresso, is added slowly, so as not to mix with the liquor. Moretta is usually served in small transparent glasses, allowing the drinker to see the expected three layers: froth, coffee, and liquor. The drinker may then stir it before drinking.

The account of his stay at the Cape from 12 March to 7 July 1825, \\"De vruchten mijner werkzaamheden\\" (fruits of my labours), was a thorough description of his trip, rich in interesting detail of the personalities and places he came across, and thoughtful commentary on the social, political and economic life of the Cape colony. Despite this being his first published attempt at writing, the artless manner in which he set down his observations on language, habits and customs, modes of transport, farming practices and the appearance of the countryside, must rank this as one of the finest travelogues on the Cape.http://www.dbnl.org/tekst/teen002vruc02_01/teen002vruc02_01.pdf Besides trying the restorative waters of the Caledon baths, he visited Genadendal Mission, Franschhoek and Stellenbosch. Teenstra belonged to a prosperous Groninger farming family of Frisian descent, and was the son of Douwe Martens Teenstra and Jantje Luies Dijkhuis. In 1819 his father bought him the 100ha farm \\"Arion\\" for the sum of 100 000 guilders. The collapsing agricultural market caused widespread financial losses, and led to his 1824 decision to temporarily abandon farming, his wife and his children, and to leave for Java aboard a swift frigate named \\"Abel Tasman\\". Life aboard the ship was comfortable with excellent fare, often consisting of seven or eight dishes, wine, music and singing after supper, and the odd game of cards, checkers or chess. In the equatorial latitudes, though, the heat was oppressive, especially at night, when the mingled odours of cheese, ham and unwashed bodies from the hold, forced passengers to sleep on deck. Teenstra, together with 33 others who had not crossed the equator previously, were subjected to the ceremony of \\"crossing the line\\". After a voyage lasting sixty-one days via Madeira, the Canary Islands and Trinidad, their ship anchored in Table Bay on 11 March 1825. Teenstra was feeling decidedly unwell, a condition he put down to a freak squall's having drenched him while he was enjoying a bath. In this fragile state he spent a few weeks in the company of his landlady, Miss Truter and her family members, who by horse and buggy introduced him to Cape Town and the Peninsula. His next letter was dated 1 May 1825 and was written from Caledon, a source of mineral-rich hot springs where he \\"took the waters\\" on the advice of his doctor, his ship having left for Batavia while he underwent an enforced convalescence. Teenstra returned to his family in 1826 and soon realised that agricultural prospects had not improved during his absence. Consequently he sold his farm and moved to Baflo with his family, from where he wrote most of his travel books. Again, he found himself in financial trouble and in 1828 moved to Surinam, at that time one of the Dutch colonies. Here he became an agricultural advisor and was soon appointed as inspector of bridges, roads and waterworks. Over this period his wife and children were living in Ulrum in a house built by his mother-in-law.

He was the son of a man named Aralt, and appears to have been a grandson of Amla√≠b Cuar√°n, King of Northumbria and Dublin. Such a relationship would have meant that √çmar was a member of the U√≠ √çmair, and that he was a nephew of Amla√≠b Cuar√°n's son, Sitriuc mac Amla√≠b, King of Dublin, a man driven from Dublin by Echmarcach mac Ragnaill in 1036. √çmar's reign in Dublin spanned at least eight years, from 1038 to 1046. Although he began by seizing the kingship from Echmarcach in 1038, he eventually lost it to him in 1046. As king, √çmar is recorded to have overseen military operations throughout Ireland, and seems to have actively assisted the family of Iago ab Idwal ap Meurig, King of Gwynedd overseas in Wales. After Echmarcach's final expulsion from Dublin 1052, √çmar may well have been reinstalled as King of Dublin by Diarmait mac Ma√≠l na mB√≥, King of Leinster. Whatever the case, √çmar died in 1054. He may have been an ancestor or close kinsman of Gofraid Crob√°n, King of Dublin and the Isles, the progenitor of a family that ruled in the Isles until the mid thirteenth century. Familial background Locations relating to √çmar and his contemporaries in Britain and Ireland. √çmar was probably the son of Aralt mac Amla√≠b,Hudson, BT (2005) p. 171; Duffy (2004a); Duffy (1992) pp. 96, 106. a man whose death at the Battle of Glenn M√°ma is recorded by the seventeenth- century texts Annals of Clonmacnoise and Annals of the Four Masters, the fifteenth- to sixteenth-century Annals of Ulster, and the twelfth-century Chronicon Scotorum.Annals of the Four Masters (2013a) ¬ß 998.11; Annals of the Four Masters (2013b) ¬ß 998.11; Chronicon Scotorum (2012) ¬ß 999; The Annals of Ulster (2012) ¬ß 999.8; Chronicon Scotorum (2010) ¬ß 999; The Annals of Ulster (2008) ¬ß 999.8; Downham (2007) pp. 29 fig. 6, 58, 245; Forte; Oram; Pedersen (2005) p. 228 n. 29; Hudson, BT (2005) p. 171; MacShamhr√°in (2005) p. 9; Duffy (2002) p. 56 n. 9; MacShamhr√°in (2001) p. 61; Oram (2000) p. 46 n. 81; Murphy (1896) p. 164. If this identification is correct, √çmar's paternal grandfather would have been Amla√≠b Cuar√°n, King of Northumbria and Dublin,McDonald (2019) p. 22; Downham (2007) pp. 29 fig. 6, 241‚Äì243, 245; Hudson, BT (2005) p. 171; Duffy (2004a). and a paternal uncle of √çmar would have been Sitriuc mac Amla√≠b, King of Dublin.Downham (2007) pp. 29 fig. 6, 58, 245; Duffy (2006) p. 60; Forte; Oram; Pedersen (2005) p. 228; Hudson, BT (2005) pp. 83 n. 3, 135; Duffy (2002) pp. 55‚Äì56; Oram (2000) pp. 16, 46 n. 81; McDonald (1997) p. 33; Thornton (1996) p. 89; Duffy (1993) p. 35; Duffy (1992) pp. 96, 96 n. 14, 106. Struggle for Dublin The name of Sitriuc mac Amla√≠b as it appears on folio 16v of Oxford Bodleian Library Rawlinson B 488: \\"\\".The Annals of Tigernach (2010) ¬ß 1028.2; Annals of Tigernach (2005) ¬ß 1028.2; Bodleian Library MS. Rawl. B. 488 (n.d.). √çmar's probable uncle, Sitriuc, ruled Dublin for almost fifty years between 989 and 1036.Connon (2005). There is reason to suspect that the latter's realm included Mann by the second or third decade of the eleventh century.Duffy (2006) p. 54; Forte; Oram; Pedersen (2005) pp. 229‚Äì230; Duffy (1992) p. 98. His reign in Dublin was finally put to an end by Echmarcach mac Ragnaill, who drove Sitriuc from the coastal town and claimed the kingship for himself.Connon (2005); Downham (2004) pp. 64‚Äì65; Etchingham (2001) pp. 157‚Äì158; Duffy (1997) p. 38. Previously, Sitriuc seems to have been closely aligned with Kn√∫tr Sveinnsson, ruler of the kingdoms of England, Denmark, and Norway.Lawson (2013); Hudson, BT (2005) pp. 120‚Äì125; Insley (2005); Downham (2004) pp. 63‚Äì64; Hudson, BT (2004a); Oram (2000) pp. 31, 34; Hudson, B (1994); Lawson (1993) pp. 106, 185. Kn√∫tr's apparent authority in the Irish Sea region, coupled with Sitriuc's seemingly close connections with him, could account for the remarkable security enjoyed by Sitriuc during Kn√∫tr's reign.Hudson, BT (2005) pp. 119‚Äì127; Insley (2005). It is possible that Echmarcach had been bound from taking action against Sitriuc whilst Kn√∫tr held power,Downham (2004) pp. 64‚Äì65. and that the confusion caused by the latter's death in 1035 enabled Echmarcach to exploit the situation and seize control of the Irish Sea region.Woolf (2007) p. 246. Although there is no direct evidence that Echmarcach controlled Mann by this date, Sitriuc does not appear to have taken refuge on the island after his expulsion from Dublin. This seems to suggest that the island was outside Sitriuc's possession, and may indicate that Mann had fallen into the hands of Echmarcach sometime before.Forte; Oram; Pedersen (2005) pp. 229‚Äì231. In fact, it is possible that Echmarcach used the island to launch his takeover of Dublin.Forte; Oram; Pedersen (2005) pp. 229‚Äì231; Oram (2000) pp. 16‚Äì17. The name of Echmarcach mac Ragnaill as it appears on folio 17r of Oxford Bodleian Library Rawlinson B 488: \\"\\".The Annals of Tigernach (2010) ¬ß 1036.8; Annals of Tigernach (2005) ¬ß 1036.8; Bodleian Library MS. Rawl. B. 488 (n.d.). Echmarcach's hold on Dublin was short-lived as the fourteenth-century Annals of Tigernach records that √çmar replaced him as King of Dublin in 1038.The Annals of Tigernach (2010) ¬ß 1038.1; Annals of Tigernach (2005) ¬ß 1038.1; Hudson, BT (2005) p. 135; Oram (2000) p. 16; Duffy (1992) p. 96; Anderson (1922a) pp. 590‚Äì592 n. 2. This annal-entry has been interpreted to indicate that √çmar drove Echmarcach from the kingship.Forte; Oram; Pedersen (2005) p. 228; Hudson, BT (2005) p. 135; Oram (2000) p. 16. There is reason to suspect that √û√≥rfinnr Sigur√∞arson, Earl of Orkney extended his presence into the Isles and the Irish Sea region at about this period.Hudson, BT (2005) p. 135. The evidence of √û√≥rfinnr's power in the Isles could suggest that he possessed an active interest in the ongoing struggle over the Dublin kingship.Byrne (2008) p. 897. In fact, √û√≥rfinnr's predatory operations in the Irish Sea region may have contributed to Echmarcach's loss of Dublin in 1038. Haraldr Kn√∫tsson as it appears on 156v of British Library Cotton Tiberius B I (the \\"C\\" version of the Anglo-Saxon Chronicle): \\"\\".O'Keeffe (2001) p. 107; Cotton MS Tiberius B I (n.d.). It is conceivable that √çmar received some form of support from Kn√∫tr's son and successor in Britain, Haraldr Kn√∫tsson, King of England. The latter was certainly in power when √çmar replaced Echmarcach, and an association between √çmar and Haraldr could explain why the Annals of Ulster reports the latter's death two years later.The Annals of Ulster (2012) ¬ß 1040.6; The Annals of Ulster (2008) ¬ß 1040.6; Hudson, BT (2005) pp. 135‚Äì136. √çmar's reign lasted about eight years,Annals of the Four Masters (2013b) ¬ß 1046.8; Forte; Oram; Pedersen (2005) p. 228; Hudson, BT (2005) p. 137; Oram (2000) p. 16; Duffy (1992) p. 96; Anderson (1922a) pp. 590‚Äì592 n. 2. and one of his first royal acts appears to have been the invasion of Rathlin Island within the year.Hudson, BT (2005) p. 136. The fact that he proceeded to campaign in the North Channel could indicate that Echmarcach had held power in this region before his acquisition of Mann and Dublin.Forte; Oram; Pedersen (2005) p. 229; Oram (2000) p. 16. In 1044, the Annals of Tigernach records that √çmar penetrated into the domain of the U√≠ Fh√≠achrach Arda Sratha and killed their chief. The annal-entry also indicates that √çmar stormed the church of Armagh, and burned ' (the \\"Shrine of Patrick\\") in the attack.Erskine (2012) pp. 214‚Äì215; The Annals of Tigernach (2010) ¬ß 1044.4; Annals of Tigernach (2005) ¬ß 1044.4; Hudson, BT (2005) pp. 136, 171; Ryan (1949) p. 76; Crawford (1923) p. 80. The following year, he again invaded Rathlin Island, and his subsequent slaughter of three hundred noblemen of the Ulaid, including a certain heir apparent named Ragnall Ua Eochada, is documented by the Annals of Clonmacnoise, the Annals of Inisfallen, the Annals of Tigernach, and the Annals of the Four Masters.Duffy (2006) p. 55; Annals of the Four Masters (2013a) ¬ß 1045.12; Annals of the Four Masters (2013b) ¬ß 1045.12; Annals of Inisfallen (2010) ¬ß 1045.5; The Annals of Tigernach (2010) ¬ß 1045.3; Annals of Inisfallen (2008) ¬ß 1045.5; Annals of Tigernach (2005) ¬ß 1045.3; Hudson, BT (2005) p. 136; Duffy (2002) p. 53; Duffy (1995) p. 391; Duffy (1993) p. 234; Duffy (1992) p. 98, 98 n. 29; Ryan (1949) p. 76; Murphy (1896) p. 177. This remarkable action may indicate that the Dubliners and Ulaid were battling for control of Rathlin Island. If so, it could be evidence that √çmar enjoyed the possession of Mann by this date. The domain of the Ulaid is certainly the closest Irish territory to Mann,Duffy (2002) p. 53. and the control of the Manx fleet could account for the Dubliner's ability to challenge the Ulaid.Duffy (2006) p. 55. Whatever the case, within the year Niall mac Eochada, King of Ulaid is recorded to have attacked Fine GallThe Annals of Tigernach (2010) ¬ß 1045.11; Annals of Tigernach (2005) ¬ß 1045.11; Hudson, BT (2005) p. 136.‚ÄîDublin's agriculturally-rich northern hinterlandDuffy (2017); Downham (2014) p. 19; Downham (2013) p. 158; Downham (2005); Downham (2005); Valante (1998‚Äì1999) p. 246, 246 n. 16; Holm (2000) pp. 254‚Äì255.‚Äîin what may have been a retaliatory raid. √çmar's name and title as they appear on folio 41r of Oxford Bodleian Library Rawlinson B 489 (the Annals of Ulster).The Annals of Ulster (2012) ¬ß 1054.1; The Annals of Ulster (2008) ¬ß 1054.1; Bodleian Library MS. Rawl. B. 489 (n.d.). The following year, the Annals of Tigernach states that Echmarcach succeeded √çmar.The Annals of Tigernach (2010) ¬ß 1046.6; Annals of Tigernach (2005) ¬ß 1046.6; Forte; Oram; Pedersen (2005) p. 228; Hudson, BT (2005) p. 137; Duffy (1992) p. 96; Anderson (1922a) pp. 590‚Äì592 n. 2. The Annals of the Four Masters specifies that √çmar was driven from the kingship by Echmarcach, who was then elected king by the Dubliners. After this point in √çmar's life, all that is known for certain is that he died in 1054,Hudson, BT (2005) p. 137. as recorded by the Annals of Ulster and the sixteenth-century Annals of Loch C√©.The Annals of Ulster (2012) ¬ß 1054.1; Annals of Loch C√© (2008) ¬ß 1054.1; The Annals of Ulster (2008) ¬ß 1054.1; Duffy (1992) p. 97; Anderson (1922a) pp. 590‚Äì592 n. 2. Nevertheless, since these sources style √çmar in Gaelic r√≠ Gall (\\"king of the foreigners\\"), there may be evidence to suggest that, when Diarmait mac Ma√≠l na mB√≥, King of Leinster drove Echmarcach from Dublin in 1052, Diarmait reinstalled √çmar as king.Duffy (1992) p. 97. After √çmar's death, Diarmait appears to have appointed his own son, Murchad, control of Dublin later that decade, as the Annals of the Four Masters accords him the title tigherna Gall, meaning \\"lord of the foreigners\\" in 1059.Annals of the Four Masters (2013a) ¬ß 1059.20; Annals of the Four Masters (2013b) ¬ß 1059.20; Duffy (2002) p. 54, 54 n. 3; Duffy (1993) p. 32, 32 n. 5; Duffy (1992) pp. 99‚Äì100, 100 n. 34. In 1061, Murchad invaded Mann and seems to have overthrown Echmarcach.Hudson, B (2005); Duffy (2002) p. 54; Duffy (1997) p. 37; Duffy (1993) pp. 32‚Äì33; Duffy (1992) p. 100; Candon (1988) p. 402; Anderson (1922a) pp. 590‚Äì592 n. 2. The record of Murchad's actions against Echmarcach could indicate that the latter had seated himself on the island after his expulsion from Dublin.Byrne (2008) pp. 864, 892; Duffy (2006) pp. 55‚Äì56; Etchingham (2001) p. 154; Duffy (1993) pp. 32‚Äì33; Duffy (1992) p. 100. Another possibility is that Echmarcach had only reestablished himself as king in the Isles after √çmar's death in 1054.Candon (1988) p. 402. Whatever the case, both Diarmait and Murchad were dead by 1072, and the Annals of Tigernach describes Diarmait on his obituary as King of the Isles (r√≠ Innsi Gall, literally \\"king of the isles of the foreigners\\"), a declaration which seems to indicate that, by the eleventh century at least, the kingship of the Isles was contingent upon control of Mann.The Annals of Tigernach (2010) ¬ß 1072.1; Annals of Tigernach (2005) ¬ß 1072.1; Duffy (2002) pp. 53‚Äì54; Duffy (1993) p. 33. Involvement in Wales The name of Iago ab Idwal ap Meurig as it appears on folio 60r of Oxford Jesus College 111 (the Red Book of Hergest): \\"\\".Williams Ab Ithel (1860) pp. 38‚Äì39 ¬ß 1031; Jesus College MS. 111 (n.d.); Oxford Jesus College MS. 111 (n.d.) p. 60r. The principal Welsh monarch during √çmar's reign was Gruffudd ap Llywelyn. One of the latter's main rivals was Iago ab Idwal ap Meurig, King of Gwynedd, a man who had killed Gruffudd's father in 1023, and thenceforth ruled Gwynedd until his own demise in 1039.Pryce (2004); Snyder (2003) p. 182. Gruffudd himself may have been responsible for Iago's slaying, and certainly succeeded to the kingship of Gwynedd after his death.Hudson, BT (2005) p. 136; Pryce (2004); Walker (2004); Snyder (2003) p. 182. It was likely in the context of Iago's fall and this resulting regime change that the latter's son, Cynan, fled overseas and sought refuge in Dublin.Duffy (2009) p. 290; Downham (2004) p. 66; Duffy (2004b) p. 104; Duffy (1997) p. 38. According to the thirteenth-century Historia Gruffud vab Kenan, the mother of Cynan's son was Ragnailt ingen Amla√≠b, a paternal granddaughter of Sitriuc. Further revealed by this source is the fact that this woman's father, Amla√≠b mac Sitriuc, built and commanded a Welsh fortress called Castell Avloed.Hudson, BT (2005) pp. 120‚Äì121; Etchingham (2001) pp. 157‚Äì158; Thornton (1996) pp. 87‚Äì88; Duffy (1995) p. 381; Hudson, B (1994) p. 328; Loyn (1976) pp. 15‚Äì16, 16 n. 1; An Inventory of the Ancient Monuments (1964) pp. cxxxix‚Äìcxlii, cxxxix n. 2; Wainwright (1962) p. 56; Jones (1910) pp. 104‚Äì105, 160 n. 9. Although it is unknown how long the Dubliners possessed the fortress, in 1036 another son of Sitriuc was slain in Wales by an apparent kinsman,The Annals of Tigernach (2010) ¬ß 1036.9; Annals of Tigernach (2005) ¬ß 1036.9; Hudson, BT (2005) p. 121; Etchingham (2001) pp. 157‚Äì158, 158 n. 35; Duffy (1997) p. 38; Duffy (1995) p. 381; Hudson, B (1994) p. 329. an event which could be evidence of a struggle for control of the site.Hudson, BT (2005) p. 121; Duffy (1995) p. 381; Hudson, B (1994) p. 329. Echmarcach's aforesaid expulsion of Sitriuc from Dublin in the same year could in turn indicate that this exiled monarch sought refuge in Wales.Etchingham (2001) pp. 157‚Äì158; Duffy (1997) p. 38; Duffy (1995) p. 381; Hudson, B (1994) p. 329. Despite the uncertainty of its specific location, Castell Avloed appears to have been situated in territory formerly controlled by Iago, and there is reason to suspect that‚Äîafter Iago's fall and Cynan's flight‚Äî√çmar oversaw military actions against Gruffudd.Hudson, BT (2005) p. 136; Downham (2004) p. 66, 66 n. 109. Three years later, for example, the thirteenth- and fourteenth- century Brut y Tywysogyon and the \\"B\\" and \\"C\\" versions of the eleventh- to thirteenth-century Annales Cambri√¶ report that this Welsh king was captured by forces from Dublin.Charles-Edwards (2013) pp. 562, 564; Gough-Cooper (2015a) p. 48 ¬ß b1063.1; Gough-Cooper (2015b) p. 26 ¬ß c364.2; Hudson, BT (2005) pp. 121, 136; Downham (2004) p. 66, 66 n. 109; Walker (2004); Snyder (2003) p. 182; Moore (1996) p. 26; Walker (1960) p. 86; Williams Ab Ithel (1860) pp. 40‚Äì41 ¬ß 1040. The episode is further elaborated upon by a sixteenth-century text compiled by David Powell and a seventeenth-century text by compiled by James Ware. According to these admittedly late versions of events, Gruffudd was captured by the Dubliners in the context of them supporting the cause of Cynan. The accounts further state that Gruffudd managed to escape his captors when the Dubliners were counterattacked by Welsh forces before they could return to Ireland.Hudson, BT (2005) pp. 136‚Äì137; Hudson, BT (1991) pp. 342‚Äì343; Powell; Price (1774) p. 87; War√¶i (1658) pp. 138‚Äì139. The evidence of Cynan cooperating with the Dubliners against Gruffudd suggests that, not only was √çmar personally involved as king, but that the Welsh fortress of Castell Avloed was still controlled by the Dubliners. The name and title of Gruffudd ap Llywelyn as it appears on 163r of British Library Cotton Tiberius B I (the \\"C\\" version of the Anglo-Saxon Chronicle): \\"\\".O'Keeffe (2001) p. 116; Cotton MS Tiberius B I (n.d.). Another conflict that could have involved √çmar and the military forces of Dublin was Gruffudd's final defeat of Hywel ab Edwin, King of Deheubarth. According to Brut y Tywysogyon and the \\"B\\" version of Annales Cambri√¶ this last stand of Hywel took place at the mouth of the River Tywi‚Äîperhaps in the vicinity of Carmarthen‚Äîand included Vikings from Ireland who supported Hywel's cause.Gough-Cooper (2015a) p. 48 ¬ß b1065.1; Charles- Edwards (2013) p. 562, 562 n. 128; Hudson, BT (2005) pp. 121, 136; Downham (2004) p. 66, 66 n. 109; Walker (2004); Snyder (2003) pp. 182‚Äì183; Walker (1960) p. 86; Williams Ab Ithel (1860) pp. 40‚Äì41 ¬ß 1042. It is apparent that Gruffudd's adversaries generally utilised foreign military support from Ireland's Viking enclaves. Certainly, the twelfth-century Book of Llandaff declares that Gruffudd struggled against English, Irish, and Vikings during his career.Hudson, BT (2005) p. 136; Hudson, BT (1991) p. 331; Haddan; Stubbs (1869) p. 294; Rees (1840) pp. 258, 539‚Äì540.

It is now an intergovernmental and inter-institutional international organization, with the mandate and role to promote sustainable global development of the tropical fruit in relation to production, consumption and trade. It is membership- based, with members acting through one lead agency on inter-country decisions. Currently, TFNet has hundreds of members from 38 countries, 14 of them are governments of the following countries: Australia, Bangladesh, China, Fiji, India, Indonesia, Malaysia, Nigeria, Philippines, Saudi Arabia, Sri Lanka, Sudan, Syria, and Vietnam. It also has 20 associate members composed of companies and organizations including CAB International, Bioversity International, Crops for the Future, Afro-Asian Rural Development Organization, Inter-American Institute for Cooperation on Agriculture (IICA), and ordinary members. Background During the 1st International Consultation on Tropical Fruits held in Malaysia on 15‚Äì19 July 1996, delegates from 22 countries conferred about economic and trade issues that centered on the current situation of the tropical fruit industry, future prospects for fresh and processed tropical fruits, tariff concerns, and phytosanitary and quarantine measures. They also recognized the importance of tropical fruits in providing vitamins, nutrients, micronutrients, and fiber essential for human health and well being. One of the solutions proposed to address these needs is through the creation of a tropical fruits network. The Sub-Group on Tropical Fruits (SGTF) was established during the 15th session of the Intergovernmental Group on Banana in Rome on May 1997. During the 1st session of SGTF in Pattaya, Thailand on May 1998, it was agreed that TFNet should be a global independent network, with possibility of regional networks. Malaysia and Thailand were vying to house the TFNet headquarters. In May 1999, the Committee on Commodity Problems decided to set up the headquarters in Malaysia. Programmes and activities =Projects and consultancies= TFNet has completed projects and consultancies in partnership with international organizations. With FAO, TFNet prepared action plans for the sustainable development of the tropical fruit industry in Bangladesh, Fiji, Malaysia, and the Philippines. A plant variety protection study for tropical fruits in 8 Asian countries was also conducted with GTZ (now GIZ). TFNet was also tapped during the 1st phase of a project with the International Plant Genetic Resources Institute (IPGRI) (now Bioversity International) and The Asian Development Bank on the sustainable conservation and utilization of tropical fruit genetic resources in Asia. Local projects have also been conducted with the Malaysian government that focused on pineapple, watermelon, and other crops. =International seminars and conferences= International seminars on tropical and subtropical fruits have also organized by TFNet on trade, postharvest handling and processing, economics and marketing, consumer trends and export, and recent developments in the production, postharvest management and trade of minor tropical fruits. These seminars have been conducted in several countries in Asia and Africa. =Workshops and study tours= Five hands-on workshops and study visits were conducted with Sentra Pengembangan Agribisnis Terpadu (SPAT Indonesia) on food processing techniques such as fruit chip production. A three-year technical assistance on post-harvest handling and processing of fruits in the Syrian Arab Republic was also conducted with funding from the Malaysian government. Workshops and study tours have also been conducted in Malaysia, Indonesia, Thailand, Fiji, Nigeria, and other South East Asian countries. =Information dissemination= TFNet also facilitates the exchange of expert information among its members through a website and information portal that includes a fruit compendium, experts list, trade database, and discussion forums. A monthly news feed on global tropical fruit news is sent to members and subscribers. TFNet also collaborated with other organizations to establish MyFruit.org and a Global Information System on African tropical fruits. Membership =Country members= Country membership is open to all member countries of the FAO that are signatories to the Agreement on the Establishment of TFNet or who has acceded to the said Agreement.

The \\"finger of God\\" is a phrase used in the Bible. In Exodus 8:16‚Äì20 it is used during the plagues of Egypt by the Egyptian magicians. In Exodus 31:18 and Deuteronomy 9:10 it refers to the method by which the Ten Commandments were written on tablets of stone that were brought down from biblical Mount Sinai by Moses., It was also used once by Jesus in the Gospel of Luke to describe how he had cast out demons. Hebrew Bible The first time the phrase \\"finger of God\\" appears is in the Hebrew Bible, in the eighth chapter, in the paragraph of verses sixteen through twenty of the Book of Exodus, which reads The second time the phrase \\"finger of God\\" appears is at the last verse, verse eighteen of the thirty-first chapter of the same book, which reads \\"And he gave unto Moses, when he had made an end of communing with him upon mount Sinai, two tables of testimony, tables of stone, written with the finger of God.\\" The third time the phrase appears is a second reference to the tablets of the Ten Commandments, and is found in Deuteronomy 9:10, which says \\"And the LORD delivered unto me two tables of stone written with the finger of God; and on them was written according to all the words, which the LORD spake with you in the mount out of the midst of the fire in the day of the assembly.\\" =Writing on the wall= The fourth biblical mention is during Belshazzar's Feast in Daniel 5, when scripture reports 'fingers of a man's hand' wrote on the wall: :'''''' Daniel reads the words \\"MENE, MENE, TEKEL, UPHARSIN\\" and interprets them for the king: \\"MENE, God has numbered the days of your kingdom and brought it to an end; TEKEL, you have been weighed ... and found wanting;\\" and \\"PERES, your kingdom is divided and given to the Medes and Persians. Then Belshazzar gave the command, and Daniel was clothed in purple, a chain of gold was put around his neck, and a proclamation was made‚Ä¶ that he should rank third in the kingdom; [and] that very night Belshazzar the Chaldean (Babylonian) king was killed, and Darius the Mede received the kingdom.\\" The phrase handwriting on the wall has entered our lexicon from this reference to mean a warning of impending doom. New Testament The phrase is also used by Jesus in the Christian New Testament during his proof that he did not cast out demons by the power of Beelzebub. He said, \\"But if it is by the finger of God that I cast out the demons, then the kingdom of God has come to you.\\" In the New Testament story of Jesus and the woman taken in adultery, Jesus writes in the dust of the earth with his finger. Pope Benedict XVI notes from St Augustine that this gesture can be seen as portraying Christ as the divine legislator; Jesus' actions in writing in the dust are redolent of the Finger of God writing the Law on tablets of stone.

Although very successful over two miles, he also excelled at longer distances, and won the 1961 Irish Grand National and finished second in the 1962 and 1963 Cheltenham Gold Cups.  Background  Fortria was a bay horse bred by Mr. A. Craigie. His sire, Fortina, won the Cheltenham Gold Cup in 1947, the only entire (stallion) to do so. His dam, Senria also produced the 1957 and 1958 National Hunt Handicap Chase winner Sentina and the 1963 Irish Grand National winner Last Link. Fortria was owned by George Ansley and put into training with outstanding Irish trainer Tom Dreaper, who later trained Arkle. Fortria was ridden by Irish jockey Pat Taaffe.  Career  = Early career = Fortria made his debut in a maiden hurdle over two miles at Mullingar in 1957, where he finished ninth to Prince Swallow. He then finished third in the Glenview Hurdle at Leopardstown before switching to fences. He had much more success as a chaser, winning four races in Ireland before triumphing in the Cotswold Chase at Cheltenham by five lengths. Fortria failed to win in the 1958/59 season due to a breathing problem, which was rectified when he was hobdayed. = 1959/1960 Season = Returning the following autumn, Fortria won the two mile Pathfinder Chase at Manchester. Sent off the 6/5 favourite and carrying 12 st 3 lbs, he beat Nickleby by one and a half lengths. Back in Ireland, Fortria was stepped up in trip in a three-mile chase, where he was beaten a short head by Leopardstown Chase winner Fredith‚Äôs Son while conceding him 12 lbs. Fortria followed this up by finishing fourth in the Baldoyle Handicap Chase and second in the Easter Chase at Fairyhouse, where he gave 13 lbs to the future Grand Annual Challenge Cup winner Monsieur Trois Etoiles. Fortria returned to Cheltenham to contest the Champion Chase, which had been run for the first time in 1959. As the previous winner, Quita Que, was injured, Fortria was sent off the 2/1 favourite against Double Star and Blue Dolphin. Fortria contested the lead with Flame Gun (winner of the 1959 Cotswold Chase), who fell at the third last, before winning by three lengths from Blue Dolphin. Fortria completed his season by running in the Galway Plate under 12 st 7 lbs, where he finished fourth to Sparkling Flame. = 1960/1961 Season = Fortria had a very successful season the following year, winning eight out of his ten races in England and Ireland. He started off by winning a hurdle race in Ireland, before travelling to Cheltenham for the newly introduced Mackeson Gold Cup over two miles. Top weight was Saffron Tartan, who went on to win that season‚Äôs King George VI Chase and Cheltenham Gold Cup, on 12 st, but by virtue of his hurdles win, Fortria was given a 7 lb penalty and carried the same weight. Fortria stalked the pace in fifth before making progress down the hill to take the lead and win by six lengths from Icanopit (carrying just 10 st 3 lbs). Saffron Tartan finished down the field. Back in Ireland, Fortria defeated Albergo, dual winner of the Irish Champion Hurdle, in a chase over two miles three furlongs while conceding 19 lbs. He then finished fifth in the Thyestes Chase to Hunter‚Äôs Breeze (who had won the Christmas Chase at Leopardstown) and Mr. What (who had won the 1958 Grand National). Fortria next defeated Champion Hurdle winner Another Flash in a hurdle race at Baldoyle. He returned to the Cheltenham Festival to defend his Champion Chase title. Also in the five-runner field were 1959 winner Quita Que, 1963 winner Sandy Abbot, Monsieur Trois Etoiles, and top novice Retour de Flamme. Quita Que led at a steady early pace, while Fortria tracked with Sandy Abbot. At the second last fence, Fortria had only a narrow advantage over his rivals but kept on well up the hill to win by two lengths. Dreaper had given him an entry in the Cheltenham Gold Cup, but the decision was made to withdraw him after this effort. However, Quita Que reappeared two days later to win the Cathcart Challenge Cup. Fortria stepped up in trip for the Irish Grand National at Fairyhouse on his next start. The race was run on good ground and, carrying 12 st, he defeated thirteen rivals to win by four lengths. Also in the field were Owen‚Äôs Sedge, who had won the Powers Gold Cup in 1960, and Zonda, the 1959 Irish Grand National winner. = 1961/1962 Season = Fortria won only once in seven races that year, with that victory coming in a walkover. He was beaten by ten lengths when conceding Grallagh Cnoc 18 lbs. He then ran in the Mackeson Gold Cup and was second by three lengths to Scottish Memories (receiving 16 lbs), who had won his last nine races. Back in fifth was 1960 Cheltenham Gold Cup winner Pas Seul. Rather than running in the Champion Chase at the Festival, connections made the decision to run Fortria in the Cheltenham Gold Cup. In the race, he came up against the other top chaser of the era, Mandarin, who had won two Hennessy Gold Cups and two King George VI Chases. Fortria hit the front in what looked like a winning move, until Mandarin came driving up the inside under Fred Winter to triumph by a length. The two horses were ten lengths clear of their rivals. Fortria then ran in the Punchestown Handicap Chase over two miles, where he was third to Owen‚Äôs Sedge, conceding 23 lbs. = 1962/1963 Season = The following season, Mandarin had retired but Fortria was still considered the dominant chaser in Ireland. Fortria won the Hermitage Chase over a two and half miles at Newbury, defeating Whitbread Gold Cup winner Hoodwinked by three lengths. He next ran in the Mackeson Gold Cup for the third time, where he was again allocated 12 st and faced two Champion Chase winners in Piperton and Sandy Abbot. Sandy Abbot led the field while Fortria lingered further back until the last open ditch, where he moved forward with a great leap at the fence. Coming to the last, he was strongly challenged by the lightly weighted School For Gamble and Owen‚Äôs Sedge but refused to yield and galloped on to win by three lengths. This victory was his seventh in England and nineteenth in total, bringing his earnings to ¬£19,731. He next ran in the two mile Baldoyle Handicap Chase but made little impression. He ran in the Cheltenham Gold Cup in March but was no match for the six-year-old Mill House, who ran away from the field to win by ten lengths. Fortria then attempted to win a second Irish Grand National under 12 st but tired in the heavy ground and fell when well behind. His sister, Last Link, won the race under 9 st 7 lbs. = 1963/1964 Season = Fortria recorded his final victory in a race in Ireland, then finished second in the Becher Steeplechase under a weight of 12 st 7 lbs after tiring and making a mistake at the last fence. His final race came in the Mackeson Gold Cup where, under top weight for the fourth time, he struggled into fifth behind Richard Of Bordeaux. It was the first time he had ever finished out of the first two in England.  Retirement  Soon after his Mackeson Gold Cup run, Fortria was retired by his connections as the winner of twenty races and ¬£20,344. The Grade 2 Fortria Chase at Navan is named in his honour and features Moscow Flyer and Native Upmanship among its winners.

They were usually around ten feet high, and replicate the 10 stations on Fuji itself, from the foot of the mountain to the summit.

Based in Paris, the press was founded in 1979 by Crombie as a vehicle for his literary and design aspirations; since then, he and Bourne (who often creates artwork for the books), have printed by hand and published more than 150 small books. The design and typography of Kickshaws publications is unusual, involving a wide range of (often French) type designs, letterpress printing in multiple colours, and the use of unusual formats and binding styles, notably a simple form of comb-binding which allows the leaves of a book to be folded and refolded in different sequences. Textually, many of the books are either Crombie's own poetry or fiction, or his interpretations or translations of French or Francophile humorists and absurdist writers, including Samuel Beckett, Alphonse Allais and Pierre Henri Cami (the latter being a particular favourite of Crombie's, and a writer he considers greatly undervalued). The artwork incorporated into Kickshaws books includes drawings, linocuts and images printed from vinyl cut-outs in a variety of colours, designed to harmonize with the typography of the books and to illustrate, or decorate, the text. Kickshaws publishes books in both French and English (sometimes both), and its publications are in some ways closer to French livres d'artiste than to private press books in the Anglo-American tradition.

Start The business was founded in the late 1940s by Charlie Williams (1915-1969) from Corsica Coachworks and Len Pritchard (1919-2008) whose coachbuilding careers had been diverted by the war to building Spitfire aircraft. They began in Edmonton then worked from Hornsey with an extra workshop in Hammersmith before returning permanently to Edmonton. Clients The clients of Williams & Pritchard included: Colin Chapman, Lotus, AC (Aceca coup√©), Lola, Cooper, Lister-Jaguar, Elva, John Surtees, Costin, Gordon-Keeble, BRM, John Sprinzel, Speedwell. The last coach building client of William's and Pritchard was designer David Gittens McLaren based Ikenga GT prototypes, constructed between 1967 and completed following Charlie Williams death in June 1969. Another project was carried out for the 1970s when the rare OWEN SEDANCA GT, another original sports car that appeared briefly for sale with Jaguar Straightsix 4235cc running gear from a Jaguar XJ6 car with an aluminium bodyshell of which 80 cars were to be made but only a reputed ten were actually made at their W & S LIMITED Edmonton North London workshops. In the early days of Lotus, Williams & Pritchard employed about two dozen men and put through production runs that took about three weeks to build a car. Williams & Pritchard was to build every Lotus prototype up to and including the Elan. The close relationship with Lotus ended in 1962 after Lotus set up their own body shop. Moulds for glass fibre bodies were made from bodies first made and finished in aluminium, but the first Lister-Jaguar was made by shaping a chicken wire armature on the actual chassis. When the original 1961 Gordon-Keeble project was revived in 1964, a new prototype incorporating improvements over the Bertone version was made in alloy in order to build a mould. Production was planned to be at Eastleigh near Southampton. Williams & Pritchard set up their own facility at Eastleigh employing around 20 extra people there, and another at Edmonton. The partners alternated between the sites. Eventually Keeble's revived project fell apart and it became an expensive experience for Williams and Pritchard. The most acclaimed British entry in the 1969 Italian International Auto Show in Turino, Italy was the Ikenga MK III GT by Charlie Williams of Williams and Pritchard and David Gittens ( http://dwij.org/dwij/auto.htm ). After the sudden death of Charlie Williams in 1969, the fibre-glass section was closed and the business deliberately shrunk to about half a dozen employees building metal prototypes and occasionally restoring famous postwar racing cars. Williams & Pritchard closed in 1986. The rights to the company name have been the subject of various claims in recent years. In 2010, the name 'Williams & Pritchard Ltd' and the design of the ID plate fixed in period to cars bearing W&P; coachwork was registered as a UK Trade Mark.The Intellectual Property Office, After-market Williams & Pritchard provided detachable glass fibre hardtops for all contemporary sports cars and replacement front-ends (bonnet and mudguards sections), particularly for Austin-Healey Sprites.

Early life Dennis Embleton was born in Newcastle on 1 October 1810. His father, Thomas Embleton was born in East Chevington and his mother Anne (n√©e Cawood) from Alwinton village, which is west of Alnwick and at the head of the River Coquet. He had an elder brother Thomas William Embleton, was trained as a mining engineer and moved in 1831 to Middleton, Leeds, to the position of colliery viewer His father died in 1820, and Dennis and his brother Thomas were brought up by an uncle, George Hill, also a colliery viewer, of Kenton, Newcastle. Both he and his brother Thomnas William were educated at Witton-le-Wear Grammar School, County Durham, under the Rev. George Newby. Career After leaving Witton School, he started his apprenticeship on 23 April 1827, bound to a Mr. T. Leighton, the Senior Surgeon at Newcastle Infirmary for a period of five years, the cost of which to his guardian, was ¬£500, not an inconsiderately sum in those days. He left Newcastle before the end of his apprenticeship, with the permission and consent of Mr. Leighton, to complete his studies in London at Guy's Hospital, St Thomas' Hospital, Grainger's anatomical school at Maze Pond (in London), and probably also at Pilcher's School of Anatomy. He qualified in 1834. After working for around a year, he spent the next two years travelling mainly on foot around Europe, with another medical student, William Croser. They both spoke French and Italian very well. They journeyed to Paris, Strasbourg, Baden, Switzerland, over the Simplon Pass, Milan, Genoa, Rome, Bologna, Pisa, Florence, Venice, Trieste, Vienna, The Tyrol and back to Paris. All the time, in addition to seeing the sights, they visited numerous medical establishments, and at Pisa they petitioned the university, sat the examination for doctorate of medicine, passed and were granted diplomas on 14 September 1836 Marriage and family Embleton was married in 1847 in Whickham to Miss Elizabeth Turner (died 1869), who also had a great interest in nature and the sciences; they had three children. Their son was Dennis Cawood Embleton (b. 9 March 1854), MD, MRCS, who predeceased him by a few months at Bournemouth, where he had a large practice. Embleton also had two daughters, one married.

This poem appeared in the Newcastle Courant around 1890 with no indication of authorship, but Thomas Allan in his Illustrated Edition of Tyneside Songs attributed it to Embleton. This was later shown to be correct when details of his works were produced and printed with his bibliographical details in his official obituary.

It has two sections: the Archaeological Section and the Medieval and Modern Section.  History  Archaeological artefacts outside the museum In 1870 Luigi Torelli, the prefect of Venice, purchased the Palazzo del Consiglio to house a centre of archaeological artefacts found in Torcello, its adjacent islands and the nearby mainland. In 1872 after Torelli had given the building to the Province of Venice, the Museum was founded, assigning the direction to the researcher Nicol√≤ Battaglini. In 1887 Cesare Augusto Levi took his place: he continued the collection from the area and added others which he gathered during his travels, especially in Rome. In 1887 he bought the Palazzo dell‚ÄôArchivio, restored it and moved the archaeological collection there, naming it Museo dell‚ÄôEstuario, donating it to the provincial authorities. On May 14, 1889, the Museo Provinciale di Torcello was inaugurated. In 1909 Levi was succeeded by Luigi Conton who discovered various necropolis in Adria from where he probably brought some findings to Torcello. Between 1928 and 1930 the collections were rearranged under the management of Adolfo Callegari, the director until 1948. In his period, inventory, cataloguing and restoration were undertaken, including the publication, in 1930, of the catalogue Il museo di Torcello. In 1949 the direction was assigned to Giulia Fogolari who, with the assistance of Guido Zattera, supervised the museum till 1997. In 1974, after a radical restoration of the Palazzo del Consiglio and of the objects exhibited, the medieval and modern sections were opened. In the following years the Palazzo dell‚ÄôArchivio was restored and the present archaeological section was inaugurated in the summer of 1990 with a new layout. From 2005 to 2006 the Palazzo del Consiglio was restored and adapted to safety regulations.  Collections  San Cristoforo The Museum houses a collection of works reflecting the history of the Venetian lagoon from private collections, archaeological finds and artefacts purchased by collectors, as well as handicrafts discovered in Torcello, the adjacent islands and the neighbouring mainland. The museum is divided into two main sections: the archaeological finds and the medieval and modern sections. The Archaeological Section, which is housed in the Palazzo dell‚ÄôArchivio, contains archaeological finds coming from the Lagoon and relics from other areas dating from the Palaeolithic era to the late-Roman period. The Medieval and Modern Section, which is housed in the Palazzo del Consiglio, contains objects and documents from the first centuries of the Christian Era until the 19th century presenting the history of the island of Torcello and its relations with the area of Altino, the Byzantine culture and the city of Venice.

Dressed in tactical clothing, James Eagan Holmes set off tear gas grenades and shot into the audience with multiple firearms. Twelve people were killed and 70 others were injured, 58 of them from gunfire. It was the deadliest shooting in Colorado since the Columbine High School massacre in 1999. At the time, the event had the largest number of victims (82) in one shooting in modern U.S. history. This number was eventually surpassed by the 107 victims in the 2016 Orlando nightclub shooting. Holmes was arrested minutes later in his car outside the cinema. Earlier, he had rigged his apartment with homemade explosives and incendiary devices. These were defused by the Arapahoe County Sheriff's Office Bomb Squad a day after the shooting. Fearing copycat crimes, movie theaters showing the same film across the US increased their security. Gun sales increased in Colorado, and political debates were generated about gun control in the United States. Holmes confessed to the shooting but pleaded not guilty by reason of insanity. Arapahoe County prosecutors sought the death penalty in this case. The trial began on April 27, 2015. On July 16 of that year, Holmes was convicted of 24 counts of first-degree murder, 140 counts of attempted first-degree murder, and one count of possessing explosives. On August 7, he was sentenced to life in prison without the possibility of parole. On August 26, he was given twelve life sentences, one for every person he killed; he also received 3,318 years for the attempted murders of those he wounded and for rigging his apartment with explosives. Shooting The shooting occurred in Theater 9 at the Century 16 multiplex (operated by Cinemark Theatres), located in the Town Center at Aurora shopping mall at 14300 E. Alameda Avenue. Police said that Holmes bought a ticket, entered the theater, and sat in the front row. About 20 minutes into the film, he left theater 9 through an emergency exit door beside the movie screen, with direct access to the lightly used parking area at the back of the complex, while propping the door slightly open with a plastic tablecloth holder. There were about 400 people inside theater 9. Holmes went to his car (which he had parked near the exit door), changed into protective clothing, and retrieved his guns. About 30 minutes into the movie, police say, around 12:30 a.m., he reentered the theater through the exit door. Holmes was dressed in black and wore a gas mask, a load-bearing vest (not to be confused with a bulletproof vest), a ballistic helmet, bullet-resistant leggings, a bullet-resistant throat protector, a groin protector, and tactical gloves. He was listening to techno music through a set of headphones so that he could not hear anything from persons in the theater. Initially, few in the audience considered Holmes to be a threat. Some witnesses thought he was wearing a costume, like other audience members who had dressed up for the screening. Some believed he was playing a prank, while others thought he was part of a special effects setup for the film's premiere, or a publicity stunt by the studio or theater management. Holmes reportedly threw two canisters emitting a gas or smoke, that partially obscured the audience members' vision, made their throats and skin itch, and caused eye irritation. He fired a 12-gauge Remington 870 Express Tactical shotgun, first at the ceiling and then at the audience. He also fired a Smith & Wesson M&P15; semi-automatic rifle with a 100-round drum magazine, which eventually malfunctioned. Finally, he fired a .40-caliber Glock 22 Gen4 handgun. He shot first to the back of the room, and then toward people in the aisles. A bullet passed through the wall and hit three people in adjacent theater 8, which was screening the same film. Witnesses said the multiplex's fire alarm system began sounding soon after the attack began, and staff told people in Theater 8 to evacuate. Holmes fired 76 shots in the theater: six from the shotgun, 65 from the semi-automatic rifle, and five from the .40-caliber handgun.Tenser, Phil. Aurora police testify in James Holmes' trial: 240 ballistic impacts found after theater shooting , KJRH, May 14, 2015. Police response The first phone calls to emergency services via 9-1-1 were made at 12:39 a.m. Police arrived within 90 seconds and found three .40-caliber handgun magazines, a shotgun, and a large drum magazine on the floor of the theater. Some people reported the shooting via Twitter or text messaging rather than calling the police; officers were already at the theater by the time that the tweets were sent. Ambulances were hindered by chaos and congestion in the parking lot, and they were unable to reach the back of the complex where police had pulled the injured out through the emergency exit doors of Theatre 9. Sgt. Stephen Redfearn, one of the first police officers to arrive on the scene, sent victims to area hospitals in squad cars. About 12:45 a.m., police officer Jason Oviatt apprehended Holmes behind the cinema, next to his car, without resistance. Because of his tactical clothing, Holmes was at first mistaken for another police officer. He was described as being calm and \\"disconnected\\" during his arrest. Two federal officials said that Holmes had dyed his hair red and called himself \\"The Joker\\", although authorities later declined to confirm this. Three days later, at his first court appearance in Centennial, Colorado, Holmes's hair appeared reddish-orange. The officers found several firearms in the theater and inside the shooter's car, including another Glock 22 handgun. Holmes was found carrying a first aid kit and spike strips, which he later admitted in an interview he had planned to use if police either shot at or chased him. Following his arrest, Holmes was initially jailed at the Arapahoe County Detention Center, under suicide watch. The police interviewed more than 200 witnesses of the shooting. Speaking on behalf of himself and FBI agent James Yacone, who was in charge of the investigation, Aurora Police Chief Dan Oates said he was confident that the shooter acted alone. Explosive devices A view of the multi-jurisdictional effort to clear the shooter's apartment of booby traps. The corner of his apartment building is visible between the white van and the fire truck. Note the white-painted bomb-disposal trailer. When apprehended, Holmes told the police that he had booby-trapped his apartment with explosive devices. Police evacuated five buildings surrounding his Aurora residence, which was about north of the cinema. Holmes' apartment complex is limited to University of Colorado Medical Center students, patients, and employees. One day after the shooting, officials disarmed an explosive device that was wired to the apartment's front door, allowing a remote-controlled robot to enter and disable other explosives. The apartment held more than 30 homemade grenades, wired to a control box in the kitchen and filled with at least of gasoline. Neighbors reported loud music from the apartment around midnight on the night of the massacre, and one went to his door to tell him she was calling the police; she said the door seemed to be unlocked, but she chose not to open it. A police official said a Batman mask was found in the apartment. On July 23, police finished collecting evidence from the apartment. Two days later, residents were allowed to return to the four surrounding buildings, and six days later, residents were allowed to move back into the formerly booby-trapped building. Casualties Eighty-two casualties were reported. 30 hospitalized in Colo. mass shooting, CBS News (July 21, 2012) Seventy were hit by bullets, and were reported by mainstream news as the most victims of any mass shooting in United States history. This figure would not be surpassed until the 2016 Orlando nightclub shooting, which killed 49 people and injured 58 others for a combined total of 107 casualties. Four people's eyes were irritated by the tear gas grenades, while eight others sustained non-gunshot injuries while fleeing the theater. The massacre was the deadliest shooting in Colorado since the Columbine High School massacre on April 20, 1999. =Fatalities= Ten victims died at the scene and two more were pronounced dead in local hospitals. Four men Jonathan Blunk, John Larimer, Matt McQuinn, and Alexander Teves died protecting their girlfriends. Gordon Cowden died saving the lives of his two teenage daughters. The people murdered were: * Jonathan Blunk, age 26 * Alexander J. Boik, 18 * Jesse Childress, 29 * Gordon Cowden, 51 * Jessica Ghawi (also known as Jessica Redfield), 24 * John Larimer, 27 * Matt McQuinn, 27 * Micayla Medek, 23 * Veronica Moser-Sullivan, 6 * Alex Sullivan, 27 * Alexander C. Teves, 24 * Rebecca Wingo, 31 =Injuries= The injured were treated at Children's Hospital Colorado, Denver Health Medical Center, The Medical Center of Aurora, Parker Adventist Hospital, Rose Medical Center, Swedish Hospital, and University Hospital. On July 25, three of the five hospitals treating victims announced they would limit medical bills or forgive them entirely. Ashley Moser, Veronica Moser- Sullivan's mother, suffered critical injuries after being shot in the chest. She was rendered a paraplegic. She miscarried a week after the attack. Caleb Medley, the last victim discharged, left University Hospital on September 12. He had serious brain damage and an injury to his right eye from a shotgun blast to the head, and underwent three brain surgeries. He required a feeding tube, had severely impaired movement, and could no longer speak. The Community First Foundation collected more than $5 million for a fund for victims and their families. In September, victims and their families received surveys asking about their preferences for how collected funds should be distributed, either by dividing it equally among victims or through a needs-assessment process. On November 16, 2012, the Aurora Victim Relief Fund announced that each family of the dead would receive $220,000.

According to press reports, he seemed dazed and largely unaware of his surroundings.\\"James Holmes appears 'dazed' in court\\", CBS News, July 23, 2012, Quote: \\"During his first court appearance on Monday, the 24-year-old frequently closed his eyes and appeared sleepy or dazed before the judge.\\" James Holmes Mugshot: Aurora Shooting Suspect's Booking Picture Released\\" (PHOTO), The Huffington Post, July 23, 2012. Retrieved January 15, 2013Alex Brandon (AP), \\"Again appearing dazed in court, Holmes charged Prosecutors and defense attorneys spar over whether a notebook that he reportedly sent to a psychiatrist is privileged information\\", Dubuque Telegraph Herald, July 31, 2012, Quote: \\"James Holmes appeared just as dazed as he did in his first court hearing after the deadly Colorado movie theater massacre.\\" On July 30, Colorado prosecutors filed formal charges against Holmes, including 24 counts of first-degree murder, 116 counts of attempted first-degree murder and one count of illegal possession of explosives. Two charges were filed for each victim to expand the opportunities for prosecutors to obtain convictions. Colorado State District Court Judge William B. Sylvester, who was the trial judge overseeing the case, placed a gag order on lawyers and law enforcement, sealing the court file and barring the University of Colorado from releasing public records relating to Holmes' year at the school. Media organizations challenged the sealing of the court file. On August 9, Holmes' attorneys said he is mentally ill and they needed more time to assess the nature of his illness. The disclosure was made at a court hearing in Centennial, Colorado, where news media organizations asked a judge to unseal court documents in the case. Prosecutors alleged on August 24, 2012, that Holmes told a classmate he wanted to kill people four months before the shooting. A judge ruled on August 30 that a notebook written by Holmes, in which he allegedly described a violent attack, was covered by physician‚Äìpatient privilege because it was addressed to his psychiatrist. This made it inadmissible as evidence unless Holmes' mental health became an issue in the case. Prosecutors dropped their request for access to the notebook on September 20, 2012. Due to suicide attempts made by Holmes, Judge Sylvester agreed to postpone proceedings until December 2012. On January 2, 2013, prosecutors and defense attorneys in the case returned to court in advance of the preliminary hearing, the public's first officially sanctioned look at the evidence, due to the gag order. It began on January 7. Prosecutors offered their case as to why the trial should proceed, and defense lawyers argued that it should not. At the conclusion, Judge Sylvester decided there was enough relevant, admissible evidence to proceed to a trial.\\"Colorado Theater Shooting Lawyers Head Back to Court\\", MSN, January 3, 2013 Also on January 7, lawyers for both sides argued whether to admit four unspecified prescription bottles and immunization records investigators had seized from Holmes' apartment when they searched it in July 2012, considering doctor-patient confidentiality laws. The judge ruled in October that prosecutors could keep the items. On March 27, Holmes' lawyers offered a guilty plea in exchange for prosecutors not seeking the death penalty. On April 1, the prosecution announced it had declined the offer. Arapahoe County district attorney George Brauchler said: \\"It's my determination and my intention that in this case for James Eagan Holmes justice is death.\\" Jury selection started on January 20, 2015. It ended on April 15, 2015. =Trial= The trial started on April 27, 2015. The jury consisted of nineteen women and five men, two of whom had connections to the Columbine High School massacre. Arapahoe County prosecutors said that Holmes was sane during the shooting and intended to kill all 400 people in the theater, while Holmes' lawyers said he had a psychotic episode during the attack.Coffman, Keith. Colorado movie gunman not faking psychosis, defense witness says, Yahoo News, June 2, 2015. On May 7, an FBI agent displayed pieces of evidence at the trial, including Holmes' body armor, an arsenal of weapons, unfired ammunition, and a helmet with strands of his dyed orange hair. Jurors examined the evidence for thirty minutes. Holmes was represented by the Colorado State Public Defender. On May 26, details of Holmes' notebook, reportedly found in a university mail room addressed to his psychiatrist Lynne Fenton, were entered into evidence at the trial for the first time. The notebook elaborated on Holmes' obsession to kill since ten years prior to the shooting, his dissatisfaction with life and finding work, as well as health issues. It also had details of his planning for the shooting, which prosecutors said indicated Holmes premeditated the attack. On May 27, Dr. William Reid, a court-appointed psychiatrist, testified that Holmes was mentally ill but legally sane. Reid and another doctor evaluated Holmes in December 2013 and determined that he understood what he was doing. On June 8, a second psychiatrist, Jeffrey Metzner, testified that Holmes was mentally ill but legally sane during the shooting, and suffers from schizoaffective disorder. On June 9, three jurors were dismissed from the trial due to concerns of their violating orders not to talk about news reports about the case. In the following week, two additional jurors were dismissed; the first due to emotional problems following the shooting of a family member, the second for recognizing a survivor who was wounded in the massacre. On July 9, Judge Carlos Samour asked Holmes if he would testify in court, and advised him of his rights to do so. Holmes chose not to testify. By July 10, the prosecution and the defense rested their cases. Closing statements were made on July 14, with formal deliberations beginning the following morning. =Verdict and sentencing= On July 16, after jury deliberations, Holmes was found guilty of twenty-four counts of first-degree murder, 140 counts of attempted first-degree murder, one count of possessing illegal explosives, and a sentence enhancement of a crime of violence. The two murder convictions for each death were first-degree murder or attempted murder after deliberation, and first-degree murder or attempted murder with extreme indifference. The sentencing phase began on July 22. On July 23, the jury ruled that Holmes acted in a cruel manner, was lying in wait, and ambushed his victims during the shooting, which constitute as aggravating factors. However, the jurors decided that Holmes did not intend to kill children when he opened fire. On July 27, Holmes' sister stated in her testimony that her brother became withdrawn from the family after they moved from Salinas to San Diego during his early teenage years. On July 28, Holmes' father pleaded for his son's life, stating that he is severely mentally ill. He displayed photos of camping trips and family vacations with Holmes to the jury. On July 30, Holmes' lawyers made a final appeal to the jurors, urging them to consider mental illness in his sentencing despite their rejection of the insanity defense used in the trial. The appeal for clemency was rejected on August 3 under the basis that mitigating factors such as mental illness did not outweigh aggravating factors such as the number of casualties in the massacre. Holmes was sentenced to life in prison without the possibility of parole on August 7 after jurors failed to reach a unanimous decision over sentencing him to death. Formal sentencing began on August 24 and was expected to last for three days. At the end of the hearing on August 26, Samour formally sentenced Holmes to twelve life imprisonment sentences without parole and a maximum of 3,318 additional years on attempted murder and explosives possession convictions. Reactions =Government= President Barack Obama visiting shooting victims at University of Colorado Hospital on July 22, 2012 The evening after the shooting, a candlelight vigil was held at the site in Aurora. President Barack Obama ordered flags at government buildings flown at half-staff, in tribute to the victims, until July 25. Both Obama's and Mitt Romney's campaigns temporarily suspended television advertising in Colorado for the 2012 presidential election. On July 22, President Obama met with victims and local and state officials and gave a nationally televised speech from Aurora. Many world leaders sent their condolences, including Queen Elizabeth II, French President Fran√ßois Hollande, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, Russian President Vladimir Putin, and Pope Benedict XVI. Memorial across the street from the Aurora Century movie theater, in September 2012 =Entertainment industry= Warner Bros., the distributor of The Dark Knight Rises, said it was deeply saddened by the shooting. The studio canceled the film's gala premieres in France, Mexico, and Japan, scaled down its marketing campaign in Finland, and decided not to report box office figures for the movie until July 23. Some television advertisements for the film were also canceled. Other major film studios joined Warner Bros. in withholding early box office numbers on July 21. Warner Bros. reportedly made a \\"substantial\\" donation to Colorado's Community First Foundation to benefit victims. Christopher Nolan, the film's director, spoke on behalf of his cast and crew and called the event \\"savage\\" and \\"devastating\\". Christian Bale, who plays Batman in the film series, privately visited victims on July 24. Members of the Colorado Rockies baseball team also visited victims. Members of the Denver Broncos also called or visited individuals at the hospitals. Warner Bros. instructed cinemas to stop screening a trailer for the film Gangster Squad, which preceded The Dark Knight Rises screenings in some cities (though not in Aurora), because it contained a scene involving the main characters shooting at a movie theater audience with machine guns. The film's release date was rescheduled to January 2013, and the theater scene was replaced by a new sequence in a different setting. In the wake of the shooting, DC Comics delayed the release of Batman Incorporated #3, which includes a scene in which a female Leviathan agent brandishes a handgun in a classroom full of children while disguised as a schoolteacher. Warner Bros. Animation reportedly edited the Cartoon Network series Beware the Batman to make the firearms look less realistic. Hans Zimmer, who composed the soundtrack for The Dark Knight Rises, recorded a choral song entitled \\"Aurora\\" in honor of the victims. The song was sold for donations that went to a fund for the victims. Cinemark agreed to pay any funeral expenses incurred by the deceased victims' families not covered by the Crime Victims' Compensation Fund. Cinemark closed the entire Century Aurora 16 multiplex in the wake of the shooting but reopened January 17, 2013, with a 40-minute ceremony led by Aurora Mayor Steve Hogan. As of 2020, Cinemark Theatres has not released any photographs or video evidence. Soon after the shooting, police departments and cinemas across the United States and around the world increased security for fear of copycat incidents. In New York City, police officers were deployed to theaters screening the new film. The National Association of Theatre Owners distributed checklists from the U.S. Department of Homeland Security to its members and said in a July 21 statement that members were \\"working closely with local law enforcement agencies and reviewing security procedures\\". AMC Theatres announced it would \\"not allow any guests into our theatres in costumes that make other guests feel uncomfortable and we will not permit face-covering masks or fake weapons inside our buildings\\". Security Director News raised the possibility in a July 23 article that \\"the massacre could be a Virginia Tech for movie theaters, causing security to become a bigger part of the conversation and more stringent security procedures to be adopted at theaters across the country.\\" Several theaters subsequently held tighter security on allowing unaccompanied singles to see films. =Civil litigation= Cinemark Theaters Three victims sued Cinemark Theatres in the U.S. District Court for the District of Colorado on September 21, 2012, for the company's alleged negligence in failing to provide adequate safety and security measures. Their attorneys released the statement \\"Readily available security procedures, security equipment and security personnel would likely have prevented or deterred the gunman from accomplishing his planned assault on the theater's patrons.\\" In response, Cinemark's representation filed a motion to dismiss on September 27, 2012, on the grounds that there was no liability under Colorado law for failure to prevent an unforeseeable criminal act.Motion to Dismiss, Nowlan v. Cinemark USA, Inc. et al., Civil Action No. 1:12-cv-02517-RBJ-MEH, U.S. Dist. Ct., D. Colo., September 27, 2012, Deadline.com, last visited October 11, 2012. Cinemark's motion quoted extensively from the landmark California appellate opinionLopez v. McDonald's Corp., 193 Cal. App. 3d 495 (1987). that held McDonald's had no duty of care to prevent the 1984 San Ysidro McDonald's massacre. On October 30, 2012, the court hearing the criminal case against Holmes denied a motion by some of the survivors that would have let them access sealed evidence for review in their civil action against the theater chain. On January 24, 2013, U.S. Magistrate Judge Michael Hegarty issued a recommendation that most of the claims be thrown out, as they were not allowable under Colorado law. He also said claims alleging violations of the Colorado Premises Liability Act could proceed.John Ingold, \\"Judge says wrongful death claims in theater shootings should be tossed,\\" The Denver Post, January 25, 2013. Judge R. Brooke Jackson stated that for theaters today, \\"One might reasonably believe that a mass shooting incident in a theater was likely enough (that is, not just a possibility) to be a foreseeable next step in the history of such acts by deranged individuals\\". Attorney Christina Habas, who represents several theater victims, has said: \\"We essentially don't have a single photograph, a single piece of evidence that we can show to a jury\\". In June 2016, a federal judge dismissed the last claims in the lawsuit. In a separate lawsuit in state court, Cinemark was sued by families of the victims, who alleged the theater should have taken greater measures to prevent such a shooting. In May 2016, after years of legal debate, a jury took three hours to deliver a unanimous verdict that the theater chain was not liable to any degree for the tragedy that transpired. The judge allowed Cinemark Theatres to submit a bill of costs to the plaintiffs to recover expenses due to the litigation, as Colorado state law allows for prevailing parties. In September 2016, Cinemark dropped all claims for reimbursement of legal fees. University of Colorado On January 14, 2013, Chantel Blunk, widow of victim Jonathan Blunk, filed a lawsuit against the University of Colorado in federal court. She alleged that a school psychiatrist could have prevented the slaughter by having Holmes detained after he admitted he \\"fantasized about killing a lot of people\\". This type of lawsuit had been anticipated in an August 2012 article co-authored by bioethicist Arthur Caplan which discussed the applicability of the landmark California Supreme Court decision in Tarasoff v. Regents of the University of California (1976) to the facts of the Aurora shooting. =Community center= A grassroots community center, Aurora Strong Resilence Center, was established by community leaders, elected officials, and mental health professionals, as a response to the shooting. The center offers therapy for people who experienced traumatic stress from the theater shooting, and also people who were victims of other crimes and refugees who experienced a traumatic event in their country of origin before coming to the U.S. Aftermath =Related incidents= In the days following the attack, several people around the U.S. and the world were arrested for threats and suspicious activities at or near screenings of The Dark Knight Rises. * On July 22 in Norwalk, California, a man at a The Dark Knight Rises screening at the AMC Norwalk 20 Theater who yelled, \\"Does anyone have a gun?\\" and \\"I should go off like in Colorado.\\" was arrested for making criminal threats. He served three months in jail and was sentenced to three years on probation.Man sentenced for making threats during 'Dark Knight' screening at Norwalk theater, Cerritos-Artesia Patch.com, September 13, 2012. Retrieved April 23, 2015. * On July 22 in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, a man faced criminal charges for being involved in a fight in a cinema restroom. During the fight, a moviegoer shouted \\"Gun!\\", causing panic inside the theater showing The Dark Knight Rises at the AMC Waterfront 22. * On July 23 in San Jose, California, someone threw a package into a theater showing The Dark Knight Rises and reportedly yelled that it was a bomb, leading to an evacuation at the AMC Eastridge 15. * On July 23 in Sierra Vista, Arizona, a moviegoer's confrontation with an intoxicated man with a backpack at a The Dark Knight Rises screening at the Cinemark 10 theater led to \\"mass hysteria\\" and 50 people evacuating the theater. * On August 4 in Westlake, Ohio, a man was arrested for carrying several weapons in a satchel into a screening of The Dark Knight Rises at the Regal Crocker Park & IMAX theater. The suspect later received six months imprisonment over the incident. =Sale of guns and gun control debate= Colorado gun sales spiked after the shooting, with the number of background checks for people seeking to purchase a firearm in the state increasing to 2,887, up 43% from the previous week. Gun sales in Washington, Florida, California, and Georgia also increased. The shooting reignited the political debate on gun control, with one issue being the \\"easy access\\" Holmes had to semi-automatic rifles and high-capacity magazines, which were banned federally from 1994 to 2004. The results of a survey released on July 30, 2012, by the Pew Research Center suggested the incident did not change Americans' views on the issue. =Campaign against media coverage= In 2015, a campaign titled \\"No Notoriety\\" was started by the parents of Alexander Teves, who died in the shooting. According to Teves' father, the campaign's incentive is to encourage media outlets to limit the usage of the suspect's name and photos when reporting about the Aurora shooting, as well as other mass shootings that receive national media coverage. In an interview on CNN, Teves' parents said they and the relatives of other victims believe the mass media coverage of Holmes' name and photo may inspire others to commit mass shootings for notoriety. =Memorial= A memorial to the victims of the attack was installed near Aurora Municipal Center, some from the theater, and dedicated on July 19, 2018, one day before the sixth anniversary of the attack. It consists of a park-like dell with 83 abstract birds, one for each victim. Thirteen of the birds, with translucent wings, are on a center column and represent the twelve dead and the unborn child. The memorial, titled \\"Ascentiate,\\" was designed by artist Douwe Blumberg.

Scientific research has established that the mind and consciousness are closely connected with the physiological functioning of the brain, the cessation of which defines brain death. However, many believe in some form of life after death, which is a feature of many religions. Neuroscience Neuroscience is a large interdisciplinary field founded on the premise that all of behavior and all of the cognitive processes that constitute the mind have their origin in the structure and function of the nervous system, especially in the brain. According to this view, the mind can be regarded as a set of operations carried out by the brain.Kandel, ER; Schwartz JH; Jessell TM; Siegelbaum SA; Hudspeth AJ. \\"Principles of Neural Science, Fifth Edition\\" (2012).Squire, L. et al. \\"Fundamental Neuroscience, 4th edition\\" (2012).O. Carter Snead. \\"Neuroimaging and the \\"Complexity\\" of Capital Punishment\\" (2007).Eric R. Kandel, M.D. \\"A New Intellectual Framework for Psychiatry\\" (1998). There are multiple lines of evidence that support this view. They are here briefly summarized along with some examples. * Neuroanatomical correlates: In the field of neuroimaging, neuroscientists can use various functional neuroimaging methods to measure an aspect of brain function that correlates with a particular mental state or process. * Experimental manipulations: Neuroimaging correlational studies cannot determine whether neural activity plays a causal role in the occurrence of mental processes (correlation does not imply causation) and they cannot determine if the neural activity is either necessary or sufficient for such processes to occur. Identification of causation and necessary and sufficient conditions requires explicit experimental manipulation of that activity. If manipulation of brain activity changes consciousness, then a causal role for that brain activity can be inferred.Max Velmans, Susan Schneider. \\"The Blackwell Companion to Consciousness\\" (2008). p. 560. Two of the most common types of manipulation experiments are loss-of-function and gain-of-function experiments. In a loss- of-function (also called \\"necessity\\") experiment, a part of the nervous system is diminished or removed in an attempt to determine if it is necessary for a certain process to occur, and in a gain-of-function (also called \\"sufficiency\\") experiment, an aspect of the nervous system is increased relative to normal.Matt Carter, Jennifer C. Shieh. \\"Guide to Research Techniques in Neuroscience\\" (2009). Manipulations of brain activity can be performed in several ways: ::Pharmacological manipulation using various drugs which alter neural activity by interfering with neurotransmission, resulting in alterations in perception, mood, consciousness, cognition, and behavior. Psychoactive drugs are divided into different groups according to their pharmacological effects; euphoriants which tend to induce feelings of euphoria, stimulants that induce temporary improvements in either mental or physical functions, depressants that depress or reduce arousal or stimulation and hallucinogens which can cause hallucinations, perception anomalies, and other substantial subjective changes in thoughts, emotion, and consciousness. ::Electrical and magnetical stimulations using various electrical methods and techniques like transcranial magnetic stimulation. In a comprehensive review of electrical brain stimulation (EBS) results obtained from the last 100 years neuroscientist Aslihan Selimbeyoglu and neurologist Josef Parvizi compiled a list of many different subjective experiential phenomena and behavioral changes that can be caused by electrical stimulation of the cerebral cortex or subcortical nuclei in awake and conscious human subjects.Aslihan Selimbeyoglu, Josef Parvizi. \\"Electrical stimulation of the human brain: perceptual and behavioral phenomena reported in the old and new literature\\" (2010). Frontiers in Human Neuroscience. ::Optogenetic manipulation where light is used to control neurons which have been genetically sensitised to light. * Symptoms of brain damage: Examining case studies (like the case of Phineas Gage) and lesion studies are the only sources of knowledge regarding what happens to the mind when the brain is damaged. Various symptoms have been documented.\\"Severe TBI Symptoms\\"\\"Symptoms of Brain Injury\\" * Mental development/brain development correlation: The brain grows and develops in an intricately orchestrated sequence of stages, and this development is correlated with the development of various mental capabilities.\\"Cognitive Development and Aging: A Life Span Perspective\\"\\"Adolescent Brains Are A Work In Progress\\"\\"Blossoming brains\\" Impairments in the growth and development of the brain also result in various neurodevelopmental disorders. Death Death is the permanent cessation of all biological functions that sustain a living organism. Death was once defined as the cessation of heartbeat (cardiac arrest) and of breathing, but the development of CPR and prompt defibrillation have rendered that definition inadequate because breathing and heartbeat can sometimes be restarted. Events that were causally linked to death in the past no longer kill in all circumstances; without a functioning heart or lungs, life can sometimes be sustained with a combination of life support devices, organ transplants and artificial pacemakers. Today, where a definition of the moment of death is required, doctors and coroners usually turn to \\"brain death\\" or \\"biological death\\" to define a person as being dead; brain death being defined as the complete and irreversible loss of brain function (including involuntary activity necessary to sustain life). Near-death experience (NDE) A near- death experience (NDE) is a personal experience associated with impending death, encompassing multiple possible sensations. Research from neuroscience considers the NDE to be a hallucinatory state caused by various neurological factors such as cerebral anoxia, hypercarbia, abnormal activity in the temporal lobes and brain damage.Olaf Blanke, Sebastian Dieguez. \\"Leaving Body and Life Behind: Out-of-Body and Near-Death Experience\\" (2009).Elizabeth K√ºbler Ross, Questions and Answers on Death and Dying: A Memoir of Living and Dying, Macmillan, 1976. .

Now a country park, it was the most important of three hillforts in the downs. Geography Of the three hillforts Cherry Hinton being one of them, Wandlebury was the most important. The site altitude is above sea level. There are at least two theories regarding why the Wandlebury Hill Fort was built on this site: it may have been chosen because of its tactical grounds, or because it would be the last fortress in a line which controlled the Thames-Stort-Cam Valley route. Wandlebury overlooked the ancient Icknield Way. The meeting point of the hundreds of Thriplow, Chilford, and Flendish is adjacent to Wandlebury. History The first hillfort was constructed in about 400 BC, consisting of \\"a substantial outer ditch and an inner rampart bank of chalk rubble and soil, enclosing a circular area of about 6 ha.\\" A second ditch and bank circuit was added on the inner side of the first rampart in the 1st century BC, and a low counterscarp bank added around the perimeter. The inner ring had a wooden palisading to deter invaders. Wandlebury was a border settlement. There is evidence that it was occupied by the Romans. The Romans built a road from Worts Causeway to Wandlebury. Two pottery sequence have been found establishing two separate construction phases. It may have been inhabited into the 1st century AD. It was later named Wendlesbiri (meaning, \\"Waendal's fort\\") by the Anglo Saxons and used as a Hundred council rendezvous point. Sir Thomas Malory mentions a Wandesborow Castle in Le Morte d'Arthur (1470), possibly referring to the Wandlebury Ring. The site has undergone considerable change since the 17th century. When a house, garden and racing stable was built for King James II within the boundaries of the old fort in 1685, the inner rampart and ditch were levelled. The mansion was later owned by Lord Godolphin and demolished in 1956, but the stable remains. The site is now a country park. Legend and literature Wandlebury Ring garden The fort and surrounding hills are shrouded in legends. Gervase of Tilbury said in his Otia Imperialia of 1214: A knight named Osbert once tested the story and legend has it that he appeared in full armour and defeated the knight who appeared to him but was wounded in the thigh by his opponents' javelin on departing.

Biography  There is not extensive information on the life of Budic I of Brittany, but sources are able to confirm a few details of his life. It is possible that in the early portion of his reign, he ruled together with his brother Maxent of Brittany. After the murder of Constantine, Budic I's uncle and a majority of his family, Constantine's two sons found sanctuary at Budic's court. This attack was allegedly perpetrated by Vortigern, governor of the city of Dubris, one of the most important ports in the kingdom. Vortigern had formed a pact with the powerful Jute kings, Hengist and Horsa.Whilst some authors categorize them as Saxons, they were originally from Jutland. They led a combined force of Saxons, Jutes and Britons and established themselves in Kent as a Jute faction. (, , , Kings and Kingdoms of Early Anglo-Saxon England de Barbara Yorke, History of England, de Charles W. Oman, The origin of the English, Germanic, and Scandinavian languages, and nations, Longman, etc.). The two youths, Ambrosius Aurelianus and Uthyr Pendragon, were both heirs to the throne of Sub-Roman Britain. It is likely that the contemporary usurper to the throne, Vortigern wished them dead so self-imposed exile for their own safety would be the likely explanation for this move. Upon reaching maturity, the two would travel again to Britain where they would seek to regain their titles to the throne. Budic I was succeeded as King of Brittany by his son, Meliau of Brittany.  Marriage and descendants  Budic married a woman named Anaumide and the couple had the following children: * Meliau of Brittany (b. c. 470 - d. ?)‚Äì who would go on to become the next king, inheriting his father's land and titles * Riwal of Brittany ‚Äì who would become king after the death of Meliau.

The church ruins are located by the E18 which passes through Bamble. The ruins are situated northeast of the newer Bamble Church (Bamble kirke) which was completed during 1845. Bamble Church was constructed in part with stone from the ruins. History St. Olav's Church was built of stone before 1150 in Romanesque-Norman style inspired by English Norman architecture. It was dedicated to St. Olaf, patron saint of Norway and served as a center for the veneration of St. Olaf by the nearby Gims√∏y Abbey. The church was probably about four feet longer than the ruins suggests. In that case, it would have been the largest stone church in Telemark during that period. It had a number of unusual building features, including a chancel screen (lektorium). After Protestant Reformation, the church was re-named Skeidi Church (Skeidis kirkja i Bamblum). Until 1738, Skeidi parish comprised Sannidal, Sk√•t√∏y, Krager√∏ and Bamble.

It is now under the jurisdiction of the Mizoram University and under recognition of the University Grants Commission (India). Under governmental organisation of Mizoram, it operates as a branch of the Mizoram College Teachers' Association. History  The demand for an institute of higher education in Chhimtuipui district (from which Saiha district would later split up) emerged in 1974. In June 1974, a demand committee was organised under the chair of K. Paichho, the then Executive Member of Mara Autonomous District Council. However, financial constraint prevented immediate action. By public pressure, Saiha College was inaugurated on 20 July 1978 with only a pre-university course. The Government of Mizoram sanctioned permission/recognition the next year, on 2 November 1979. It received affiliation from North Eastern Hill University, Shillong, in 1980. Bachelor's degree course was started in 1980, and was recognised by the university in 1984. Science subject was introduced in 1988. Honours degree subjects were initiated in 1986 in political science and history.

Disclosed in a heavily redacted review of the FBI's role in the prevention of the 2009 Fort Hood shooting, its full capabilities are classified but at a minimum, provides a searchable archive of intercepted electronic communications, including email sent over the Internet. Another report suggests that online chat transcripts, email attachments, and audio of unspecified origin are stored. By the third quarter of 2006 it was involved in 130 successful investigations and 370 active cases. In June 2007 a total of 70 million intercepts from 16,500 online accounts were present on the system, and were expected to increase to 350 million intercepts from over 50,000 accounts by June 2009.  History  The DWS was designed by STAS in 2001 to record a certain class of data intercepts. In the following years it became a de facto depository of a wider category of intercepts, surpassing its original intent and straining its hardware limits. The DWS was involved in the interception of 18 email messages between Nidal Malik Hasan and Anwar al-Awlaki from December 2008 to June 2009, although the messages were largely benign and provided no actionable evidence. It was upgraded in February 2009, improving the user interface and tools, and merged with a related system, EDMS. The user interface was again improved in May 2009.  Capabilities  The interface of DWS-EDMS is described as relatively crude. Intercepts are stored in text format. The primary user interface is similar to Outlook Express. Users can add notes, translations, and tags to intercepts. While it provides search capabilities, it does so poorly, failing to return many relevant results. Although it is one of the FBI's primary investigative tools, it does not have a backup scheme in place. A failure scenario such as data corruption would be considered catastrophic. As of 2011, it was considered to be overburdened and incapable of sustaining its present role. The underlying infrastructure of DWS-EDMS uses widely available commercial and open source technologies, including Java, Red Hat Linux, Oracle SQL, XML, Microsoft IIS, and Apache HTTP Server.

Planned by the Steel Company of Wales in 1947, today it is part of Tata Steel Europe's infrastructure. Background The name of the area derives from the Pemberton family, landowners and industrialists from the North of England, who played a role in the development of Llanelli (especially the local coal industry) in the early 19th century.Pemberton Family History On formation in 1947, the nationalised Steel Company of Wales was under UK Government pressure to both increase production and profits, and rationalise its production base. As part of its strategic plan, the company envisaged creating two new tinplate works, one at Trostre and one at Felindre, Swansea. With in excess of 12,000 men unemployed in post-World War II Llanelli, the decision was made to focus on construction of the Trostre plant to make best use of the areas developed skills in tinplate manufacture. Chosen due to its close location to railway access via Llandeilo Junction on the West Wales Line/Heart of Wales Line, after buying up three farms, the new plant was planned with an output of 400,000 tons per annum. Construction was started in August 1947, but due to the marshland-geology of the site, main ground works contractor Robert M Douglas was forced to devise a new type of formwork for its construction. Timber was the traditional material for such purposes, but immediately post- war could only be obtained on permit from the Ministry of Supply. The quantity allocated by the ministry was inadequate to maintain the required progress of the work, so alternative means of providing the necessary formwork were investigated. Limited quantities of cold steel plate were available, and the timber obtained by permit was to a considerable extent used as framing to which the steel plate was fixed. The available quantities were soon absorbed and the supply was augmented by the purchase of now redundant Anderson-type air raid shelters, which were rolled flat and pressed into panels of uniform size. This was the first steel panel formwork system ever deployed in the world. Production started in 1951, which was also the year in which the delayed Felindre plant was given approval for construction. Output reached the planned 400,000 tons in 1956. =British Steel= In 1967, the Steel Company of Wales was nationalised with others to form British Steel Corporation. Choosing to close the tinplate works at Port Talbot Steelworks, they invested in all three remaining tinplate works within the newly formed South Wales group: Trostre, Felindre and Ebbw Vale. With four electrolytic continuous tinning lines installed at each plant, they were capable of combining to produce 2 million tons of tinplate per annum. While Felindre had always out produced Trostre on quality and volume since the start of its production in 1956 (peak production, 450,000 tons per annum), after a review of its tinplate sites in South Wales, British Steel decided in December 1980 to close Felindre. 1,300 people were made redundant in March 1981, though 138 were found jobs at Trostre. Production finally ceased in 1989, when another 108 were given jobs at Trostre.The Welsh Academy Encyclopedia of Wales. Cardiff: University of Wales Press 2008 =Corus= On 6 October 1999, a merger was announced between the Koninklijke Hoogovens steel company of the Netherlands and British Steel to form new company Corus. Although investment had continued at the Ebbw Vale site over the past two decades, No.2 ETL had been shut down in 1995, and rather than be redeveloped as planned had become a source of spares for the No.1 ETL. Steel production capacity was in excess of the required market in Europe, hence the need for the merger, which would result in the closure of capacity across the newly integrated company. With much tinplate consumption moving to the newly expanding Asian market, it came as little surprise when on 1 February 2001 that Corus announced the focus of tinplate production at Trostre, and the resultant complete closure of the Ebbw Vale site with the loss of 780 jobs. The Ebbw Vale plant began a shut-down procedure, with many of the lines within the plant packaged up and transported to other Corus sites, including Trostre and IJmuiden, the Netherlands, while other plants were sold as a package to an Indian-based company. In July 2002, the Ebbw Vale steelworks site officially closed, although a skeleton staff deconstructed the remaining sold plants and handled shipping of residual finished product until December 2002. Present Presently the plant employs around 700 people, and manufactures tinplated steel, electro chromium coated steel and laminated steel (under the Protact brand) for packaging applications such a food and drinks cans, aerosols and paint tins. The plant takes in hot rolled steel from Port Talbot and IJmuiden, and some cold rolled steel from Llanwern. Most raw materials and output product is transported by DB Cargo UK via the Margam Knuckle Yard. The plant's customers include Heinz, Ball Packaging Europe and Crown Holdings. Tata Steel Packaging Recycling (TSPR) is based at the site, responsible for managing the largest steel recycler in the UK. The works was one of the first large manufacturing sites in the UK to attain ISO 14001 accreditation, the European Standard for Environmental Management.

The hospital is widely known among Mizo people as \\"Durtlang Hospital\\". It is managed and governed by the Mizoram Presbyterian Church Synod. The hospital was established in 1928 by the Calvinistic Methodist Church (now the Presbyterian Church of Wales) as a nursing institute. It is the second hospital (after Christian Hospital Serkawn) established, and the largest non-governmental hospital in Mizoram. It has a registered capacity of 355 beds. History In 1923, Suaka, Chief of Durtlang, leased the hill top of Durtlang known as Derhken Tlang (derhken for marigold, tlang, hill) for theological school of the Welsh Christian Mission. A small building was constructed and run by Fred J. Sandy, a Welsh missionary. With the establishment of formal education in the main Aizawl area, the theological school was also sifted to Mission Veng, Aizawl in 1926. (By then Sandy had died of influenza.) The property was abandoned. Dr. John Williams, L.M.P., a Welsh missionary from Cwm-y-Glo, Arfon, arrived on 22 February 1928 to become the second medical doctor after Dr. Peter Fraser who arrived on 9 December 1908 but left after 4 years stay. He wisely chose Durtlang for his mission field. With the help of only two supporting staff D. Thianga, a compounder (pharmacist), and Tlawmkungi, a midwife, he converted the old theological school building into a hospital. Williams noted later: With the admission of the first patient on 6 March 1928 the hospital was formally inaugurated and was named as the \\"Welsh Mission Hospital\\". A 16-year-old girl Khuangi became the first nursing student later that year. The Welsh mission sent Winifred Margaret from Maesglas Farm, near Tregaron, to become the first trained nurse, and arrived on 7 January 1927. On 1 February 1924 the Welsh Mission Hospital recruited its first Mizo doctor H.K. Thanglura. In July of the same year Dr R.K. Nghakliana, who had just completed MBBS, joined him. The nursing course was approved by the Indian Nursing Council in the year 1944, becoming the first recognised nursing school in northeast India. The political climate in the country began to forebode uncertainty for the missionaries. With the independence of India, Welsh mission works came to a halt. The Welsh mission handed over the ownership and management of the entire to the Mizoram Presbyterian Church Synod on 28 February 1958, and the name officially became \\"Presbyterian Hospital\\". It is situated at the highest point in aizawl with an elevation of 1384 metres. Facility The hospital is now equipped with well furnished major operation theatre, gynaecological O.T., and eye O.T., medical, surgical, pediatrics, orthopedics, eye, ENT and obstetrics and gynaecology wards and two complexes of private wards with deluxe rooms in the new cabin complex. The hospital also has acquired modern equipment‚Äôs like X-ray machine, USG machine, ECG machine, CT Scan, fetal monitor and endoscopy equipments. Departments such as medicine, surgery, gynaecology, pediatrics, ENT, eye and orthopedics have specialist doctors. =Extension= Grace Home, Durtlang Hospital The hospital has extension centres in the proper Aizawl city such as Dr. Fraser‚Äôs Clinic for out-door patients, Grace Inn which is a drop-in centre for persons with substances abuse problems, and out-door patient clinic at Millennium Centre.

According to a study carried out in 2009 by Human Rights Watch, it is estimated that between 10 and 20 percent of women in Pakistan have suffered some form of abuse.Cited in: An estimated 5000 women are killed per year from domestic violence, with thousands of others maimed or disabled. Women have reported attacks ranging from physical to psychological and sexual abuse from intimate partners. In 1998, of the 1974 reported murders, the majority of victims were killed by family members. A survey carried out by the Thomson Reuters Foundation ranked Pakistan as the third most dangerous country in the world for women, after Afghanistan and the Democratic Republic of Congo. The majority of victims of violence have no legal recourse. Law enforcement authorities do not view domestic violence as a crime and usually refuse to register any cases brought to them. Given the very few women's shelters in the country, victims have limited ability to escape from violent situations.  Overview  = Definition = As defined by the World Health Organization, domestic violence encompasses physical and psychological distress including sexual coercive acts towards primarily women by a current or former male intimate partner.WHO (2005).WHO Multi-Country Study on Women‚Äôs Health and Domestic Violence against Women. Geneva: World Health Organization The landmark Domestic Violence (Prevention and Protection) Act passed in 2012 by the Pakistani Senate defines domestic violence as including, ‚Äúall acts of gender based and other physical or psychological abuse committed by a respondent against women, children or other vulnerable persons‚Ä¶‚Äù The definition then further specifies assault, attempt at assault, criminal force, criminal intimidation, emotional, psychological, and verbal abuse, harassment, stalking, sexual abuse, physical abuse, and economic abuse as some of the actions that fall under domestic violence. = Statistics = An estimated 5000 women are killed per year from domestic violence, with thousands of others maimed or disabled. Lisa Hajjar, an associate professor at the University of California, describes abuse against women in Pakistan as \\"endemic in all social spheres\\". In an observational study published in the Pakistan Journal of Medical Sciences based on a convenience sample of 218 women in the gynecology wards of three hospitals, 97% of the interviewed women said they had been victims of some form of assault, ranging from verbal abuse or threatened, to being subjected to beatings or non-consensual sex. Cited in: A study by the United Nations found that 50% of married women have experienced sexual violence and 90% have been psychologically abused. Studies by the Pakistan Nation Women's Division and Zakar et al. confirmed these statistics of high percentages of domestic violence in Pakistani households. Research has also shown high rates of domestic violence primarily in rural communities and Afghani refugees living in Pakistan. A cross-sectional survey of 490 randomly selected women from a rural health center in Pakistan of reproductive age reported that 65% of those interviewed had experienced domestic violence. A special report by the United Nations of the state of violence against women in Pakistan reported that Afghani refugees are left out of Pakistani services and of Pakistani statistics. The report noted that violence against women like child abuse and domestic violence is considerably high, however, proper statistics on this population are difficult to obtain. Types of abuse = Physical violence =  Abduction, rape, forced conversion and marriage of women from minority communities  Women from the minority communities in Pakistan are abducted, forced to convert to Islam and married off to Muslim men against their will and get repeatedly raped by them.  Dowry deaths  Dowry deaths have been described by the United Nations as a form of domestic violence in Pakistan. Women are often attacked and murdered if their in-laws deem their dowry to have been insufficient. Amongst dowry-related violence, bride burnings, also known as \\"stove deaths\\", are widely reported. In 1988 a survey showed that 800 women were killed in this manner, in 1989 the number rose to 1,100, and in 1990 it stood at 1,800 estimated killings. According to the Progressive Women's Association, such attacks are a growing problem and, in 1994 on International Women's Day, announced that various NGOs would join to raise awareness of the issue. Newspapers in Lahore in a six- month period (1997) reported on average 15 attacks a month. Women's eNews reported that 4,000 women had been attacked in this manner in Islamabad's surroundings over an eight-year period, and that the average age range of victims was between 18 and 35, with an estimated 30 percent being pregnant at the time of death. The Human Rights Commission of Pakistan reported that about four women are killed in this manner every day, by either family members or husbands. Shahnaz Bukhari, who runs the Progressive Women's Association in Islamabad, has said of such attacks: \\"Either Pakistan is home to possessed stoves which burn only young housewives, and are particularly fond of genitalia, or looking at the frequency with which these incidences occur there is a grim pattern that these women are victims of deliberate murder.\\"  Acid attacks  Acid attacks in Pakistan came to international attention after the release of a documentary by Sharmeen Obaid-Chinoy called Saving Face (2012). According to Shahnaz Bukhari, the majority of these attacks occur in the summer when acid is used extensively to soak certain seeds to induce germination. Various reasons have been given for such attacks, such as a woman dressing inappropriately or rejecting a proposal of marriage. The first known instance of an acid attack occurred in East Pakistan in 1967. According to the Acid Survivors Foundation, up to 150 attacks occur every year. The foundation reports that the attacks are often the result in an escalation of domestic abuse, and the majority of victims are female.  Honour killing  A recent report noted that one in five homicides in Pakistan are attributed to honour killings. The prevalence of such honour killings that have been reported are around 2,000 killings every four years. Overall, out of all homicides of both men and women in Pakistan, honour killings of women constitute 21%. Moreover, the perpetrator in most honour killings is the husband. One study found as high as 92% of all honour killings are committed by the spouse. The highest occurring reason in spousal honour killings was alleged extramarital affairs. Much of the data has been collected by the Human Rights Commission of Pakistan through newspaper reports, however, it is clear there needs to be more systematic research by a health agency is needed to assess this public health crisis and effectively plan for solutions as many cases go unreported. Another analysis of this research states that a possible explanation of the high rate of honour killings towards married women could be attributed to the generally high statistics of domestic violence in Pakistan. = Psychological abuse = Psychological abuse generally includes yelling, insulting, controlling behaviors, and threatening. In a study by Zakar et al., of 373 randomly selected married women of reproductive age interviewed in Pakistani hospitals, 60.8% reported as current victims of severe psychological violence with 15% having been victims in the past. The percentage of women going through current psychological violence far surpassed the percentages of women going through current sexual (27.3%) and physical (21.7%) violence. Moreover, more than half of these participants, 54%, reported being currently in a poor state of mental health. Factors A young girl in a rural area of the Sindh province of Pakistan is selling these baskets her family has made for a living. = Poverty = Associated with poverty is illiteracy and social stigma against domestic violence. Lack of an education due to financial reasons accompanies a lack of awareness about women‚Äôs rights. Moreover, because mental health illiteracy is especially widespread in low-income areas, many women to not get appropriate treatment for the after effects of domestic violence. = Patriarchalism = Another reason given for abuses is patriarchalism in Pakistani society, which marginalizes women‚Äôs role. In some traditional societies, a man is considered to have the right to physically beat his spouse on his wish. According to Rahel Nardos, it is \\"the dual constructs of women as the property of men and as the standard-bearers of a family's honour set the stage for culturally sanctioned forms of violence\\". In some cases, women perpetuate patriarchalism and domestic abuse especially in regard to mothers-in-law. Many women are expected to be homemakers and to perform key household duties, however, if a woman is not performing her duties by her mother-in-law's standards, the mother-in-law may seek to punish the woman through her son. In analysis of data from 3,867 married or previously married women from the 2012 - 2013 Pakistan Demographic and Health Survey, association was found between the intergenerational transfer of spousal violence and cultural views of women. Strikingly, 47% of these women agreed that beating of a spouse was justified if the wife had argued with her husband. Statistics such as this prove that patriarchalism within the Pakistani society has led many Pakistani women to believe that domestic violence is normal or even at times justified. This idea is enforced by a study done of 759 Pakistani women between the ages of 25 and 60 years old in which 27% admitted they had never told anyone of the spousal violence they had endured or were currently enduring. = Child marriage = Women and girls in Qamber, Shadadkot, north-west Sindh, Pakistan (8406155976)Defined as marriage before the age of 18 years, child marriage is widespread in Pakistan and linked to spousal violence. Child marriage occurs most often in rural and low- income households where education is minimal. The Pakistan Demographic and Health Survey conducted from 2012 to 2013 reported that 47.5% of currently married women aged 15 to 24 had been married before the age of 18. Moreover, of those child marriages, one-third of those women reported spousal violence. = Marriages within the extended family = Consanguineous marriages, or those within blood relations such as first and second cousins, are considered marriages in biraderi, or brotherhood, within many Pakistani subcultures. Based on reported research, about two-thirds of all Pakistani marriages are within families. Analysis of a Pakistani Health Demographic Survey from 2012 to 2013 showed that women in consanguineous marriages are more likely to face psychological domestic abuse. However, findings in this study also reported the prevalence of domestic violence within the larger Pakistani population as well. = Increased urbanization = Another factor given for the rise in domestic violence has been due to increased urbanization. As people move from villages and increasingly live apart from an extended family, assaults are less likely to be prevented by the intervention of family members, who in past times often intervened in domestic conflicts. In particular, women who move cities or areas after marriage away from their respective family are more at risk for domestic violence. These women are left without parental or familial support as the only contacts they have are now limited to their husband and husband's family. Violent spousal relationships are perpetuated by isolation of the victim and lack of social support.  Impact on women  = Physical and psychological health outcomes = Domestic violence leads to increased risk towards certain health outcomes like major depression, dysthymia, conduct disorder, and drug abuse. Moreover, because women are primary caretakers in Pakistan, children also face increased risk for depression and behavioural problems. Zakar et al. found in their study that of those interviewed (373 women from Pakistani hospitals) including women who had experienced severe domestic violence, 54% reported poor current mental health. Associated with this self-reported statistic of women in a poor state of mental health was also a high prevalence of mental health disorders with anxiety and depression being the most common. In particular, physical violence has long-term, negative psychological impacts on women with stigma against mental health serving as an impediment to treatment. At times, physical violence may cause permanent disfiguration of the body causing physical ailments that lead to a variety of psychological disorders like depression. Furthermore, women are often unable to receive treatment for psychological disorders as mental health within the cultural realm of Pakistan is not considered a health matter. Mental health illiteracy leads to treatment of mental health disorders superstitiously or not at all. Another study that examined domestic violence and pregnancy among Pakistani women found that 51% of respondents reported experiencing domestic violence in the six months prior to or after pregnancy. The researchers of this study and others have suggested due to the prevalence of domestic violence in pregnant women that domestic violence be screened for during antenatal care. = Bargaining power = Women in domestic violence relationships often have no recourse of escaping due to fear of murder from the perpetrator. A vivid example of this is the practice of watta satta, or bride exchange, whereby a daughter from one family is swapped for a daughter of another in a brother-sister pair. Power dynamics between the families follow a revenge-based model. If a husband is harsh on his wife then the mutual threat exists of the husband's brother-in-law being harsh on his sister. These reciprocal threats leave women in positions with little to no bargaining power. This leaves women in a position where they cannot escape a marriage because of cross bride exchange family entanglement. Adding to the complexity, divorce is also highly stigmatized within the Pakistani culture. Bargaining power of women in domestic violence relationships is also minimal due to residence with the husband's family. Particularly, in rural areas, if a woman in a domestic violence relationship is living with her husband's family, she has little recourse to seek help or escape. Studies on attitudes of domestic violence in Pakistan have shown that though these families in rural areas may wish to help their daughter, it is costly to continuously visit her. In other cases, domestic violence perpetrator families have been shown to taunt or ridicule those seeking justice. Policy initiatives = General legislation against domestic violence = In 2009 a Domestic Violence Protection bill was proposed by Yasmeen Rehman of the Pakistan People‚Äôs Party. It was passed in the National Assembly but subsequently failed to be passed in the second chamber of parliament, the Senate, within the prescribed period of time. The Council of Islamic Ideology objected to the bill, claiming that in its current form it will increase divorces and argued that the bill considered women and children the only victims of domestic violence, ignoring elderly and weak men. The council claimed that the punishments suggested by the bill were already enacted by other laws and suggested lack of action on these laws as the reason for increase in domestic violence. After the passage of Eighteenth constitutional amendment, the matter pertaining to the bill became a provincial issue. It was re-tabled in 2012, but met with a deadlock in parliament because of stiff opposition from the religious right. Representatives of Islamic organizations vowed resistance to the proposed bill, describing it as \\"anti-Islamic\\" and an attempt to promote \\"Western cultural values\\" in Pakistan. They asked for the bill to be reviewed before being approved by the parliament. The bill was passed for Islamabad Capital Territory. = Specific legislation against certain offenses =  Dowry deaths  In 1976 the Pakistani government passed legislation on dowry and bridal gifts in an attempt to eliminate the custom but, because of cultural and societal norms combined with government ineffectiveness, such killings over inadequate dowries continue.  Acid attacks  In 1999 the Senate of Pakistan rejected a resolution which would have condemned the practice of murdering women for the sake of family honour. In 2011 the Senate passed the Acid Control and Acid Crime Prevention Bill to repress acid attacks in the country; the senate also passed the Prevention of Anti-Women Practices bill.  Honour killing  On April 21, 2001, the national government leader Pervez Musharraf declared that honour killings were \\"vigorously condemned\\" by the government and would be treated as murder. The Ministry of Women Development set up ten crisis centres to help the victims of domestic violence and raise the awareness level of the people on this issue. Particularly in 2004, Pakistan's Criminal Law (Amendment) Act passed that provided legal protection for womenOn April 21, 2001, the national government leader Pervez Musharraf declared that honour killings were \\"vigorously condemned\\" by the government and would be treated as murder. The Ministry of Women Development set up ten crisis centres to help the victims of domestic violence and raise the awareness level of the people on this issue. Particularly in 2004, Pakistan's Criminal Law (Amendment) Act passed that provided legal protection for women against any offense committed by family members for the sake of honour. However, Pakistan's legal system has done little to uphold this legislation. The National Commission on the Status of Women reports that Pakistan is doing little to bring justice to perpetrators. If the family of the victim forgives the perpetrator, then the perpetrator will be set free despite clear violation of Pakistani law. Oftentimes, families who are caught in an honour killing case come from rural areas where families must work together in a village on the daily to live. When an honour killing occurs, the family of the victim are highly likely to forgive the perpetrator based on what elders of the village advise them to do.  Support organizations  From both international and internal funding, there are a variety of NGO's that provide support to women who have endured or are enduring domestic violence. * Bedari (funded by United Nations Development Programme) * White Ribbon Campaign Pakistan * Lawyers for Human Rights and Legal Aid - LHRLA * Madadgaar National Helpline 1098 * War Against Rape Pakistan * Acid Survivors Foundation Pakistan * Chayn See also * Acid throwing * Child marriage * Dowry death * Domestic violence * Domestic violence in India * Honour killing * Honour killing in Pakistan * Honour killing of Sadia Sheikh * Honour killing of Ghazala Khan * Rape in Pakistan * Violence against women in Pakistan References  External links  * Domestic Violence (Prevention and Protection) Act, 2012 (PDF) Violence against women in Pakistan Crimes against women ","title":"Domestic violence in Pakistan"},{"id":"36489383","text":"The 1953‚Äì54 season was the 39th in the history of the Isthmian League, an English football competition.

The forest sharp-tailed snake is found in shaded wet forests along the West Coast of the United States. The forest sharp tailed snake went unnoticed for a long time due to its vast similarities to Contia tenuis and because of the secretive nature of both species of sharp-tailed snakes, and also of their seasonally limited amount of activity. Identification The easiest way to set the two species apart is by looking at the tail length and the subcaudal scales. The forest sharp-tailed snake has a longer tail than Contia tenuis and more subcaudal scales.

Training was hampered by the shortage of rifles and equipment, and the tented camp became uninhabitable during winter gales, with the battalions having to go into billets. In February the brigade transferred to the Durham and North Riding County Division in North East England, where it took up an operational role in beach defence. All the brigade's infantry battalions left in November and December 1941 for conversion to other roles in the Royal Artillery (RA) or Royal Armoured Corps. =148th RAC= 9th Loyals was converted into an armoured regiment at Thoresby Hall, Nottinghamshire, on 22 November 1941.

Blandin was a standout as a tackle at Tulane University and earned All-America honors in 1941, his senior year. Blandin was drafted to play for the Philadelphia Eagles, but he instead joined the military and served in the Pacific theater of World War II. Upon his discharge, he signed with the Browns of the AAFC and played on the team for two seasons. The Browns won the league championship in both of those years. Blandin was then sent to the Colts, where he remained through the 1950 season. He played one more year of professional football in 1953. College career Blandin attended Tulane University and played for the Tulane Green Wave football team between 1939 and 1941. He was part of an offensive line that was one of the largest in the country at the time: the linemen averaged 214 pounds. Blandin was named a consensus All-American after the 1941 season. Blandin was drafted by the Philadelphia Eagles in the 1942 NFL Draft, but he delayed a professional football career to join the U.S. Navy as America's involvement in World War II intensified. Blandin served in the Pacific theater, spending a year in the Marshall Islands and three months in Hawaii. Professional career After the war, Blandin signed with the Cleveland Browns in 1946 as the team geared up to play its first season in the All-America Football Conference. He rotated at left tackle with Chet Adams in 1946 and 1947. The Browns won the AAFC championship both of those years. By early 1948, the league was looking for ways to distribute talent more evenly across its teams, and several Browns players, including Blandin, were sent to the Baltimore Colts to help the struggling team. Paul Brown, Cleveland's coach, called Blandin \\"one of my best men\\" and insisted that the AAFC's commissioner, Admiral Jonas H. Ingram, tell Blandin that the move was Ingram's decision. Blandin played at left tackle for the Colts until 1950, when the team ceased to exist. He left football before returning for one additional season in 1953 with a newly re-formed Colts team.

The opera finishes with happy end, heroine ‚Äì is a modest girl, daughter of a woodcutter who gains victory over psychology of a formidable Shah, who learns a handicraft ‚Äì carpet weaving ‚Äì because of his love to her. History Premiere of the opera was held on March 10, 1912 in Nikitin brothers‚Äô circus in Baku. Huseyn Arablinski was director of the spectacle and Muslim Magomayev was its conductor. Huseyngulu Sarabski (Shah Abbas), Ahmed Agdamski (Khurshid Banu) and M.H.Teregulov (Mestaver) played the leading parts. The opera stayed in a repertoire of the Opera and Ballet Theatre right up to 1930‚Äôs. Music Huseyngulu Sarabski in the role of Shah Abbas The composer broadly used mugam in the opera. There is also author‚Äôs music in the opera. Hajibeyov used an aria of traditional-classic type for the first time (I act). A basis of tonality and intonation is vividly reflected in it. It is a multisided and finished portrait of Shah Abbas. The aria is also notable for that, unlike the vocal characteristics of other earlier operas of Hajibeyov, there are revealed a lot of moods in its music. Two themes lie on its basis, the first of them is thoughtful, concentrated, lyric, and the other is decisive, march-like and associated with ‚ÄúHeyrati‚Äù zerb-mugham. The aria of Shah Abbas created prerequisites for aria of Aslan Shah in ‚ÄúShah Ismayil‚Äù opera of Muslim Magomayev, and also was of great importance in evolution of Hajibeyov ‚Äòs opera style. Author‚Äôs music of mugam lies on the basis of Khurshid Banu‚Äôs aria (I act) and Mestaver‚Äôs part. Combination of traditional and new musical means expanded arsenal of composer style, promoting the opera with success.

Cheroke grew up in Ohio and attended Ohio State University, where he was a standout player on the school's football team as a sophomore in 1941 under head coach Paul Brown. He left Ohio State after the season to join the military during World War II. When he was discharged in 1946, he joined the Browns, a new team in the AAFC coached by Brown. The Browns won the 1946 AAFC championship, but Cheroke was traded away at the end of the season. He cut his football career short to re-enlist in the Army, where he stayed for 20 years. He retired in 1965 and settled in California, working for Beckman Instrument Company in Los Angeles. Nephew George Cheroke born 8/25/43(named after uncle George) is a life long Cleveland Browns fan living in Post Falls, ID. with wife Kay. College and professional career Cheroke grew up in Shadyside, Ohio and attended Ohio State University, where he played guard on the school's football team starting as a sophomore in 1941. Cheroke saw his first action on the varsity team after Lin Houston, the regular starter at right guard, suffered an injury. In his first game, against Pitt, Cheroke blocked a punt that led to a safety. The Ohio State Buckeyes posted a 6‚Äì1‚Äì1 record in 1941 under head coach Paul Brown and were ranked 13th in the nation by the Associated Press. He was given a trophy by the Ohio State Journal Downtown Quarterback Club as the sophomore who improved the most during the season. Cheroke left Ohio State before the 1942 season to serve in the Army Air Force during World War II. He spent over four years in the service and was deployed in the European Theatre of World War II for 18 months, rising to the rank of captain. After his discharge in 1946, Cheroke joined the Cleveland Browns, a team under formation in the All-America Football Conference and coached by Paul Brown. Cheroke was one of five Ohio State players who signed with the Browns despite having remaining college eligibility, which caused a controversy because some Ohio State alumni and administrators wanted them to come back and play at the collegiate level. Cheroke played in all of the Browns' games in 1946 as the team finished the regular season with a 12‚Äì2 record and won the AAFC championship game. Brown traded Cheroke and four other players to the Baltimore Colts for guard Weldon Humble before the start of the 1947 season. Cheroke, however, did not play in any games for the Colts, opting instead to re-enlist in the Army. Later life and death Cheroke spent 20 years in the Army, retiring at the end of 1965.

The group claims areas around Mombasa and the coastal area. It has both Muslim and Christian supporters. The leader of the group is Omar Mwamnuadzi and he was charged in 2014 along with 11 other members. However, the group denies claims by government officials that it has forged links with Somalia's militant Islamist group al-Shabaab. History The Mombasa Republican Council was formed in 1999 to address perceived political and economic discrimination against the people of the coast province. The group traces its secession claims to the 1895 and 1963 agreements transferring the ten-mile strip of land along the coast to the Government of Kenya from Zanzibar. Some critics characterize these British agreements as a form of bribery designed to facilitate colonization of the interior. The group contests these agreements as invalid, because they were enacted without the consent of coastal stakeholders, and says the state of Kenya has failed to honor the provisions designed to protect the coastal population. Secession claims The Mombasa Republican Council was dormant until 2008, when it first raised claims that Mombasa should secede from Kenya to become an independent state. They argued that secession would liberate the people of the coast province from marginalization by the successive governments in Kenya. The slogan they are using is Pwani Si Kenya (\\"The Coast is not Kenya\\"). In response, the government declared the group to be an illegal organization, together with another 33 groups. Mombasa Republican Council contested the government's decision in the court. The high court of Mombasa lifted the ban and ruled that claiming the group was illegal was unconstitutional.

The studios are closely associated with Gainsborough Pictures which was based there for most of the studio's history. During its existence Islington worked closely with its sister Lime Grove Studios in Shepherd's Bush and many films were made partly at one studio and partly at the other. Amongst the films made at the studios were Alfred Hitchcock thrillers, Will Hay comedies and Gainsborough Melodramas. History The studios were originally built as a power station for the Great Northern & City Railway, and were acquired by the major American company Famous Players-Lasky which wanted to set up a British subsidiary. The building was converted into a two-stage studio, and production began in 1920. During this era Alfred Hitchcock made his start in films, when he was employed as an intertitle writer at Islington. In 1924 the Hollywood company sold off the studios which were bought by Michael Balcon's Gainsborough Pictures. The company enjoyed some success turning out silent films during the 1920s, at a time when other British companies were struggling. In the late 1920s Gainsborough merged with the larger British Gaumont which owned the Lime Grove Studios. The conglomerate had ambitious plans to challenge Hollywood and produce more than twenty films a year. The larger Lime Grove complex was selected to make expensive films while Islington was designated the cheaper films, particularly comedies. However, during these years it served as an overflow studio and many films scheduled for Shepherd's Bush were made partly at Islington. During the Slump of 1937, British Gaumont shut down production. Although it considered giving up filmmaking completely, it was decided to continue Gainsborough Pictures making slightly cheaper films. Shepherd's Bush was shut down and all production switched to Islington. The success of some of these late 1930s Islington productions such as The Lady Vanishes helped Gainsborough to keep in business.Warren p.107-109 Unlike many other studios, Islington was not requisitioned when war broke out and production continued there, but the studio was temporarily closed because it was feared that a direct hit from a German bomb during an air raid would make the large chimney collapse. All production was switched to re-opened Lime Grove. Both studios came under the control of the Rank Organisation when it bought Gainsborough in 1941.Warren p.109 Flats built on the site of Islington Studios Following the war, Islington were re-opened. In 1946 Betty Box was placed in charge of the studios when her brother Sydney Box was appointed by Rank to run Gainsborough Pictures. Over the next three years the studio turned out a large number of thrillers and comedies. In 1949 both Islington and Shepherd's Bush were closed when Rank concentrated production at Pinewood Studios. Today a block of flats stand where the studio used to be. The block's courtyard features a large sculpture of Alfred Hitchcock's head, by sculptor Anthony Donaldson.

She was a celebrated Wagnerian singer, possessing a wide vocal range and dramatic creativity and fine sense of style. She made her debut in 1907 at the Stadttheater Dortmund as a contralto and mezzo-soprano. She performed at the Stuttgart Court Opera from 1914 to 1918, the Berlin State Opera from 1919 to 1925, the St√§dtische Oper Berlin from 1925 to 1932, and the Vienna State Opera from 1919 until 1932. From 1932 to 1950, she only appeared as a concert singer, and taught at the Vienna Music Academy as a professor.  Career  She was born Helene Wehrenfennig in Vienna in 1882, the daughter of a railway operator. She studied in Vienna at the Gesellschaft der Musikfreunde Conservatory under Rosa Papier-Paumgartner, who had earlier taught Anna Bahr- Mildenburg and Lucie Weidt. She was initially a contralto, but had a wide vocal range. She made her debut in 1907 at the Stadttheater Dortmund as an alto and mezzo-soprano. At the Dortmund theatre, she performed 23 different roles in one season, and in the 1913 season appeared as Waltraute, Erda and Fricka in Wagner's Ring and as Brang√§ne in his Tristan und Isolde. She married fellow opera singer Karl Wildbrunn (1873‚Äì1938) in 1914. Shortly afterwards, they moved to Stuttgart, where she became a member of the Stuttgart Court Opera. Here she developed to a soprano, performing the roles of Rezia, Amelia, Leonore, Br√ºnnhilde in Siegfried and G√∂tterd√§mmerung, Valentine in Les Huguenots, Kundry and the Marschallin. From 1919 to 1925 she performed at the Berlin State Opera, from 1925 to 1932 at the St√§dtische Oper Berlin, and from 1919 until 1932 at the Vienna State Opera.

The first half of the advertisement was animated by Hanna- Barbera, with the second half featuring National Party leader Robert Muldoon. The advert was produced to be highly critical of the governing New Zealand Labour Party's recently introduced compulsory superannuation scheme, implying the scheme would eventually turn New Zealand into a Soviet-style communist state, and urged people to vote for National in the upcoming general election. Background The Third Labour Government introduced a compulsory superannuation scheme in 1974, with the scheme beginning on 1 April 1975. Every employee aged between 17 and retirement age would have 4% of their gross wage deducted, with this deduction being matched by their employer and paid to the Superannuation Corporation. The Corporation would bank the money received in individual accounts, and would contribute money to individual accounts earned by investments on its own part. When the person reached retirement age, their money would gradually be paid out of their account back to them as income. In many respects, the scheme was similar to the modern KiwiSaver scheme, introduced by the Fifth Labour Government in 2007, but unlike the 1975 scheme, KiwiSaver is voluntary, and investments are carried out by multiple providers; Inland Revenue is responsible only for collection and on-payment. The National Party saw this scheme as socialist, and claimed that the Government, through the Superannuation Corporation, would eventually end up gaining control of a large proportion of the country's property and shares. The compulsory superannuation scheme subsequently became a major issue approaching the 29 November general election. Advert The three-minute advert starts explaining the compulsory superannuation scheme's introduction on 1 April, and that the Labour government called it a bold piece of social legislation. The narrator then says it was a poor April Fool's joke (referencing the introduction of the scheme on 1 April), and notes that Labour did not tell the full story of the scheme: nobody would receive the scheme's full benefit until 2028, and it would not pay anything at all to housewives, those aged over 55, or those on Social Security. After saying it was a bad idea, the narrator explains that it is dangerous: Labour would soon be deducting money from wage earners and spending it. In seven years, they would have enough money to buy every share in every company in New Zealand, followed by every farm, and eventually the whole country. Following this, the narrator asks \\"And you know what that's called, don't you?\\" before several Cossacks dance across the screen in front of a concerned-looking man to represent the Soviet Union, implying the answer to the question was Communism (despite the fact that the Cossacks were traditionally opponents to the communist Bolsheviks). The advert then cuts to National Party leader Muldoon, who explains if National won the election, it would repeal the compulsory superannuation scheme, refund money that workers and employers had paid in, and replace it with its \\"fairer\\" and universal National Superannuation, explaining its benefits, and then urging people to vote National. The advert ended with the National Party logo and its campaign slogan: \\"New Zealand. The way YOU want it\\". Aftermath Even though the advert played only twice on New Zealand television, it became both a famous ‚Äì and infamous ‚Äì part of New Zealand political advertising history. As a result of the advert and other campaigning against Labour's compulsory superannuation scheme, the National Party won the election by a landslide, gaining 55 of the 87 seats in the New Zealand House of Representatives. Within three weeks of taking office, the new National government fulfilled their promise and abolished the compulsory superannuation scheme, replacing it with National Superannuation.

The Astoria Riverfront Trolley is a heritage streetcar line that operates in Astoria, Oregon, United States, using former freight railroad tracks along or near the south bank of the Columbia River, with no overhead line. The service began operating in 1999, using a 1913-built streetcar from San Antonio, Texas. As of 2012, the service was reported as carrying 35,000 to 40,000 passengers per year and has been called a \\"symbol\\" and \\"icon\\" of Astoria. The line's operation is seasonal, normally during spring break and from May through September. Volunteers from the non-profit Astoria Riverfront Trolley Association (ARTA) operate the service and maintain the streetcar and tracks, but the city of Astoria has provided some funds for certain purchases, including a new carbarn in 2001 and a contribution to the cost of purchasing the streetcar. The car was on loan from San Antonio for the first seven years, but was purchased by ARTA in August 2005. By 2004, the Trolley had become \\"one of Astoria's most popular features\\" and \\"a main attraction in the city of Astoria\\". Pre-opening history The idea of creating a heritage streetcar system in Astoria, as part of efforts to redevelop and revitalize the riverfront area, had first been raised in 1980, long after the closure of the city's streetcar-transit system, which operated from 1892 to 1924. An attempt by city officials to acquire a trolley car in 1986 was dropped in the face of high insurance costs. When Burlington Northern abandoned its freight railroad line from Portland to Astoria in 1996, the city of Astoria purchased about of BN right-of-way and track in and around downtown Astoria for possible future use, an action known as \\"railbanking\\". The remaining section of the Portland‚ÄìAstoria line was sold by BN to the Portland and Western Railroad in 1997 and kept intact. After Astoria officials learned that a genuine vintage streetcar already in Oregon was not in use and was available for possible lease, they approached its owners and negotiated a five-year lease. The car was ex-San Antonio Public Service Company No. 300 and was owned by the San Antonio Museum of Art, but had been in Oregon since 1990 and had been used on the Willamette Shore Trolley line, in Portland, from 1990 through 1994. In November 1998, Astoria mayor Willis Van Dusen signed the five-year lease, which specified a rent of just $1 per year, and car 300 was moved to Astoria the following month. Since 1995, it had been stored in a closed museum near Gales Creek, Oregon, known as the Trolley Park (and formally as the Oregon Electric Railway Museum until that museum moved in 1996). Although the car had been in regular use until fewer than four years earlier, it had been stored outdoors since that time and was now in need of extensive restoration work. After raising $40,000 in donations, volunteers refurbished car 300 and repainted it from the yellow paint scheme it had worn in Portland (inherited from San Antonio) to a new red-and-green livery, with \\"Astoria Riverfront Trolley\\" lettered along the side, above the windows. To avoid the expense of installing trolley wire and associated support poles and electrical substations, the electric motors of the trolley are powered by a diesel generator mounted on a trailer that the car pulls when westbound and pushes when eastbound, the same arrangement that car 300 had used when running on the Willamette Shore Trolley. Route and service Service was inaugurated on June 8, 1999, on a route from Portway Street to 36th Street. The principal boarding location was at the Columbia River Maritime Museum (at 17th Street and approximately the middle of the route), and initially there were no other set stops. Several designated stops were added later, and some of these include a bench and small shelter. Passengers are still permitted to flag-down the trolley in between the posted stops. Passengers boarding car 300 at the Columbia River Maritime Museum during the first season of operation, in 1999 The route runs parallel to the Columbia River's bank, and the river is visible most of the way. In a few places, the tracks are carried on low trestles over the water. The line passes through the National Register of Historic Places- listed Downtown Historic District, and its westernmost section passes under the Astoria‚ÄìMegler Bridge. To the east of the Maritime Museum, at 20th Street, it passes a former Spokane, Portland and Seattle Railway depot built in 1924. The fare has always been $1, with an all-day pass available for $2. Around 2006, operation was extended east from 36th Street to 39th Street, making the line about long. During the first few years, the line operated from March or April through December, daily in summer months and otherwise Fridays through Sundays. Since about 2005, it has typically run daily from May through September, and sometimes also during spring break. Hours of operation are noon to 7 p.m. daily, Memorial Day to Labor Day, with more limited dates and hours in late spring and early fall. A round trip takes about 50 minutes. The car makes a trip approximately once an hour in each direction, but there is no exact schedule. Volunteers from the trolley association operate the car, with a two-person crew consisting of a motorman and a conductor. Boarding takes place at the rear door, where the conductor assists people in boarding, collects fares and identifies sights along the route while talking about the city's history. The trolley line has been credited by local officials with being instrumental in bringing about redevelopment of the downtown waterfront area, among them the chairman of the Port of Astoria Commission, the executive director of the chamber of commerce and the chairman of the Clatsop County Commission. Mayor Willis Van Dusen, another of the trolley's supporters, was quoted in a 2004 Daily Astorian article as saying that the trolley \\"has become almost a logo for the city, second only to the Astoria Column.\\" Facilities and acquisitions Benches and shelters were installed at several stops along the line in 2000 and 2001. In 2002, a new carbarn was built on Industry Street, at the line's west end, where the trolley car is stored and maintained. The building is owned by the city of Astoria. In 2004, the Sunset Empire Transportation District opened a new bus transit center near the trolley line, at Ninth Avenue and Marine Drive. In 2005, the San Antonio Museum of Art (SAMA), which had previously been unwilling to sell car 300, agreed to allow the Astoria Riverfront Trolley Association (ARTA) to buy it. The price was $50,000, and it was paid for almost entirely with donations, but with the city of Astoria contributing $5,000. The purchase was completed in early 2006. In 2010, the car was fitted with a GPS tracking device, and the Astoria-Warrenton Chamber of Commerce makes location information available to the public on its website. The data is updated online every two minutes while the trolley is running. Car 300 history The trolley line passes under the southern end of the Astoria‚ÄìMegler Bridge. This view is northwest, looking across the mouth of the Columbia towards Washington. ARTA's only streetcar is No. 300, nicknamed \\"Old 300\\" and built in 1913 by the American Car Company for the streetcar system in San Antonio, Texas. It served San Antonio until the abandonment of streetcar service there in 1933 and was acquired at that time by the San Antonio Museum Association, former parent of the San Antonio Museum of Art. In 1981, SAMA opened in a former Lone Star Brewery building located along the tracks of the Texas Transportation Company. As an additional attraction for museum visitors, car 300 was restored to operating condition, and in October 1982 it began providing public rides along a short section of track behind the art museum. This heritage trolley service was discontinued at the end of 1985 due to budget cuts, and the trolley car, by then already nicknamed \\"Old Number 300\\", went back into storage. No. 300 was brought to Oregon in June 1990 by Gales Creek Enterprises (GCE), the then-new operator of the Willamette Shore Trolley line in Portland.Furey, John (June 30, 1990). \\"Vintage trolley links Portland, Lake Oswego\\". The Oregonian, p. E1. GCE was leasing the car from the San Antonio Museum Association. Car 300 was the main streetcar on the WST line through the 1994 season, but in 1995 the city of Lake Oswego decided to give the operating contract for the WST instead to the Oregon Electric Railway Historical Society, and that group substituted its own historic streetcars to provide WST service.\\"Trolley service likely to begin Friday\\" (July 13, 1995). Lake Oswego Review, p. A3. GCE moved car 300 to storage at the Oregon Electric Railway Museum, located near Glenwood (and Gales Creek) at that time. Meanwhile, the San Antonio Museum Association was dissolved in 1994, and the San Antonio Museum of Art became car 300's owner.\\"Museum History\\". 2012. San Antonio Museum of Art. Retrieved January 5, 2013. In 1998, Astoria officials learned of the car's availability and secured a five-year lease agreement with SAMA. The car was brought to Astoria in December 1998 to be restored, and it inaugurated the Astoria Riverfront Trolley service in June 1999. In 2003, the lease agreement was extended for another five years, but in 2005 this was superseded by an outright purchase, after SAMA agreed to sell the car to the Astoria Riverfront Trolley Association.

Born and raised in Calgary, Alberta, Murdoch Burnett was the seventh of eleven children born to Pat and Jim Burnett. He began writing poetry in the summer of 1971 at the age of seventeen. He left formal education behind at that point and embarked on what he has described as a journey of self-discovery and lifelong learning. He has taught and been a guest lecturer at the Alberta College of Art and Design, Mount Royal University and the University of Calgary. In 1975, he met a local bookseller who would later become a book publisher, George Parry.Article about George Parry Parry owned and operated several independent bookstores in Calgary and a small publishing/distribution house, Westlands Book Express Ltd Parry owned and operated a series of bookstores in Calgary including Laughing Rooster Books, Wild Turkey Books, and City Limits. Later he owned and operated a small publishing/distribution house, Westlands Book Express Ltd, which was eventually located in Cochrane, Alberta. Several of Burnett's books would be published by Westlands Book Express, but volumes were also published by Whickey Jack Publishing, Garlic Press, City Limits Communications, Penny Dreadfuls and BookThug.Book Thug Website According to its website, BookThug is a Toronto-based publishing house that has been in existence since 1992 and publishes innovative books of poetry, prose and creative criticism that extend the tradition of experimental literature. Influences According to Burnett, his work was influenced by the founders of contemporary poetry ‚Äì William Blake, Walt Whitman, and Charles Baudelaire ‚Äì but also reflected his great respect for the early modernist pioneers Ezra Pound, Guillaume Apollinaire, William Carlos Williams, and Gertrude Stein. He always maintained that the single volume of poetry that most influenced his work was The Waste Land by T. S. Eliot and he was a great admirer of the poetry of Dylan Thomas and the Beat Generation poets, many of whom he met and worked with in their later years.A Conversation with Murdoch Burnett, September, 2009 Performance highlights Burnett, performed his work at a number of popular venues in Calgary, including Ten Foot Henry's and Marty's Cafe. Over the years, Burnett would perform at various other venues and festivals both in and out of Alberta, including Vancouver, British Columbia, Winnipeg, Manitoba,An Evening with Murdoch Burnett was a poetry reading by Murdoch Burnett presented by Ace Art Inc. in Winnipeg Manitoba, on October 16, 1996 Toronto, Ontario and Seattle, Washington. In addition to writing poetry and performing, Murdoch Burnett hosted a radio show \\"Breaking the Silence\\" on commercial radio station 107 KIK FM (now CFGQ-FM) in Calgary from 1987 to 1989. It was a weekly half hour program dedicated to the art and craft of poetry and included interviews with other writers, recorded and live performances, and historical readings. Burnett's research for his book, The Centre of the World: A Plains Journey was reviewed by Hugh Dempsey, noted Canadian historian, author, and Curator Emeritus of the Glenbow Museum, resulting in his book launch and first reading from that book being held at the museum. In addition to numerous regular readings and performances at various venues, he was also a headline performer at several \\"High Performance Rodeos\\"The High Performance Rodeo is a series of shows presented by One Yellow Rabbit theatre company in Calgary during the month-long Calgary International Arts Festival. The shows feature experimental performance artists, poets, puppeteers and other artists. produced annually by the One Yellow Rabbit theatre company in Calgary. In 1988, Burnett was invited to perform at the Calgary Olympic Arts Festival alongside writers from 27 different countries amongst whom were Lawrence Ferlinghetti and Ryszard Kapuscinski. A film of this event was produced and directed by Shona Rossell. On November 25, 1989, Burnett performed at a \\"Poetry Caberet,\\" presented by a performance group called Penny Dreadful based in Calgary. Other performers in the Cabaret were Suki Davis, Brian Rusted, Rick Therrien, Ken Rivard, Glen Sherret, and Yvonne Trainer. The well-attended caberet was held at the \\"Open Space\\" venue in Victoria, British Columbia. In 1996, Murdoch Burnett was invited to participate in the first Wordfest: Banff Calgary International Writers Festival featuring 50 writers over four days. The 1996 line-up featured not only Burnett, but also Margaret Atwood, Roch Carrier, Wayson Choy, Tomson Highway, Paul Quarrington and Sheri-D Wilson.Alumni List The complete Alumni list, including Murdoch Burnett, is available at the Wordfest site. A recording of one of Burnett's performances in Toronto, when he appeared as the closing act at the Scream in High Park - Scream '98, can be accessed at the Scream Literary Festival site. The Scream Literary Festival was an annual summer poetry reading event held under the stars in Toronto's High Park from 1993 to 2011. The Scream Festival no longer exists in that form, and in 2012 it was renamed \\"The Scream Unfestival.\\" For many years, Burnett worked with musician and composer Scott Willing and together they composed music for his performances of the poems: \\"We Are Not Romans,\\" \\"Technologically Native\\",Later adapted to be a short film produced by The Funnel Experimental Film Theatre in 1983. Murdoch Burnett played one of the lead roles in the film. \\"Power and Glory,\\" \\"A Choice of Futures,\\" \\"The Long Distance,\\" \\"The Homecoming,\\" and \\"Centre of the World.\\" Some of these performances were recorded on videotape and produced by The New Gallery and EMMEDIA.EMMEDIA The New Gallery (TNG), 1987 to present (formerly Known as Off Centre Centre from 1980 to 1987) is a not-for-profit arts organization that provides a venue for artists producing new work that may be experimental in nature or not commercially viable.

An archival photograph of Murdoch Burnett at a poetry performance can be found at TNG's website Awards and recognition Burnett's contributions to the literary community in Canada were recognized at the Calgary International Spoken Word Festival \\"Home on Earth\\" in 2007 where he was honoured with the first ever Golden Beret Award. This award is given annually to a Canadian Poet who has made significant and lifelong contributions to the development of the poetic discipline through his or her written work, performances, and involvement in the community. The jury selected Mr. Burnett for the award based not only on these criteria but also the originality of his work, mastery of his art, and innovative techniques. When interviewed by Fast Forward Weekly Magazine about the award, he humbly responded, \\"I hope people feel it is something that I would deserve.\\" But added, \\"I hope it is not a lifetime achievement award ‚Äì I still have so much more that I want to do. I was quite surprised and honoured by the award.\\" Burnett went on to say that he felt Calgary's arts community had finally started to come into its own but expressed concern about the integrity of art making. Finally, when asked what he thought about all the new types of poets - punk-poets, club-poets, spoken- word artists and the like - Burnett said, \\"For a long time it was poet, before the hyphen. Over the years, there has been an explosion of club-poets, punk- poets, poetry slams, workshops, etc. That has been great ‚Äì spoken word had been meant to be a more inclusive term,\\" says Burnett. \\"But for myself, I am a poet first, performer second. I recognize that poetry can wear many hats. I just have never felt a need to hyphenate myself.\\"Fast Forward Weekly Article The complete article, \\"Poet Heroes: Long Lost Spoken Word Artists Descend on Calgary for Home on Earth\\" can be read in the Fast Forward Weekly Archives . See also an article in Island Editions: \\"ABC Friday Reads - Three Calgary Poets\\" wherein the author speaks of Murdoch Burnett as a Calgary poet who \\"went on to publish his work and realize success.\\" Burnett's work was also recognized and commented on in The Literary History of Alberta: From the End of the War to the End of the Century, Vol 2, wherein author, George Melnyk, wrote: > Murdoch Burnett (born 1953) grew up in Southern Alberta and describes > himself in his first volume as an \\"alienated man.\\" For most of his career, > Burnett published with George Parry, a Calgary (and later Cochrane) > bookseller and occasional publisher whose Westlands imprint released > Burnett's books 'We Are Not Romans' (1984) and 'The Long Distance and Other > Poems' (1987).

Beaudoin (Royal Alberta Museum) for inclusion in her recommended bibliography of important written and photographical accounts of the human history of the Palliser Triangle, the southern Canadian prairies. Contributions to other writers From the late 1970s through the 1980s, Murdoch Burnett was instrumental in bringing other local, national and international writers to various Calgary stages including William S. Burroughs, Allen Ginsberg, Anne Waldman, and Anne Michaels. Around that same time, Burnett became a founding member of the Penny Dreadfuls, a writing collective in Calgary whose mandate was to identify accomplished but unpublished writers in Calgary and to produce live performance, video, and small press publications of their work. In addition to writing and performing, Burnett was also the Poetry editor for Release Magazine and Last Issue Magazine during the late 1970s and early 1980s. In the book \\"Moving History / Dancing Cultures: A Dance History Reader\\" edited by Ann Dils and Ann Cooper Albright, in the Notes accompanying a chapter contributed by Lisa Doolittle and Heather Elton, entitled \\"Medicine of the Brave: A Look at the Changing Role of Dance in Native Culture from Buffalo Days to the Modern Powwow\\" the authors thank Murdoch Burnett for his assistance. Murdoch Burnett has donated a number of his personal writings, photographs, manuscripts, drawings and other documents to the Murdoch Burnett Fonds which are maintained as part of the Special Collections, Literary and Art Archives, of the University of Calgary. Researchers, historians, other writers, students, and interested readers will, therefore, always have access to these materials. Social activism Over the years in Calgary, Murdoch Burnett was actively concerned about community and social issues. From 1981 to 1982 he was the Editor of City Limits - A Community Newspaper.City Limits: A Community Newspaper The entire collection of City Limits: A Community Newspaper editions is available at the Snytax Art Society website. City Limits began as a community newspaper but quickly came to serve as an alternative voice in Calgary. The paper dealt with local community, cultural, and international issues, offering alternative perspectives on women's issues, labour, culture, the third world, and local and international politics. In Volume 1 of the paper (August 1981) for example Burnett edited a taped conversation with a group of El Salvadorean folk musicians known as Yolocamba Ita. The goal of the piece (which was also released as a stand-alone publication by Syntax Arts Society in Calgary) was, according to Burnett, to express solidarity with the El Salvadorean cultural workers and to counteract some of the biased reporting they had been subjected to by other mainstream North American press.Murdoch Burnett Quote regarding the Yolocamba Ita Conversation Reference to the conversation with the Yolocamba Ita, edited by Murdoch Burnett and the full quote attributed to him can also be found at the Syntax Art Society website. Burnett was also instrumental in helping to promote a local artists' centre, and bring together artists from diverse backgrounds and mediums to run the centre cooperatively. This collective was known as Off Centre Centre and would undergo many metamorpheses in subsequent years, eventually becoming The New Gallery. From 1980 to 1987, Off Centre Centre focused on community collaborations and worked with organizations such as ANNPAC (Association of National Non-Profit Artist Centres) and One Yellow Rabbit (theatre company) to advance artist‚Äôs rights and artistic practices in Calgary and Canada. Later Years Murdoch Burnett moved to Comox, British Columbia in 1998 where he continued to write. In 2009, he moved back to his beloved Alberta Prairies. He was married in 2010, lived in Bermuda with his wife where he spent his time editing the poems he wrote while living in British Columbia and writing new poems.

She was the only child of Bernard IV, Count of Comminges, and his wife Stephanie-Beatrice IV, Countess of Bigorre. Petronilla succeeded her mother in 1194 as Countess of Bigorre; she was also Viscountess of Marsan and N√©bouzan through further successions. She reigned as countess for fifty-seven years, in which time she was married five times. Biography =Early life= Petronilla was born around 1184 as the only child of her parents, and was therefore their heir. As a child Petronilla was at the centre of political plans, first conducted by her father who acted as regent after the death of Stephanie-Beatrice. However, Petronilla's guardianship was soon handed over to Alfonso II of Aragon who had Petronilla betrothed and married to one of his allies Gaston VI, Viscount of B√©arn in early 1196.Jaurgain (1902), p. 389, quoting Marca (B√©arn), p. 495. Gaston ruled jointly with Petronilla over Bigorre. The couple remained childless. Gaston participated in the 45-year Albigensian Crusade, a time in which he lost favour. He was excommunicated by the Council of Vabres and his territories declared forfeit by the pope.Luchaire, Achille and Edward Benjamin Krehbiel, Social France at the time of Philip Augustus, Henry Holt and Company, 1912, p. 296 =Adulthood= Petronilla's husband Gaston died in 1214 leaving her a childless widow aged around thirty. The following year, Petronilla was married to Nu√±o S√°nchez, a grandson of Petronilla of Aragon; however, the marriage was annulled by Pope Honorius III the very next year, in 1216. The leader of the ongoing crusade, Simon de Montfort, 5th Earl of Leicester, who was at that time at the height of his power, had Petronilla in 1216 married to his own son Guy.Chronique de Guillaume de Puylaurens, Chap. XXVI, p. 129. The power of the Montfort family began to decline during the Albigensian Crusade. There was opposition by the local nobility in 1218, Simon de Montfort was killed at Toulouse and Guy himself was killed in 1220 when taking Castelnaudary. Petronilla was left with two daughters by this marriage.GASCONY, Medieval Lands Although her husband and father-in-law had died, Petronilla remained at their property in the camp of the northern French crusaders as her brother-in-law Amaury de Montfort succeeded and had his sister-in-law remarried to Aymor de Racon. This was followed by the failure of the papal crusade in 1224 and the death of Aymor, the couple having no children. In 1228 Petronilla married for the fifth and final time, her latest husband being Boson of Mastas, Seigneur de Cognac. Petronilla spent the next few years on her husband's estates in Aquitaine as they had made themselves unpopular by their marriages with the Crusaders and their own people. In 1230, Petronilla returned to Bigorre with her husband where public order had collapsed, as a result of her many years of absence, and restored it. In 1232 they attacked Petronilla's half-brother Bernard V in order to inherit the Comminges as their father had died in 1225. Although the claim on Comminges could not be enforced, Petronilla did inherit large parts of the N√©bouzan from her father. In 1242 Petronilla was reconciled with the nobility of Languedoc, who had turned against her because of her hostile northern French husband, Boson, after she and her husband were in the revolt of Count Raymond VII of Toulouse. The rebellion had failed and Boson lost favour with Louis IX of France and eventually died in 1251. =Children= In total Petronilla had three children, two from her third marriage and one by her fifth marriage: With Guy de Monfort she had two daughters: *Alix (1217/1220 ‚Äì 1255), succeeded her mother as Countess of Bigorre; she was married firstly to Jordan, Lord of Chabanais, by whom she had issue; and secondly to Raoul de Courtenay, with issue. *Petronilla, married Raoul de la Roche-Tesson With Boson of Mastas she had one daughter: *Martha (also known as Amata) (after 1228-6 February 1270/April 1273), married Gaston VII, Viscount of B√©arn, and had issue =Death and legacy= Near the end of her life, the Countess Petronilla relinquished the government of Bigorre to her brother-in-law, Simon de Montfort, Earl of Leicester and governor of Guyenne. Petronilla retired to an abbey and died in 1251. Simon had interpreted Petronilla's act of relinquishing Bigorre to him as a gift and he was fought by Alix (Petronilla's daughter and heiress) assisted by Martha. To prevent Guyenne and Gascony from rebelling, Henry III of England recalled Simon de Montfort and appointed John Grailly in his place. Petronilla's grandson was Eschivat de Chabanais who had succeeded his mother Alix without protest, but made the mistake of keeping land that Martha had in Bigorre. Martha's husband Gaston VII of B√©arn then invaded the county, forcing Eschivat to defend it, seeking the assistance of Prince Edward of England and the alliance of Count Roger IV of Foix. In 1258, war resumed in the region and Eschivat agreed to temporarily surrender the County of Bigorre to Simon de Montfort, this time to end the conflict. In doing so, he committed the same mistake as his grandmother, Petronilla, because Simon refused to return the county. Soon after, Simon de Montfort rebelled against King Henry III, and Eschivat helped Gaston VII regain Bigorre. After his death, Petronilla's daughter Martha and her granddaughter by Alix, Laura, competed for the County of Bigorre. After this point the succession become disputed and whether the county owed allegiance to England or France was also fought over. In 1360, the Treaty of Br√©tigny made it decisively French. In 1407, it belonged to Bernard VII of Armagnac, who sold it that year to John I, Count of Foix, (a descendant of Petronilla through Martha). From then on it has been a subsidiary title of the counts of Foix. References *Dictionnaire de la conversation et de la lecture, 2nd Edition, Vol.3, Ed.

Biography Much of St. Misael's story is recorded by Anba Isaac, the abbot of the St. Samuel monastery. St. Misael is known to have had parents who were not religious or heavily involved with the church. His parents also struggled to have a child. It is said that an old monk gave commands to the father to return to the Church and to strengthen the family's foundation with the Christian faith so that they could have a child. According to the testimony of St. Misael to the abbot of St. Samuel monastery, it was after his father had done all that the elder monk had commanded that his mother gave birth to him. St. Misael was accepted into the monastery of St. Samuel the Confessor by the Abbot and was accordingly dressed with the garb of the monastic life and the holy Eskeem. From there on, he lived a solitary life in worship and asceticism. St. Misael is also said to have prophesied about three main events which took place. The first of which concerned an incoming famine; in response to hearing about this, the abbot of the monastery was able to purchase a plentiful supply of grain in preparation. The second prophesy concerned him being taken away from the monastery by a soldier. The third prophesy regarded St. Misael's own death: he informed the abbot of the monastery, Abba Isaac, that he would die the following year. After that, Isaac reports that Misael \\"departed and I did not see him again\\". Feast Day and Commemoration The consecration day of the church of St. Misael was on the 10th of Bashens in the Coptic Year 396, during the reign of Decledianus.

He made over 190 Football League appearances mainly in the 1970s. Career Rodgers was the son of Arnold Rodgers himself a former Bristol City footballer. David Rodgers played for England Schoolboys and in the youth teams at Bristol City. Alan Dicks signed Rodgers as a professional in July 1969 for Bristol City. Rodgers made his debut for Bristol City on 3 November 1970 at centre half deputising for Dickie Rooks in a League Cup 4th round replay 2‚Äì1 win over Leicester City in which Rodgers scored the opening goal for Bristol City. Bristol City reached the semi final of the League Cup losing 1‚Äì3 to Tottenham Hotspur over two legs although Rooks had returned to the side by the time of the semi final ties. Bristol City struggled throughout the 1970‚Äì71 season hovering in or just above the relegation positions in the Second Division eventually finishing in the safety of 19th place. Rodgers made 7 appearances including one wearing the no.11 shirt when City played three central defenders v Bolton Wanderers. Rooks and Geoff Merrick formed the regular central defensive pairing for the 1971‚Äì72 season when Bristol City started strongly before finishing in 8th place. David Bruton was first choice as deputy when Rooks was injured and Rodgers had to wait until February 1972 before being given his chance. Rodgers made 8 appearances and scored one goal in a 2‚Äì0 win v QPR. Rodgers established himself as the centre half alongside captain Merrick at the heart of the City defence for 1972‚Äì73. Rooks had departed and Bruton was now deputy to Rodgers. Rodgers made 35 appearances scoring one goal as Bristol City climbed from bottom of the table in September 1972 up to a final position of 5th place. The following season saw the emergence of a young Gary Collier to share the centre half duties in partnering Merrick. This season Bristol City started well before slipping steadily down the table finishing in 16th place. Rodgers made 26+2 appearances scoring one goal playing mainly in the earlier half of the season. He also made the team for the FA Cup 6th round 0‚Äì1 defeat v Liverpool and made a substitute appearance in the 5th round 1‚Äì0 victory at Leeds United. Rodgers made only 5 appearances in 1974‚Äì75 as Collier and Merrick formed the regular central defensive pairing and Bristol City rose to 5th place in the Second Division. Bristol City won promotion to the First Division as Second Division runners up in 1975‚Äì76 but Rodgers failed to make the first team with Steve Harding playing in the two games that Merrick missed; Collier was ever present. Rodgers made his First Division bow on 23 October 1976 in a 1‚Äì3 defeat at Aston Villa when he replaced the injured Merrick. Rodgers made only that single appearance in 1976‚Äì77 as Bristol City spent almost all season in the relegation places and only escaped along with Coventry City due to a 2‚Äì2 draw between the two clubs on the final day of the season. The final 15 minutes with the ball being played around the halfway line as neither side wanted to disturb the 2‚Äì2 scoreline which guaranteed both teams safety from relegation. In 1977‚Äì78 Norman Hunter joined Bristol City as defensive partner to Collier with Merrick moving to left back and Bristol City finished in 17th position three points above relegation. Rodgers played alongside Hunter in the final 15 league matches after Collier was injured. Rodgers scored one goal in a 3‚Äì0 win v Chelsea. Rodgers missed out in the Anglo Scottish Cup campaign ending with Cup victory over St Mirren in the final in December. Bristol City ended the 1978‚Äì79 season in 13th place in the First Division with Rodgers forming the regular central defensive pairing with Hunter throughout the season. The Anglo Scottish campaign saw City defeated in the quarter final by St Mirren. Rodgers made 36 appearances scoring five goals and another in the FA Cup 3‚Äì1 win v Bolton Wanderers. Bristol City were relegated from the First Division in 1979‚Äì80 finishing 20th of 22 teams. Rodgers played alongside Geoff Merrick in defence making 26 appearances scoring six goals but missing several games with injury. Rodgers again missed out on playing in a successful Anglo Scottish Cup campaign resulting in losing in the final to St Mirren. Rodgers had an injury interrupted season in 1980‚Äì81 as Bristol City were relegated from the Second Division in 21st position making only 14 appearances with Julian Marshall newly signed from Hereford United taking advantage of the opportunity in the centre half shirt. Season 1981‚Äì82 was a momentous one for Bristol City as City suffered a third successive relegation but worse still a financial crisis which very nearly saw the club fold altogether in February 1982. Rodgers was one of the \\"Ashton Gate Eight\\" the players who effectively tore up their well paid contracts and accepted redundancy from the club on 2 February 1982 to save Bristol City from being wound up the following day. The eight players shared the proceeds of a match staged on 24 March 1982 at Ashton Gate between Ipswich Town and Southampton in front of 6,200 spectators. On the field Rodgers made 18 appearances without scoring for Bristol City. After leaving Bristol City, David Rodgers played on a non-contract basis for Torquay United in February 1982 and then on a similar basis for Lincoln City in March 1982 before returning to the West Country with Forest Green Rovers. After Rodgers finished playing he worked briefly as groundsman at Bristol Grammar School before joining nearby Clifton College in January 1985 as the general manager of services.

Since 1934 Quisling's Nasjonal Samling party had held a number of rallies at Stiklestad, in an attempt to link the party to Norway‚Äôs historic past. The NS monument took the place of the Olav's monument erected in 1807 in remembrance of Olav Haraldsson, who later became King Olaf II of Norway and received the epithet \\"Olaf the Holy.\\" The Olav's monument was consequently placed in storage at Verdals√∏ra. The NS monument was carved by sculptor Wilhelm Rasmussen (1879‚Äì1965) and was designed with a central obelisk, surrounded by a low wall and accessed by a staircase consisting of 39 steps. The installation carried the solar cross logo of the pro-Nazi Nasjonal Samling (NS), images with scenes from the battle of Stiklestad, and the death of King Olaf, in nationalistic viking style and stanzas from Per Sivle's poem \\"Tord Foleson\\": :::: \\"Mannen kan siga :::: Men merket det m√• :::: I Norig si jord :::: Som p√• Stiklestad st√•\\" In English :::: \\"The man can say :::: But the mark it must :::: In Norwegian soil :::: As at Stiklestad stand\\" The NS monument was demolished and buried nearby, and the Olav's monument restored immediately following World War II.

TUG-UBL1 is an acronym for Tether containing UBX domain for GLUT4-Ubiquitin Like 1, this is encoded for by the gene, ASPSCR1. Function When insulin is secreted, glucose uptake of cells increase, since insulin stimulates GLUT4 to move from the intracellular surface to the outer surface. In a similar fashion, TUG retains GLUT4 within unstimulated cells, but when insulin is secreted it causes GLUT4 to dissociate and so GLUT4 moves to the cell surface. TUG binds directly and specifically to a large intracellular loop in GLUT4. It acts as a tethering protein, which along with other proteins, retain GLUT4 within cells in the absence of insulin. Additionally, when the protein TUG becomes disrupted it appears to accelerate the degradation of GLUT4 in lysosomes. However, the functional role of the TUG‚ÄìUBL1 domain remains to be elucidated. Structure N-terminal ubiquitin- like domain (TUG‚ÄìUBL1) has a tertiary structure of TUG‚ÄìUBL1, which consists of a beta-grasp or ubiquitin-like topology for this domain. This comprises a five-stranded beta-sheet, a single major alpha-helix (residues 32‚Äì42), and two short helices. Mechanism TUG releases the GLUT4 containing vesicles (GSVs) in response to insulin stimulation which allows it to move to the plasma membrane. TUG has an N-terminal ubiquitin-like protein domain (UBL1) which in similar proteins appears to participate in protein-protein interactions. The region does have an area of negative electrostatic potential and increased backbone motility which leads to suggestions of a potential protein-protein interaction site.

The area was located around 150 km south-east of Algiers, in the ancient province of Mauretania Caesariensis.  History  Auzia probably took the name from the Berber pagan god \\"Auzius\\", because under Augustus a Roman castrum was founded near a small Berber village with that name The city constituted of a castrum (fort) and a vicus (small city): Auzia achieved autonomous status as municipium in the second century and later was renamed Colonia Septima Aurelia Auziense by emperor Septimius Severus. As a Roman colonia, its people received full status of Roman citizenship rights. Tacitus wrote about a \\"Castellum Auziense\\", as the headquarters of the Roman garrison commander in Mauretania Caesariensis's central limes (border fortifications). According to the historian Richard Lawless, Auzia was a vicus that achieved independent status from the castrum (fort) garrison and had a forum (market square) and an important pagan temple, later converted into a Christian church. The Roman settlement (probably with nearly 4,000 inhabitants around 200 AD) was surrounded by farms.Lawless, R. Mauretania Caesartiensis: anarcheological and geographical survey Section: The Roman Civilian Sites. p.122-195 Auzia had even a theater and a small \\"circus\\" for chariot races, created around 227 AD according to epigraphic evidenceAuzia \\"Circus\\" Auzia achieved prosperity mainly because it was at the center of some roads in Roman Africa: from Auzia there were roads toward the Mediterranean sea (Caesarea) and the Saharan interior with the Atlas mountains. In 290 AD, however, the Bavares tribe attacked Auzia and the city suffered huge destruction. Vandals and Byzantine troops occupied temporarily the city. It was reduced to a small village when Arabs conquered the region at the end of the seventh century. Archaeology According to the sources, the French had undertaken several excavations in the ruins of Auzia without ever revealing the slightest historical fact to scientific research because of the policy of francization which was aimed at erasing all trace of civilization old or present on the territory Algerian. In addition, the reconstruction of Auzia would have destroyed several historical sites in the time of the Duke of Aumale. All the large-scale excavations were carried out secretly by the French authorities, who forbade access to the sites to the Arabs, which means that they wanted to hide all the increasingly numerous A civilization fundamentally different from that of the Roman Empire. The French administrative decision prompts the workers with a confidential note to destroy all objects and funeral inscriptions found in the site of the temple of Apollo, completely destroyed to build the civil hospital there - a truth conveyed through history by Algerians who participated in the construction of the city of Aumale. At the same time, Auzia was not occupied by inhabitants, it was about Roman ruins that the French choose for the construction of the city of Aumale. The inhabitants of the region, mostly from the tribes of Ouled Driss, Ouled Fa√¢rha and Ouled Khalouf who occupied the Dirah Mountains, organized themselves and succeeded in uniting all the tribes to oppose the French troops and then to be forced into negotiations. Urban design The study of the urbanism of the ruins reveals that the town of Auzia was fenced by a long wall of quarry stone, supposedly removed from the quarry located as the departmental road connecting Sour-El-Ghozlane - Ain-Bessem. A wall 75 cm wide and 6.7 km long surrounding the city. The total area of Auzia is 920 hectares. Inside, the Romans built a large military barracks at the entrance of Bab-El-Gurt (currently). There were several cohorts, commanded by a tribune militum, a squadron of Moorish vexillaries (light and mobile troops recruited from the provinces), supported in force by a cavalry corps (led by three decurions and a Pr√¶fectus equitum. Which was important for the Roman Empire and had a regional military district in charge of surveillance and intervention at the scale of the Tirinadi (Berrouaghia) region in the Djurdjura and Biban Mountains. (Djouab), the second in Afoul (Chalalat el- Adhoura) and the third in the mountains of Jebel Lakhdar in Achir (The ruins located 4 km from Ain-Boucif reveal the existence of this bastion advanced). Population The total area of Roman construction in the city of Auzia, a space of more than 720 hectares, reveals that the city was populated by a population of more than 12 000 to 13 000 inhabitants, that it would be the largest Roman city of Central Algeria, more important than Tipaza. But this figure could be increased in view of its status as a large military barracks. In addition, the shape of the city reveals a common principle of construction rules, based on the keys of modern urbanism namely the four functions: habitat, work, leisure and circulation. This quality of modern city that can be made of Auzia, attracted the inhabitants of all the tribes, which had resulted in a galloping demography which prompted the Roman authorities to found another city in the region, first to defend Auzia Repeated attacks by the Moors in a protected place, like a fortified enclosure. This was the origin of the foundation of CASTELLUM AUZIENS.  Former and Titular bishopric  Christianity was present in the Auzia area during the third century. It achieved the status of episcopal see. It was one of the many suffragans of the metropolitan Archbishopric of Mauretania Caesariensis, the capital of the Late Roman province of Mauretania Caesariensis, and faded like most. The ancient diocese of Auzia was nominally revived in 1594 as a Latin Catholic titular bishopric of the lowest (episcopal) rank.

In the 2007‚Äì08 Serie B season, in which the team was relegated, he played five times as understudy of Gianluca Berti and later Artur; Rossini also played three times for the reserve. In the 2008‚Äì09 season he moved down one division to Ivrea; on loan as the first choice goalkeeper of Cesena was fellow youth- product Nicola Ravaglia. While on loan, Rossini was the first choice in 2008‚Äì09 Lega Pro Seconda Divisione for the Piedmontese club, but Ivrea folded at the end of season despite finishing mid-table. Rossini's parent club Cesena was promoted back to 2009‚Äì10 Serie B and both Ravaglia and Rossini left the club. =Foligno= Rossini was signed by Foligno Calcio in a co-ownership deal for ‚Ç¨500. Rossini was the starting keeper in both 2009‚Äì10 and 2010‚Äì11 Lega Pro Prima Divisione seasons. He was one of the players in the 2‚Äì2 draw with Pistoiese relegation playoff and Foligno escaped relegation due to a better regular season result (35 versus 33 points).

It is an adjoining area of the Dispur Capital Complex, the capital of Assam. Though most of the buildings and roads were newly constructed, Beltola has a long history which dates back mythical ages. During Ahom reign, Beltola was a small Koch kingdom, whose ruler assisted in the administration of the Borphukan in Guwahati, the Ahom Viceroy of Lower Assam and in maintaining relations with the communities of Khasi Hills. The Kingdom of Beltola survives under the British rule and it existed till India's independence in 1947 CE. Brief History of Beltola Not much is known about the history of Beltola in ancient times. Mythical sources claimed that the word Beltola comes from the word Bilvapatra, which means leaves of Bael tree, used in religious ceremonies. It was said that in olden day's large quantities of Bael tree leaves were sent to Kamakhya Temple to be used in rituals. It was from that time the place is called as Beltola.Choudhury Madhuri Rani Lakshmipriya Devi aru Beltolar Itihash or Rani Lakshmipriya Devi and the history of Beltola 2008 page 55 Ancient Ganesh temple in Ganeshguri, Beltola Mouza, GuwahatiThe Ganesh Temple located in Ganeshguri, which comes under Beltola Mouza or estate, is also very ancient and not much is known about its origin. Some local sources stated that since Beltola was located in the entrance of the old city of Guwahati where the famous temple of Kamakhya is situated, the Ganesh deity at the Ganesh temple in Ganeshguri, serves as a gatekeeper. Therefore, the Ganesh temple may be as ancient as Kamakhya temple. This theory was inspired by the mythical story of Ganesha guarding the entrance of the house, while his mother Devi Parvati was bathing.Choudhury Madhuri Rani Lakshmipriya Devi aru Beltolar Itihash or Rani Lakshmipriya Devi and the history of Beltola 2008 page 55Basistha Temple in Basisthashram, Beltola Mouza, GuwahatiThe Basithashram or Basistha Temple also comes under Beltola Mouza. Though the Basistha Temple was constructed by Ahom King Swargadeo Rajeswar Singha in the middle of eighteenth century, the Basisthashram or the ashram of Basistha dates back to mythical era and it was established by one of the Saptarishi, Rishi Basistha. It is said that Rishi Basistha performs religious ceremonies to worship Lord Shiva in the ashram.Choudhury Madhuri Rani Lakshmipriya Devi aru Beltolar Itihash or Rani Lakshmipriya Devi and the history of Beltola 2008 page 58 Early inhabitants of Beltola mainly consist of Garos, Karbis, Lalungs, Rabha and Koch-Kachari, while small numbers of Manipuris, Kalitas and Muslims later came and settled in Beltola. No records exist about any rulers of Beltola before Gaj Narayan of Koch dynasty. In 1613 CE, Parikshit Narayan, the ruler of Koch Hajo, was defeated by the Mughals. He was taken prisoner and was escorted to Delhi where he had an audience with Mughal Emperor Jahangir. On acknowledging Mughal Supremacy and on the agreement of annual tribute of four lakhs rupees, the Emperor returned his kingdom. While on his way back, Parikshit Narayan fell ill and died. On his death, the Mughals annexed his kingdom and set up Hajo as their headquarters in Assam. Bijit Narayan, the young son of Parikshit Narayan was set up as a tributary king of a small state, named after him, called Bijni. On the defeat of Parikshit Narayan, his two brothers Balinarayan and Gaj Narayan, fled to the Ahom Kingdom and sought refuge from Ahom King Swargadeo Pratap Singha. Swargadeo Pratap Singha had married the daughter of Parikshit Narayan, Mangaldohi, and later set up the Mangaldoi town on her respect. Owing to this matrimonial alliance, Swargadeo Pratap Singha granted refuge to these Koch princes. Meanwhile, the Mughal Governor demanded their extradition, which Swargadeo Pratap Singha refused. This and other causes of offence led the Mughal Governor to decide on the invasion of the Ahom Kingdom, leading to Ahom-Mughal conflict. The invading Mughal forces were defeated and driven back to their own territory. After this victory, in 1615 CE Swargadeo Pratap Singha installed Balinarayan as the tributary ruler of Darrang and renamed him as Dharmanarayan, while his brother Gaj Narayan was set up as a tributary ruler in Beltola.Gait E.A. A History of Assam 1926 page 365Choudhury Madhuri Rani Lakshmipriya Devi aru Beltolar Itihash or Rani Lakshmipriya Devi and the history of Beltola 2008 page 65 Gajnarayan was instructed to administer under the supervision of Borphukan, the Ahom viceroy of Lower Assam. Gaj Narayan and his descendants ruled Beltola as a Tributary Chiefs under the Ahom Sovereigns. Treasury records of late Ahom period showed that the rulers of Beltola used to pay 2500 rupees as annual tribute to the Ahom Government.Bhuyan Dr. S.K. Swargadeo Rajeswar Singha 1975 page 246 After the decline of Ahom supremacy and the fall of Ahom Kingdom in Assam, Beltola comes under British rule. After occupation of the Ahom Kingdom, the British divided the erstwhile Ahom kingdom into Mouzas or revenue circle for the purpose of smooth administration. In each Mouza, one Mouzadar was appointed who was entrusted with the task of collecting taxes and administration. The British reduced the status of Beltola from Kingdom to Mouza and that of the ruler from King to Mouzadar, though certain terms were set up in favour of the royal family. Beltola Mouza was specially categorized as Raj Mouza or Principality. The rulers were allowed to retain the title of Raja in their names and the official post of the Mouzadar of Beltola was made hereditary and was reserved for the royal family of Beltola. After independence of India from British rule, the Government of India abolished Zamindari or system of land lords in 1956 CE, due to which the royal family of Beltola lost much of their lands. Then in 1974 CE, the Government of India abolished all the special privileges bestowed to former royal families of India. The royal family of Beltola was also affected by these changes and the rank of Beltola Mouza was demoted from Raj Mouza to that of general category Mouza. The official post of Mouzadar remained with the royal family and till now the post of Mouzadar was held hereditarily by them, though they do not have any power of administration except collecting land taxes for Government of Assam. Extent of Beltola Mouza During the Ahom reign, the kingdom of Beltola extends from the borders of the kingdom of Rani in the west, while in the east it extends to the borders of the kingdom of Mayong and Dimorua. The places named as Rajgarh and Hatigarh in present-day Guwahati city, were the borders between Ahom ruled Guwahati city and the kingdom of Beltola. After the fall of Ahom kingdom and the British occupation of Assam, Beltola lost its status as a kingdom and converted into a Mouza or revenue circle. Under British rule, the size of the Beltola Mouza was much reduced. Presently Beltola Mouza consists of several places of Modern day Guwahati city. Centrally located from Beltola haat or Beltola Bazaar, the Mouza or estate covers the area of Narengi, Birkuchi, Hengrabari, Panjabari, Hatigaon, Bhetapara, Maidam gaon, Rukminigaon, Khanapara, Kahilipara, Ganeshguri and Basistha Mandir. It was said that the Royal residence of the Beltola royal family was in Rukminigaon, while the place where the royal elephants were kept and trained was Hatigaon, literally meaning village of elephants (in Assamese Hati means elephant; gaon means village). Maidam gaon was said to be the place of cremation of the royal family members. The old name of Khanapara was Kainapara. Kaina is a Khasi word, which means elephant, while Para in Khasi language means human settlements or colony. It was said that the ruler of Beltola used to capture elephants and was indulge in the profitable business of selling elephants. It can be assumed that the Khasi people living in that region were indulged in the capturing elephants for the rulers of Beltola, due to which the name Kainapara or later Khanapara came into existence. Birkuchi name comes from the combination of two words, Bir means heroes and Kuchi means camp. It was said that the Koch army of Chilarai use to camp there for some time and thus the place got its name. Koch rulers of Beltola *1. Raja Gaj Narayan Dev (brother of Parikshit Narayan, last ruler of Koch Hajo, brother of Balinarayan, first Koch ruler of Darrang). *2. Raja Shivendra Narayan Dev (Son of Raja Gaj Narayan) *3. Raja Gandharva Narayan Dev (Son of Raja Shivendra Narayan): Raja Gandharva Narayan Dev witnessed the climax of Ahom-Mughal conflict. When he was still a prince, he joined the Ahom forces led by Lachit Borphukan against the invading Mughal forces led by Raja Ram Singh I of Amber and participated in the famous Battle of Saraighat, in which the Ahoms won a decisive victory against the Mughals. After this victory, Lachit Borphukan, after obtaining permission from Ahom king Swargadeo Udayaditya Singha, installed Gandharva Narayan as the king of Beltola.Gait E.A.

Raja Jay Narayan Dev (Son of Raja Dhwaja Narayan Dev) *7. Raja Lambodar Narayan Dev (Son of Raja Jay Narayan Dev): Raja Lambodar Narayan Dev witnessed the fall of Ahom supremacy and the decline of Ahom Kingdom in Assam. The British, after driving the Burmese invaders out of Assam, became the new masters of Brahmaputra valley. In October, 1826 CE, Raja Lombodar Narayan Dev signed an ordinance with the British East India Company, acknowledging their supremacy.Choudhury Madhuri Rani Lakshmipriya Devi aru Beltolar Itihash or Rani Lakshmipriya Devi and the history of Beltola 2008 page 41 Raja Lambodar Narayan Dev married a Manipuri Princess, who was accompanied by a caravan of Manipuri people. These Manipuri people were settled in Beltola, and their settlement was known as Manipuri Basti (not to be confused with Manipuri Basti of present-day Guwahati City. Both places are different). As time passes by, these Manipuri people left Beltola and migrated to other placesChoudhury Madhuri Rani Lakshmipriya Devi aru Beltolar Itihash or Rani Lakshmipriya Devi and the history of Beltola 2008 page 39-41 *8. Raja Lokpal Narayan Dev (Son of Raja Lambodar Narayan Dev): Raja Lokpal Narayan Dev succeeded Raja Lambodar Narayan Dev as the new ruler of Beltola. It was during his reign, the British reduced the status of Beltola from Kingdom to that of a Mouza or revenue circle. The status of the ruler was reduced to that of an official post of Mouzadar, one who collects revenue and administers the Mouza. Yet, some of the terms and conditions were framed in favour of Raja Lokpal Narayan Dev. Beltola Mouza was listed specially in the category of Raj Mouza. The rulers of Beltola were allowed to retain the title of Raja in their names and the official post of Mouzadar would be held hereditarily by the royal family of Beltola. Still communication letters between Raja Lokpal Narayan Dev and the British officials suggested that the Raja Lokpal Narayan Dev was not happy with the treatment meted out by British towards him.Choudhury Madhuri Rani Lakshmipriya Devi aru Beltolar Itihash or Rani Lakshmipriya Devi and the history of Beltola 2008 page 41-42 Raja Lokpal Narayan Dev married Padmavati Devi alias Padumi. She was the daughter of the king of Mayong. The couple had three sons, Amrit Narayan Dev, Chandra Narayan Dev and Lakshmi Narayan Dev. Raja Lokpal Narayan Dev died in 1863 CE. *9. Raja Amrit Narayan Dev (Son of Raja Lokpal Narayan Dev): Raja Amrit Narayan Dev was the elder son of Raja Lokpal Narayan Dev and succeeded his father as the ruler of Beltola. He married Rani Lambeswari Devi, who was a princess of the neighbouring kingdom of Dimorua. The couple was childless. During his reign, due to some irregularity in the payment of revenue by him, the British Government officially reduced the size of the Beltola Mouza.Choudhury Madhuri Rani Lakshmipriya Devi aru Beltolar Itihash or Rani Lakshmipriya Devi and the history of Beltola 2008 page 38 *10. Raja Chandra Narayan Dev (Son of Raja Lokpal Narayan Dev): Raja Chandra Narayan Dev succeeded his elder brother, Raja Amrit Narayan Dev as the ruler of Beltola. Raja Chandra Narayan Dev was not only an efficient ruler but also a shrewd businessman. His business of selling elephants earned him lot of profits. For business purpose he had to visit Calcutta frequently. Therefore, for his convenience in staying there, he constructed a mansion, which was known as Beltola House.Choudhury Madhuri Rani Lakshmipriya Devi aru Beltolar Itihash or Rani Lakshmipriya Devi and the history of Beltola 2008 page 43 He was also active in social activities and in the act of charity. The 1897 Assam earthquake rocked Assam and its neighbouring regions causing massive loss of lives and property. Raja Chandra Narayan Dev extended aid and relief to the earthquake victims and helped them in getting back to their normal lives. In recognition to his valuable services to the earthquake victims, the British Government of India, officially invited him to Delhi for the occasion of King Edward VII coronation as Emperor of India and was awarded a silver medal and a certificate.Choudhury Madhuri Rani Lakshmipriya Devi aru Beltolar Itihash or Rani Lakshmipriya Devi and the history of Beltola 2008 page 45-46 Raja Chandra Narayan Dev had two wives, Ahalya Devi and Giribala Devi, who begotted him two sons and a daughter. Ahalya Devi was the mother of the elder son Rajendra Narayan Dev and a daughter Labanyaprabha Devi, who was later married into the family of Zamindar or Landlord of Rupsi in Dhubri district in Assam. Giribala Devi was the mother of Pabindra Narayan Dev, the second son of Raja Chandra Narayan Dev. Raja Chandra Narayan Dev arranged western education facilities for his sons at Calcutta. Unfortunately, the promising ruler died in 1910 CE, leaving his both sons at minor age. *11. Raja Rajendra Narayan Dev (Son of Raja Chandra Narayan Dev): Raja Rajendra Narayan Dev succeeded his father Raja Chandra Narayan Dev as the new ruler of Beltola. When his father died, Rajendra Narayan Dev was only 10 years of age. Therefore, after approval from Rani Ahalya Devi, the British Government appointed Rai Saheb Chidananda Choudhury to look after the administration of Beltola Mouza till Rajendra Narayan Dev attains adulthood. After completing his college education at Calcutta, Rajendra Narayan Dev joined the newly established Earl Law College at Guwahati, founded by Gyanadaviram Barua, son of noted Assamese writer Gunaviram Burua and maternal grandfather of famous actress of Hindi cinematic world Sharmila Tagore.Choudhury Madhuri Rani Lakshmipriya Devi aru Beltolar Itihash or Rani Lakshmipriya Devi and the history of Beltola 2008 page 47 After completing his law education, as a lawyer, he joined Guwahati High Court and was also associated with Calcutta High Court. In 1923 CE, he was formally bestowed with the responsibilities of Beltola Mouza and became its new ruler as Raja Rajendra Narayan Dev. He married Rani Lakshmipriya Devi, who hailed from a prominent Phukan family of Jorhat. Her father's name was Gadadhar Phukan and noted Assamese poet, writer and social worker, Nilomoni Phukan was her uncle.Choudhury Madhuri Rani Lakshmipriya Devi aru Beltolar Itihash or Rani Lakshmipriya Devi and the history of Beltola 2008 page 17 Raja Rajendra Narayan Dev was associated with many social activities and because of his qualifications as a lawyer, the British Government granted him magisterial power to settle disputes and impart justice to the people of Beltola Mouza. Raja Rajendra Narayan Dev and his brother Pabindra Narayan Dev were members of the football Club, known as Guwahati Town Club and both were known as good football players. In 1933 CE, tragedy struck the royal family, when Pabindra Narayan Dev committed suicide, after killing his wife and his child, at the royal residence of Beltola. After this tragic incident, Raja Rajendra Narayan Dev abandoned the royal residence considering it as inauspicious. Earlier Pabindra Narayan Dev had borrowed a large sum of money as debt from one of his friend putting the royal residence as security, to guarantee the return of amount. After his death, his friend obtained the permission from British Government and put the royal residence and its articles on lease to get his money back. The royal residence got destroyed in the process.Choudhury Madhuri Rani Lakshmipriya Devi aru Beltolar Itihash or Rani Lakshmipriya Devi and the history of Beltola 2008 page 51 In 1937 CE, while on a hunting excursion Raja Rajendra Narayan Dev got hit by bullet accidentally and succumb to his wounds, leaving his wife Rani Lakshmipriya Devi and his three minor children, two sons and one daughter.Choudhury Madhuri Rani Lakshmipriya Devi aru Beltolar Itihash or Rani Lakshmipriya Devi and the history of Beltola 2008 page 49 *12. Rani Lakshmipriya Devi (wife of Raja Rajendra Narayan Dev): Fruits and vegetable market in Historic Beltola Bazaar Rani Lakshmipriya Devi took up the administration of Beltola Mouza in 1937 CE after her husband Raja Rajendra Narayan Dev died suddenly in an accident on a hunting excursion. Since their children, two sons and one daughter were in their minor age, the queen undertook to look after the administration of Beltola Mouza. Due to her efficiency in handling the administration, Rani Lakshmipriya Devi became very popular among the people of Beltola. She actively participated in the welfare programs of the people and performs charity in various religious ceremonies.Choudhury Madhuri Rani Lakshmipriya Devi aru Beltolar Itihash or Rani Lakshmipriya Devi and the history of Beltola 2008 page 19-20 She took utmost care for the educations of her children. Her elder son Kumar Jatindra Narayan Dev, after completion of his college education, was sent to Colorado School of Mines in United States of America. Her second son, Dwijendra Narayan Dev was also a prominent film producer and director.Choudhury Madhuri Rani Lakshmipriya Devi aru Beltolar Itihash or Rani Lakshmipriya Devi and the history of Beltola 2008 page 34 After India's independence in 1947, the power of administration of Beltola Mouza was transferred to the Government of Assam. In 1956 CE, the Government of India abolished the Zamindari or the system of landlords. Due to which the royal family of Beltola lost much of their lands, which were distributed to the landless peasants.Choudhury Madhuri Rani Lakshmipriya Devi aru Beltolar Itihash or Rani Lakshmipriya Devi and the history of Beltola 2008 page 53 In 1974 CE, the Government of India abolished all the special privileges bestowed to former royal families of India.

She also raised her voice for the indigenous Assamese communities of Beltola Mouza, when the population of the local indigenous communities faced the threat for their existence due to the settlement of large number of people from different parts of Assam in Beltola, as the city of Guwahati expands into Beltola Mouza. She also worked to protect the rights of indigenous communities in the historical Beltola Haat or Beltola Bazaar, when some outside business community tried to expel them. It was partly because of her effort that the historical Beltola Haat or Beltola Bazaar still retains the indigenous character of being a meeting point for the people from hills and plains.Choudhury Madhuri Rani Lakshmipriya Devi aru Beltolar Itihash or Rani Lakshmipriya Devi and the history of Beltola 2008 page 24 Rani Lakshmipriya died in 1991, at the age of 80 years.Choudhury Madhuri Rani Lakshmipriya Devi aru Beltolar Itihash or Rani Lakshmipriya Devi and the history of Beltola 2008 page 15 Her daughter Madhuri Choudhury wrote several books on her life and several others on the history of Beltola. The royal family of Beltola still holds the official post of Mouzadar of Beltola Mouza though they do not have any power of administration except collecting land taxes for Government of Assam. Beltola after India‚Äôs independence After India's independence from British rule, Guwahati became the prominent city of Assam, but the Beltola Mouza was still not a part of Guwahati city. Beltola and Guwahati were separate places at that time. In 1973 CE, Sarat Chandra Singha, the then Chief Minister of Assam, decided to shift the capital of Assam from Shillong. A small village named Dispur in Beltola Mouza was selected temporarily as the Capital of Assam. After this decision, all the important government offices were shifted to Dispur. People from different parts of Assam came and settled in and around Dispur, quickly converting a rural area, into a thickly populated region. As the year progressed, the city of Guwahati expanded, and Dispur and Beltola became a part of Greater Guwahati city. Dispur became a permanent seat of the Government of Assam and remained as the Capital. Today Beltola and Guwahati are no longer considered as separate places, but rather part of the same city.

This auk breeds on islands off California and Mexico. It is threatened by predators introduced to its breeding colonies and by oil spills. This species and the Guadalupe murrelet were considered conspecific and were known collectively as Xantus's murrelet until 2012. The two species are now considered distinct based on a lack of evidence of interbreeding at a shared nesting colony on the San Benito Islands, differences in facial pattern and bill shape, and differences in vocalizatons and genetics. Description and range This species is a small black and white auk with a small head and thin sharp bill. It resembles the closely related Craveri's murrelet, with which it shares the distinction of being the most southerly living of all the auk species. It breeds on islands in the Channel Islands of California, the largest colonies being on the Coronado Islands and on Santa Barbara Island, and also several islands off Baja California, including Isla Guadalupe. After the breeding season it disperses north at sea, usually to offshore waters, as far as British Columbia. Behavior Scripps's murrelet chicks leave the nest for the ocean at just two days old. Scripps's murrelet feeds at sea (but on average not as far from land as Guadalupe murrelet), often in association with large pelagic predatory fish like tuna, on larval fish like anchovies, sardines and Sebastes rockfish. Like all auks it is a wing-propelled diver, chasing down prey under the water with powerful wingbeats. There is some speculation that it may feed cooperatively in pairs, as it is almost always observed in pairs, even during the non-breeding season. It flies well, and can take off without taxiing. It nests in loose scattered colonies on arid islands, typically in small crevices and caves and under dense bushes. It returns to the colony only at night, laying two eggs which are incubated for about a month. As in other synthliboramphine murrelet species (e.g. the ancient murrelet) the chicks are highly precocial, leaving the nest within two days of hatching and running actively towards the sea, where the parents call to them. Once at sea the family swims to offshore waters. Little is known about their time at sea due to difficulties in studying them in this habitat. A female shot at Isla Guadalupe at the end of June was moulting its primary remiges (flight feathers) and unable to fly. Status and conservation By the end of the 20th century, the Xantus's murrelet complex was considered to be among the most endangered species of auk.IUCN Redlist (1988, 1994, 2000) This has changed since, but not because the present species' status has improved, but because other auks have become rarer. Scripps's murrelet is mainly threatened by oil spills, as much of its population lives near the busy shipping lanes connecting Los Angeles to other ports. Because a large part of its small population nests in such a small area, a single catastrophic oil spill could have far reaching implications. It is also threatened by introduced species such as rats and feral cats; this threat has been lessened lately by efforts to restore its habitat by removing introduced predators. In 2001 and 2002, Island Conservation, the Channel Islands National Park, California Department of Fish and Game, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, and the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration removed invasive rats from Anacapa Island. This effort was paid for by a trust fund from an oil spill settlement. References Further reading *Drost, C.A. & Lewis, D.B. (1995): Xantus's Murrelet (Synthliboramphus hypoleucus).

The program is supported by a multi-donor trust fund with paid-up capital of USD $165 million (as of 30 April 2012) for development interventions in 49 Least Developed Countries (LDCs). The EIF is being promoted by the World Trade Organization (WTO) and Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) as the preferred way to provide official development assistance to LDC's as part of the global Aid for Trade Initiative.Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development, 2011, \\"Aid for Trade and LDCs: Starting to Show Results\\", Paris. Available at www.oecd.org/aidfortrade/49015161.pdf History The idea of the predecessor program, the IF, was first discussed at the First Ministerial Conference of the WTO in Singapore in December 1996.Stephen Browne and Sam Laird, 2011, \\"The International Trade Centre: Export Impact for Good, Routledge\\", page 26 It was subsequently launched in October 1997 at the WTO's High Level Meeting on Integrated Initiatives for Least-Developed Countries' Trade Development, which was held at the WTO. It was meant as a mechanism to increase effectiveness and efficiency of trade-related technical assistance to LDCs by improving coordination between donors, beneficiary countries and providers of technical assistance. The calls for an overarching program arose from the feeling that the uncoordinated actions of these parties lead to duplication of efforts, overallocation of resources to certain technical and geographical areas, and an untapped potential for joint initiatives and information exchange. By some, the IF is regarded as a failed program because the responsiveness of the involved parties (LDCs, development agencies, and donors) was much smaller than had been expected.Apart from the article by Susan Prowse, see, for example, United Nations Industrial Development Organization (UNIDO), 2007, \\"A Practical Contribution to Aid for Trade\\", Vienna, or Gideon Rabinowitz, 2008, \\"Trade, Poverty Reduction and the Integrated Framework: Are we asking the right people the right questions?\\", CUTS CITEE Working Paper 02/2008, and United Nations Office of the High Representative of the Least Developed Countries, Landlocked Developing Countries and Small Island Developing States, 2008, \\"LDC Briefing Book\\", Chapter 12, New York Susan Prowse from the UK's Overseas Development Institute, for example, points out that LDCs and donors had different perceptions and expectations about the purpose of the IF: While LDCs expected it to be mainly a vehicle to mobilize more financial resources for development interventions, donors sought to create a mechanism to improve co-ordination. Prowse, as others, also mentions that the main flaw of the IF lay in its design, meaning, that the assistance that was channeled through the IF was not aligned to a country's overall development strategy.Susan Prowse, 2010, \\"Aid for Trade: Supporting Trade: Preference Reform\\", Centre for Global Development Working Paper 224. Available at: http://www.cgdev.org/content/publications/detail/1424468/ As a consequence of the limited impact that the IF had achieved during the initial program period, the Development Committee of the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank agreed at its meeting in 2005 to restructure the program and endow it with additional resources. A Task Force for the Enhanced Integrated Framework was subsequently created by the Steering Committee of the IF, which, on 29 June 2006 published its recommendationsODI Conference on 24 May 2007, \\"Aid for trade: One year on. How much, for whom and the institutional challenges?\\", Supporting material. Available at http://www.odi.org.uk/events/details.asp?id=197&title;=aid-trade-one-year- much-whom-institutional-challenges for changing the existing strategy and implementation modalities. The revamped programme, then officially called Enhanced Integrated Framework, was launched on 1 January 2007Stephen Browne and Sam Laird, 2011, \\"The International Trade Centre: Export Impact for Good\\", Routledge, page 27 and began to be fully operational in 2010.Bernard Hoekman, 2011, \\"Aid for Trade: Why, what, and where are we?\\", in: United Nations Economic and Social Commission for Asia and the Pacific (ed.), 2011, \\"Trade beyond Doha: Prospects for Asia-Pacific Least Developed Countries\\", Studies in Trade and Investment 76, Bangkok, page 98 Other similar programs include the World Bank's Trade Facilitation Facility and the WTO's Standards and Trade Development Facility.  Events  = The Global Forum on Inclusive Trade for Least Developed Countries = In 2018, the EIF Secretariat hosted the inaugural Global Forum on Inclusive Trade for Least Developed Countries.  Trade for Development News  The EIF has an in-house news platform called Trade for Development News, which shares stories on topics ranging from ecommerce to trade facilitation from the EIF and partner agencies, as well as the broader Trade for Development and Aid for Trade spheres. Governance structure Several bodies on the global and the national levels form the institutional framework of EIF program.For information about the different governance bodies, see: Atul Kauschik, 2010, \\"Reassessing Scope and Mandate of the Enhanced Integrated Framework: A Legal/ Technical Study\\", Deutsche Gesellschaft f√ºr technische Zusammenarbeit (GTZ), Eschborn, or UNOHRLLS, 2008, LDC Briefing Book, Chapter 12, Washington, and the overview presented by the WTO on http://www.wto.org/english/tratop_e/devel_e/teccop_e/if_e.htm. =Global governance bodies= The EIF Steering Committee is the highest level body of the EIF and responsible for setting the overall policy direction of the programme, reviewing its effectiveness and ensuring transparency. It is composed of representatives from each of the participating LDCs, the donor countries and agencies, the six core agencies, the EIF Executive Secretariat and the EIF Trust Fund Manager ex officio. The Steering Committee meets at least twice a year. The EIF Board is responsible for managing the programme and taking key operational decisions. It thereby implements the EIF Steering Committee's policies, which it reports to. It is made up of three LDC representatives, three donor representatives and one representative each from the core agencies, the EIF Executive Secretariat and the EIF Trust Fund Manager. The EIF Board decides over funding decisions under the EIF Trust Fund and monitors, reviews and evaluates country-specific progress and operations. The EIF Executive Secretariat carries out the day-to-day operations of the programme in collaboration with the EIF Trust Fund Manager and the National EIF Focal Points. It was established on 1 October 2008 with Dorothy Tembo as its executive director.US Federal News Service, \\"Enhanced Integrated Framework establishes Executive Secretariat, Welcomes Executive Director\\", 13 October 2010, Washington The EIF Executive Secretariat is based at WTO headquarters and reports to the EIF Board as well as to the Director-General of the WTO. The EIF Trust Fund Manager manages the financial contributions made by donors to the EIF Trust Fund. The United Nations Office for Project Services (UNOPS) has been designated for this role and the UNOPS in Switzerland is acting as the executing office.See the statement on the website of UNOPS in Switzerland: http://www.unops.org/english/whatwedo/Locations/Europe/Pages/SwitzerlandOperationsCentre%28SWOC%29.aspx =Country-level governance bodies= The below governance bodies, which are either being established or already operational within the participating LDCs, are as a whole called National Implementation Arrangement (NIA). Each LDC has a National EIF Focal Point who coordinates the EIF process in the country. He or she is appointed by and based in the LDC. Usually, only senior government officials get appointed. The EIF Focal Point is in direct contact with the EIF Executive Secretariat and is supported by a National Implementation Unit. The National Implementation Unit supports the National EIF Focal Point in coordinating and monitoring the implementation of projects funded under the EIF. The EIF Donor Facilitator is responsible for facilitating, jointly with the EIF National Focal Point, donor coordination and the dialogue between donors and the LDC's government on trade issues and development interventions. He or she plays an important role in ensuring that interventions are aligned to a country's overall development priorities, according to one of the five principles of the 2005 Paris Declaration on Aid Effectiveness. The EIF Donor Facilitator is a representative from the donor community and is identified by the government and other donors. The EIF National Steering Committee represents a national dialogue forum among different public and private stakeholders in trade and development. It is composed of government officials, private sector associations, civil society representatives and the donor community and takes high-level decisions on the national EIF process. Functioning The EIF is designed in such a way that its overall objective of making trade a driver for LDCs' development is pursued through three areas of activities: * Mainstreaming trade into national development strategies * Setting up new structures or strengthen existing institutions needed to coordinate the delivery of trade-related technical assistance * Building capacity to trade, which also includes addressing critical supply‚Äëside constraints. The EIF programme works with six core partner agencies, which are responsible for jointly delivering development assistance in these three areas (see below). An LDC is, in principle, in of the following three stages: Pre- DTIS phase, DTIS phase, implementation phase.The United Nations Office for Project Services identifies only two phases, namely, \\"Tier 1\\" and \\"Tier 2\\", which reflects the different funding options from the EIF Trust Fund. However, an LDC can receive assistance through the EIF even before the release of funds by the Trust Fund. This assistance is, indeed, crucial because the in-country institutional framework is being built up during that phase. Moreover, the pre-DTIS phase is also being funded by Tier 1 funds and could be regarded as a sub-stage. For the UNOPS position see http://www.unops.org/english/whatwedo/UNOPSinaction/Pages/Enhanced-Integrated- Framework.aspx . ITC on the hand does support the distinction into three stages. See, for example, ITC, 2006, \\"Enhanced Integrated Framework\\" Serves as Model for Aid for Trade\\", International Trade Forum 3/2006, Geneva. For another global overview of the different stages and funding options see, for example, Atul Kaushik, 2010, Reassessing Scope and Mandate of the Enhanced Integrated Framework: A Legal/ Technical Study, Chapter 2, Gesellschaft f√ºr technische Zusammenarbeit (GTZ), Eschborn, and the overview by the WTO at http://www.wto.org/english/tratop_e/devel_e/teccop_e/if_e.htm =Pre-DTIS stage= In this stage, a country requests membership in the programme. This step has become superfluous since all current LDCs are EIF member countries. Once the request has been reviewed and approved by the EIF Board, the LDC sets up a national EIF structure as outlined above. An important element of this step is to build up in-country support for the trade and development agenda through stakeholder outreach, advocacy and awareness-raising. LDCs in this stage can benefit from so-called pre-DTIS funds of up to US$50,000 to build the in-country institutional infrastructure needed for the next stages. =DTIS and Action Matrix stage= Once the institutional set-up is operational, an LDC can engage, in collaboration with one or more of the six core partner agencies, to conduct a Diagnostic Trade Integration Study (DTIS). The DTIS is a comprehensive analysis of an LDC's economic and trade environment and aims at identifying constraints to competitiveness, supply chain weaknesses and sectors of greatest growth and/or export potential. Each DTIS contains an Action Matrix which outlines priority reforms to be conducted in a certain order to alleviate most binding constraints to greater trade competitiveness. A beneficiary country may request funds of up to USD400,000 to finance the production of a DTIS, or up to USD200,000 for the update of an existing DTIS. =Implementation stage= Strengthening of in-country EIF institutions During the implementation stage, an LDC undertakes concrete steps towards integrating trade into its national development strategy and identifying funding for key priorities. The NIA plays a crucial supporting role for it provides a forum for dialogue and exchange between the LDC's policymakers, the private sector, and development partners that provide advisory services. The LDC can utilize co-called Tier 1 funding and/or seek bilateral donor support to strengthen its NIA through capacity building projects of up to five years. Building supply side capacities The LDC also implements the priority projects of the Action Matrix during this stage by elaborating individual development interventions for each of the reforms mentioned in the Matrix. The EIF Trust Fund provides so-called Tier 2 funds for priority small-scale projects to build up trade related and supply-side capacities. However, the bulk of the funding should be sought from bilateral donor support. Involved organizations and countries Six core agencies are responsible for providing trade-related technical assistance to the participating LDCs and help them attaining the EIF's overall objective: IMF, World Bank, International Trade Centre, United Nations Development Program, United Nations Conference on Trade and Development, WTO. United Nations Industrial Development Organization is currently an observer agency.See ODI Conference on 24 May 2007, \\"Aid for trade: One year on.

The album contains songs from Hybrid's previous studio albums and also contains a cover of \\"Enjoy the Silence\\", originally by Depeche Mode. The cover was a result of a fan poll, where fans could suggest songs for Hybrid to cover. The album was originally due for autumn 2011, but ended up being delayed until 30 July 2012. The album was released, both as a standard CD, as well as a 4-disc box set, which contains previously unreleased material. The box set was originally limited to 300 copies, however the number was increased to 500. The deluxe edition saw a digital download release on 7 September 2012, due to public demand. A 5th disc was only made available to the first 40 orders of the deluxe edition, and then later given away. Overview The album contains songs taken from Hybrid's previous albums. \\"Finished Symphony\\" and \\"If I Survive\\" appeared on Hybrid's debut album Wide Angle. The songs were very popular around the time of release and have since been played, and highly favored, by several DJs, as well as appearing in several commercials and TV shows. Most notably, \\"Finished Symphony\\" appeared in the British television show Top Gear. \\"If I Survive\\" features Julee Cruise on the vocals and still remains one of Hybrid's most well known works. Both tracks have strings provided by the Russian Federal Orchestra. The album was made with the original third member, Lee Mullen, who has since left the group. The deluxe edition features orchestral and instrumental versions of several tracks from \\"Wide Angle\\" as well as an unreleased remix of \\"If I Survive\\" which featured Charlotte James on vocals. \\"True to Form\\" and \\"Higher Than A Skyscraper\\" both appeared on Hybrid's second album Morning Sci-Fi. Both tracks feature Peter Hook, previously a member of New Order, who played on bass for three hours during the sessions. Some of Hook's contributions would later be reconstructed and reused on I Choose Noise. The strings for both tracks were provided by The Hermitage Orchestra, conducted by Andrew Skeet. The version of \\"True To Form\\" that appears on this album however is the Acoustic Mix, which combines the Acoustic Version, previously released on the \\"True To Form\\" single and the Soundtrack Edit, which is also featured on the deluxe edition. The deluxe edition features an instrumental version of \\"True To Form\\", as well as an orchestral version of \\"Blackout\\", which originally featured Kirsty Hawkshaw on vocals. Hybrid's third album I Choose Noise is represented by \\"Dogstar\\", \\"Keep It In The Family\\" and \\"Just For Today\\". \\"Dogstar\\" features Perry Farrell on the vocals and the track was later re-recorded as part of Perry Farrell's Satellite Party project, which coincidentally also featured a re-recording of \\"Dream Stalker\\", also taken from \\"I Choose Noise\\". The entire album was a collaboration with noted film composer Harry Gregson-Williams and fellow film composer Stephen Barton. Previously, Hybrid and Harry Gregson-Williams collaborated on film scores for Man on Fire and Domino. Though Harry Gregson-Williams would only make a small appearance on Hybrid's next album, they would continuously collaborate for several film scores, such as The Chronicles of Narnia: Prince Caspian, Unstoppable, X-Men Origins: Wolverine, and the Total Recall remake. John Graham, who makes music under the name 'Quivver,' also contributed vocals to two songs: \\"Choke\\" and \\"Until Tomorrow,\\" though only the instrumentals make an appearance on disc 3. Hybrid's fourth album Disappear Here is represented by \\"Formula of Fear\\", \\"Disappear Here\\" and \\"Break My Soul.\\" The album was the first to feature a new third member, Charlotte James, who became the new female lead of the group, during the recording of the album. The strings were provided by The City of Prague Philharmonic Orchestra, conducted by Andrew Skeet once again. Like before, the deluxe edition features orchestral editions of several tracks. Some of those tracks feature Tim Hutton, who previously played alongside Ian Brown and The Prodigy and also played instruments on previous Hybrid albums. The deluxe edition features several items of unreleased and rare material. Among the tracks are several that were purely made for advertising agencies. Among them are the track \\"Orbit,\\" which was later reworked into \\"Awesome\\" as part of \\"Perry Farrell's Satellite Party\\". Several of these tracks also made an appearance in TV shows, such as \\"Mr. Smith\\", which infamously appeared in Top Gear. A few unreleased remixes are also included, such as the Shifter & Carvel remix of $50 Pistol, which originally appeared on the compilation album Soundsystem_01. The original track was originally a remix of \\"Humvee Chase,\\" previously made for D√©j√° Vu, however it was later remade into \\"Empire\\" and eventually appeared on the \\"Disappear Here\\" album. Several alternate versions of previously released songs were included, such as \\"Sea Chase\\" (a soundtrack edit of \\"Break My Soul\\"), and \\"Bound and Gagged\\" (a rework of \\"Falling Down\\"). A surprise inclusion is also the track \\"Experiment IV,\\" a cover of the Kate Bush song of the same name. The track was recorded during the \\"Wide Angle\\" era and was previously only available on a rare promotional CD, named \\"Views From Wide Angle\\". Among other songs are \\"Lights Go Down Knives Come Out\\" and \\"Everything Is Brand New.\\" Both songs appeared on Morning-Sci-Fi and I Choose Noise respectively, though they were only accessible by rewinding the CDs from the very first tracks. Initial copies mistakenly excluded \\"Orbit\\" (which is presented in its full 5 minute length), prompting Distinct'ive to delay shipping of the box sets. The fifth disc contains special and previously unreleased versions of tracks, such as \\"Disappear Here\\" and \\"Original Sin\\", though some of the material has been released in the past. The CD is mixed, which could explain the appearance of tracks, such as \\"$50 Pistol.\\" It was originally intended to be released with the first 40 orders, with an additional 10 being given away randomly, however Distinct'ive made the fifth disc available to download for people who ordered it, due to continuous shipping delays.

It controls the release of Yersinia outer proteins (Yops) which help Yersinia evade the immune system. More specifically, it interacts with the bacterial protein YopN via hydrophobic residues located on the helices. Function This protein domain is involved in the control of Yop release. This helps it to evade the host's immune system. Yersinia spp. do this by injecting the effector Yersinia outer proteins (Yops) into the target cell. Also involved in Yop secretion are YopN and LcrG. TyeA is also required for translocation of YopE and YopH. TyeA interacts with YopN and with YopD, a component of the translocation apparatus. This shows the complex which recognizes eukaryotic cells and controls Yop secretion is also actively involved in translocation. Localisation Like YopN, TyeA is localized at the bacterial surface. Structure The structure of TyeA is composed of two pairs of parallel alpha-helices. Mechanism Association of TyeA with the C terminus of YopN is accompanied by conformational changes in both polypeptides that create order out of disorder: the resulting structure then serves as an impediment to type III secretion of YopN.

Plot summary In the story, the narrator recounts to an old flame a date they once had, whilst her husband was away, where they visited a friend, Pal Palych, in the country. From the very beginning, it is revealed that the narrator is an aesthetic individual, prone to epiphanies. For him, the world seems \\"homogonous, congruent, bound by the laws of harmony\\". Whereas the narrator is prone to communicate his epiphanies in the language of sound, the woman is \\"habitually untalkative\\". When the narrator must venture back to Palych's house to retrieve his date's cigarette- holder, he finds his friend bleary eyed and suggests that he get outside more. Towards the end, the woman tells the narrator that she'd leave her husband to be with him. The reader by now already suspects that something is up, as the narrator has revealed that he loves not only her, but the entire world: \\"it was not you alone who were my lover but the entire earth\\". In the end, the narrator rides his bicycle home, stopping along the way to sit on a park bench where he notices a woman he plans to talk to, as well as seeing Palych fishing.

The protests spanned 1‚Äì3 July 2012, and drew thousands of participants. Police were dispatched to break up the demonstrations, and reportedly shot tear gas and stun grenades into the crowd. Chinese authorities said some protesters has stormed a government building and smashed vehicles.Brian Spegele, Quiet returns to once restive Shifang, The Wall Street Journal, 4 July 2012. Images and video of the protest circulated on the microblogs and social networking websites throughout China, some showing the protesters‚Äîmany of them students‚Äîbadly beaten. The protests ended late on 3 July when the local government announced that it had terminated construction of the metals plant and released all but six protesters who had been taken into custody.Caixin Online, Timeline of Shifang Protests, 5 July 2012. The protest was notable for its size and the composition of its participants, as well as for its success in derailing the copper plant project.Stanley Lubman, China‚Äôs Young and Restless Could Test Legal System, The Wall Street Journal, 16 July 2012. It was one of a growing number of large-scale environmental protests in China that achieved success.Keith Bradsher, Bolder Protests Against Pollution Win Project‚Äôs Defeat in China, The New York Times, 4 July 2012. Background The Shifang city area was among the most severely impacted by the 2008 Sichuan earthquake, suffering heavy loss of life and major damage to infrastructure. The centerpiece of the city's economic revitalization efforts was to be the Sichuan Hongda Co.'s copper smelting plant. The plant was to be one of the largest in the world, and its construction was intended to spur economic growth through the creation of thousands of jobs. China's Ministry of Environmental Protection said the $1.7 billion plant would refine 40,000 tons of molybdenum and 400,000 tons of copper annually.Mark McDonald, A Violent New Tremor in China's Heartland, The New York Times, 4 July 2012Andrew Jacobs, In China, Wait Leads to Standoff With Officials, The New York Times, 17 July 2012. Copper smelting and refining processes can produce a variety of toxic byproducts, including mercury, sulphur dioxide, and arsenic. Residents feared these pollutants would seep into the city's air and water supply.Ben Blanchard, China pollution protest ends, but suspicion of government high, Reuters, 8 July 2012. Critics further charged that the government had not been transparent in reviewing or disclosing information on the plant's potential environmental impact. Ma Jun, director of the Institute of Public and Environmental Affairs, told The Guardian that the government \\"only released the short version of the plant's environmental report, which did not have information about the solid waste and waste water.\\" Ma added: \\"Heavy metal projects are always highly polluting. Of course the public has concerns about this.\\"Tania Branigan, Anti-pollution protesters halt construction of copper plant in China, The Guardian, 3 July 2012. Residents of the city had reportedly filed petitions against the project, but authorities took no action. Reuters reported that although many local residents supported the efforts to create jobs, they were upset by the government's lack of consultation with the public and failure to adequately address environmental concerns. Protests Construction on the Sichuan Hongda copper refinery began on 29 June with the company laying the foundation for the plant. Two days later, on 1 July, hundreds of student protesters assembled in front of municipal government buildings to protest the project. Protests grew on 2 and 3 July as thousands more citizens‚Äîincluding students from nearby Guanghan city‚Äîdemonstrated on the streets and in front of government offices demanding the suspension of the project. Protesters carried banners with slogans such as \\"Unite to protect the environment for the next generation\\" and \\"Safeguard our hometown, oppose the chemical factory's construction.\\" The South China Morning Post reported that the protest swelled to have tens of thousands of participants. Authorities and state-run media reported that the protests turned violent, with demonstrators overturning police vehicles and throwing bricks at government buildings. Police were dispatched to quell the protests, firing tear gas and stun grenades into the crowd, and detaining 27 protesters. Images and video circulated online showing protesters bloodied and beaten, and police carrying batons and lobbing tear gas into the crowds. Witnesses told the South China Morning Post that about 8,000 police were stationed along major roads, and that the security officers had used force to disperse the protests. The local government announced on the morning of 3 July that the copper plant construction would be suspended. Protests continued into the evening, with demonstrators demanding the release of the detained protesters, most of whom were students.Shi Jiangtao, Factory axed as Shifang heeds protesters' calls , South China Morning Post, 4 July 2012. Late in the evening of 3 July, authorities released 21 of the 27 detained protesters.Reuters, Chinese anti-pollution protesters freed as state bows to public outcry, 4 July 2012 Protests subsided, though six remained in custody facing criminal and administrative charges for their role in the demonstrations. Public demonstrations were briefly revived on 9 July amidst unverified rumors that a 14-year-old girl had been beaten to death during the protests.Shi Jiangtao, Rumours fuel new protests in Shifang, South China Morning Post, 9 July 2012. However, authorities consistently refuted reports of casualties or mass bloodshed, saying that only a few residents and police officers were injured. Local authorities also said that police had \\"exercised great restraint\\" in their handling of the protest. =Aftermath= Two months after the protests in Shifang, residents told the New York Times that there were no signs that the Sichuan Hongda project was being resuscitated, and that the city had been quiet since the demonstrations concluded.Keith Bradsher, Hong Kong Retreats on 'National Education' Plan, The New York Times, 9 September 2012. An executive with Sichuan Hongda told Caijing magazine on July 9 that it was unclear whether the construction for copper plant would go forward in the future, and whether it would be located in Sichuan province.Zuo Lin and Li Wei'ao, Doubts Remain as Shifang Protests Subside, Caijing, 17 July 2012. After the demonstrations, authorities were left to grapple with providing housing and compensation to approximately 2,300 villagers whose land had been requisitioned to make room for the copper plant. Villagers from Hongmiao and Jinguang, Shifang, reportedly received eviction notices in November 2011 and saw their homes demolished the following month. As of July 2012, they had yet to receive promised compensation from the government. During a Communist Party committee meeting on 25 October 2012, authorities in Shifang decided to replace the local party secretary, Li Chengjin. His position was assumed by former mayor Li Zhuo.South China Morning Post, Shifang party boss axed after pollution protest, 30 October 2012. Significance =Role of students= The Shifang protests were notable in part due to the composition of the demonstration, which was largely led and organized by young students. Although China experiences tens of thousands of large-scale protests annually, student involvement in anti-government protests has been rare since the 1989 Tiananmen Square Protests.Phelim Kine, Chinese Government's Oppressive Policies Draw Ire from the Public, Human Rights Watch, 3 August 2012. Leslie Hook of the Financial Times wrote that the protests \\"revealed a potentially important shift in the country's politics: youth were at the forefront of the three-day demonstration, exposing a new vein of activism in a generation seen by many as apathetic.\\" Environmental causes and land rights issues seemed particularly attractive to the \\"post 90s\\" generation, she wrote.Leslie Hook, China's post-90 generation make their mark, The Financial Times, 9 July 2012. Stanley Lubman wrote for the Wall Street Journal that \\"the protests may augur both a growing public anger over environmental degradation and a rise of political activism among China's younger generation ‚Äì trends that could lead in turn to an increase in legal challenges to the arbitrary behavior of local governments.\\" Chinese blogger Michael Anti explained the shift by saying that the generation born after 1990 is \\"the generation of social media so they embrace freedom of speech as their birthright.\\" Alarmed by the participation of students in the demonstration, the state-run Global Times newspaper ran an editorial on 6 July titled \\"Do not foment youngsters to protest.\\" The editorial exhorted young people to stay out of mass protests and political conflicts, and chastised adults who encouraged such behavior: \\"In every normal peaceful country, high school students should focus on school work. It is a revolutionary instinct to urge young students to join a mass protest...It is immoral for adults to exploit the young for political ends.\\"The Global Times, Do not foment youngsters to protest, 6 July 2012. The editorial was met with some derision on Chinese social media websites; one netizen responded by drawing attention to images of young school children being organized to participate in political rallies supporting the ruling Communist Party.China Digital Times, No More Politics, Get Back to Studying, 10 July 2012. =Importance of social media= As the Shifang protest unfolded, government- run media outlets were largely silent in covering developments in the city. On 3 July, for instance, the official media outlets People's Daily and Xinhua News Agency carried minimal reports on either the protests or the local government's promise to halt construction of the copper smelting plant. Social media platforms and text messaging thus became the primary means by which information on the protests were shared. According to the University of Hong Kong's China Media Project, between 1 and 4 July, \\"there were around 5.25 million posts on Sina Weibo containing 'Shifang'. Of these about 400,000 included images and close to 10,000 included video.\\"Qian Gang, China‚Äôs malformed media sphere, University of Hong Kong, China Media Project, 11 July 2012. The protests gave rise a popular internet meme based on a photograph of a shield and baton-wielding police officer, identified as Liu Bo, chasing a group of young protesters. Liu's image was photoshopped into other scenes, depicting him chasing after actor Mark Wahlberg and Olympic hurdler Liu Xiang, or appearing in the background of Edvard Munch's The Scream.Liz Carter, Meme Watch: China‚Äôs ‚ÄúFat Police Officer‚Äù Terrorizes Everything , Tea Leaf Nation, 6 July 2012.Paul Mozur, Is This Guy the Chinese Version of Pepper Spraying Cop?, Wall Street Journal, 9 July 2012. The Atlantic's Jessica Levine wrote that the image was \\"representative of a growing resentment toward alleged abuses by the People's Armed Police,\\" noting that such memes can serve as a barometer of culture in an environment where freedom of speech is limited. \\"Because of the strictures on speech in China, memes tend to be a really effective way to spread a political message,\\" said social media expert and blogger An Xiao Mina. \\"If you use off-the-cuff, remixed humor, it's a little easier to talk about such critical topics.\\"Jessica Levine, Photoshopping Dissent: Circumventing China's Censors With Internet Memes, The Atlantic, 4 September 2012.

It is an example of Speculum literature. Also known as the \\"Book of Marvels\\", it primarily concerns the three fields of history, geography, and physics, but its credibility has been questioned by numerous scholars including philosopher Gottfried Leibniz, who was alerted to the fact that it contains many mythological stories. Its manner of writing is perhaps because the work was written to provide entertainment to Holy Roman Emperor Otto IV. However, many scholars consider it a very important work in that it \\"recognizes the correctness of the papal claims in the conflict between Church and Empire.\\" It was written between 1210 and 1214, although some give the dates as between 1209 and 1214 and numerous authors state it was published c.1211. Background Though of English origin, Gervase was brought up in Rome. He travelled widely, took religious orders, studied and taught canon law at Bologna, was in Venice in 1177, and at the reconciliation of Pope Alexander III and Frederick Barbarossa. He spent some time in the service of Henry II of England, and of his son, \\"Henry the Young King\\". For the latter, he composed a Liber facetiarum (‚ÄòBook of entertainment‚Äô), now lost, as well as the basis for what would become the Otia Imperialia. After 1189, Gervase moved to the court of the Otto of Brunswick, a grandson of Henry II and after 1198 one of the two rival kings of the Holy Roman Empire. Gervase accompanied Otto to Rome in 1209 for his imperial coronation and was enmeshed in the papacy's struggle with his patron Otto, who was excommunicated by Pope Innocent III. Gervase employed the next years, from 1210 to 1214, writing the Otia Imperialia for his patron. The Otia was written at a time when other encyclopedic descriptions of the world were being produced and translated, such as the Summarium Heinrici, the Hortus deliciarum (Herrad of Landsberg), the Liber exceptionum (Richard de Saint- Victor, Jean Ch√¢tillon), the De proprietatibus rerum (Bartholomeus Anglicus), and the Speculum naturale (Vincent of Beauvais). Content Gervase's Otia imperialia is an encyclopedic work concerning history, geography, physics, and folklore, in the manner of speculum literature. It is sometimes associated with the Ebstorf Map, to the extent that some claim the map was meant to accompany the text, but this is a subject of continued debate. The text is divided into three parts (decisiones). The first is a history of the world from the Creation to the Flood. The second is a geographic treatise on the regions of the known world, as divided between Noah‚Äôs three sons. The third section, parts of which have been reprinted separately from the rest of the book, is a compendium of marvels. Like Honorius of Autun‚Äôs Imago mundi and Vincent of Beauvais‚Äôs Speculum naturale, the Otia imperialia contains fables attributed to Pliny the Elder and Solinus, as well as other tales and folk beliefs, including the Fairy Horn, a Gloucester variety of the widespread fairy cup legend; the supernatural powers of Virgil; the folk belief that a priest's cloak could be viewed as an element pitting good Christians against the Devil; and the first recorded instance of the Wandlebury Legend, which Gervase summarizes as follows: > In England, on the borders of the diocese of Ely, there is a town called > Cantabrica, just outside which is a place known as Wandlebria, from the fact > that the Wandeli, when ravaging Britain and savagely putting to death the > Christians, placed their camp there. Now, on the hill-top where they pitched > their tents, is a level space ringed with entrenchments with a single point > of entry, like a gate. A very ancient legend exists, preserved in popular > tradition, that if a warrior enters this level space at dead of night by > moonlight and calls out 'Knight to knight, come forth', he will at once be > faced by a warrior armed for fight, who charging horse against horse, will > either dismount his adversary or himself be dismounted. Gervase recounts that a knight named Osbert Fitz Hugh once tested the story, and legend has it that he defeated the phantom knight, even stealing his horse as a prize, but was wounded in the thigh by his opponent‚Äôs javelin on departing. Some legends are found only in the Otia imperialia, including two later included in Thomas Keightley‚Äôs influential The Fairy Mythology. One describes the ‚Äúneptunes‚Äù or ‚Äúportunes,‚Äù diminutive humanoids found in France and England, which help peasants finish their domestic chores, but also delight in leading English travellers‚Äô horses into mud. Another is the Grant, a creature of English legend which resembles ‚Äúa yearling colt, prancing on its hind-legs‚Äù and which runs through towns to warn of impending fire. This belief persisted well into the 20th century around Cambridgeshire, albeit applied to hares. Reception During the following three centuries, it was much read, and it was twice translated into French: by Jean d'Antioche in the 13th and Jean de Vignay in the 14th century. Gottfried Leibniz, who edited parts of it,In his Scriptores rerum Brunsvicensium, vol. I (Hanover, 1710). called it a \\"bagful of foolish old woman's tales\\", while its modern Oxford University Press editors less dismissively report \\"a wealth of accounts of folklore and popular belief\\". Catholic apologists respect it most of all for the support it offers of Innocent's papal claims in his conflicts between Church and Empire.Catholic Encyclopedia, s.v. \\"Gervase of Tilbury\\". Portions of it were printed in Historiie Francorum Scriptores (Andr√© Duchesne, 1641), and by Joachim Johann Mader (1673). Large portions were published in Scriptores Rerum Brunsvicensium (G. G. Leibnitz, 1707‚Äì10). The third part of Otia was edited by Felix Liebrecht and published by Carl R√ºmpler (1856). References Further reading * T.B.

Met with indifference by the contemporary critics, later it came to be regarded as a classic of the Russian theatre. Yakov Protazanov directed a cinematic adaptation, Without a Dowry, which was released in 1937, and Eldar Ryazanov also adapted it into a popular 1984 film. Synopsis In Bryakhimov, a \\"large city on the bank of the Volga River\\", after a hard, desperate year and devastated by the abrupt (and unexplained) end of her romance with a rich man (Paratov) with whom she was in love and almost worshipped, Larisa decides to marry the first man who approaches her. Karandyshev is a silly, obnoxious and vain person, but Larisa doesn't much care about that, wishing only to get away from it all and to live in the country. Suddenly, Paratov arrives and causes a stir both in the local community and in the girl's heart. It turns out he's about to marry a rich woman and now enjoys his last bachelor spree, selling ships he owns to get money to burn. He finds out Larisa still loves him and realizes that his own feelings for her are also still strong. Karandyshev, just to show off, throws a party, inviting among others a young man Vozhevatov (Larisa's childhood friend), local millionaire Knurov (who'd earlier told Larisa's mother he'd be willing to become her daughter's 'sponsor' and take her to Paris should she feel inclined that way; the mother is quite receptive to the offer) and Paratov himself. Paratov, to punish Karandyshev for being impolite and to make Larisa see him for what he was, stages a kind of practical joke. Using his alcoholic actor friend's drinking prowess he makes the young man get drunk and make a fool of himself, prompting laugher and ridicule from the other guests. Leaving Karandyshev behind, Paratov, Knurov and Vozhevatov take Larisa out for an impromptu nighttime picnic. As the party ends, Larisa approaches Paratov and proposes marriage. She gets a straight answer: no, he won't marry her after all, for he is betrothed to that other woman. Larisa feels humiliated, betrayed and compromised. Feeling unable to return home and face her fianc√©, whom she now hates, she contemplates suicide. Knurov and Vozhevatov discuss her position among themselves too; they end up tossing a coin to decide which of them will be lucky enough to take her on to a romantic trip to Paris. The older man wins, but Larisa rejects his offer. Drunk Karandyshev appears brandishing one of the Turkish pistols from his collection and implores Larisa to return home. Full of contempt, she refuses. In a fit of desperation, he draws the pistol and shoots her. Mortally wounded, she reaches for the pistol, trying to make it appear as if she shot herself, and even thanks her murderer. \\"You all are... good people and... I love you all,\\" are her last words. Composition According to the author's note, the idea of the play came to him on 1874, in Moscow. On 1876, informing his friend, the actor Fyodor Burdin about how his work on the Truth is Good But Happiness Better was going on, Ostrovsky wrote: \\"Now my attention and energy are focused on my next large play which I have been working upon since last year... I intend to finish it this year and am going to polish it with the utmost care for it will be my 40th original work.\\" The play's manuscript has been marked by the author as \\"Opus 40\\". Next time Ostrovsky mentioned it in his 1878, in a letter to Burdin: \\"Now I am busy working on a large original play. I'd rather finish it this winter before the new season starts so as to have more spare time in the summer.\\" Yet, he continued to work upon the play all through the summer and autumn on his Shchelykovo estate, all the while negotiating the terms for the future stage production. On 1878, the play was finished, he sent it to Burdin on the , and two days later it had been approved by the Theatre and Literature Committee. Burdin appeared to be unhappy with the part of Knurov, which he deemed 'secondary', and suggested some cuts should be made in the text. Ostrovsky wrote back: \\"I've read the play in Moscow five times, among the audiences there were people whom I'd hardly call my friends, but all unanimously agreed that Without a Dowry was my best play to date. The idea of cutting anything in the text hasn't crossed anyone's mind. But you there, do cut whatever you will, I won't dispute it\\". Production history Without a Dowry was premiered in Moscow's Maly Theater on 1878, as a benefit for the actor Nikolai Muzil (who played Robinson). Larisa was played by Glikeriya Fedotova, Paratov by Alexander Lensky, Karandyshev by Mikhail Sadovsky, Knurov by Ivan Samarin. Several days later the play was performed for the second time, as a benefit for Prov Sadovsky, with Maria Yermolova as Larisa. Ostrovsky in a letter informed Burdin of the \\"great success\\" these two shows had. In Saint Petersburg Without a Dowry was performed for the first time on , in the Alexandrinsky Theatre, as a benefit for Burdin. Maria Savina played Larisa and it was her inspired performance that drew all the attention. Otherwise the critical response was lukewarm. In the early 1890s, Without a Dowry was successfully revived on stage by Vera Komissarzhevskaya, who created her own, unique version of the Larisa character.

Summary The story uses third- person narration and tells the story of Victor, a self-conscious man for whom \\"music he did not know... could be likened to the patter of a conversation in a strange tongue.\\" When Victor arrives at a party, he finds the other guests listening with varying degrees of engagement to a man named Wolfe play the piano. As Victor does not know the song being played, he loses interest. He catches a glimpse of his ex-wife at the party, but cannot look at her. He laments the fact that now he must \\"start all over\\" the long task of forgetting her (in a flashback, it's revealed that she left him for another, who may or may not be at the party). Throughout the entire story, Victor views the music as a structure that has him encaged in an awkward situation with his ex-wife; it had seemed to him \\"a narrow dungeon\\" until it ends, thus giving his ex-wife the opportunity to leave, which she does. Victor then realizes that the music was not a dungeon, but actually \\"incredible bliss, a magic glass dome that had embraced and imprisoned him and her,\\" and which allowed him to \\"breathe the same air as she.\\" After she leaves, another party-goer comments to Victor that he looked immune to the music and that he didn't think such a thing possible. His own inanity is revealed when Victor asks him what was played and he cannot tell whether it was Beethoven's Kreutzer Sonata or Tekla BƒÖdarzewska- Baranowska's rather easy piece, Maiden's Prayer. Comments The story features a few examples of Nabokov's fascination with reflections and doubles, even though they don't have any thematic importance. He gives us Victor's reflection in a mirror straightening a reflected tie, as well as Wolfe's hands reflected \\"in the lacquered depths of the open keyboard lid... engaged in a ghostly, intricate, even somewhat clownish mimicry.\\" References Short stories by Vladimir Nabokov ","title":"Music (short story)"},{"id":"36490885","title":"Lean CFP driven"},{"id":"36490886","text":"1857 Kranti is an Indian historical drama television series directed by Sanjay Khan and produced by Numero Uno International Limited.

Biography Born in Buffalo, New York, Rachel Tzvia Back was raised in the US and Israel. The seventh generation of her family in Israel, Back returned there for good in 1980. She has lived in the Galilee, in the north of the country, since 2000. Back studied at Yale University, Temple University, and received her PhD from the Hebrew University of Jerusalem. She is a professor of English literature and head of the graduate English track at Oranim Academic College. Back has taught also at the Hebrew University, Bar-Ilan University and Tel-Aviv University, and has been guest writer at numerous US universities, including Columbia, Barnard, Princeton, Rutgers, NYU, Wesleyan, Williams and others. In 2009, she was a Brownstone Visiting Associate Professor at Dartmouth College. From 1995-2000, Back was the Israeli Academic and Administrative Director of the Wesleyan and Brown Universities Overseas Program in Israeli and Palestinian Studies, based in Jerusalem. Literary career Back's most recent poetry collection, What Use is Poetry, the Poet is Asking (2019), is described by University of California Berkeley professor Chana Kronfeld as ‚Äú‚Ä¶the best work of this poet, translator, peace activist and scholar who reminds us, through the courageous beauty of her poems, that not to be political in these times is to collaborate with the forces of darkness.‚Äù This is poetry that is ‚Äúnecessary, irreplaceable, urgent,‚Äù writes Kronfeld, stating finally that this is ‚Äúone of the best new books of poetry I have read in recent years.‚Äù Back‚Äôs previous collection, A Messenger Comes (2012), is described by the poet Irena Klepfisz as \\"poetry that, without apology, centers on grief and its faithful companion, memory\\"; according to poet Hank Lazer, this collection is \\"a harrowing & inspiring book of poems.\\" Among her previous poetry collections is Litany (1995), Azimuth (2001), The Buffalo Poems (2003), and On Ruins & Return: Poems 1999-2005 (2005). Poet Peter Cole noted of Azimuth that \\"with grace and gravity, with a gentle, quiet tenacity, Rachel Tzvia Back brings the poetics of indeterminacy to bear on Israel's over-determined landscape. Her verse hurts as the land itself has been hurt: its rippling music is delicate and achieved, its evocation of intimacy stunning.\\" Back's subsequent poetry collections The Buffalo Poems and On Ruins & Return track the cycle of violence marking the lives of Palestinians and Israelis. Poet Andrew Mossin noted that \\"with its passionate interrogation and representation of the Palestinian-Israeli conflict, [Back's] work has its basis in personal, observed experience of a conflict that appears to be without end.\\" Mossin also observed that Back's On Ruins & Return \\"continues the journey of her earlier volume, Azimuth, to inscribe in a poetry of psalmic intensity and astringent care the geographic, political and po-ethical realities of present-day Israel.\\" A noted and award-winning translator of Hebrew verse, Back's translations of the poetry of Tuvia Ruebner in In the Illuminated Dark: Select Poems of Tuvia Ruebner (2015) brought this critical Hebrew poet to the English world for the first time. In 2016, the collection was awarded the TLS-Risa Domb/Porjes prize; at the award-ceremony, noted British literary critic Boyd Tonkin spoke the following in his introductory words: \\"The miracle, if I may use that word, of Rachel Tzvia Back‚Äôs translations is that they somehow find an English voice - and one planted deep in the soil of Anglophone poetry - for this German spirit; a spirit that had already reinvented itself in Ruebner‚Äôs adopted language of Hebrew. That voice is always compelling and convincing, as these poems express a soaring beauty, tenderness and sorrow in the face of personal ordeals and historical catastrophe.\\" Her translations of preeminent Hebrew poet Lea Goldberg in Lea Goldberg: Selected Poetry and Drama were awarded a PEN Translation Grant, and the collection On the Surface of Silence: The Last Poems of Lea Goldberg, was shortlisted for the TLS-Risa Domb/Porjes Award in 2019. Back was also the editor and primary translator of the English edition of the groundbreaking anthology With an Iron Pen: Twenty Years of Hebrew Protest Poetry, which American poet Adrienne Rich referred to as \\"a historic collection.\\" Additional books of translation include Night, Morning: Selected Poems of Hamutal Bar Yosef and work collected in The Defiant Muse: Hebrew Feminist Poetry from Antiquity to the Present (The Feminist Press, 1999) and Hebrew Writers on Writing (Trinity University Press, 2008).

Technically, the word dalak is derived from the Arabic word dalaka which means to rub. Their preferred self-designation is now Salmani, as the word dalak is seen as offensive, and the community were traditionally associated with the profession of barbering.The Mongols of Afghanistan : an ethnography of the Moghols and related peoples of Afghanistan by Schurmann, H. F. pages 225 to 227  Origin  The principal function of the Dalak is cutting hair, circumcision, the performance of music at certain events such as marriages for their patrons and carrying out certain minor surgical operations. Littler is known about the origin of the Dalak, but a possible connection with the Afghan Jat cannot be ruled. Unlike the Jat, who are nomadic, the Dalak are essentially a settled urban community, with settlements in Herat, mainly in the neighbourhood of Kurt, and in Chisht as well as other towns of western Afghanistan. A claim is now being made that they are descended from Salman Al Farsi, a Sahabah of Mohammad, hence the new name Salmani meaning a descendant of Salman.The Mongols of Afghanistan : an ethnography of the Moghols and related peoples of Afghanistan by Schurmann, H. F. pages 225 to 227 During the summer months, the Dalak leave their urban settlements and visit various villages, where they perform circumcision, entertain at weddings, cut hair and occasional perform agriculture labour. A patron client relationship exists with the local sedentary population. Historically, they were given in grain in return for their services, but increasingly they are now being paid cash. Their patrons belong mainly to the Aimaq, Tajik and Uzbek communities, and their culture is not dissimilar to the other Dari speaking communities. However, there is virtually no intermarriage between the Dalak and neighbouring ethnic groups, and as a community they are strictly endogamous.

Colonial rule, 1858-1947 1866 : Oil discovery at Nahorpung,Assam. Not explored. 1882 : Big \\"Oil Seepage\\" in Digboi during construction of Dibrugarh-Ledo Railway Line. The first oil production started in India in 1889 near the town of Digboi in the state of Assam. A Small thatched structure was erected and christened \\"Oil well no.1\\" or \\"Discovery\\". This discovery came on the heels of industrial development. The Assam Railways and Trading Company (ARTC) had recently opened the area for trade by building a railway and later finding oil nearby. The first well was completed in 1890 and in 1893 first refinery started at Margharita, Assam. The Assam Oil Company was established in 1899 to oversee production. In 1901, Digboi Refinery was commissioned supplanting the earlier refinery at Margharita. At its peak during the Second World War the Digboi oil fields were producing 7,000 barrels per day.. In the year 1909, IBP (Indo Burmah Petroleum) was incorporated in Rangoon to explore oil wells that had been discovered in Burma and Assam. Oil in colonial India was mostly exploited by a number of British companies with intricate alliances. Their output began to increase during the first and second world wars to support British troops and industries in the United Kingdom. In 1928, Asiatic Petroleum Company ( India) started cooperation with Burmah Oil Company. This alliance led to the formation of Burmah-Shell Oil Storage and Distributing Company of India Limited. Burmah-Shell began its operations with import and marketing of Kerosene. On 24 January 1976, the Burmah Sell was taken over by the Government of India to form Bharat Refineries Limited. On 1 August 1977, it was renamed as Bharat Petroleum Corporation Limited. Independence, 1947-1991 After India won independence in 1947, the new government moved to a Communist system, often termed as License Raj. In terms of economic policy this meant a far bigger role for the government and little or no role for the private sector. This resulted in a focus on centralized planning, heavily bureaucratic and inefficient system that meant a large public sector and economic protectionism. The foreign companies continued to play a key role in the oil industry. Oil India Limited was still a joint venture involving the Indian government and the British owned Burmah Oil Company (presently, BP) whilst the Indo-Stanvac Petroleum project in West Bengal was between the Indian government and the American company SOCONY- Vacuum (presently, ExxonMobil). This changed in 1956 when the government adopted an industrial policy that placed oil as a ‚Äúschedule A industry‚Äù and put its future development in the hands of the state. In October 1959 an Act of Parliament was passed which gave the state owned Oil and Natural Gas Commission (ONGC) the powers to plan, organise, and implement programmes for the development of oil resources and the sale of petroleum products and also to perform plans sent down from central government. In order to find the expertise necessary to reach these goals foreign experts from West Germany, Romania, the US, and the Soviet Union were brought in. The Soviet experts were the most influential and they drew up detailed plans for further oil exploration which were to form part of the second five-year plan. India thus adopted the Soviet model of economic development and the state continues to implement five-year plans as part of its drive towards modernity. The increased focus on exploration resulted in the discovery of several new oil fields most notably the off-shore Bombay High field which remains by a long margin India's most productive well. Liberalisation, 1991-present The process of economic liberalisation in India began in 1991 when India defaulted on her loans and asked for a $1.8 billion bailout from the IMF.India's Pathway through Financial Crisis . Arunabha Ghosh. Global Economic Governance Programme. Retrieved on 2 March 2007. This was a trickle-down effect of the culmination of the cold war era; marked by the 1991 collapse of the Soviet Union, India's main trading partner. The bailout was done on the condition that the government initiate further reforms, thus paving the way for India's emergence as a free market economy, which would open up its markets to western companies. For the ONGC this meant being reorganised into a public limited company (it is now called for Oil and Natural Gas Corporation) and around 2% of government held stocks were sold off. Despite this however the government still plays a pivotal role and ONGC is still responsible for 77% of oil and 81% of gas production while the Indian Oil Corporation (IOC) owns most of the refineries putting it within the top 20 oil companies in the world. The government also maintains subsidised prices. As a net importer of oil however India faces the problem of meeting the energy demands for its rapidly expanding population and economy and to this the ONGC has pursued drilling rights in Iran and Kazakhstan and has acquired shares in exploration ventures in Indonesia, Libya, Nigeria, and Sudan. India's choice of energy partners however, most notably Iran led to concerns radiating from the US. A key issue today is the proposed gas pipeline that will run from Turkmenistan to India through politically unstable Afghanistan and also through Pakistan. However, despite India's strong economic links with Iran, India voted with the US when Iran's nuclear program was discussed by the International Atomic Energy Agency although there are still very real differences between the two countries when it comes to dealing with Iran.

The arena would have hosted basketball, ice hockey, and concerts. The proposal called for an arena with a capacity of around 19,000 to 20,000 seats. It was part of a larger plan to return the Seattle SuperSonics (NBA) franchise, along with adding a potential National Hockey League (NHL) franchise, to the city of Seattle. The proposal was rejected in favor of redeveloping KeyArena into Climate Pledge Arena. Background The east entrance to KeyArena. The largest arena by seating capacity in the greater Seattle metropolitan area is KeyArena. Originally called the Seattle Center Coliseum, the arena opened in 1962. It was remodeled and took its present name in 1995. KeyArena was the home of the SuperSonics from to , the duration of the NBA team's existence in Seattle. The SuperSonics relocated to Oklahoma City, Oklahoma. in 2008 and are currently known as the Thunder. The KeyArena (then named the Seattle Center Coliseum) was the home of the minor professional Western Hockey League Seattle Totems from 1963 to 1975. KeyArena was later home to the Seattle Thunderbirds of the major junior Western Hockey League from 1977 to 2009. In 2009, the Thunderbirds relocated to the ShoWare Center in nearby Kent. Several professional hockey teams have played in Seattle since 1915. The first was the Seattle Metropolitans, who played in the Seattle Ice Arena from 1915-1924 and became the first American team to win the Stanley Cup in 1917. Other professional hockey teams included the Seattle Eskimos, Seattle Ironmen, Seattle Bombers, and Seattle Americans. KeyArena's current tenants include the Seattle Redhawks athletic program, the Women's National Basketball Association (WNBA) Seattle Storm, and the Rat City Rollergirls. KeyArena also hosts concerts, circuses, professional wrestling, and other events. Other arenas in Seattle include the Alaska Airlines Arena at Hec Edmundson Pavilion, home of the Washington Huskies; and Mercer Arena, a performing arts venue. Comcast Arena, in Everett, is the home of the IFL's Everett Raptors and the WHL's Everett Silvertips. A key reason given for the Sonics relocation to Oklahoma City in 2008 was KeyArena's small size and lack of amenities. Before moving the team, the SuperSonics' ownership group proposed that a new arena be built in Renton using $500 million in public funds, but an agreement was not made. In an attempt to keep the Sonics in Seattle, a group of investors led by former Microsoft CEO Steve Ballmer promised to pay half of the $300 million needed for a proposed remodel of KeyArena (with Seattle and King County financing the other half), but an agreement was not reached. On January 21, 2013, the Sacramento Kings were sold to a Seattle-based ownership group, on the condition that the NBA Board of Governors approve the sale to San Francisco hedge fund manager Chris Hansen. These reports were by Hansen, the Maloof family, and the NBA. However, on May 15, 2013, the NBA voted 22-8 to reject the Kings' proposed relocation to Seattle. The day after the NBA's decision, the Maloof family reached agreement to sell the Kings to a group led by Silicon Valley tech entrepreneur Vivek Ranadiv√© for a record NBA franchise valuation of $535 million and the team stayed in Sacramento. Despite the failed attempt to move the Kings, Hansen's plans to bring an NBA team back to Seattle, possibly by expansion, are continuing. Proposal King County Executive Dow Constantine, Chris Hansen, and Seattle Mayor Mike McGinn In late 2011, the City of Seattle was approached with a proposal to build a multipurpose arena in an industrial zone south of CenturyLink Field and Safeco Field. The total cost of a new arena had been estimated to be $490 million, and the investment group had proposed a direct public investment of up to $200 million to be repaid by ticket surcharges, split between the City of Seattle and King County. The investors had agreed to pay any construction shortfalls and for improvements to KeyArena, which would serve as a temporary home for both a new NBA team and a new NHL team while the arena was being built. On February 16, 2012 Seattle Mayor Mike McGinn and King County Executive Dow Constantine announced an agreement with the Hansen's investment team. The Mayor and Executive forwarded a memorandum of understanding was forwarded to the Seattle City Council and the King County Council for further review and approval. On April 5, 2012, the Port of Seattle and the Seattle Mariners Baseball club sent a letter to the Seattle City Council objecting to the location of the arena, citing traffic issues affecting freight mobility at the port, scheduling conflicts with Mariners' games, and gentrification of the \\"industrial waterfront\\". On July 30, 2012, the King County Council approved the draft Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) that Chris Hansen, Mike McGinn, and Dow Constantine proposed. Earlier that day the Seattle City Council had declared the MOU unacceptable in its current form with the intent to renegotiate. On September 11, 2012, the Seattle City Council reached a tentative agreement with Chris Hansen to build a SoDo basketball and ice hockey arena with revisions including the base rent being reduced from $2 million a year to $1 million, some tax revenue paying for surrounding transportation improvements and KeyArena renovations, a study for alternatives for the redevelopment of KeyArena, and an added five-year personal guarantee of bond debts from Hansen. On September 24, 2012, the Seattle City Council approved the memorandum of understanding for the proposed SoDo basketball/ice hockey arena. On October 15, 2012, the King County Council voted unanimously in favor, while the Seattle City Council voted 7‚Äì2 to approve the amended SoDo multipurpose arena proposal. On August 12, 2014, major investor Steve Ballmer left the Sonics Arena investment team to purchase the Los Angeles Clippers. Ballmer purchased the Clippers for a then record $2 billion. His departure was a devastating double blow for the Sonics Arena investment team, as not only was he expected to be the majority owner of a prospective NBA franchise (A requirement for construction of the arena to commence), but the purchase price of the Clippers also greatly inflated the expected asking price of an NBA franchise (The Houston Rockets selling 3 years later for $2.2 billion ). Hansen vowed to press on with the project despite Ballmer's departure, but acknowledged that he would need to find one if not multiple new investors to replace Ballmer's contribution. The Mayor's budget director Ben Noble later said of the departure of Ballmer that \\"the mood at City Hall for Hansen's original MOU soured considerably after Steve Ballmer purchased the Los Angeles Clippers for $2 billion in 2014.\\" In June, 2015, architecture giant AECOM released a study commissioned by the 2012 MOU for alternatives for the redevelopment of KeyArena. The study examined multiple potential options including a concert venue, an adventure park, a museum and even 400-500 units of housing, each option costing more than $100 million, demolition of the arena costing $7 million. The study also estimated the cost of rebuilding the arena into an NBA or NHL ready facility to be $285 million, considerably less than the $490 million price tag of the SoDo arena. Coupled with the NBA/NHL ready design, AECOM also examined the likely hood of securing a franchise in both the NBA and NHL, and concluded that NBA expansion was unlikely in the near future as the league had concerns about \\"product dilution\\" and that relocation was unlikely as \\"there currently is no team that is actively and publicly planning to move\\", but that Seattle was a top market for potential expansion or relocation of an NHL franchise due to its population, population growth, median household income, and corporate support. The Seattle Design Commission approved the project on September 3, 2015. On November 30, 2015 the Seattle Department of Transportation and Mayor Ed Murray recommended that Occidental Avenue should be vacated for the arena. The street vacation was subject to opposition by the Port of Seattle and local longshoreman unions, citing their previous arguments from 2012 of increased traffic and gentrification of the \\"industrial waterfront\\". On May 2, 2016, the Seattle City Council voted 5‚Äì4 against the street vacation and sale of the street. Hansen said the following day in a statement that he and his group would \\"need to take a little time to step back and evaluate [their] options.\\" Mayor Murray later said that the vote made it \\"less likely that the NBA will return to Seattle.\\" On October 25, 2016, in a letter to Seattle Mayor Ed Murray, King County Executive Dow Constantine and the Seattle City Council, Hansen's group offered to terminate the MOU and waive the requirement for the City and County's $200 million contribution (bonds which would have been repaid pay through rent and taxes generated by arena operations). Instead, the group would pay for the entire cost of construction and contribute to other traffic and freight mobility improvement projects, including the Lander Street Overpass, in exchange for the vacation of Occidental Avenue, a waiver on admission taxes similar to that granted to the other sports venues, and a reduction of the B&O; tax rate on out-of-town revenue. The letter was issued the day before news began to surface that the city was more seriously considering a redevelopment of KeyArena instead. On September 7, 2017, the day before a draft MOU for the redevelopment of KeyArena was to be delivered to the City Council, the Sonics Arena group released a 10-page letter detailing a $100 million privately financed redevelopment of KeyArena into a concert venue to be coupled with construction of the new basketball arena in SoDo in an effort to kick start the project again. Under the proposal, KeyArena would have been subdivided into 3 venues of varying sizes including a 6,200 seat indoor venue, a 3,000 seat outdoor venue, and a 500-seat theater. The project also included 500 underground parking stalls. The proposal was dismissed by the Office of Economic Development as the proposal was never officially submitted during the RFP process for KeyArena. \\"If the SODO Arena Group was interested in redeveloping KeyArena, they should have submitted their proposal during the RFP process, which would have shown a willingness to work with the City on this project. They did not submit a proposal and continue to show no interest in working in partnership with the City.\\" On December 4, 2017, the day after the original MOU with the Sonics Arena group expired, the Seattle City Council voted 7-1 to approve a memorandum of understanding with the Oak View Group for the redevelopment of KeyArena. The MOU included an exclusivity clause that forbade the city from giving benefits to any other group proposing an arena of 15,000 seats or more. Private investors The primary investor for the project was Chris Hansen. Hansen had a modest upbringing in Seattle's Rainier Valley neighborhood. He is managing partner of Valiant Capital in San Francisco, where he manages approximately $2.44 billion in public and private investments as of April 2013. Other investors included Steve Ballmer, CEO of Microsoft; former minor Sonics owner Erik Nordstrom, Executive Vice President and President (Stores) of Nordstrom; and former minor Sonics owner Peter Nordstrom, Executive Vice President and President (Merchandising) of Nordstrom. Public debate In early April 2012, the International Longshore and Warehouse Union, Seattle Mariners and Port of Seattle were the first organizations to publicly oppose the arena proposal. All sent strongly worded letters to the city and county arguing the location would negatively impact their business. The Mariners argued that \\"scheduling, traffic and parking challenges that would likely require hundreds of millions of dollars to mitigate.\\" The Port raised concerns regarding transportation, infrastructure and land use, and asked for an alternative site analysis. Approximately 6,000 supporters of the arena proposal rallied at Occidental Park on June 14, 2012. At the two-hour rally, Chris Hansen, Dow Constantine, and other council members spoke along with former Sonics Gary Payton, Shawn Kemp, Slick Watts, and Detlef Schrempf. On July 7, 2012, the Seattle Times wrote an editorial opposing the arena proposal, writing, \\"The glittering offer should be turned down with a resolute ‚Äòno thanks.\\" The paper argued that the location would be too detrimental to the business of Port of Seattle and other companies in the industrial area. Design On March 13, 2013, Chris Hansen's group released preliminary design renderings of the arena's interior. Configured to support both basketball and ice hockey, the renderings illustrated two unique seating options. Small sideline \\"pocket\\" suites would be less than ten rows from the floor. In the upper tier of the arena, three \\"Sonic Ring\\" sections would have allowed for expanded standing-room seating that could be opened or closed based on event capacity needs. Each ring would have featured approximately 800‚Äì900 fixed seats and standing-room capacity for between 700 and 1,500 people. Other Seattle-area proposals In 2015, two proposals from other groups interested in both basketball and hockey proposed new arenas in the suburbs of Tukwila and Bellevue in light of delays in the approval of the SoDo arena.

It was released as the album's second single on March 26, 2012. Although a handful of critics assumed this was an English-language cover version of Jacques Brel's song \\"Ne me quitte pas\\", Spektor‚Äôs song is different in every way except the title. The chord structure, melody, and lyrics are all completely different. Brel‚Äôs song was written in the key of A minor, in 3/4 time. It is a slow, haunting story of a man trying to win back his former lover‚Äîa song about the cowardice of men according to Brel. In contrast, Spektor‚Äôs song is lively, in 4/4 time, and in a major key. Its lyrics evoke a carefree jaunt through various neighborhoods of New York City, the narrator describing all the beautiful and interesting things encountered along the way. Somehow the narrator ends up in the caf√©s and gardens of Paris, and the song ends with repeated declarations of love for Paris in the rain. The song was previously released on Spektor's 2002 album Songs, simply titled \\"Ne Me Quitte Pas\\". This version of the song featured just Spektor and her piano, while the 2012 version includes a drum machine, horns and brass instruments. The song also features lyrics sung in both English and French. In June 2012, Spektor released yet another version of the song online, keeping the multi-instrument production heard on What We Saw from the Cheap Seats, but replacing the English verses with Russian lyrics. The new rendition was titled \\"–ù–µ –ü–æ–∫–∏–¥–∞–π –ú–µ–Ω—è\\". The song can be heard at the end of the episode \\"Five Miles From Yetzer Hara\\" from the eighth season of Weeds. Music video A video for the 2012 version of \\"Don't Leave Me (Ne Me Quitte Pas)\\" was uploaded to YouTube on June 12, 2012. The video was directed by Ace Norton and features Spektor, alone in an apartment, interacting with various items. For example, at one point she is fencing on a table and at another she is dancing on a piano. The video is edited by Isaac Hagy and production design is by Maxwell Orgell.

He was arrested in July 2012 following a suicide attempt. In September he pleaded guilty to embezzling $215.5 million from more than 13,000 customers over the course of 20 years. On January 31, 2013, he received a 50-year sentence for fraud, effectively a life sentence.  Career  Wasendorf established Wasendorf & Son Inc. in 1980, renamed it Peregrine Financial Group 10 years later and opened a Chicago office, according to the company website. On July 9, 2012, the same day that the National Futures Association reported that PFG appeared to be missing at least $200 million in customer funds, Wasendorf attempted to commit suicide by asphyxiation outside company headquarters. Before doing so he left a suicide note admitting to embezzling from the company for nearly two decades, according to the FBI affidavit. \\"I have committed fraud. For this I feel constant and intense guilt,\\" he wrote in the note, according to the affidavit. The bankruptcy filing took place after Peregrine was put under investigation for a shortfall of at least $200 million in customer funds. The firm was also accused by federal regulators of commingling customer and firm money. Wasendorf was arrested and charged with making false statements to the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC). He admitted to stealing at least $100 million from his firm, according to an FBI affidavit that accompanied the criminal complaint unsealed on July 13, 2012, the date of his arrest.Andrew Harris and Margaret Cronin Fisk, \\"Peregrine CEO Wasendorf‚Äôs Bail Hearing Moved To July 27\\", Jul 18, 2012 He pleaded guilty to all charges in July 2012.

Life and work Ripley is the author of the Angel series of comedy thrillers set mainly in Essex and London's East End. He won the Crime Writers' Association 'Last Laugh Award' for best humorous crime novel for 'Angel Touch' in 1989 and 'Angels In Arms' in 1991. He was also a scriptwriter for the fifth series of the BBC comedy-drama Lovejoy (1986‚Äì94) starring Ian McShane, and served as The Daily Telegraph's crime fiction critic for ten years. In 2003 at the age of fifty he suffered a stroke; his 2006 book, Surviving a Stroke, is his autobiographical account of his recovery. After twenty years of working in London he moved to East Anglia and became an archaeologist. In the words of his publisher, \\"he was thus one of the few crime writers who regularly turned up real bodies\\". He currently writes the \\"Getting Away With Murder\\" column for the online publication Shots. The inspiration for the column (he once claimed) came after a night of drinking gin with Auberon Waugh and Gore Vidal in London. He is the series editor at Ostara Publishing, which specialises in reprinting classic mysteries and thrillers, and was co-editor of the three Fresh Blood anthologies promoting new British crime writing. He also lectures on crime writing at the University of Cambridge. In 2007 he was made a Patron of the Essex Book Festival and ran his Creative Crime Writing course at the Lavenham Literary Festivals in 2009 and 2013. Working with the Margery Allingham Society he has completed the Albert Campion novel left unfinished on the death of Allingham's widower, Philip Youngman Carter in 1969. Mr Campion's Farewell was published in April 2014. A second Campion \\"continuation\\" novel followed in 2015 and a third in 2016. His non-fiction reader's history Kiss Kiss, Bang Bang, a survey of the boom in British thrillers 1953-1975 was published in May 2017 and won the H.R.F.Keating Award for non-fiction at Crimefest 2018. Mr Campion's Farewell Mike Ripley's most recent project has been the completion of a novel featuring Albert Campion, the detective character created by one of his heroes, the crime writer Margery Allingham. Following Margery's death in 1966, her husband Philip Youngman Carter completed her novel Cargo of Eagles (published 1968), and two further Campion books: Mr Campion‚Äôs Farthing and Mr Campion‚Äôs Falcon. Upon Carter's death in 1969, he too left an unfinished manuscript for a Campion novel. Carter's fragment of manuscript, which contained revisions and minor corrections but no plot outline, character synopsis or plan, was bequeathed to Margery Allingham‚Äôs sister Joyce; and upon her death in 2001, the manuscript was left to officials of the Margery Allingham Society. It was not until 2012 that Ripley, with the approval and agreement of the Margery Allingham Society, took up the challenge of completing Carter's manuscript, which has become Mr Campion's Farewell. The novel was published in March 2014 by Severn House Publishers.

Summary The story uses third- person narration and concerns itself with a child named Peter. The syntax and diction is, in some ways, childish, making the story stylistically comparable to the early portion of Joyce's A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man. At school, another child (Dmitri Korff) shows Peter a magazine with a comic illustration announcing a duel between Peter's father and another member of the parliament whereat he works, asking \\"is it true?\\" As Peter did not know about the duel, he becomes upset, dreading his father's potential death. It's unknown to Peter in what medium the duel will progress, but his father's daily fencing lessons in the library suggest (to the reader) that it will be by sword (a clever red herring planted by Nabokov). The boy's dread is captured symbolically (although Nabokov hated talk of symbols) by his mis-remembering a poem in front of his class; he recalls the dramatic 'ache' instead of the innocuous 'orache', a weed After much dread over his father's duel, which includes calling to mind Lenski falling like a \\"black sack\\" in Pushkin's Eugene Onegin (one of Nabokov's Russian favorites), the same student reveals to Peter that the events of the duel are recounted in that day's paper. Peter rushes to the school's porter, Andrey, to look into his paper, where it's written that the duel was bloodless, the opponent firing first, and missing, to which Peter's father fired into the air. In the end, Peter weeps with relief.

Since the completion of the Aswan High Dam, the island has been flooded with Lake Nubia. The fort, about 351 kilometers south of Aswan was built by Sesostris III. It measured 77 √ó 87 meters. The protective wall had a thickness of 5.3 meters and had spur- like bastions. The highly fortified entrance protected a temple and warehouses along the harbor. Inside the castle were a commander's house and barracks. Pottery has been unearthed at the site dated to the early 13th Dynasty.  Introduction  Askut was an ancient Egyptian fortress located on an island on the Nile during the Middle Kingdom. Its intention was to seal the border to Nubia. It was excavated by Alexander Badawy during the Aswan High Damage Salvage Campaign which aimed to preserve sites threatened by the building of the Aswan Dam. Fortresses such as this one were typically home to a large community of diverse geographical origin and ethnicity. Different roles were taken on by all members of the community, however men typically dominated the roles associated with military, politics, and economics. An important part of uncovering this site included understanding the social context associated with the environment and material culture. Smith, Stuart Tyson (2013). The Garrison and Inhabitants: A View from Askut. In The Power of Walls - Fortifications in Ancient Northeastern Africa, edited by Friederike Jesse and Carola Vogel, pp. 269-292. Heinrich-Barth-Institut, Koln.  Type of research  An important method when studying fortress societies is to look on a smaller scale rather than a larger scale. It may seem easier to understand the society just through a macro historical approach since the state creates them for specific purposes, however looking more closely at individual decisions during specific circumstances is a better way of understanding social dynamics. When exploring this site, a multi scalar approach is used to integrate both large scale societal actions and individual actions to come as close to the reality of this fortress society as possible. This method is important when studying the architecture of Askut. It helped archaeologists to understand a change from a society that was centrally planned (a society where a central authority such a government, makes major choices economically) and consisted of military garrisons, to a more casual and changeable organization that was more intimate and family oriented. This helps archaeologists see a shift that led to permanent settlement. Smith, Stuart Tyson (2013). The Garrison and Inhabitants: A View from Askut. In The Power of Walls - Fortifications in Ancient Northeastern Africa, edited by Friederike Jesse and Carola Vogel, pp. 269-292. Heinrich-Barth-Institut, Koln.  Demography, gender, and ethnicity  = Layout = As Askut began to transform to a more settlement style pattern, old three-room barracks indicating a military like set up began to shift and individualize. Many floor plants and spaces were rebuilt and domestic spaces turned into a layout that was more diverse and fit the needs of different types of families. The Southeastern part of this site gives evidence that these changes were implemented in the New Kingdom, but could have began at the end of the Middle Kingdom. Important areas of the fortress were left behind and filled with trash, such as the granary complex. In the New Kingdom, a large area of Askut was transformed into a fundamental house with a central courtyard, encircled by rooms. Only an old barrack remains from the Middle Kingdom and these changes could represent a response to significant events unfolding during the Second Intermediate Period after a period of warfare with the reconquest of Lower Nubia. This new organization of the community came about as a desire for comfortable access to the riverbank.Smith, Stuart Tyson (2013). The Garrison and Inhabitants: A View from Askut. In The Power of Walls - Fortifications in Ancient Northeastern Africa, edited by Friederike Jesse and Carola Vogel, pp. 269-292. Heinrich- Barth-Institut, Koln. = Gender and children = The role of women and children were extremely important to the Askut society. Nubian and Egyptian women appear very rarely in textual records and they are always almost considered subordinate to the men of the society. However, there were an array of Nubian cookpots and cuisine that represent the large role and influence that Nubian women had on the community's foodways, which became increasingly important for Nubian identity and dominated a large amount of their social context.Smith, Stuart Tyson (2013). The Garrison and Inhabitants: A View from Askut. In The Power of Walls - Fortifications in Ancient Northeastern Africa, edited by Friederike Jesse and Carola Vogel, pp. 269-292. Heinrich-Barth- Institut, Koln. Children are often underrepresented because they are hard to see in the archaeological record. At Askut however, objects like gaming pieces or ceramic buttons that make enjoyable whirring noises and motion indicate the presence of children. Figurines could also have been used by children, however archeologists are unsure due to the fact that they could have been used by adults as offerings in religious rituals. Today, child life may seem relaxed and playful, however in the past children were heavily involved in many productive activities in this community. In evidence of pottery production, some argue that small, poorly done pots could reflect that they were made by children. Evidence of this was done through comparing patterns on the pots with studies of childhood Moto development and cognitive development. Even some fingerprint evidence of children was discovered on pottery.Smith, Stuart Tyson (2013). The Garrison and Inhabitants: A View from Askut. In The Power of Walls - Fortifications in Ancient Northeastern Africa, edited by Friederike Jesse and Carola Vogel, pp. 269-292. Heinrich-Barth-Institut, Koln. = Ethnicity = Since fortresses are usually based on boundaries or within conquered territories, ethnicity is a great way of understanding more about the site's context. In Askut, ethnicity is studied as multi dimensional, situational and overlapping, constructed and negotiated, rather than simply rigid and fixed. Material culture is understood in specific social contexts where ethnicity is approached as changeable and subjective. Fortresses such as Askut are a site of extreme interaction that signify differences and the importance of ethnic identity as multi scalar. Vessels that showed pre- depositional sooting indicated that they were used for cooking. Some pottery sherds of these vessels suggest a difference in foods cooked in Egyptian style and Nubian style cookpots. Cemeteries provide insight into the complexities of ethnicity at this site. The cemetery of Tombos, near Askut provides evidence for an ethnic dynamic that included colonists and natives at Askut. Furthermore, through bioarcaheological analysis archaeologists are able to see the appearance of immigrants and a blending with the Egyptian and Nubian. At Tombos, a study of Strontium Isotopes in teeth point archaeologists to the origin of an individual and the specific craniofacial proportions that link them to Egyptian, Nubian, or mixed ancestry. Smith, Stuart Tyson (2013). The Garrison and Inhabitants: A View from Askut. In The Power of Walls - Fortifications in Ancient Northeastern Africa, edited by Friederike Jesse and Carola Vogel, pp. 269-292. Heinrich-Barth-Institut, Koln.  Religion  Religious practices played a large role in the lives of those living in the fortress society. Large temples that appear in Askut reflect the belief and the practices of the site, however, artifacts found in everyday households better reflect everyday religious activity. Votive objects found inside homes give insight into an egalitarian understanding of religion at Askut. Although Askut did not have a state-sponsored temple, the residents did build a small chapel. Inside there were many indicators of religious activities including tall white painted stands, incense burners, balls of incense, a copper alloy knife for sacrifices, a stone offering table, and an altar with remains of food offerings still present. Inhabitants built household shrines and often artifacts like incense burners, amulets, and figurines were found. A specific charring at the bottom of certain bowls indicated that they were specifically used for burning incense and they account for one percent of the total ceramic assemblage at Askut. These bowls were found in the chapel as well as inside of the homes. This could indicate complex religious rituals, however it could also point to simple cleansing rituals that are still practiced in Egyptian and Nubian households today. There were some artifacts found that indicate that women were at the center of some of these religious practices, A Nubian style female figurine points to a certain faith centered around women and fertility. All of these religious artifacts were a key part of Nubian identity in and out of the households.Smith, Stuart Tyson (2013). The Garrison and Inhabitants: A View from Askut. In The Power of Walls - Fortifications in Ancient Northeastern Africa, edited by Friederike Jesse and Carola Vogel, pp. 269-292. Heinrich-Barth-Institut, Koln.  Finds and craft production  The shift to a more domestic layout is further supported through the findings of jar stoppers in a large room at the southern end of the site that indicate beer production on a large scale. However this large scale does move into the households on a smaller scale during the end of the Middle Kingdom. Bread molds are also found and indicate household style baking for smaller groups rather than central baking on a larger scale. Local harvesting of grain is supported by the finding of artifacts such as sickle blades, however they could have also been used for making matts and baskets. Large amounts of cattle were domesticated according to faunal remains and small amounts of hunted animals such as gazelle. Since this site was located near the river, this provided shellfish and fish that is supported by the findings of fishing net weights which would allow them to be dragged along by boats and collect the fish. Smith, Stuart Tyson (2013). The Garrison and Inhabitants: A View from Askut. In The Power of Walls - Fortifications in Ancient Northeastern Africa, edited by Friederike Jesse and Carola Vogel, pp. 269-292. Heinrich- Barth-Institut, Koln. = Middle and New Kingdom craft production = Molds were used to make tools such as hammer stones and anvils. Crucibles (a ceramic or metal container) and copper waste was also uncovered in the southern end of the site near the households. Evidence of pottery is seen through fragments of unfired vessels and a potters wheel head. These date to shapes seen in both the Middle Kingdom and the New Kingdom. Archaeologists believe there may have been a workshop present at Askut mostly run by Egyptian men, due to the evidence that Egyptian potters at Askut used a more narrow set of clay sources. On the other hand, Nubian potters mostly consisted of women and they used varying sets of clay resources that indicate production was mainly done in the household.Smith, Stuart Tyson (2013).

The castle is first mentioned in the 11th century under the name binithem.  Situation  The castle is built on a protrusion of Bentheim sandstone, which not only provided building materials for the castle itself, but was also a valued export product.\\"Bentheimer Gold\\" - Sandstein aus Bad Bentheim, Kulturportal Nordwest This Bentheimer H√∂henr√ºcken is the last protusion of the nearby Teutoburger forest.Geodienst.de Its elevated position in an otherwise very flat landscape, provides an excellent view and thus a strategic location to build a castle.  History  = Until 1500 = Burg Bentheim by Jacob van Ruisdael (1653) Burg Bentheim by Jacob van Ruisdael (second version) The earliest history of the castle, which was erected on the remains of an earlier refuge castle is largely unknown.Burg Bentheim, Geschichte In the registries of Werden Abbey (1050) the castle is mentioned, as Binedheim, in and contributes grain, honey and 2 solidi. A document from 1020 names Otto von Northeim as the owner of the castle. In 1116 the castle is completely destroyed in the war between Herzog Lothar von S√ºpplinburg, better known as Lothar III and Heinrich V.Geschichte des ehemaligen niederstifts M√ºnster (Vol II) The Annalista Saxo describes how Lothar \\"lays siege to Binithem, a fine and strong city and burned it after it was conquered\\". The epithet \\"strong\\" (firmam) suggests the castle played a vital role in the cities defences, though it is assumed it was a wooden structure, and not yet a stone one. The castle is soon rebuilt and this time in stone by Otto von Salm, brother in law of the victorious Lothar III, whose wife Gertrud von Northeim uses it as a residence. In 1050 she is mentioned as comitissa de Benetheim, which is the first documented member of the Counts of Bentheim. In 1146 a war erupted between Otto von Rheineck and the Bishop of Utrecht concerning the jurisdiction over Twente and Otto and his knights were defeated near Ootmarsum and the castle became a fee of the Diocese of Utrecht and the Bishop claimed the palace and the chapel for his personal use until 1190. Otto's son and only heir, Otto II von Salm-Rheineck tried to recapture the castle but fell into the hands of Hermann von Stahleck in 1148. He spent some time as a prisoner in Sch√∂nburg near Oberwesel and was strangled the next year. To the bishops of M√ºnster and Utrecht the independent county remained a thorn in the side, and most notably in 1374 both launched attacks upon the castle. Otto's daughter, Sophie von Salm-Rheineck inherited the castle. She married Dirk VI, Count of Holland and the castle (1154) and the county (1165) thus passed into the hands of the Counts of Holland. Their son, Otto the Younger is mentioned in a deed by Henry the Lion as comes de Binitheim. He is the first of the counts of Bentheim-Holland, whose rule lasts until 1421 when the castle passes into the hands of Eberwin IV von G√∂tterswick, a cousin of the last count of Bentheim-Holland. = After 1500 = The Pulverturm (Gunpowder Tower) From 1421 the name Grafen von Bentheim first appears. In 1486 Graf Eberwin II gets a Fee from Frederick III and the County of Bentheim becomes an independent political entity. In 1489 this is reflected in the Burg, and the construction of the Pulverturm starts Between 1588 and 1593, Arnold II chooses the side of the Reformation, following the church reformers Calvin and Zwingli. During the Thirty Years' War, the county pays the price for its choice and is repeatedly sacked by Spanish troops. Much of the castle is destroyed in the process. This is repeated during the Seven Years' War, in which the Burg repeatedly comes under siege from French and British troops and is taken several times. In 1795 it served as a field hospital in the war against the revolutionary French Army and was set ablaze and taken by general Dominique Vandamme. The castle is still owned by the Prince of Bentheim- Steinfurt who is living at Steinfurt Castle. It is home to some of his siblings and is also open to the public as a family museum.

Members of this family are predominantly found in tumour necrosis factor receptor superfamily, member 13b (TACI), and are required for binding to the ligands APRIL and BAFF. TACI-CRD2 stands for Transmembrane Activator and CAML Interactor- Cysteine Rich Domain 2. Function TACI functions as a negative regulator of BAFF function given that loss of TACI expression results in the overproduction of B lymphocytes, a type of white blood cell that guards against infection. Cytokines can be grouped into a family on the basis of sequence, functional and structural similarities. Tumor necrosis factor (TNF) (also known as TNF-alpha or cachectin) is a cytotoxin which is derived from a form of white blood cell called monocytes. It is thought to cause tumour regression, septic shock and cachexia. The protein is synthesised as a prohormone with an unusually long and atypical signal sequence, which is absent from the mature secreted cytokine. A short hydrophobic stretch of amino acids serves to anchor the prohormone in lipid bilayers. Both the mature protein and a partially processed form of the hormone are secreted after cleavage of the propeptide. There are a number of different families of TNF, but all these cytokines seem to form homotrimeric (or heterotrimeric in the case of LT-alpha/beta) complexes that are recognised by their specific receptors. TACI is a member of the tumor necrosis factor receptor superfamily and has an important role as regulator of B cell function. TACI binds two ligands, APRIL and BAFF, which it binds to with high affinity and contains two cysteine-rich domains (CRDs) in its extracellular region. Formation TACI- CRD1 forms TACI-CRD2 by removing the N-terminal cysteine rich domain by alternative splicing. This shorter form is capable of ligand-induced cell signaling and that the second CRD alone (TACI-CRD2) contains full affinity for both ligands. Ligands The ligands are type II transmembrane protein cytokines that have various effects on immune cells, including acting as a: * costimulatory molecules, * apoptotic agents, * growth factors APRIL (also known as TNSF13A, TALL-2, and TRDL-1) is a TNF ligand that is overexpressed by some tumours.

He made over 400 Football League appearances in the 1970s and 1980s. Career John Shaw played youth football with Leeds United. Shaw signed professional for Leeds United in February 1971. Shaw gained first team experience in the UEFA Cup with Leeds United, notably in a 0‚Äì4 defeat at home to Lierse S. K. of Belgium, but never appeared in the Football League for the club. Alan Dicks signed Shaw in May 1974 on a free transfer from Leeds United for Bristol City. Jimmy Mann made the same move at the same time. John Shaw had to wait in line behind regular goalkeeper Ray Cashley who was ever present in 1974‚Äì75 and again in 1975‚Äì76 when Bristol City finished runners up in the Second Division and won promotion back into the First Division after a wait of 65 years since 1911. However Shaw did make two substitute appearances in the Anglo Scottish Cup in August 1975. Cashley started in goal in season 1976‚Äì77 in the First Division before Len Bond was given a chance with two games but was injured so John Shaw finally made his League debut in goal for Bristol City in a 0‚Äì1 defeat v Birmingham City on 26 October 1976. This was the start of a run of 103 successive league appearances for Shaw. Bristol City hovered around the relegation places throughout their first season back in the First Division. Lying bottom in 22nd place with four games to go they managed two wins and two draws to finish 18th. The final game at Coventry City ended in a 2‚Äì2 draw which was enough to save both teams from relegation with the ball hardly leaving the centre circle during the last 15 minutes of the game. Shaw made 33 appearances in 1976‚Äì77. John Shaw was the only ever present City player in 1977‚Äì78 with 42 appearances as the \\"Robins\\" rose to 17th in the table. Shaw also played in all nine Anglo Scottish cup ties culminating in a two legged final 3‚Äì2 aggregate win over St Mirren in December 1977. It was during this period that John Shaw was spoken of as a possible replacement for Alan Rough in the Scotland full international team; but despite his splendid form the call to international duty never came. With Bristol City rising to 13th place in the First Division in 1978‚Äì79 John Shaw started the season in the team and missed only two games making 40 appearances. John Shaw was initially chosen as no.1 again in season 1979‚Äì80 which ended with relegation in 20th place to the Second Division. Shaw played in the first 27 league games but was replaced by Ray Cashley after a run of ten matches conceding 22 goals without a win. Shaw made 28 appearances in 1979‚Äì80 and also played in 8 of the 9 Anglo Scottish Cup ties which ended in an aggregate 1‚Äì5 defeat to St Mirren in the final. Back in the Second Division in 1980‚Äì81 Bristol City finished 21st and were relegated on downwards to the Third Division. Cashley began the season in goal before John Shaw was given his chance in December at Shrewsbury Town where City lost 0‚Äì4. The signing of Jan Moller later in December restricted Shaw to making 5 appearances in 1980‚Äì81. Bristol City suffered a third successive relegation in 1981‚Äì82 but very nearly failed to survive a mid season financial crisis in February 1982 when only a last minute acceptance of redundancy by the \\"Ashton Gate Eight\\" saved the club from potential extinction. Moller began the momentous season in goal but was a further victim of the crisis leaving the club after which Shaw took over in March making 15 appearances. This was the start of another long run of 124 successive league appearances by John Shaw. Down in the Fourth Division in 1982‚Äì83 John Shaw was the only ever present with 46 appearances as Bristol City finished in 14th place. Shaw was ever present in goal again in 1983‚Äì84 when Bristol City won promotion back to the Third Division by finishing in 4th place conceding only 44 goals the second best record in the division. Shaw made 41 appearances in the Third Division in 1984‚Äì85 as Bristol City narrowly missed another promotion finishing in 5th place. Bristol City played a benefit match for John Shaw v West Bromwich Albion on 13 May 1985 before a crowd of 1,950 fans. Shaw left Bristol City and moved on to Exeter City in July 1985. After three seasons with Exeter City Shaw joined Gloucester City of the Southern League in 1988. John Shaw overcame the loss of his hair due to alopecia while at Bristol City. Shaw's unquenchable spirit in the face of adversity won widespread admiration, and he joked about his baldness with team mates telling them: \\"You try playing behind the City defence for 11 years and see what you'd look like!\\".

Summary A writer and critic have a conversation on a train. The story uses third-person narration and opens with a writer explaining his view that Life creates much better situations than a writer ever could, and that it's a writer's job to plagiarize from actual experience, all the while cleaning up the frayed edges of \\"Life's untidy genius\\", like a producer does to a novel when making a film. The writer then recounts a true story about a passenger he heard sobbing aboard a train. After the police announced that a murderer who killed his wife and her lover was suspected to be on board the train, they checked passports and found that the weeping passenger was not the murderer. The writer and critic then discuss whether this is a good twist. The writer asks the critic to be honest and to confess that he expected the crying passenger to turn out to be the murderer. The critic tells the writer that it is the artist's job to make a story out of this apparently random experience, by providing an explanation for the weeping. The critic, after warning the writer not to overuse his method of trying to \\"produce an impression of expectancy by means of the most natural denouement\\" reminds him that \\"The Word is given the sublime right to enhance chance and to make of the transcendental something that is not accidental\\". After this, he suggests his own explanation, showcasing his complete artistic and imaginative inability: the loss of the passenger's wallet. In the end, a waitress comes to pour them more drinks (suggesting that this was just a drunken conversation between passengers).

In a burst of scientific productivity that lasted just nine years, he published 1800 pages of scholarly work, in which he described 17 new ciliate families, 57 genera, and about 700 previously unknown species. During his brief career as a protozoologist, he redescribed and illustrated nearly all the species of ciliates known in his time, and fit them into a taxonomic scheme that remains influential today.Foissner, Wilhelm. Life and Legacy of an Outstanding Ciliate Taxonomist, Alfred Kahl (1877-1946), Including a Facsimile of his Forgotten Monograph from 1943. Acta Protozoologica 2004 (Suppl.) 43: 1-69Corliss, John O. A Salute to Fifty-Four Great Microscopists of the Past: A Pictorial Footnote to the History of Protozoology. Part II. Transactions of the American Microscopical Society. 98: 1 (Jan, 1979), pp. 26-58 Kahl was born in the municipality of Warwerort, in the Dithmarschen district of Germany, a region of the country that includes the city of Hamburg. Official records show that he taught primary school in Hamburg, from 1897 to 1901, and that by 1934 he was teaching English, French and Natural History at a Gymnasium (High School) in Hamburg. Nothing else is known about his early life. His interest in ciliates began, according to his own account, when his daughter was studying under Dr. Eduard Reichenow, then head of the protozoa department at the Hamburg Tropical Institute: \\"The very interesting literature and preparations my daughter Lucia brought home fascinated me, as a dedicated biologist, and created the desire to study this field more deeply‚Ä¶Thus, I enthusiastically commenced literature reading and investigation of the small water bodies in my surroundings at the beginning of the year 1924. Within nine months, I got a rather solid knowledge in drawing and identifying many species.\\" The ciliates Euplotes harpa and Euplotes extensum, from vol. III of Wimpertiere oder Ciliata Kahl's first scholarly work, published in 1926 when he was 49 years old, was a 241-page monograph on \\"new and little-known forms of holotrich and heterotrich ciliates.\\" In the course of the next nine years, he issued a steady series of important articles, culminating in his compendious, 4-volume study of free- living ciliates, Wimpertiere oder Ciliata (Infusoria), published as part of a series on German wildlife, edited by the zoologist Friedrich Dahl. This lavishly illustrated work, which combines new research with meticulous historical and taxonomic investigations, was completed in 1935. At this point, Kahl abruptly stopped publishing. The reasons for Kahl's withdrawal from the field are not known. The ciliatologist Wilhelm Foissner speculates that he was discouraged by harsh criticism from academic colleagues, and rejection by academic journals. Despite these setbacks, his work continued to win admirers among researchers involved in the classification and identification of ciliates. Sometime in the early 1940s he returned to his microscope, producing the first part of what was supposed to be another 4-volume treatise on the infusoria. The first volume made it into print. However, in the turmoil and confusion of wartime Germany, the second part of the projected work was lost, and the remaining sections were never completed. In November 1946 (the exact date is uncertain) Alfred Kahl died of unknown causes, at the age of 69. Working methods and legacy Kahl worked alone, using a basic monocular microscope, equipped with an oil-immersion objective providing a maximum magnification of 500X. He preferred to examine living subjects, and rarely used fixed specimens or chemical stains. From his close scrutiny of living organisms, he produced simple informative freehand drawings to accompany his written observations. Despite his simple procedures, absence of collaborators and lack of formal training, he came to dominate his field, to the extent that the period from 1930-1950 has been characterized as the \\"Kahlian era\\" of ciliate systematics.Lynn, Denis. The Ciliated Protozoa: Characterization, Classification, and Guide to the Literature. 3rd edition. Springer, 2008. p. 2 During his decade of activity, he nearly doubled the number of known ciliate species, and created a body of scholarship that is still cited with regularity. This accomplishment has been described by the ciliatologist John O. Corliss as an \\"unbelievable record [that] has never been--and is hardly ever likely to be--met in the annals of protozoology and microscopy, past, present, or future.\\" Selected publications * Kahl A.

The magazine was in circulation between 1973 and 1991. It often dealt with musical applications of feminism, politics, and the environment. It was also notable for its extensive listings of new music events in the Bay Area, and later, New York. History Ear Magazine began as a volunteer-based effort in the Bay Area in 1973. It was first edited by Charles Shere and published by Ann Kish, though Beth Anderson became the principal editor by the fifth issue in May 1973. It was originally meant to provide a balance between traditional classical music and contemporary music.http://radiom.org/detail.php?omid=AM.1973.01.23.A Originally published on newsprint, yet still referred to as a magazine, early Ear was notable for its extensive concert listings and for its promise to publish at least one new musical score in each issue. Several important composers, including Lou Harrison,Harrison, Lou. \\"Precision Piece: A: Phrase for Arion's Leap\\", Ear I, January 1973. Beth Anderson,Anderson, Beth. \\"Peachy Keen-O\\", Ear V, June 1973. and Gene Tyranny,Sheff, Robert. \\"Street\\", Ear IX, November 1973. among others, contributed new scores to early issues. Over time, Ear began focusing almost exclusively on new music with special attention being paid to Bay Area composers. As it was originally conceived of as a local magazine, it was primarily circulated at Bay Area concerts and at local booksellers. = Move to New York = In 1975, Beth Anderson, moved to Brooklyn, NY and began publishing a version of Ear in New York, initially co-edited by Laurie Spiegel and Richard Hayman. Two Ears existed at this point until the California publication ended in the 1980s. In 1976, Ear began to be published by the \\"New Wilderness Foundation,\\" a not-for-profit organization and began to be published in tabloid format. Anderson left the magazine at 1978, at which point R.I.P. Hayman took the position of editor. Starting in 1980, Ear began publishing themed issues, with occasional guest editors who were experts in the field. Helen Thorington served as its Radio Editor from 1987‚Äî1989; Thorington, Regine Beyer and Gregory Whitehead, co-edited the EAR Supplement, Festival for a New Radio in 1987. In 1989, the format was again changed to glossy 8 1/2 x 11. The magazine at this point was notable for its contributions from and exclusive interviews with a diverse array of notable contemporary composers and musicians, including Pauline Oliveros, Terry Riley, and Queen Latifah. = Final run = In 1990, Ear received sponsorship from Absolut Vodka. As part of its advertising campaign, Absolut helped to produce a series of CDs to supplement the articles in the magazine, which was a very popular campaign which doubled its subscriptions. In order to support the increased costs of production, Ear put on a benefit concert, which lost money. Additionally, Ear's printer declared bankruptcy. The final issue was a 1991 Fall Supplement.

They are coordination complexes of platinum. These drugs are used to treat almost half of people receiving chemotherapy for cancer. In this form of chemotherapy, popular drugs include cisplatin, oxaliplatin, and carboplatin, but several have been proposed or are under development. Addition of platinum-based chemotherapy drugs to chemoradiation in women with early cervical cancer seems to improve survival and reduce risk of recurrence. In total, these drugs can cause a combination of more than 40 specific side effects which include neurotoxicity, which is manifested by peripheral neuropathies including polyneuropathy. Mechanism of action As studied mainly on cisplatin, but presumably for other members as well, platinum-based antineoplastic agents cause crosslinking of DNA as monoadduct, interstrand crosslinks, intrastrand crosslinks or DNA protein crosslinks. Mostly they act on the adjacent N-7 position of guanine, forming a 1, 2 intrastrand crosslink. The resultant crosslinking inhibits DNA repair and/or DNA synthesis in cancer cells. Platinum-based antineoplastic agents are sometimes described as \\"alkylating-like\\" due to similar effects as alkylating antineoplastic agents, although they do not have an alkyl group. Examples Strategies for improving platinum-based anticancer drugs usually involve changes in the neutral spectator ligands, which are usually nitrogenous. Changes in the nature of the anions (halides vs various carboxylates), and changes in the oxidation state of the metal (Pt(II) vs Pt(IV)). Nanotechnology has been explored to deliver platinum more efficiently in the case of lipoplatin, which is introduced into the tumor sites thereby reducing the chance of toxicity. Cisplatin was the first to be developed. Cisplatin is particularly effective against testicular cancer; the cure rate was improved from 10% to 85%.

Katzenbach Scholar of Law & Philosophy at Rutgers School of Law‚ÄìNewark. The book was the first extensive jurisprudential treatment of animal rights.Kunstler, William F. (1995). \\"Foreword\\" in Animals, Property, and the Law. TOC Synopsis The book is divided into an introduction, which describes Francione's concept of \\"legal welfarism,\\" followed by three parts: (1) \\"The Status of Animals as Property, (2) \\"A General Application of the Theory: Anticruelty Statutes,\\" and (3) \\"A Specific Application of the Theory: The Regulation of Animal Experimenation.\\" The epilogue is entitled, \\"An Alternative to Legal Welfarism?\\" In part 1, Francione argues that nonhuman animals are the personal property, or chattel, of their owners, even if recognized as a special kind of property. As such, they cannot themselves possess legal rights, because they are the objects of the exercise of someone else's rights. Whenever the interests of an animal are balanced against the interests of the owner (assuming the animal is recognized as having interests), the owner's interests almost always prevail, no matter how trivial they might be. Francione compares the situation to the treatment of slaves in the United States in the 18th and 19th centuries, where legislation existed that ostensibly protected them, while the courts ignored that the institution of slavery rendered that protection largely meaningless.Francione (1995), pp. 4‚Äì5. He argues further that the United States Animal Welfare Act is an example of symbolic, as opposed to functional, legislation, relying on concepts described by John Dwyer in 1990. It is symbolic, he writes (quoting Dwyer), because it is an example of a law where \\"the legislature has failed to address the administrative and political constraints that will block implementation of the statute.\\"Francione (1995), p. 208ff; also see Sherry, Clifford J (2009). Animal Rights: A Reference Handbook. ABC-CLIO, p. 248 Reception Professor Priscilla Cohn gave the book a favorable review, writing \\"Francione makes us analyze our views on animals, cruelty, what sort of pain is 'necessary,' what kind of a society allows defenseless creatures to be shot, burned, prodded, beaten, etc. His explanations are always thoughtful, his analyses penetrating, his examples interesting and entertaining.\\" Antonia Layard of Environmental Values was more critical, as she felt that Francione experienced difficulty when he \\"attempts to put something in its place, for he does not describe how Regan's theory of animal rights might be implemented in practice, a contribution most lawyers would expect him to make. In particular, Francione cites Regan to submit that animals should not have equal rights with humans, intertwining this with a statement that they do not have the same rights.\\" The Harvard Law Review was also critical, as they felt that the book was a \\"thoughtful, wide-ranged study\\" but that it \\"will do nothing to convert the confirmed speciesist\\".

There has been a Serbian community in the area since the 1940s, when Serbian POWs and anti-Communist refugees from German camps arrived in Halifax in 1947. They needed a place to worship and were given a former Methodist chapel in Simpson Street to worship in. Closed in the 1950s, it was acquired by the Serbian Orthodox Church in 1952. The building, by then in a dilapidated state, was renovated and consecrated on 26 September 1954. In 1963, a split emerged in the Serbian Orthodox community in England, and in the USA, between those who believed that the Belgrade central hierarchy of the Church was too much influenced by the Communist government there, and others who believed that they must adhere to the official Church hierarchy in Belgrade, regardless of the political complexion of the Government there. This dichotomy was exacerbated in 1964 when the Serbian Orthodox Bishop in the USA was removed from office by Belgrade, and the groups formally split. After the split, those who recognised the authority of Belgrade remained at Simpson Street, but were much reduced in numbers. In the early 1970s, that group moved to join a Serbian Church in Bradford and the Simpson Street site ceased to be a church. The larger part of the Halifax Serbian community followed the anti-communist line and established their own separate Church with links to a body in the USA known collectively there as The Free Serbian Orthodox Church in Exile. In 1965, the former Akroydon Wesleyan Methodist Church and Sunday School in Boothtown, were bought by this group. The main Church building was adapted for their style of worship with a new Social Centre created on the lower floor. The church had been built in 1871 as a Methodist church and was abandoned in 1964, when the Methodists moved to Boothtown United Methodist Chapel nearby. The interior of the church was adapted, by financial input and renovation work, to accommodate Orthodox Christian services. His Majesty King Peter II Karadjordjevic attended the formal consecration of the church by bishop Dionisije Milivojeviƒá on 5 September 1965. The property has two function halls, a car park and a vicarage. The parish priest is the Very Reverend Protopresbyter-Stavrophore Aleksandar Ilic.

He had no known criminal background before the shooting occurred. Holmes booby-trapped his apartment with explosives before the shooting, which were defused one day later by a bomb squad. Holmes was arrested shortly after the shooting and was jailed without bail while awaiting trial. Following this, he was hospitalized after attempting suicide several times while in jail. Holmes entered a plea of not guilty by reason of insanity, which was accepted. His trial began on April 27, 2015, and on August 24 he was sentenced to 12 consecutive life sentences plus 3,318 years without parole. Personal life Holmes was born on December 13, 1987 in San Diego, California. His father is a mathematician and scientist with degrees from Stanford University, UCLA and UC Berkeley, and his mother is a registered nurse. He has one sister. Holmes was raised in Oak Hills, a community near Castroville, California, where he attended elementary school. At twelve years old, Holmes moved back to San Diego. There, he lived in the Rancho Pe√±asquitos neighborhood, where he reportedly began to decline socially. He went to Westview High School and graduated in 2006. Holmes played soccer and ran cross-country in high school. He attended Pe√±asquitos Lutheran Church with his family, according to the Lutheran church's pastor. According to Holmes' lawyer, Daniel King, Holmes began to suffer from mental health issues in middle school and attempted suicide at age 11. According to Holmes, during his childhood, he was frightened of what he called \\"Nail Ghosts\\" that would hammer on the walls at night. He would also see shadows and \\"flickers\\" at the corners of his eyes, which would fight each other with firearms and other weapons. Holmes saw social worker Margaret Roth once before she sent him to psychiatrist Lynne Fenton. Holmes was depressed and \\"obsessed with killing for over a decade\\". Despite these issues, Holmes graduated from high school in 2006 and completed a bachelor's degree at University of California, Riverside in 2010. He decided to pursue a graduate degree at University of Colorado and moved to Aurora. In Aurora, Holmes lived on Paris Street in a one-bedroom apartment, in a building with other students involved in health studies at the University of Colorado. In a rental application for an apartment, he described himself as \\"quiet and easygoing\\", and in an online dating profile, Holmes identified himself as an agnostic. He left some digital footprints, like a university email address, an old Myspace photo, a dating profile on Match.com, and a profile on Adult FriendFinder, as well as a r√©sum√© at the employment website Monster.com. According to a few sources, Holmes allegedly hired prostitutes and left reviews of them on an online message board. In October 2011, Holmes began dating a fellow student in his biology class. Their relationship lasted about two months, ending when she felt distant from him following an encounter between Holmes and another man who talked to her during a date on Saint Patrick's Day. She said that Holmes often made flat jokes that made other people feel uncomfortable and had expressed his desire to kill people. She tried to recommend getting professional help despite not taking his claims seriously. They resumed their relationship in early January 2012, but it ended again in February. Holmes told a state-appointed psychiatric physician that \\"their breakup contributed to his violent depression\\". Education and career In 2006, Holmes worked as an intern at the Salk Institute for Biological Studies, where he was assigned to write computer code for an experiment. Holmes, who was described by his supervisor as stubborn, uncommunicative and socially inept, presented his project to the other interns at the end of the internship, but never completed it. Holmes wrote of his experience at the Salk Institute in a college application essay: \\"I had little experience in computer programming and the work was challenging to say the least. Nonetheless, I taught myself how to program in Flash and then construct a cross-temporal calibration model.... Completing the project and presenting my model at the end of the internship was exhilarating.\\" Graduating from Westview High School in the Torrey Highlands community of San Diego in 2006, Holmes attended the University of California, Riverside (UCR). In 2010, he received his undergraduate B.S. degree in neuroscience with highest honors. He was a member of several honor societies, including Phi Beta Kappa and Golden Key. According to UCR recommendation letters submitted to the University of Illinois at Urbana‚ÄìChampaign (UIUC), Holmes graduated in the top 1% of his class with a 3.949 GPA. The UCR letters also described Holmes as \\"a very effective group leader\\" and a person who \\"takes an active role in his education, and brings a great amount of intellectual and emotional maturity into the classroom\\". Holmes scored in the 98th percentile on the verbal portion, the 94th percentile on the quantitative portion and the 45th percentile on the analytical writing portion of the Graduate Record Examinations. In the summer of 2008, Holmes worked as a counselor at a residential summer camp in Glendale, California, which served children aged 7‚Äì14. There, he was responsible for ten children and had no disciplinary problems. In the fall of 2010, Holmes was employed at a pill and capsule- coating factory in San Diego County. One of his co-workers later said that Holmes was unsociable, and once acted strangely at a laboratory work station by staring at a blank wall and not verbally responding, only making a quick glance and smirking, when his co-worker asked if he was okay. In June 2011, Holmes enrolled as a Ph.D. student in neuroscience at the University of Colorado Anschutz Medical Campus in Aurora. He received a $21,600 grant from the National Institutes of Health, according to agency records, which was disbursed in installments from July 2011 to June 2012. Holmes also received a $5,000 stipend from the University of Colorado, Denver. Though Holmes received a letter of acceptance to UIUC, where he was offered a $22,600 stipend and free tuition, he declined their offer without specifying a reason. Reviewers of Holmes' application at UIUC remembered his application in part because he submitted a picture of himself with a llama. At the University of Colorado, Holmes sought help in 2012 for his mental state at the student health clinic after he broke up with his girlfriend. (Because he pleaded not guilty by reason of insanity, his caregivers were allowed to testify at his trial.) His first mental health professional contact was with a social worker, who wrote, ‚Äúthis is the most anxious guy I've ever seen and he has symptoms of OCD, but most concerning is that he has thoughts of killing people, though I don't think he's dangerous\\". The social worker said that it was difficult to interview him, because he would stare and take a long time to answer. Holmes told them that he never had hurt anybody and never would. The social worker noted that he had a number of odd mannerisms; for instance, when he left appointments, he would not say thank you, goodbye, or other customary remarks on his way out. The worker also thought that he may be having a psychotic break. He was seen by psychiatrist Dr. Lynne Fenton, who testified at his trial that she was worried about his homicidal ideation expressed in their last meeting. She saw him a total of seven times over three months, twice with a male psychiatrist. Holmes rejected their suggestions for treatment. In June 2012 after Holmes had sent her a threatening email, she activated a threat assessment team to help her formulate a plan for Holmes. She listed specific concerns, such as his long-standing fantasies about killing as many people as possible, his reluctance to discuss any details about his plans, his refusal to allow them to talk to anyone else and the unclear timeline; she didn't know if he was always that way or if this was a new behavior. She consulted with his mother, who said he had longstanding social problems. Although the center offered to treat him if he lost his insurance, he left treatment. His final diagnosis there was Schizoid personality disorder with two rule-outs: Schizophreniform disorder and autism spectrum disorder. In 2012, Holmes' academic performance declined, and he scored poorly on the comprehensive exam in the spring. The university was not planning to expel him; however, Holmes was in the process of withdrawing from the university. Three days after failing a key oral exam at the university in early June 2012, Holmes dropped out of his studies without further explanation. At the time of his arrest, he gave his occupation as \\"laborer.\\" Aurora theater shooting =Background= Holmes' defense attorneys stated in a motion that he was a psychiatric patient of the medical director of Anschutz's Student Mental Health Services prior to the Aurora shooting. The prosecutor disagreed with that claim. Four days after the release of the defense attorney's motion, the judge required this information to be blacked out. CBS News later reported that Holmes had met with at least three mental health professionals at the University of Colorado before the massacre. One of them, who was informed by Holmes of his homicidal thoughts, considered placing him on an involuntary mental health hold, but decided against it, noting her belief that Holmes was borderline and the commitment would only inflame him. One of Holmes' psychiatrists suspected that prior to the shooting, Holmes suffered from a mental illness that could have been dangerous. A month before the tragedy, Dr. Lynne Fenton told the campus police that he had also made homicidal statements. Two weeks before the massacre, Holmes sent a text message asking a graduate student if the student had ever heard of the disorder dysphoric mania, and warning the student to stay away from him \\"because [he was] bad news\\". Holmes was a fan of superheroes, including Batman, and his apartment was decorated with Batman paraphernalia. Dave Arag√≥n, an actor from the MTV television series Pimp My Ride, stated that Holmes called him twice the month before the shooting took place. Arag√≥n was the writer, director, and star of a then-upcoming film entitled The Suffocator of Sins, which depicts a vigilante who shoots criminals, and Arag√≥n claimed that Holmes showed interest in his movie's trailer. According to Arapahoe County District Attorney George Brauchler, Holmes chose the Century 16 theater for his attack because he liked movie theaters and that specific theater had doors that he could lock in order to increase the number of casualties, as well as being in an area where police response would take longer. He specifically chose to attack a midnight screening because he believed fewer children would be present, not wanting to kill them. Holmes allegedly considered other locations for a mass shooting, such as an airport, but ruled it out because an airport would have too much security. He also wrote his reasoning that an attack on an airport would be confused as an act of terrorism, saying, \\"Terrorism isn't the message. The message is, there is no message.\\" In addition, he had been considering using explosives, chemical agents, or biological agents in his attack, but rejected the scenario as he thought he might \\"blow himself up\\". Holmes had also considered serial killing as an option, but later reasoned it was \\"too personal, too much evidence, easily caught, few kills.\\" =Prelude= On May 22, 2012, Holmes purchased a Glock 22 pistol at a Gander Mountain shop in Aurora. Six days later, on May 28, he bought a Remington 870 Express Tactical shotgun at a Bass Pro Shops store in Denver. On June 7, just hours after failing his oral exam at the university, he purchased a Smith & Wesson M&P15; Sport rifle. All three of these weapons were bought legally, and background checks were performed. In the four months prior to the shooting, Holmes also bought 3,000 rounds of ammunition for the pistol, 3,000 rounds for the M&P15;, and 350 shells for the shotgun over the Internet. On July 2, he placed an order for a Blackhawk Urban Assault Vest, two magazine holders, and a knife at an online retailer. He also purchased spike strips, which he later admitted he planned to use in case police would shoot at or follow him in a car chase. On June 25, less than a month before the shooting, Holmes emailed an application to join a gun club in Byers, Colorado. The owner, Glenn Rotkovich, called him several times throughout the following days to invite him to a mandatory orientation, but could only reach his answering machine. Holmes left Rotkovich one voicemail in reply. Due to the nature of Holmes' voicemail, which Rotkovich described as \\"bizarre\\", \\"freaky\\", \\"guttural\\", \\"spoken with a deep voice\\", \\"incoherent and rambling\\", Rotkovich instructed his staff to inform him if Holmes showed up, though Holmes neither appeared at the gun range nor called back. \\"In hindsight, looking back ‚Äì and if I'd seen the movies ‚Äì maybe I'd say it was like the Joker ‚Äì I would have gotten the Joker out of it... It was like somebody was trying to be as weird as possible,\\" Rotkovich said. On July 19, just hours before the shooting started, Holmes mailed a notebook to his psychiatrist. The notebook detailed his thoughts and plans during the weeks preceding the shooting. The notebook was found in an undelivered package in the Anschutz Medical Campus mail-room. Immediately prior to the shooting, Holmes reportedly called a crisis hotline for mental health with the hopes that someone would talk him out of committing the massacre at the last minute. However, the call was disconnected after nine seconds. =Arrest= Century 16 at right On July 20, 2012, police arrested Holmes without resistance while he was standing next to his car behind the Century 16 theater, moments after the shooting. Holmes had sneaked out an exit door, propped it open, and returned with weapons and other gear, setting off several gas or smoke canisters and then opening fire on the theater audience, killing 12 and wounding 70. According to testimonies during the following trial, Holmes was initially \\"calm and detached\\" during the arrest, but became interested in watching the aftermath of the shooting after being placed in the back of a police car. The responding officers recovered several guns from inside the car and the theater. Once apprehended, Holmes told the police that he had booby-trapped his apartment with explosive devices before heading to the theater. Police later confirmed the presence of explosives in the apartment. Legal proceedings =Detention and pretrial court appearances= Holmes was initially jailed at Arapahoe Detention Center, under suicide watch. He was being held in solitary confinement to protect him from other inmates, a routine precaution for high-profile cases. Holmes made his first court appearance in Centennial, Colorado, on July 23, 2012, before Judge William B. Sylvester. He was read his rights and no bail was given due to the nature of the charges. A mandatory protection order was issued by the judge. The judge appointed a public defender. Holmes said nothing and never looked at the judge. His appearance and behavior, which was described as \\"dazed\\" and \\"confused\\" fueled speculation about his mental state. Holmes was represented by the Colorado State Public Defender. On July 30, Colorado prosecutors filed formal charges against Holmes that included 24 counts of first degree murder, 116 counts of attempted murder, possession of explosive devices, and inciting violence. The multiple charges expand the opportunities for prosecutors to obtain convictions. For each person killed in the shooting, Holmes was charged with one count of murder with deliberation and one count of murder with extreme indifference. Holmes agreed in court to waive his right to a preliminary hearing within 35 days. On August 9, Holmes' attorneys said their client was mentally ill and that they needed more time to assess the nature of his illness. The disclosure was made at a court hearing in Centennial where news media organizations were asking a judge to unseal court documents in the case. On September 19, the prosecution filed a motion to add 10 new charges against Holmes and asked to amend 17 others. The additional charges would bring the total counts Holmes faces to 152. Holmes appeared in the Arapahoe County Court house the following day for the first time without his dyed-red hair, but with cropped hair revealing his natural brown color. On September 28, court documents released by prosecutors say Holmes was revoked access to the University of Colorado campus because he threatened a professor. The university has said Holmes was denied access to non-public parts of the campus because he had withdrawn from school. On October 11, Holmes' attorneys asked Judge William Sylvester to postpone a preliminary hearing scheduled for November. On October 25, the preliminary hearing was set for the week of January 7. Holmes' lawyers filed an emergency motion on November 14 to delay a pre-trial hearing, citing an unspecified condition that has left him unable to appear in court: \\"As a result of developments over the past 24 hours, Mr. Holmes is in a condition that renders him unable to be present in court for tomorrow's hearing.\\" They requested to delay the hearing, which they received. It was rescheduled for December. Evidently, Holmes made various suicide attempts referred to as \\"half-hearted\\" in the days before the scheduled hearing on November 15. Holmes returned to court on January 7, 2013, at which 9-1-1 phone call recordings and videos from the cineplex were presented as evidence, information that up until then had not been released. Holmes' defense team continued to maintain that he was mentally ill. On that same day, it is reported that investigators seized four prescription bottles and immunization records from his apartment when it was searched in July 2012. It was not revealed what the prescriptions were or what they were for. The judge ultimately ruled in October that prosecutors could keep the items. On January 10, 2013, a judge ruled that the evidence presented is sufficient for Holmes to face trial on all counts with which he has been charged. His plea hearing was delayed until March 2013. On March 27, 2013, Holmes' attorneys said he would be willing to plead guilty to avoid the death penalty. On March 28, prosecutors said they were not ready to accept Holmes' offer to plead guilty and avoid the death penalty and also criticized the offer as a deliberate ploy by the defense in order to delay the start of the trial. On April 1, 2013, prosecutors announced they would seek the death penalty in a trial to start in February 2014. On May 7, 2013, Holmes' attorneys filed their intent for him to plead not guilty by reason of insanity. He made this change in his plea on May 31. On May 23, 2013, Holmes' attorneys called the state's insanity-plea rules unconstitutional. On May 29, 2013, the judge ruled about the constitutionality of the laws for insanity-plea questioned by Holmes' attorneys, concluding that the laws are not in violation of the Constitution. On June 4, 2013, the presiding judge accepted his plea of insanity defense. On August 5, 2013, Holmes was transferred to the Colorado Mental Health Institute in Pueblo, Colorado. By August 20, 2013, Holmes was no longer detained at Colorado Mental Health Institute; he was transferred back to jail. =Trial= On February 27, 2014, Arapahoe County District Court Judge Carlos Samour set the start of Holmes' trial for October 14. The trial was delayed to December 8 upon a defense request for a continuance to further evaluate Holmes' mental condition. \\"Judge sets new Dec. 8 trial date for James Holmes \\" The Denver Channel, July 22, 2014. On that date, the trial was again postponed, as Holmes' lawyers asked for another continuance to further prepare their case and review the paperwork of evidence. Jury selection eventually started on January 20, 2015, after a request by Holmes' lawyers for yet another continuance was denied. The juror selection process lasted three months and summoned 9,000 candidates, making it the largest jury summons in U.S. history. On April 15, selection ended, with a total of nineteen women and five men serving. There were concerns about the selection of the jurors since at least two from the pool of twelve primary jurors, along with twelve alternatives, had ties to the 1999 Columbine High School massacre: \\"Juror No. 535\\", was the aunt of a Columbine survivor; and \\"Juror No. 737\\", was a student there at the time and was also a former friend of the shooters. The trial began on April 27 with opening arguments by the prosecution explaining that Holmes intentionally went to the movie theater that evening with the deliberate intent to kill as many people as possible in a mass shooting spree. The defense opened their argument by admitting the facts that Holmes was the shooter, but said that he is mentally ill with severe schizophrenia and was never in control of his right mind. Starting on April 28, and over the next few weeks, prosecution testimony included various survivors of the massacre and the after-effects it had on the survivors. On May 26, the notebook Holmes mailed to his psychiatrist hours prior to the shooting was presented as evidence. There had previously been intense debate as to whether the notebook was eligible as evidence and should be admitted, since it details Holmes' thoughts. Prosecutors argued the content in Holmes' notebook, which had attack plans, proved the shooting was premeditated, while Holmes' attorneys argued that his writing indicated his mental illness. On May 27, Dr. William Reid, a court- appointed psychiatrist who interviewed Holmes for a total of about 22 hours, testified that Holmes was mentally ill but legally sane. He diagnosed him as having schizotypal personality disorder, which is characterized by constricted behavior and difficulties relating to others. Reid and another doctor evaluated Holmes in December 2013, determining him to be legally sane, and said that his mental illness did not prevent him from forming intent and knowing the consequences of his actions. Holmes' attorneys tried to call for a mistrial, saying that the jurors heard an unprompted opinion that complicated the legal standard for judging the sanity of a person, but the judge refused to grant the request. On May 29, videos of Reid's interviews with Holmes in 2013 were shown to the court. In the videos, Holmes described his social awkwardness and the violent, paranoid thoughts he had been having prior to the massacre. He also stated his belief that he was being followed by federal agents at the time of the massacre and hoped they would apprehend him at the theater before he could act. According to him, he transitioned from suicidal thoughts to homicidal thoughts after becoming depressed from his breakup with his girlfriend. On June 8, a second psychiatrist, Jeffrey Metzner, testified that Holmes was mentally ill but legally sane when he plotted and carried out the shooting, and that he suffers from schizoaffective disorder. He interviewed Holmes for a total of 25 hours. On June 9, the trial came to a standstill after three jurors were dismissed by the judge for violating orders to refrain from talking about news reports regarding the trial. One of the jurors had begun discussions about sensitive details of the case with the other two jurors outside of the court on at least two occasions. Two days later, Holmes's attorneys requested the dismissal of a fourth juror after her brother-in-law was shot during a robbery the previous day, and other jurors had seen her crying. Judge Carlos Samour responded that he would consider it, and agreed to the motion by dismissing her on June 15. On June 17, a fifth juror was dismissed after Judge Samour was advised that she personally knew a wounded victim of the shooting. On June 19, the prosecution called as their last witness Ashley Moser, the mother of slain victim Veronica Moser-Sullivan. Moser was critically injured and left paralyzed by the shooting. Afterward, they rested their case. On July 9, Samour asked Holmes if he would testify in court, and advised him of his rights to do so. Holmes chose not to testify. On July 10, the defense showed two videos of Holmes' behavior in his jail cell. One video showed him running and slamming his head against the wall before sitting down, while the other showed him tethered to a bed while naked, attempting to cover his head with a blanket and then a sheet. Afterward, they rested their case. On July 14, closing statements were made following a delay after the defense claimed some of the images which the prosecution planned to show to the jury were improper. The judge ordered for some of the slides to be changed or removed, explaining that they misstated or exaggerated the evidence. Jury deliberations began on July 15 and continued into July 16. =Verdict and sentencing= On July 16, after deliberating for over twelve hours, the jurors found Holmes guilty on all twenty-four counts of first- degree murder, 140 counts of attempted first-degree murder, one count of possessing explosives, and a sentence enhancement of a crime of violence. They began deciding his sentence on July 22. The court expected the sentencing phase to last for one month. Holmes declined to make an allocution statement. On July 23, the jury ruled that Holmes acted in a cruel manner, was lying in wait, and ambushed his victims during the shooting, which constitute as aggravating factors. However, the jurors decided that Holmes did not intend to kill children when he opened fire. On July 27, Holmes' sister testified that her brother became withdrawn from the family after they moved from Salinas to San Diego during his early teenage years. On July 28, Holmes' father pleaded for his son's life, stating that he is severely mentally ill and does not deserve to die, regardless of his crimes. He displayed photos of camping trips and family vacations with Holmes to the jury. On July 30, Holmes' lawyers made a final appeal to the jurors, urging them to consider mental illness in his sentencing despite their rejection of the insanity defense used in the trial. The appeal for clemency was rejected on August 3, under the basis that mitigating factors such as mental illness did not outweigh aggravating factors such as the number of casualties in the massacre. On August 7, Holmes was sentenced to life in prison without the possibility of parole after jurors failed to unanimously agree on a death sentence. One juror was opposed to sentencing Holmes to death due to his mental health issues, while two other jurors were uncertain. Formal sentencing began on August 24 and ended on August 26. On August 26, Samour formally sentenced Holmes to 12 life sentences without the possibility of parole for the murder charges, and an additional 3,318 years for the attempted murder and explosives possession charges. In imposing the sentence, Samour stated for the record that it was \\"the intention of the court that the defendant never sets foot in free society again,\\" and added that \\"the defendant deserves no sympathy.\\" =Restitution= On December 4, 2015, Judge Carlos Samour ordered Holmes to pay $955,000 in restitution to the victims. The judgment ordered $851,000 of the restitution to be sent to the state victim compensation fund, and $103,000 to be paid directly to the victims. Imprisonment In September 2015, Holmes was moved to the Colorado State Penitentiary in Ca√±on City. Authorities said they had not determined at which facility Holmes would be ultimately incarcerated and that it was possible he might be moved out of state due to his high profile. On October 8, 2015, Holmes was assaulted by another inmate, identified as Mark Daniels, who was convicted of auto theft. Daniels attacked Holmes after a prison guard inadvertently opened a gate separating the two of them; he struck Holmes twice before being subdued by prison staff. At the time, Holmes was not allowed interaction with other inmates. As a result of the attack, he was secretly transferred to an undisclosed location out of the state. According to the inmate locator on the Federal Bureau of Prisons website, Holmes is incarcerated at USP Allenwood in Gregg Township, Union County, Pennsylvania. The exact reason for the transfer to federal custody is not known for certain but seems to be at least in part due to a heightened need for security.

Juan Dolio has 2,488 inhabitants (2010 ) and belongs to the district municipality Guayacanes. Geographical Location Main Districts of Juan Dolio The former fishing village of Juan Dolio is located on the Caribbean Sea and extends over a length of about 7 km along the coast and on both sides of the access road Avenida Boulevard passing through Juan Dolio. The western and eastern end of the access road Avenida Boulevard connects Juan Dolio with the highway DR-3 Autovia Del Este which bypasses the village in the north. The distance to the country's capital Santo Domingo, located west of Juan Dolio, is about 50 km and the provincial capital of San Pedro de Macor√≠s is about 12 km in the eastern direction. While the north and east of the village consists mainly of wide pastures, fallow land and sugar cane fields, the western part of Juan Dolio passes almost seamlessly into the community of Guayacanes. Also in the western direction are the tourist town Boca Chica (approx. 23 km) and the Las Am√©ricas International Airport (30 km). History In the pre-Columbian era, Juan Dolio was the site of an indigenous Arawaks settlement of the Ta√≠no people known as El Corral with its cemetery near the western end of the bay. The natural bay of the Playa Juan Dolio protected by the coral reef in front was used as a harbor for their canoes. Occasionally are still archaeological findings made in the center area of Juan Dolio. Since the late nineteenth century the community of Juan Dolio was a section of the municipality of San Jos√© de los Llanos. On May 8, 1884, by Decree No. 2223, the communities of Juan Dolio and Guayacanes were segregated and added to the Maritime District of San Pedro de Macoris. The legal foundation of the tourist destination Juan Dolio, began with the enactment of Decree No. 3133 of January 23, 1973, which sets the limits and extension of the area populated by fishermen and farmers. During the late 1980s Juan Dolio became one of the first tourist resorts in the country and an exclusive destination for mainly European tourists. Later the business concept of an All-inclusive resort offered by the various hotels lead to a tourist boom and the construction of new hotels in the western part of Juan Dolio, Villas Del Mar. In 1995 the hotels in Juan Dolio had a daily average of 5,500 tourists. After Hurricane Georges devastated Juan Dolio in 1998, many of the hotel chains moved their business further east where the new tourist destination B√°varo-Punta Cana was just built from the ground. The owners of the damaged resorts in Juan Dolio had problems attracting new business partners and most of the beach hotels were closed. Some of the older hotels were demolished and became development sites for real estate projects. With the low cost of properties after the hurricane damage, developers found a new opportunity and started second homes projects in the area. Projects like Guavaberry Golf Club and Metro Country Club became very popular. Since 2006 Juan Dolio is part of the municipality of Guayacanes, the latest district in the San Pedro de Macor√≠s Province, created by Law No. 203-06 of May 3, 2006. Formally established in December 2007, the town council of Guayacanes is now also responsible for the administration of Juan Dolio. Infrastructure The center of the elongated village is located near the bay Playa Juan Dolio, which is a popular beach among locals and visitors. The bay is also used by the remaining few local fishermen to land their boats. In the north-west of the town center lies the district of Mar Del Sol, in the north lies the gated community of the Metro Golf & Country Club and in the east of the center begins the district of Villas Del Mar. The western part of Juan Dolio adjoins the neighboring community and administration headquarters of the district, Guayacanes. The village is traversed by a main street, Calle Principal, running parallel to the beach and the access road Boulevard. On weekends the Calle Principal can be driven in only one direction from west to east. Located along the main street are numerous small shops, restaurants, bars, guesthouses, mostly small residential buildings and an occasional multi-story apartment building. Newly created during the past two decades, at the eastern end of the Calle Principal starts the district of Villas Del Mar, which also houses the two major beach resorts of Juan Dolio. Financially strong investors have used Villas Del Mar in the past repeatedly for their real estate development projects. The zone is characterized by modern high-rising apartment towers and some luxurious residential complexes, in some cases still under construction. Playa Juan DolioPlaya Juan Dolio Beaches The beach in the center of the community, the Playa Juan Dolio, is publicly accessible and provides parking spaces for visitors. The view from the main road to the beach of Villas del Mar, the Playa Real, is blocked by high-rising condo buildings. The free access to the Playa Real is often limited by the private security personnel of the different condo towers along the beach. All beaches in the different sections of Juan Dolio were renewed and extended within a government project in the winter of 2006/07 and attract, especially on weekends, a growing number of visitors. The public beach of Juan Dolio, the Playa Juan Dolio, is not as famous as the beach of the tourist town Boca Chica for instance, but seems more natural and unspoiled. Coconut palms grow on the sand, the sea is turquoise and there is no large hotel in sight.

The construction of Frederiksholm Fortress was begun in 1655. After the fort Christians√∏ was abandoned on 1 May 1658, the stones, building materials and other useful material were transferred to Fredriksholm. The new fortress was completed in 1662. It is named after Frederick III of Denmark. The fortress was divided into a lower and an upper part. The lower part was a wall that followed the shoreline. The upper part had a tower with a cupola and 2 artillery batteryes. The tower was the residence of the commander, and this was also the royal chambers. Otherwise, there were a number of large and small houses in the Fort area. Fortress walls were of stone, covered outside with turf and palisadeverk. The peat was taken from a cemetery wall in such large quantities that the coffins were almost uncovered. Within the wall there was a gallery. When the fortress was completed, consisted the luminaire of 14 cannons on the lower part and 10 guns on the upper. The fortress was originally armed with 24 guns from 2-to 34 pounds. In 1700 the fortress was at its largest, armed with 50 cannons. Garrison was in 1658 on the 24 man. The strength of the fortress, however, varied depending on the threat of war and the season. It could be up to 110 men at the castle during the summer, while there were around 30 in winter. Fredriksholm was timed to be able to accommodate 300 men. On the mainland in the north was in 1808‚Äì1809 built a defense battery which had the task to cover the land by Fredriksholm. The area known as Batteriodden.

Issued by the government of William III and Mary II, the corulers of the Kingdom of England, the charter defined the government of the colony, whose lands were drawn from those previously belonging to the Massachusetts Bay Colony, Plymouth Colony, and portions of the Province of New York. The territorial claims embodied in the charter also encompassed all of present-day Maine (some of which had been claimed by the Massachusetts Bay Colony), New Brunswick, and Nova Scotia. The charter was approved by William and Mary on October 7, 1691 and established English rule of the colony, by appointing a governor, deputy governor and secretary, to be elected by members of the council. It took away many of its rights of self- government that had previously been enjoyed by Massachusetts and Plymouth authorities, transitioning the power in Boston from elected to royally appointed governors. William and Mary appointed Sir William Phips as the new governor. The charter established freedom of worship and removed religious restrictions on voting, although Roman Catholics were still frowned on. Economically the charter benefited the British by reserving the right of free fishery to British interests only. Towns across the colony grew in status as a result of the charter. History With the Glorious Revolution and the 1689 Boston revolt the Dominion of New England fell apart. The Dominion had been an attempt by the Crown to consolidate some North American colonies into one entity and consisted of the Massachusetts Bay Colony, Province of New Hampshire, Plymouth Colony, Colony of Rhode Island and Providence Plantations, Connecticut Colony, Province of New York, and Province of New Jersey. With the breakup of Dominion the Crown consolidated colonies around New England, specifically the Massachusetts Bay Colony, the Plymouth Colony, and territories such as Martha's Vineyard and Nantucket. With the dissolution of the Dominion many colonies were concerned about their future status of annexation by other colonies. For instance the Plymouth Colony was originally meant to be transferred to the Colony of New York however the colonial leaders insisted that they become part of the Massachusetts Bay Colony instead.Hutchinson 1765, p.350.Hutchinson 1765, p.355. Portrait of William Phips who served as the Royal Governor of Massachusetts Bay and who brought the 1691 Charter to New England from London A draft of the charter was drawn up by the Attorney-General which allowed the Royal Governor to be chosen by the Crown, however the Governor's Council, the Deputy Governor and the lower house of the General Court were to be elected by the colonists. These proposals were dismissed by the Privy Council on the grounds it gave too much control to the colonists and diminished the rightful authority of the Crown. In 1692 William Phips arrived in Boston with a copy of the new charter that was written by the Privy Council. Although many in Massachusetts Bay objected to their not being able to return to their original 1629 charter (other colonies were allowed to return to their original charters). Despite opposition from many colonial leaders, when Phelps arrived he assembled the General Court and the majority of members approved the charter and declared a day of prayer and thanksgiving.Hutchinson 1765, p.361.Hutchinson 1765, p.365. Effects of the Charter Other than an increase in land under control of the General Court in Boston there were other \\"constitutional\\" changes as well. The religious requirement that had existed for suffrage was changed to a property requirement. This widened the margin of those men able to vote. The lower house of the General Court was to remain intact and allowed to continue to pass governmental rulings with the condition that the Royal Governor had veto power. The upper house of the legislature was to be codified as the Governor's Council instead of the previous \\"Board of assistants\\". These councilors were to be elected by the General Court with the Governor's assent. The General Court was to be given control of most Provincial affairs aside from admiralty and commercial rulings. These areas were to remain under the control of Royal Officers appointed by the monarchy. The Governor was given control of the militia however the House of Representatives had to consent to any officers receiving commission. The General Court was also given authority of the treasury, this included the Governor's as well as all royal officer's pay. With a friction existing between the General Court and the Governor the Royal Governor was limited in power and authority in most matters to that of a head of state rather than a head of government.Morison 1917, p.9. With the passage of what came to be known as the Intolerable Acts by the Parliament of England many colonists became dissatisfied with the governmental arrangement. This political tension culminated in the Boston Tea Party which resulted in the cancellation and dissolution of the General Court by Thomas Gage. The members of the General cited the 1691 Charter as their constitutional authority and did not recognize the actions of Gage as legitimate. The delegates then met and formed the Massachusetts Provincial Congress in 1774. The Provincial Congress became the revolutionary government of the Province of Massachusetts Bay, with the 1691 acting as the de facto constitution of Massachusetts Bay until the formulation and passage of the Constitution of Massachusetts in 1780.Morison 1917, p.9.Morison 1917, p.10.Morison 1917, p.12.Morison 1917, p.11.

The club had a very short life of only 20 years being dissolved in 1968. History =Foundation= Arsenal de Llavallol was established on 12 October 1948 by An√≠bal D√≠az, a fan of English football who was also the president, coach and business man of the club. Arsenal had been founded with the purpose of participating in \\"Torneos Evita\\", the children's football championship organized by Fundaci√≥n Eva Per√≥n that was very popular by those years. After the team won the 1950 Evita's championship with a team formed by players drafted around the country, the Ministry of Finance of Argentina collaborated with Arsenal giving the club some lands located in Llavallol, Greater Buenos Aires, where the club built its headquarters and stadium, which was made of concrete instead of wood as many clubs had by then. Once the works finished, Arsenal requested Argentine Football Association (AFA) being affiliated to play the official tournaments of Argentine football league system. =Official championships= The AFA accepted the request in 1952 so Arsenal made its debut that same year in Tercera de Ascenso (current Primera D). During its first tenure on the official football Arsenal totalized 16 points. In 1954 Arsenal promoted to Segunda de Ascenso division (current Primera C) along with arch-rival Sacachispas although the team had been finished 5th. That happened because Arsenal had requested AFA to play at a higher division due to its number of members and the stadium conditions, which fulfilled the conditions demanded by the Association. Some of the most notable players of the team promoted were Humberto Maschio, Vladislao Cap, Omar S√≠vori and Antonio Angelillo who would later win the 1957 South American Championship with the Argentina national team. Arsenal did not have successful campaigns in the Primera C and the team was relegated again in 1958. After disputing 14 fixtures of the 1959 championship, Arsenal was disaffiliated from the Football Association due to a conflict with club's president D√≠az, who was accused by the Association of forging AFA president Daniel Colombo's signature to transfer players outside Argentina. The team did not play again officially until 1962. =Acquisition by Boca Juniors= In 1962 Arsenal became a reserve team of Boca Juniors which acquired its facilities and other assets. The presidents of each club, Alberto J. Armando (Boca Juniors) and An√≠bal D√≠az (Arsenal), signed an agreement for Boca to buy Arsenal at a price of three and a half million pesos.\\"Goles\\" magazine, 1 January 1962 After becoming Boca Juniors' subsidiary, Arsenal changed its former brown and gold jersey to the blue and gold of Boca Juniors. =Final years= Team of the champion 1964. In 1964 Arsenal won the title for the first time, beating Ituzaing√≥ in a playoff at Nueva Chicago's stadium. √Ångel Rojas (who would later become a Boca Juniors star) and Oscar Pianetti were the most notable players of the team that achieved promotion to Primera C. Arsenal played in that division until 1968, when the \\"de facto\\" Government presided by Juan Carlos Ongan√≠a demanded the restitution of Arsenal's lands that had been donated to them during the presidency of Juan Per√≥n. The lands where the club had built its facilities were restored to the Province and the stadium demolished. Club Arsenal was also left behind by Boca Juniors which had acquired La Candela, a facility dedicated to training Boca's youth players. Arsenal was disaffiliated from AFA on 12 October 1968, exactly 20 years after its foundation, and dissolved soon after.

Among the various other geographic features believed of Diyu, the capital city has been thought to be named Youdu. It is generally conceived as being similar to a typical Chinese capital city, such as Chang'an, but surrounded with and pervaded with darkness. Name \\"You\\" () in Chinese means \\"dark\\". \\"Du\\" () means \\"capital\\". Thus, Youdu is the Dark Capital (Yang 2005: 236). Among other meanings, You can mean \\"hidden\\", \\"secluded\\", and is in particular used to indicate the underworld. Location Youdu is located under the earth, in the Region of Darkness, also known as Diyu, or the Yellow Springs. The general ruler of this realm is Houtu, but there are many other functionaries which have been believed to inhabit this region, and with the more important individuals being located in Youdu, as the capital city and seat of government. Description Youdu has been described in various texts, as well as being depicted in art. Sometimes differences exist according to the religious affiliation of the text, for example whether more Buddhist, folk- oriented, or secular. Being located in the darkness underground is the most common feature. Generally, lighting is provided by torches and candles. Youdu may be the best-lit area of Diyu. =Inhabitants= Youdu is the home or official residence of various deities, and also the location of their official offices or palaces. The souls of the dead are their fellow inhabitants and subjects. There are also many subordinate demons which serve to carry out the commands of the judges. Many of these are concerned with punishing or processing the souls of the dead for reincarnation. The sovereign deity is generally considered to be King Yama. Beneath him in rank ten other kings serve as judges of the souls of the dead. =Creatures= Various creatures also inhabit Youdu, including a creature that can determine truth from falsehood. =Places= Youdu is generally conceived of as similar to a typical historical Chinese capital city, such as Chang'an. Thus, it has a city wall, palaces, a hall of justice, and various residences for the ghosts of the dead. Especially important is the housing for the official records, which allow the various judges to determine proper punishments, or occasionally to allow someone who dies before their officially allotted time has expired to be returned to life. Especially important in this regard are the place of King Yama and the Ten Courts of Justice.

It is an arch bridge constructed from reinforced concrete. Construction began in 1926 and the bridge was completed in 1928. It was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1980. This is the third bridge to be built on this site across the Congaree River. The first, built around 1827, was burned down in the American Civil War and the second, built in 1870, was replaced by the current bridge. At the time of its construction it was the widest roadway in the state. It was the only bridge across the Congaree River until 1953. Architecture The bridge is an arch bridge constructed from reinforced concrete with open spandrels. The bridge is crossed by a roadway flanked by sidewalks. The balustrades along the edges of the bridge carry green-painted, cast iron light fixtures at intervals. The decorative fixtures of these lamp posts have the letter C and a palmetto palms on the bases, a vine pattern on the eight-sided post, and an acanthus leaf design on the necking. It is one of four open spandrel concrete bridges in South Carolina as well as the oldest and most decorative of the three bridges that cross the Congaree River. Geography The Gervais Street Bridge is located in Columbia, South Carolina. It carries U.S. Route 1 (US 1) and US 378 across the Congaree River. Within the city, the bridge links Gervais Street on the east bank to Meeting Street on the west bank. The bridge connects Columbia with the south and west parts of South Carolina. This bridge is close to the site where the Broad River and the Saluda River meet to form the Congaree River. History This is the third bridge built on this site. The remains of both previous bridges can be seen north of the current Gervais Street Bridge. The first was a wooden bridge. The Columbia Bridge Company was charted in 1819 to construct the bridge and it was completed in about 1827. The early planners of Columbia intended Senate Street and Assembly Street to be the two main thoroughfares of the city. However, for engineering reasons, the bridge across the Congaree River was constructed at the foot of Gervais Street, which caused the traffic to bypass Senate Street. The latter became a residential area instead while Gervais Street acquired more activity and commerce; which was further enhanced with the arrival of major railroads. The Confederate States Army burned the first bridge in 1865 to delay the progress of General Sherman's army during the American Civil War. The second bridge was constructed in 1870. It was privately owned until 1912, when it was purchased by Richland County in cooperation with Lexington County. The building of the current bridge began in February 1926 and the bridge was completed in June 1928. It was designed by the bridge engineer for the State Highway Department, Joseph W. Barnwell of Charleston, and constructed by the Hardaway Contracting Company of Columbus, Georgia. Until 1953, Gervais Street Bridge was the only bridge across the Congaree River. At the time of its construction it was the widest roadway in the state.

Construction Combination buses are built by installing a complete box body equipped for transporting people onto a truck chassis. The body is independent and separate from the driver. There is usually no passage between the cab and box body but there is usually an intercom system. The body is equipped with windows, a separate internal lighting and heating and/or air conditioning systems. Related bodies are different types of mobile workshops or specialized military superstructure. Passenger comfort is generally minimal. Some companies such as Ha'argaz manufacture combination buses by installing a partial bus body on an all-wheel-drive truck chassis. Usage Due to the minimum of comfort provided by the combination bus, they are suitable for transport over short distances only.

There had been a continuous Greek presence in Cappadocia since antiquity, and the indigenous populations of Cappadocia, some of whose Indo-European languages (cf. Phrygian) may have been closely related to Greek, became entirely Greek-speaking by at least the 5th century. In the 11th century Seljuq Turks arriving from Central Asia conquered the region, beginning its gradual shift in language and religion. In 1923 following the genocide of the minorities of Turkey the surviving Cappadocian Greek native communities were forced to leave their homeland and resettle in modern Greece by the terms of the Greek‚ÄìTurkish population exchange. Today their descendants can be found throughout Greece and the Greek diaspora worldwide. Historical background Mount Aktepe near G√∂reme and the Rock Sites of Cappadocia (UNESCO World Heritage Site) =Early migrations= Apollonius of Tyana (1st century ad), a Greek Neopythagorean philosopher from the town of Tyana in Cappadocia The area known as Cappadocia today was known to the Ancient Persians as Katpatuka, a name which the Greeks altered into Kappadokia (Cappadocia). Before Greeks and Greek culture arrived in Asia Minor, the area was controlled by another Indo-European people, the Hittites. Mycenaean Greeks set up trading posts along the west coast around 1300 BC and soon started colonizing the coasts, spreading Hellenic culture and language. In the Hellenistic era, following the conquest of Anatolia by Alexander the Great, Greek settlers began arriving in the mountainous regions of Cappadocia at this time. This Greek population movement of the 3rd and 2nd centuries BC solidified a Greek presence in Cappadocia. As a result, Greek became the lingua franca of the region's natives. It would become the sole spoken language of the region's inhabitants within three centuries and would remain so for the next one thousand years. After the death of Alexander the Great, Eumenes of Cardia, one of the Diadochi of Alexander the Great, was appointed satrap of Cappadocia, where he set up Greek settlements and distributed cities to his associates. Eumenes left behind administrators, judges and selected garrison commanders in Cappadocia. In the following centuries the Seleucid Greek Kings founded many Greek settlements in the interior of Asia Minor, and this region would become popular for the recruitment of soldiers. Unlike other regions of Asia Minor where Greeks would settle in cities, most of the Greek settlements in Cappadocia and other interior Anatolian regions were villages. The Hellenistic Kings would make new Greek settlements in Cappadocia and other surrounding regions in order to secure their hold on this volatile region, under their rule Greek settlements would increase in the Anatolian interior. In the centuries following Alexander the Great's death, Ariarathes, the son of a Persian satrap who formerly controlled Cappadocia, gained control of Cappadocia and left it to a line of his successors, who mostly bore the name of the founder of the dynasty. These kings began to intermarry with neighboring Greek Hellenistic kingdoms, such as the Seleucids. During their reign Greek towns were beginning to appear in the southern regions of Cappadocia. Ariarathes V of Cappadocia who reigned from 163 to 130 BC is considered to have been the greatest of the Kings of Cappadocia. He was predominantly Greek by descent, his father Ariarathes IV of Cappadocia was half Greek Macedonian and Persian and his mother was Antiochis, was the daughter of the Seleucid Greek King Antiochus III of the Seleucid dynasty. By the 1st century BC, regions of Cappadocia had been ravaged by Armenian King Tigranes the Great, who had relocated a great number of Cilician and Cappadocian Greeks to Mesopotamia (geographically in modern Iraq, eastern Syria and south-eastern Turkey.) =Roman Period= Archelaus who was a Roman client prince was the last to rule as a king of Cappadocia. He was a Cappadocian Greek nobleman, possibly of Macedonian descent and was the first king of Cappadocia of wholly non-Persian blood. He ruled over Cappadocia for many years before being deposed by Tiberius who took possession of Cappadocia for Rome. The region of Cappadocia produced some notable Greek individuals in antiquity, such as Apollonius of Tyana (1st century ad) who was a Greek Neo- Pythagorean philosopher who became well known in the Roman Empire and Aretaeus of Cappadocia (81‚Äì138 AD) who was a native Greek, born in Cappadocia and is considered to have been one of the foremost surgeons on antiquity. He was the first to distinguish between diabetes mellitus and diabetes insipidus, and the first to provide a detailed description of an asthma attack. Byzantine fresco in a Cappadocian rock-cut church at G√∂reme depicting Jesus Christ with the twelve apostles. By late antiquity the Cappadocian Greeks had largely converted to Christianity. They were so thoroughly devout to Christianity that by the 1st century AD, the region of Cappadocia served as a stronghold for Christian Monasticism and was of significance importance in the history of early Christianity. In the early centuries of the Common Era Cappadocia produced three prominent Greek patristic figures, known as the three hierarchs. They were Basil the Great (c. 330‚Äì79), Bishop of Caesarea in Cappadocia. Gregory of Nazianzus (c. 330‚Äìc. 389 AD) (later known as Saint Gregory the Theologian) and Gregory of Nyssa (died c. 394). These Cappadocian Greek fathers of the fourth century revered the ancient Greek cultural pursuit of virtue, even studying Homer and Hesiod and ‚Äústood squarely in the tradition of Greek culture‚Äù. =Byzantine Period= By the fifth century the last of the Indo-European native languages of Anatolia ceased to be spoken, replaced by Koine Greek. At the same time the Greek communities of central Anatolia were becoming actively involved in affairs of the Byzantine Empire and some Greek Cappadocians such as Maurice Tiberius (r. 582‚Äì602) and Heraclius would even serve as Emperors. The region became a key Byzantine military district after the advent of Islam and the subsequent Muslim conquest of Syria led to the establishment of a militarized frontier zone (cf kleisoura and thughur) on the border of Cappadocia. This lasted from the mid-7th to the 10th century during the Arab‚ÄìByzantine wars, immortalized in Digenis Akritas, the Medieval Greek heroic epic set in this frontier region. During this period Cappadocia became crucial to the empire and produced numerous Byzantine generals, notably the Phokas clan, warlords (see Karbeas of Tephrike), and intrigue, most importantly the Paulician heresy. Because they were living in such a volatile region, the Cappadocian Greeks created elaborate underground cities in the volcanic formations of eastern Cappadocia and would take refuge in them during times of danger. The Cappadocian Greeks hid in these rock-cut underground towns from many raiders over the next millennium, from 9th century Arab invaders to 11th century Turkish conquerors to 15th century Mongols. As late as the 20th century the local Cappadocian Greeks were still using the underground cities as refuges (Greek: Œ∫Œ±œÑŒ±œÜœçŒ≥ŒπŒ±) from periodic waves of Ottoman persecution. The most famous of these ancient underground cities are at the Cappadocian Greek villages of Anaku-Inegi (ŒëŒΩŒ±Œ∫Œøœç) and Malakopi-Melagob (ŒúŒ±ŒªŒ±Œ∫ŒøœÄŒÆ). The Greeks were removed from these villages in 1923, and they are now known as Derinkuyu and Kaymakli. These underground cities have chambers extending to depths of over 80 meters. Gregory of Nazianzus (- AD) In the Middle Ages Cappadocia had hundreds of settlements and Byzantine rock-cut churches were carved out of the volcanic formations of eastern Cappadocia and decorated with painted icons, Greek writing and decorations. Over 700 of these Churches have been discovered and date from the period between the 6th century to the 13th century, many of these monasteries and churches continued to be used until the population exchange between Greece and Turkey 1920s. The Greek inhabitants of these districts of Cappadocia were called Troglodytes. In the 10th century Leo the Deacon recorded a journey to Cappadocia by Nikephoros Phokas, in his writings he mentions that its inhabitants were called Troglodytes, in view of the fact that they ‚Äúwent underground in holes, clefts and labyrinths, as it were in dens and burrows‚Äù. The Byzantines re-established control of Cappadocia between the 7th and 11th centuries, during this period churches were carved into cliffs and rock faces in the G√∂reme and Soƒüanlƒ± region. In the Middle Ages the Cappadocian Greeks would bury their religious figures in and around monasteries. In recent years mummified bodies have been found in abandoned Greek monasteries of Cappadocia, and many, including bodies of mummified babies, are on display in the Nigde Archaeological Museum. A well-preserved mummified corpse of a young Christian woman is popular with tourists; the blonde haired mummy is believed to be a nun and dates from the Byzantine era, from the 6th to the 11th century. It was discovered in a sixth- century Greek chapel in the Ihlara Valley of Cappadocia. During the tenth century the Byzantine Empire had pushed east into formerly Arab-ruled lands, including most of Armenia, and had resettled thousands of Armenians into various regions of Cappadocia. This population shift intensified ethnic tensions between the Cappadocian Greeks and the Armenian newcomers in Cappadocia, and left Armenia largely devoid of native defenders. =Turkish Cappadocia= Basil Giagoupes (BŒ±œÉŒØŒªŒµŒπŒøœÇ ŒìŒπŒ±Œ≥ŒøœçœÄŒ∑œÇ), a 13th-century Cappadocian Greek feudatory lord who held the court title of general (amir arzi) in the army of Mesud II, Sultan of the Seljuk Sultanate of Rum. In 1071 AD the Byzantine Empire suffered a considerable defeat at the Battle of Manzikert in Armenia. This defeat would open the interior of Anatolia to invasion by Central Asian Seljuq Turks who would overrun most of Byzantine Asia Minor. This began the transformation of Asia Minor from an entirely Christian and overwhelmingly Greek-populated region to a primarily Muslim and Turkish center. Several Armenian royal families, which included Gagik of Ani and Adom and Abu Sahl of Vaspurakan, sought vengeance on the local Greek Orthodox population after persecutions of the Armenians and Syriac Monophysites by the Byzantines. They used the opportunity provided by the Seljuq conquest to target the Greeks, they tortured and then assassinated the Greek Orthodox metropolitan of Kayseri and pillaged wealthy Greek owned estates. The local Greek landowners eventually killed the Armenian royal Gagik. By the 12th century all of Anatolia was overrun by Turkmen tribes from Central Asia, these invading nomads had cleared many regions of Anatolia of indigenous Greeks. The Anatolian Greek population rapidly diminished under Turkish rule owing to mass conversions to Islam, slaughter or exile to Greek territories in Europe. Before the Turkish migration into Anatolia, Greeks as well as smaller numbers of Armenians, Syrians, and Georgians were all Christians, but by the 15th century more than 90% of Anatolia was Muslim, according to some researchers largely because of Christian conversions to Islam. Many Byzantine Greek leaders were also tempted to convert to Islam in order to join the Ottoman Turkish aristocracy, although in the beginning of the 20th century, the proportion of Christians in Anatolian population was more than 20%. During the centuries of Turkish rule in Asia Minor many Greeks and other peoples of Anatolia such as Armenians and Kurds adopted the Turkish language, converted to Islam, and came to be identified as Turks. Despite the turmoil in Anatolia, by the 13th century the Greeks of Cappadocia, Lycaonia and Pamphylia remained numerous, even under the pressure of the Turkmen nomads, possibly constituting majorities in some urban centers. During this chaotic period there is evidence that some native Cappadocian Greeks had joined the invading Turkish nomads. Some even managing to rise to levels of prominence in the Seljuq Sultanate of Rum, such as Basil Giagoupes (BŒ±œÉŒØŒªŒµŒπŒøœÇ ŒìŒπŒ±Œ≥ŒøœçœÄŒ∑œÇ), a wealthy Cappadocian Greek feudatory lord of a strongly Greek district who held the court title of general (amir arzi) in the army of the Seljuq sultan of Konya, Mesud II. He dedicated a church in the Peristrema (Belisƒ±rma) valley where his portrait, which was painted from life still survives to this day. 13th century Cappadocian Greek artists were renowned for their naturalistic paintings and were employed throughout the Seljuk Empire. Cappadocian Greeks were also employed as architects, such as Kalo Yianni, who was commissioned to build the G√∂k Medrese (Sivas) in 1271. Abandoned Greek Orthodox churches carved into a solid stone cliff face, G√∂reme Open Air Museum, Cappadocia, Nev≈üehir/Turkey. Over the course of the 15th century the Ottoman Turks conquered Cappadocia from the Seljuk Turks, the Cappadocian countryside remained largely Greek populated, with a smaller Armenian population even after the Ottoman conquest. During the reign of Ottoman Sultan Murad III (1574 to 1595) the region of Cappadocia became largely Turkified in culture and language through a gradual process of acculturation, as a result many Greeks of Cappadocia had accepted the Turkish vernacular and later became known as ‚ÄòKaramanlides‚Äô. This name derives from the region of Cappadocia which was called Karaman by the Turks in honor of the Turkish chieftain Karamanoglu, though the Cappadocian Greeks continued to call the region ‚ÄòLaranda‚Äô, its ancient Greek name. These Turcophone Greeks lived primarily in the region of Karamania although there were also significant communities in Constantinople and in the region of the Black Sea. Cappadocian Greeks living in remote less accessible villages of Cappadocia remained Greek-speaking and Christian, as they were isolated and consequently less affected by the rapid conversion of the bordering districts to Islam and Turkish speech. The Greek Cappadocians retained the original Greek names of many regions of Cappadocia which were renamed Turkish names during the Ottoman era, such as the town known as ‚ÄòHagios Prokopios‚Äô in the Middle Ages, and renamed ‚ÄòUrgup‚Äô by the Turks was still called ‚ÄòProkopion‚Äô by the local Greeks of the early 20th century. Frescoes in St. John (G√ºl≈üehir) Church, Cappadocia, Turkey. Although the Karamanlides abandoned Greek when they learned Turkish they remained Greek Orthodox Christians and continued to write using the Greek Alphabet. They printed manuscript works in the Turkish language using the Greek alphabet, which became known as ‚ÄòKaramanlidika‚Äô. This was not a phenomenon that was limited to the Cappadocian Greek Karamanlides, as many of the Armenians living in Cappadocia were also linguistically Turkified, although they remained Armenian Apostolic (Orthodox) Christians, they spoke and wrote in the Turkish language although still using the Armenian Alphabet. Some Jewish inhabitants of the Ottoman Empire were also Turkified and although they retained their religion, they also wrote in the Turkish language but using Hebrew script. The Cappadocian Greeks, Armenians and Jewish minorities of the Ottoman Empire had created Graeco-Turkish, Armeno-Turkish, and Judeo-Turkish literatures by developing their own written traditions. Despite the fact that they had lost all knowledge of their own languages after they had been Turkified, the majority of Karamanlides and many Turkophone Armenians eventually revived their original native tongues. While most Cappadocian Greeks had remained Orthodox Christians a significant number of the Karamanlides even converted to Islam during this period. As with other Greek communities, these converts to Islam were considered \\"Turks\\", as being a Muslim was synonymous with being Turkish to the Greeks of the Ottoman Empire. Greek writers would erroneously describe Greek converts to Islam as ‚ÄúTourkeuoun‚Äù (Œ§ŒøœÖœÅŒ∫ŒµœçŒøœÖŒΩ) or becoming Turkish. European visitors to the sultans' realms would also subjectively label any Muslim a \\"Turk\\" regardless of his or her mother tongue. The Greeks believed that by converting to Islam and ‚Äòlosing‚Äô his or her original Christian religion, the individual was also stepping out of the Greek national community. This way of thinking was even popular years after the dissolution of the Ottoman Empire. Many shifts of population took place in central Anatolia during the period of Ottoman rule. Subsequent to the 1571 Ottoman conquest of Cyprus, the Ottoman Sultan Selim I decided to transfer Greeks from Cappadocia, particularly from the Kayseri region, to Cyprus. During this period the architect Sinan, who was born of Greek parentage and a native of Cappadocia wrote a letter to the Sultan asking for his family to be spared from this population transfer. During the Ottoman era, Cappadocian Greeks would migrate to Constantinople and other large cities to do business. By the 19th century, many were wealthy, educated and westernized. Wealthy Cappadocian Greek businessmen built large stone mansions in regions of Cappadocia such as Karvali (modern G√ºzelyurt) many of which can still be seen today. The Cappadocian Greeks wrote the earliest published novels in the Ottoman Empire in the 19th century, using the Greek Alphabet and Turkish language. Cappadocian Greeks from different regions would specialize in a particular profession, such as the caviar trade. Demetrius Charles Boulger later describes their work character, \\"Each village is connected with some particular guild in Constantinople; one supplies bakals or small storekeepers, another sellers of wine and spirits, another dryers of fish, another makers of caviare, another porters, and so forth.\\"‚Äô =Modern= A Cappadocian Greek wedding in Kermira (Germir), Kayseri, Cappadocia, in 1902. A passage in the Underground City In the early 20th century, Greek settlements were still both numerous and widespread throughout most of today‚Äôs Turkey. The provinces of Cappadocia and Lycaonia had a large number of Greek settlements and sizeable populations in urban centres such as Kayseri, Nigde, and Konya. According to 1897 estimations, the sanjak of Konya had a total Greek population of 68.101 (6.6%) and according to Ottoman population statistics of 1914, the sanjak of Niƒüde had a total Greek population of 58.312 (20%) and the sanjak of Kayseri had a total of 26.590 (10,1%).Kemal Karpat (1985), Ottoman Population, 1830‚Äì1914, Demographic and Social Characteristics, The University of Wisconsin Press, p. 160-161, 188‚Äì189 The Cappadocian Greeks of the 19th and 20th centuries were renowned for the richness of their folktales and preservation of their ancient Greek tongue. The underground cities continued to be used as refuges (Cappadocian Greek: Œ∫Œ±œÑŒ±œÜœçŒ≥ŒπŒ±) from the Turkish Muslim rulers. As late as the 20th century the locals were still using the underground cities to escape periodic waves of Ottoman persecution. Dawkins, a Cambridge linguist who conducted research on the Cappodocian Greek natives in the area from 1909‚Äì1911, recorded that in 1909, Scholars passing through Cappadocia during the 19th century described the Cappadocian Greeks and their habits. In 1838 British scholar Robert Ainsworth wrote that \\"The Cappadocian Greeks are, generally speaking, pleasing and unreserved in their manners, and their conversation indicated a very high degree of intelligence and civilization, where there are so few books, and so little education, and consequently, little learning.\\" Sir Charles William Wilson, British consul-general in Anatolia from 1879 to 1882, described their character: =Persecution and population exchange= By the early 1900s the region of Cappadocia was still inhabited by Christian Cappadocian Greeks as well as Muslim Turks and also communities of Armenians and Kurds. By the beginning of the First World War, the Greeks of Anatolia were besieged by the Young Turks. Thousands of Greeks were massacred, approximately 750,000 Anatolian Greeks were massacred in an act of Genocide and 750,000 exiled. The Greeks were targeted prior to and alongside the Armenians and Assyrians. Ionian and Cappadocian Greek deaths alone totaled 397,000, while Pontian Greek deaths numbered 353,000 people. Turkish official Rafet Bey was active in the Genocide of the Greeks of the Anatolian interior, on November 1916 he stated \\"We must finish off the Greeks as we did with the Armenians‚Ä¶today I sent squads to the interior to kill every Greek on sight‚Ä¶\\" During the Greco-Turkish War (1919‚Äì1922) countless numbers of Greeks were deported by the Turks to the Mesopotamian desert where many perished. On January 31, 1917, Chancellor Theobald von Bethmann-Hollweg of Germany reported that: : In 1924, after living in Cappadocia for thousands of years, the remaining Cappadocian Greeks were expelled to Greece as part of the population exchange between Greece and Turkey defined by the Treaty of Lausanne, the descendants of the Cappadocian Greeks who had converted to Islam were not included in the population exchange and remained in Cappadocia, some still speaking the Cappadocian Greek language. Many Cappadocian towns were greatly affected by the expulsion of the Greeks including Mustafapa≈üa (Sinasos), √úrg√ºp, G√ºzelyurt and Nev≈üehir as the Greeks constituted a significant percentage of the towns population. The Cappadocian Greeks were taken to the coastal town of Mersin in order to be shipped to Greece. Many would lose all of their belongings due to corrupt officials and looters. The Cappadocian Greeks who were migrating from Cappadocia were replaced by Muslims migrating from mainland Greece, mainly from Thrace; some of these Muslims were Greeks (see Greek Muslims), although most were of Slavic, Turkish and Gypsy origin. Many of the Cappadocian Greek churches were converted to mosques after the Greeks left in the population exchange of the 1920s. These include the Church of St Gregory known today as \\"Buyuk Kilise Camii (Big Church Mosque)\\". Cappadocian Greek athletic seminary team \\"Argaios\\" in Kayseri (1907). The team was named after Mt. Argaios, a famous volcano in Cappadocia. Following the population exchange there was still a substantial community of Cappadocian Greeks living in Turkey, in Constantinople, they had settled there during the Ottoman era and formed enclaves of their native communities, the majority of whom also migrated to Greece following the Anti-Greek Istanbul Pogrom riots of 1955. On their arrival in mainland Greece, many Cappadocian Greeks settled in villages similar to their original Cappadocian villages; the new settlements were named after towns and villages left behind in Cappadocia, with the addition of the word ‚ÄúNea‚Äù (New). For example, Cappadocian Greeks from Sinasos (present Mustafapa≈üa near √úrg√ºp) who settled in the northern part of the island of Euboea in Greece named their new settlement Nea Sinasos \\"New Sinasos\\". Other examples include Nea Karvali in northern Greece, and Neo Prokopi in central Greece. The regions of Greece with significant settlements of Cappadocian Greeks include the cities of Karditsa, Volos, Kilkis, Larisa, Chalkidiki, Kavala, Alexandroupoli and Thessaloniki. Today the descendants of the Cappadocian Greeks can be found throughout Greece, as well as in countries around the world particularly in Western Europe, North America and Australia as part of the Greek diaspora. The modern region of Cappadocia is famous for the churches carved into cliffs and rock faces in the G√∂reme and Soƒüanlƒ± valleys. The region is popular with tourists, many of whom visit the abandoned underground cities, houses and Greek churches carved and decorated by Cappadocian Greeks centuries ago. The formerly Greek town of G√ºzelyurt (Karvali) has become popular with tourists who visit the abandoned stone mansions built centuries ago by wealthy Cappadocian Greek businessmen. Today, more than 700 Greek Orthodox churches and over thirty rock-carved chapels, many with preserved painted icons, Greek writing and frescos, some from the pre-iconoclastic period that date back as far as the 6th century, can still be seen. As of 1985 these Greek cave churches were designated a UNESCO World Heritage Site. Language Demotic in yellow. Pontic in orange. Cappadocian in green, with green dots indicating individual Cappadocian Greek speaking villages in 1910.Dawkins, R.M. 1916. Modern Greek in Asia Minor. A study of dialect of Silly, Cappadocia and Pharasa. Cambridge: Cambridge University Press. Greek inscription in Mustafapasa, Cappadocia. The Cappadocian Greeks traditionally spoke a dialect of the Greek language known as Cappadocian Greek. Cappadocian Greek diverged from the other Byzantine Greek dialects early, beginning with the Turkish conquests of central Asia Minor in the 11th and 12th centuries, and so developed several radical features, such as the loss of the gender for nouns.Dawkins, R.M. 1916. Modern Greek in Asia Minor. A study of dialect of Silly, Cappadocia and Pharasa. Cambridge: Cambridge University Press. However, having been isolated from the crusader conquests (Fourth Crusade) and the later Venetian influence of the Greek coast, it retained the Ancient Greek terms for many words that were replaced with Romance language ones in Demotic Greek. After centuries of Ottoman rule the Turkish language began to emerge as the dominant language of Cappadocia. Many Greeks began to speak Turkish as a second language and became bilingual, this was the case with the ‚ÄúKouvoukliotes‚Äù who were always Greek speakers and spoke Turkish with a strong Greek accent, and there were Cappadocian Greeks who only spoke the Turkish language and had given up the use of Greek centuries earlier, known as the Karamanlides. At the beginning of the 20th century, the Cappadocian Greek language still had a strong presence at G√ºl≈üehir (formerly Arabison/Arapsu) north-west of Nevsehir, and in the large region southward as far down as Niƒüde and Bor. Greek was also still spoken at Silli north-west of Konya, in Pharasa (today's √áamlƒ±ca village in Yahyalƒ± district) and other villages in isolated communities in the interior of central Turkey prior to the Genocide of 1915 and subsequent population transfers. Many Cappadocian Greeks completely abandoned Greek when they learned Turkish, although in the western regions of Cappadocia many Greeks still retained their native language. John Robert Sitlington Sterrett travelled through Cappadocia in 1884 and noted: \\"Melegobi is a large and flourishing village, inhabited almost exclusively by Greek-speaking Greeks. The Greeks are numerous all through the western part of Cappadocia, and generally cling to their language with great tenacity, a fact worthy of notice, inasmuch as the Greeks in other parts of Asia Minor speak only Turkish. Instances of Greek-speaking towns are Niƒüde, Gelvere, Melegobi (ŒúŒµŒªŒøŒ∫ŒøœÄŒπŒ±), and Ortak√∂y in Soƒüanlƒ± Deresi.\\" In the early 20th century scholars and linguists studying the Cappadocian Greeks observed that many Cappadocian Greek villages had begun to replace their native Greek language for the Turkish language. During the 19th-century British scholar John Pinkerton was informed by the Turkish-speaking Greeks that past Turkish rulers of Anatolia had caused them to lose the knowledge of the Greek language, Pinkerton reported that: : In the 1920s when the Cappadocian Greeks arrived in Greece, the Cappadocian Greek spoken by them was hardly intelligible with the Demotic Greek used in mainland Greece, as it had been cut off from the rest of the Greek-speaking world for centuries. The Cappadocian Greeks were more linguistically Turkified then the Greeks in Pontus and the western coastal regions of Turkey. Once in Greece though, they started using the modern Greek language, causing their ancestral Greek dialect, the Cappadocian Greek language, to go to the brink of extinction. The Cappadocian Greek language was believed by some scholars to have been extinct for many years. The language was then declared alive in 2005, when descendants of Cappadocian Greeks were discovered still speaking the language fluently in central and northern Greece. Today it is still spoken by mainly elderly Cappadocian Greeks in various regions of Greece including in Karditsa, Volos, Kilkis, Larisa, Thessaloniki, Chalkidiki, Kavala, and Alexandroupoli. Some Cappadocian Greeks who converted to Islam, allowing them to avoid the population exchanges of 1923, still speak the language in their traditional homeland in Turkey. Culture The Cappadocian Greeks have been isolated from the rest of the Greek-speaking world for centuries and this has made their culture, way of life, and customs somewhat distinctive. Their culture has been strongly influenced by the topography of its different regions. In the middle of the 18th century, after the Hatt-i humayun ,the Greek feeling was stimulated, more schools were founded in the area and Greek was taught above. In commercial cities like Kayseri and Malakopea upper-level education and arts flourished under the protection of a cosmopolitan middle class. The economy of Cappadocia was largely based upon agriculture and mining and the rural centers which lay upon the valleys and plains. The Cappadocian Greeks have distinctive traditional songs and dances which are still performed in Greece. = Early Cappadocian Greek literature = Cappadocian Greek children wearing traditional costumes in Greece. The Persian poet Rumi (1207‚Äì1273), whose name means \\"Roman\\", referring to his residence amongst the \\"Roman\\" Greek speakers of Cappadocia, wrote a few poems in Cappadocian Greek.ŒîŒ≠Œ¥ŒµœÇ, Œî. 1993.

Sent on foot by his father as a teenager, with the entire family savings, to Istanbul, Elia's uncle was supposed to establish a new life and, eventually, to bring the rest of the family to the city. In the end Elia's uncle traveled much further, to America, later fulfilling his filial duty and bringing his family over as well.

These include the preparing of wind-cured meats known as pastirma,Andrew Dalby, Siren Feasts, p. 109, 201 a delicacy called in Byzantine times \\"paston,\\" along with the use of the ubiquitous Central Anatolian spinach-like herb madimak to make dishes such as a variant of spanikopita.

The brothers were members of the Bal≈°iƒá family, which earlier held Zeta, but had now placed itself among the nobility in Albania. They participated in founding of the League of Lezh√´, an alliance led by their maternal uncle Skanderbeg. Ivan and Gojko supported Skanderbeg until he died in 1468 and then continued to fight against Ottomans together with Venetian forces. After Skanderbeg's death Venice installed Ivan Strez Bal≈°iƒá as Skanderbeg's successor.  Family  According to Gjon Muzaka and Karl Hopf, Ivan Strez Bal≈°iƒá and his brother Gojko were children of Vlajka Kastrioti and Stefan Strez who was a son of ƒêuraƒë Bal≈°iƒá, an illegitimate child of ƒêuraƒë I Bal≈°iƒá.Gopƒçevi 1914, p. 460: \\"Bez√ºglich der Strez herrscht Verwirrung.

Both views confirm that Gojko was Skanderbeg's nephew.Spandouginos-Nicol, p. 96: \\"Iella, who married Paul Bal≈°a\\"  Life  The three Bal≈°iƒá brothers joined the League of Lezh√´, an alliance formed by their maternal uncle Skanderbeg, after meeting in Lezh√´ on March 2, 1444. The members included Lek√´ Zaharia, Peter Spani, Lek√´ Dushmani, Andrea Thopia, Gjergj Arianiti, Theodor Musachi, Stefan Crnojeviƒá, and their subjects. Skanderbeg was elected its leader, and commander in chief of its armed forces numbering a total of 8,000 warriors. Ivan was the commander of a unit of 500 cavalry sent by Skanderbeg to support Ferdinand I of Naples, whose rulership was threatened by the Angevin Dynasty, before Skanderbeg himself led a military expedition to Italy. Ivan Strez Bal≈°iƒá was perceived by Venice as Skanderbeg's successor. After Skanderbeg's death Ivan and his brother Gojko Bal≈°iƒá, together with Leke, Progon and Nicholas Dukagjini, continued to fight for Venice. In 1469 Ivan requested from the Venetian Senate to return him his confiscated property consisting of Castle Petrela, woivodate of \\"Terra nuova\\" of Kruje (unknown position), territory between Kruje and Durr√´s and villages in the region of Bushnesh (today part of the Kod√´r-Thuman√´ municipality). Venice largely conceded to the wishes of Ivan Bal≈°iƒá and installed him as Skanderbeg's successor.  Death  The Venetian chronicler Stefano Magno recorded details about Ivan's death. Ivan insisted that Venetian grain supplies to the Ottoman besieged Kruj√´ could only be transported through his territory after a yearly licence was paid to him. Venetian governor of Scutari, Leonardo Bold√º, realised that Ivan's requests could have serious consequences. He gathered forces consisting of Venetian militia from Scutari, commanded by their voivoda and joined with the forces of many noble families from Albania who were loyal to Venice. Ivan Bal≈°iƒá prepared an ambush in the house where he met with Venetians but they managed to kill Ivan in the ensuing fight and threw his head out of the house in front of his stunned followers.

Background By early February 1746 John Campbell, 4th Earl of Loudoun, supporter of the British government had nearly 2000 men under his command, mostly from the Independent Highland Companies. He waited at Inverness for the Jacobites under Prince Charles Edward Stuart, however he was ordered by Duncan Forbes, Lord Culloden to quit Inverness in view of the superior size of the Jacobite force. The Independent Companies were then transported over the Cromarty Firth, then over the Dornoch Firth and into Sutherland without loss. Loudon's retreat had left him and his force 28 miles away from the Old Fort George in Inverness, which was now stranded beyond any possible hope of relief in the midst of the Jacobite force of 3,000 men. The siege The Old Fort George had somewhat cramped lines of defence, with the tower of the original tower house still standing inside the newer bastioned rampart. The governor of the fort, Major George Grant, had at his disposal two Independent Highland Companies, those of the Laird of Grant and the Master of Ross, as well as eighty or so regular troops of Gusie's 6th Regiment who were reckoned \\"some of Loudon's best men\\". James Drummond, 3rd Duke of Perth assumed overall command on the Jacobite side, to the annoyance of Sir John O'Sullivan who believed that he and the Marquis d'Eguilles were managing perfectly on their own. O'Sullivan carried out his reconnaissance on the morning of 19 February and saw that the fort's double layered defenses were too formidable for the Jacobites to escalade and also proof against the single cannon that was available to them. However, O'Sullivan noticed that the foundations were unstable and made the bastion facing the bridge vulnerable to mining. That evening O'Sullivan and Colonel James Grant set their men to work in opening the mine. They built an emplacement on the Bara Hill overnight, and on the morning of the 20 February they opened fire with their cannon. The defenders of the fort were powerless to stop the progress of the mine, their hand grenades had little effect and they could not depress the barrels of their cannon sufficiently to bring them to bear on their enemy. Major George Grant with good reason, feared that the rampart would be blown up beneath him, and therefore surrendered the fort on the 21 February 1746. Aftermath When news of the surrender reached the Lord Justice Clerk in Edinburgh, he complained that Grant could have held the Jacobites at bay for a few more days, and the Duke of Cumberland exclaimed that he was \\"no way able to explain how, or by what it is so, but a silly affair it is\\". The Jacobites plundered the ample provisions from inside the fort and Prince Charles Edward Stuart ordered the curtain walls to be razed and the bastions blown up, in order for the fort to be of no use if it fell back into the hands of the government.

It is a functional beverage which serves to calm a person but unlike other calming beverages such as tea, relaxation drinks almost universally contain more than one active ingredient. Relaxation drinks may be served chilled and carbonated. Others have now been introduced in shot- form. History The concept of relaxation drink first emerged from Japan in 2005 when a group of products were introduced to the market enriched with gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA). In 2007, a couple group of kitesurfers from KƒÅne ªohe Bay and Lanikai beach of O'ahu Hawai'i developed a drink which they dubbed the relaxation drink with their own formula containing gamma- aminobutyric acid (GABA), L-Theanine and L-Threonine providing similar calming effects found in kava or valerian roots (rhizo) which later became known as lanilai. Lani is a common Hawaiian word meaning 'sky' or 'heaven' and ' means 'calm after the storm', and hence ' carries the meaning of 'heavenly calm'. Kava roots are well known in the Pacific Islands and mostly grown in Tonga and Fiji. Kava is known to be used for social rituals and celebrations. Melatonin is another major ingredients found in relaxation drinks which also carry some controversy due to negative effects from long term use. Relaxation drinks have been known to contain other natural ingredients. Common ingredients in relaxation drinks may contain kava root, melatonin, valerian root, gamma- aminobutyric acid (GABA), Chamomile, Melissa officinalis, L-Theanine, L-Threonine, 5-Hydroxytryptophan or Passiflora. Relaxation drinks are usually free of caffeine and alcohol but some have claimed to contain marijuana. Function Relaxation drinks are formulated to help reduce stress, anxiety, improve focus, and promote better sleep. Relaxation drinks can be considered the anti-energy drink and have found a niche alongside energy drinks. Some relaxation shots, particularly those with L-theanine, have been known to be used alongside coffee as a way to counter some of the jittery-feeling caffeine can produce. Uses In many scenarios, people use relaxation drinks for dealing with stressful situations, after a work day, after strenuous exercise or before bed time. Further uses have also included aiding anxiety relief. Studies have found that ingredients found in relaxation drinks can help promote alpha wave brain wave patterns to improve focus. Depending on the formulation, relaxation drinks may promote Rapid eye movement sleep (REM) sleep. Relaxation drinks have been known to reduce stress, anxiety and calm nervousness due to their calming effects on the nervous system. People who are allergic to alcohol, recovering from alcohol abuse or have liver problems have resorted to drinking relaxation drinks because its ability to calm nerves and provides what people call a \\"buzz\\" however it is alcohol free which does not bring about the well known hangover. This is all dependent on the nutritional content which varies from one relaxation drink to another. There are reports of melatonin causing this next-day grogginess feeling. People with Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) have been known to use relaxation drinks to substitute for Dexedrine because of the properties to help focus thoughts. Some relaxation drinks can cause drowsiness and should not be taken while driving or operating heavy machinery.

It sits high above the valley of the Zwickauer Mulde in the Free State of Saxony.  History  In the course of the settlement of the Ore Mountains, a fortifications was built on a rocky spur above the confluence of the Wildbach stream and the river Mulde. Archaeological finds indicate that this site already existed in the 12th century. The name \\"Isenburg\\" goes back to the name Vas and indicates either iron mining, which took place in the vicinity (see also: Bad Schlema Show Mine), or it meant \\"iron\\" in the sense of \\"impregnable\\". Little is known about the history of spur castle and its violent destruction. There are no verified, documented references. Oral traditions - the first account dates to 1738 - called the Isenburg a \\"robber castle,\\" the \\"Old Castle\\" (Altes Schloss) and the \\"Iron Castle\\" (Eisenburg), from which its present name is derived. But there are no medieval sources. The castle had been destroyed by the 14th century and was never rebuilt. Its ruins were probably used from the 15th to 17th centuries as shelters for the local population during times of conflict. Around 1750, the remains of the castle were demolished to build the stone church in Wildbach. In 1934 the remains of the ramparts were exposed by the Reich Labour Service. The foundations of the ramparts and the remains of the round bergfried were restored in 1993.  Design  Western view An outer, lower and upper bailey can be made out and there was also a cistern. The site covers an area of 51 x 33 metres, the tower has a diameter at its base of about 9 metres and a wall thickness of 3 metres. The only easily accessible, western, side of the castle was also protected by a ditch. The inner and outer shell is made of horizontal layers of brick, whilst the core is lined with cut stone laid in a herringbone pattern (opus spicatum).  Access  The recommended way to visit the castle ruins is by foot from Hartenstein railway station which takes about 30 minutes. Only about 200 metres from the station is Stein Castle. At this spot the route crosses the Zwickauer Mulde river to a point immediately below Schloss Wolfsbrunn. Here the route turns left and winds through the Poppenwald upstream and parallel to the Mulde. After a short, but steep, climb known as \\"Gentle Henry\\" (Sanfter Heinrich), the path forks. Keeping right, the route passes the Wildbach Church on an easy forest path. Here there are signs to the ruins which are another 700 metres further on. The left-hand fork leads via a wild and romantic narrow path on top of the river bank of the Mulde to the same destination. This path is called the \\"Raubrittersteig\\" (\\"Robber Baron Climb\\") and is one of the most attractive walks in the Mulde Valley. Very close to the Isenburg, but on the opposite bank of the Mulde, is the Prince's Cave. The path continues further upstream towards Bad Schlema where a radium spring is reached after about 1 kilometre.

Origins Prestbury is thought to have been born in the mid-1340s. The estimate is based on the assumption that he was about 24 in 1370, the year of his ordination to the priesthood. There are many villages in England called Prestbury, but it is thought that of these the most likely place of birth would be Prestbury, Cheshire, near Macclesfield. Monk and academic Shrewsbury Abbey interior. Prestbury was ordained a subdeacon on 13 March 1367, marking the latest date he could have been admitted to Shrewsbury Abbey. He was made a deacon the following year on 3 June and a priest on 21 September 1370. He seems to have spent much of his early monastic career as a student. The general chapter of the English Benedictines had decreed that all abbeys maintain two monks at Oxford University during the 13th century. To achieve this Shrewsbury Abbey deployed funding from Wrockwardine parish church, which had been granted to it by Roger Montgomery shortly after its establishment, as noted in the Domesday Book.Morris et al. Domesday text translation, SHR 4,1,1. at Hydra Digital Repository. In 1329 Edward III licensed the abbot to appropriate the church,Eyton, Antiquities, volume 9, p. 28. i.e. to take over the income stream of the benefice, essentially the tithes. In 1333, referring to the request of King Edward and Queen Philippa, the Pope issued a mandate confirming the abbey's appropriation, so long as enough was left over to support a perpetual vicar.Calendar of Papal Registers, Volume 2. Regesta 107: 1333-1334, 16 Kal. May. A late 15th century rent roll of the abbey shows the appropriation raising the reasonable sum of ¬£17 6s. 8d. toward the support of two students, although the Valor Ecclesiasticus reckoned it at only ¬£14. However, by that time it had long been customary to pay for only one, a fact bemoaned by critics of the abbey.Letters and Papers, Henry VIII, p. 60. Prestbury evidently made the best of this funding, as he is known to have become a master of theology.' It is not certain, however, that he was the Benedictine Thomas Scherusbury who was Chancellor of the University of Oxford in 1393-4: the identification is far from certain, although it appears as a fact in older sources, like Owen and Blakeway's History of Shrewsbury (1825).Owen and Blakeway, p. 121. Throughout this period, the abbot at Shrewsbury was Nicholas Stevens, whose long incumbency from 1361 to 1399 enjoyed royal favour. A charter of Richard II, dated 10 February 1389, is said to be occasioned partly by \\"the sincere affection which we bear and have to Nicholas the abbot and for his merits.\\" It is clear that the king had no such affection for Prestbury. Election as Abbot Prestbury was, as older and newer accounts agree, the Abbot of Shrewsbury Abbey from 1399‚Äì1426.Angold, et al. Houses of Benedictine monks: The Abbey of Shrewsbury: Abbots of Shrewsbury. The circumstances of his election show that he was in some way involved in the conflicts of the time, when Richard II's authority, and ultimately kingship, were challenged by Henry Bolingbroke, although his precise r√¥le remains mysterious. On 6 April 1399 the king wrote to Stevens ordering Prestbury's detention. :To the abbot of Shrewsbury. Order at his peril, to deliver brother Thomas master of theology, one of the monks his fellows, to the abbot of Westminster to be kept in custody until further order.Calendar of Close Rolls, Richard II, Volume 6, p. 468, Westminster 6 April. A further note to the abbot added that he was to hand over Prestbury to John Lowell, serjeant at arms, for transfer to Westminster Abbey.Calendar of Close Rolls, Richard II, Volume 6, p. 476, Westminster 6 April. At the same time arrangements were made with the abbot of Westminster to imprison Prestbury. :To the abbot of Westminster. Order at his peril, for particular causes specially moving the king, to receive Thomas a monk of Shrewsbury Abbey from one who shall deliver him, and as he will answer it to keep him in safe custody in Westminster Abbey until further order. Presumably Abbot Stevens died some time in the summer. The next report of Prestbury's detention comes from Adam of Usk, an important supporter of Bolingbroke, who accompanied his army on its triumphal progress from Bristol to Chester. Archbishop Thomas Arundel, a key figure in Prestbury's career, depicted within a historiated initial R. Henry of Bolingbroke, flanked by the lords spiritual and temporal, claims the throne in 1399 Illumination showing Henry IV. If as Usk claims, he himself approached both Bolingbroke and Archbishop Thomas Arundel to secure Prestbury's release, the circumstance of their passing through Shrewsbury would explain the speed of his election. The monks requested royal approval for their election of Prestbury, still addressing themselves to Richard, on 11 August. Royal approval, now in the hands of Bolingbroke himself, came less than a week later. :Signification to J. bishop of Coventry and Lichfield, of the royal assent to the election of Thomas de Prestbury, monk of St Peter's, Shrewsbury, to be abbot of that house.Calendar of Patent Rolls, Richard II, Volume 6, p. 592, Chester, 17 August. After some delay, as he presumably need to be fetched from Westminster, Prestbury was admitted as abbot on 4 September 1399. The mandate to restore temporalities, accompanied by the writ de intendendo, instructing the tenants to transfer their loyalty to Prestbury, was issued from Westminster on 7 September.Calendar of Patent Rolls, Richard II, Volume 6, p. 594. As the abbots of Shrewsbury were tenants-in-chief of the king and had been summoned to parliament ever since the reign of Henry III,Owen and Blakeway, p. 32. Prestbury then had to attend parliament to deal with the business of deposing Richard II. Abbot of Shrewsbury In 1403 the turmoil following the change of r√©gime became particularly acute at Shrewsbury, which was the scene of a major conflict between Henry IV and a coalition led by his former allies, the House of Percy. The Battle of Shrewsbury was waged on a site just to the north of the town and abbey: a location still called Battlefield. According to Thomas Walsingham, Prestbury and another cleric, a clerk of the Privy Seal, went on a peace mission to the rebels, offering Henry Hotspur \\"peace and pardon if he would refrain from opening\\" hostilities.Walsingham, p. 257. Walsingham attributes the failure of this effort to the deception of Hotspur's uncle, Thomas Percy, 1st Earl of Worcester. Earl Thomas was beheaded after the battle.Walsingham, p. 258. In December Prestbury was instructed to recover his head, on display at London Bridge, and have it buried in Shrewsbury Abbey with his body. The disorder, which included the depredations of Owain Glynd≈µr's troops, was such that On 20 May 1405 the abbey was dispensed, during Prestbury's lifetime, from paying the tenths, a key royal tax, on its properties outside the Diocese of Lichfield because of the damage done by to its lands by Welsh rebels.Calendar of Patent Rolls, Henry IV, Volume 3, p. 22. On 5 December 1405 Prestbury was granted a licence for 20 marks to take into mortmain six properties in Shrewsbury with an annual value of 6 marks:Calendar of Patent Rolls, Henry IV, Volume 3, p. 162. the first of a number of small acquisitions for the abbey. The Victoria County History argues that the appointment of Prestbury as abbot after Richard II's imprisonment is \\"a circumstance suggesting that Prestbury favoured the Lancastrians.\\"Angold, et al. Houses of Benedictine monks: The Abbey of Shrewsbury, note anchor 170. ODNB, however, concedes only that Prestbury became a firm supporter of Bolingbroke after he became king. Usk makes clear that Thomas Arundel's approval was significant in winning the support of the new r√©gime for Prestbury and the most important centre of power in Shropshire was the Arundel affinity, centred on the Archbishop's nephew, Thomas FitzAlan, 12th Earl of Arundel, certainly the most important magnate in the region.Roskell, Clark and Rawcliffe. Constituencies Shropshire Although the precise scope of the Arundel affinity is unknown, it is known to have included at least half the Members of Parliament elected in Shropshire in the period 1386‚Äì1421. Prestbury made a few small acquisitions of property in Shrewsbury during his abbacy and one of them was a house known as \\"Ireland Hall.\\" Royal permission to accept this burgage was sought in July 1407 by Prestbury and the convent of Shrewsbury Abbey.Calendar of Patent Rolls, Henry IV, Volume 3, p. 339, Westminster, 20 July 1407. The donors included four gentry members of the Arundel affinity, probably acting on the Earl's behalf:Roskell, Clark and Rawcliffe. Members CORBET, Robert (1383-1420), of Moreton Corbet, Salop. Robert Corbet, his younger brother Roger, their aunt's husband John Darras and William Ryman of Sussex. Some of these were very violent men. Darras, an experienced soldier in the campaigns against Owain Glynd≈µr,Roskell, Clark and Rawcliffe. Members DARRAS, John (c.1355-1408), of Sidbury and Neenton, Salop. died by his own hand the following year.Calendar of Patent Rolls, Henry IV, Volume 3, p. 485, Westminster, 30 March 1408. It was hard to avoid involvement with the Arundel affinity, even had Prestbury so desired. On 25 July 1407, a few days after the licence was granted for Ireland Hall, Prestbury was commissioned, along with the Earl of Arundel and two of his closest supporters, David Holbache and John Burley, to attend to the fortifications of Shrewsbury, using money from customs granted by Richard II.Calendar of Patent Rolls, Henry IV, Volume 3, p. 341. Chancellor of Oxford Medieval buildings at Worcester College, Oxford, part of the Benedictine Gloucester College. Prestbury's career as Chancellor of the University of Oxford has been the subject of considerable revision by historians in recent years. The traditional view was that he was Chancellor in 1393‚Äì94 and 1409‚Äì10.Hibbert p. 521-1. It was discovered that his activity as chancellor went on after the years 1409-10, a fact recorded by Thorold Rogers as long ago as 1904.Gascoigne, Rogers (ed.) , p. 116, footnote 1. Martin Heale's 2015 biography for ODNB reflects more recent views in casting severe doubt on the first term of office while allowing for a term of almost two years from July 1409. Prestbury's academic interests seem to have remained strong. During this period he was awarded a doctorate in theology by the university. He was later, in 1413, to secure two rooms in Gloucester College, Oxford for use by monks from his abbey. Prestbury's appointment may have been in the interests of Archbishop Arundel, who was making serious efforts to suppress Lollardy. The archbishop was particularly preoccupied with cornering such reform-minded academics, Peter Payne and William Taylor.Jacob, p. 96. He set up a committee of twelve, initially at Oxford,Concilia Magnae Britanniae, volume 3, p. 322-3. but later extended to both universities,Jacob, p. 97. to determine which Wycliffite teachings and writings were to be condemned and banned. A later chancellor, Thomas Gascoigne recorded that, as the commissary of the Bishop of Lincoln, Prestbury oversaw the burning of John Wycliffe's books at Carfax in the centre of Oxford, in 1410.Gascoigne, Rogers (ed.) , p. 116 p. 550 in original. In March 1411 the committees of 12 provided Arundel with a convenient list of 267 heretical propositions,Concilia Magnae Britanniae, volume 3, p. 339-49. which he intended to use as a check-list in a visitation of Oxford University. However, the university resisted, claiming exemption from such procedures under a papal bull of Boniface IX. Prestbury published notice of Arundel's intention to carry out the visitation of the university, provoking strong resistance to what was seen as an attack on academic freedom. St Mary's barred its doors against Arundel and the crisis forced the king to summon the chancellor and proctors.Jacob, p. 98. As his position was at this time untenable, Prestbury resigned. Subsequently, the king and archbishop gained papal support for their clampdown on the university. Conflict and pardon King Henry V, by unknown artist. The rivalry of Arundel and John Talbot, 6th Baron Furnivall led to widespread violence in Shropshire during 1413. The Corbets and other Arundel supporters obstructed and then attacked the tax collectors. Matters escalated to the point where the Arundel affinity mustered 2000 Chester men to attack Much Wenlock, the location of Wenlock Priory, which suffered considerable losses. The mayhem prompted the new king, Henry V, to hold the final regional sessions of the Court of King's Bench at Shrewsbury in Trinity term 1414. Although large numbers of the Arundel affinity and their opponents were indicted, the facts were disputed, the cases remanded and the accused pardoned after the magnates stood surety for them. Prestbury and his abbey were certainly allies of the Arundel faction. In February 1413 he received a general pardon from Henry IV, covering \\"all treasons, insurrections, rebellions, felonies, misprisions, offences, impeachments and trespasses.\\"Calendar of Patent Rolls, Henry IV, Volume 4, p. 464. This seems a little late for Prestbury's time at Oxford, but too early to relate to the major violence of that year, and has never been satisfactorily explained. Owen and Blakeway searched in vain for any record of accusations to match the various pardons he was granted. In December 1413 Prestbury was one of a group of eminent clerics commissioned to investigate and amend abuses at St Mary's Church, Shrewsbury, a royal free chapel:Calendar of Patent Rolls, Henry V, Volume 1, p. 149. a task that suggests he was essentially trusted by the king. Henry V's invasion of France in 1415 took the heat out of the regional situation. The venture was not unexpected as the diplomatic prelude had been prolonged. It may explain why John Burley, a veteran lawyer of Arundel's affinity and a man well past youth,Roskell, Clark and Rawcliffe. Members BURLEY, John I (d.1415/16), of Broncroft in Corvedale, Salop. decided to prolong his relationship with Shrewsbury Abbey beyond death. On 1 December 1414, working through agents who were mainly clerics, and for a fine of ¬£20, he received a licence to alienate in mortmain to the abbey substantial holdings at Alveley on the River Severn.Calendar of Patent Rolls, Henry V, Volume 1, p. 258. These included two houses, agricultural land, meadow, woods, rents and a share in a weir on the river. In return the abbey promised to operate a chantry for John Burley and his wife Julian, in the chapel of St Katharine. The investment was timely. Arundel himself died of dysentery, contracted at the Siege of Harfleur, the first major engagement of the campaign. Burley followed him back to England soon afterwards and died, perhaps of the same complaint. On 28 November 1415 another pardon was issued to Prestbury.Calendar of Patent Rolls, Henry V, Volume 1, p. 373. This time it is known that it covered allegations of felony made by Ralph Wybynbury, a runaway monk from Shrewsbury Abbey. These were made in the County Palatine of Lancaster. Although united with the Crown since the accession of Henry IV, the palatinate had an administration and legal system distinct from the rest of England, headed by its Chancellor. The charges went back some years, into the reign of Henry IV as well as of Henry V. They were serious enough to prevent Prestbury visiting the county, which was more than inconvenient, as the abbey had considerable holdings there. However, the nature of the allegations is not made clear in the pardon. It does make clear that Prestbury was infirm by this time, as \\"on account of divers infirmities he is so impotent that without great bodily grievance he cannot labour for his deliverance.\\" This may be an exaggeration but he was probably at least 70 years old by this time. Prestbury was back in royal favour fairly quickly after this second pardon. After recording the death and burial of Glynd≈µr, Adam of Usk refers to an otherwise unknown royal visit to Shrewsbury. Apparently around 1416, this must have involved Henry V staying at Shrewsbury Abbey, which was the starting point for pilgrimages to Holywell: a mark of regard for Prestbury the abbot, if also expensive and diverting for him. It appears that the king proposed at the time to establish a chantry chapel, dedicated to St Winifred, in Shrewsbury Abbey for his own soul. However he died before this was accomplished and nothing further is heard of the project until 1463 when the Pope permitted the appropriation of Great Ness church to fund it.Calendar of Papal Registers, Volume 11. Vatican Regesta 491: 1463, 17 May. In 1421 further accusations were made against Prestbury. These alleged involvement in the escape of Sir John Oldcastle from the Tower of London some years earlier, on 17 October 1413. Sir John had subsequently led a revolt, been captured in Herefordshire or a neighbouring part of Wales and then executed in London. As Oldcastle, a Lollard sympathiser, was convicted of heresy, the accusations against Prestbury, a known ally of the heresy-hunter Arundel, were hard to believe and nothing seems to have come of them. Prestbury defended the abbey's interests in 1423 against the bailiffs of Shrewsbury in a dispute over the proceeds of the annual fair. However, he did not meet the abbey's obligations to contribute annually to the Benedictine provincial chapter. In 1426, just before he died, serious dissensions among the monks forced the chapter to intervene.Angold, et al. Houses of Benedictine monks: The Abbey of Shrewsbury, note anchor 178. The abbot of Burton Abbey was sent in and discovered that Prestbury was apparently trying to secure the succession for a monk called William Pule, against the will of most of the convent. The prior of Worcester Cathedral was then sent in for a special visitation during July but Prestbury died around that time. Death Prestbury probably died in mid-July 1426. The licence to elect a successor was issued on 23 July.Calendar of Patent Rolls, Henry VI, Volume 1, p. 345. He was succeeded not by his proteg√© but by John Hampton, a monk of Shrewsbury favoured by the convent, who was confirmed by the bishop at Lilleshall parish church on 27 August.

O. Morrow to alter the present by changing the past. The two issues of the series were released in January and February 2000, in prestige format. Synopsis =Issue 1= In the year 2000, T. O. Morrow is the ruler of the world, as a result of using a time-travel machine called M.O.R.R.O.W. to strategically send pieces of modern technology (a laptop, an artificial heart, et cetera) to specific places in the year 1941. In the past, the newly formed Justice Society is investigating the mysterious technological devices they've encountered, when a group of heroes from 2000‚ÄîThe Justice League‚Äîarrives, determined to take back the future devices and restore their time-period. The JSA's Spectre looks into the JLA members' minds, and sees the worst parts of the future (e.g., the dismantling of New Deal programs, causing the poor to suffer greatly). Rather than allow that future to occur, The Spectre imprisons the JLA members in 1941. =Issue 2= The League members escape their imprisonment and return to 2000, where Morrow's citadel is being attacked by descendants of the JSA; made corrupt by unearned power, the heirs of the Society intend to hijack M.O.R.R.O.W. for their own purposes. In 1941, most of the JSA members plan to use Morrow's technology to improve the world, but The Flash (Jay Garrick) tries to tell them that it's wrong to do so. Later, Flash stops the future Morrow from killing his own mother in the past; he'd intended to make himself \\"tougher\\" by having been an orphan, but Flash shows him that that's a line even Morrow can't cross. The JSA travels to the year 2000 and sees what has happened to the world as a result of Morrow's efforts and their own. With Morrow's help, they use M.O.R.R.O.W. to take back all the year-2000 devices that had been sent to 1941, thus restoring the future.

John Blanke is depicted twice, as one of the six trumpeters on horseback in the royal retinue. All six of the trumpeters wear yellow and grey livery, and bear a trumpet decorated with the royal arms; Blanke alone wears a brown and yellow turban, while the others are bare-headed with longish hair. He appears a second time in the roll, wearing a green and gold head covering. Black trumpeters and drummers were documented in other Renaissance cities, including a trumpeter for the royal ship Barcha in Naples in 1470, a trumpeter recorded as galley slave of Cosimo de' Medici in 1555, and black drummers in the court of King James IV in Edinburgh.

Gotaas-Larsen is a Norwegian company but it registered Golar Patricia in Monrovia to use the Liberian flag of convenience. In November 1973 Golar Patricia was steaming in ballast from Coryton Refinery on the Thames Estuary in England to Bahrain in the Persian Gulf. On 5 November she was in the North Atlantic about off the Canary Islands when she suffered three large explosions, caught fire and broke her back. One crew member died but the Master (Harald Stormo), 38 officers and crew and three passengers successfully abandoned ship. The Spanish liner rescued all survivors and landed them at Tenerife. It was in the early-1970s that the first Inert Gas Systems were developed to improve safety on board tankers. During the previous docking at AFO Shipyard in Brest, France, a few weeks before, Golar Patricia had been retrofitted with such an installation. However, the normal docking time had not been enough to complete 100% of the works related to the crude oil tanks. This completion was done at sea, the ship being kept gas free during her ballast passage to Persian Gulf. No works had been done during the loaded passage back to Europe, and the commissioning of the new IG System was to be done after completion of the gas freeing operation during which the explosion occurred. Golar Patricia was insured for $24,000,000. At the time of her sinking she was the largest ship ever lost at sea. This record was surpassed in 1973 by the loss of the ore-bulk-oil carrier .

The open half-donut seating arrangement improves chances for communication between a teacher and several students. The Summit Speech School is a year-round educational institution based in New Providence, Union County, New Jersey, United States, which assists children in northern and central New Jersey who have difficulty hearing. The school uses an approach which has been described variously as an oral-option or auditory- oral or auditory-aural method, in the sense that the program helps children \\"to listen and talk without the use of sign language\\". The school receives funding from various sources, including the Junior League of Summit and the State of New Jersey. It hosts benefits to raise funds. According to a report in 2010, fund-raising is on-going and ranges from $800,000 to $1 million a year. It has been assisted in the past by volunteers. An introduction to music had been provided by renowned educator Capitola Dickerson for thirty years. History The Summit Speech School was formed in 1967 with assistance from the Junior League and with efforts by volunteers such as Diane Hunt Lawrence. The first building was located near Overlook Hospital. In the nineteen eighties, pediatrician Arthur F. Ackerman was president. The school moved to its present facility in New Providence in 1997 into a former warehouse. Since 1997, according to one report, the building has been owned by the borough of New Providence. In 2008, New Jersey was on the verge of passing Grace's Law, which requires health insurers to pay up to $1,000 per ear for hearing aids for children younger than fifteen years old, and the law was named for a former hearing-impaired student of the Summit Speech School named Grace. In 2009, volunteers including Betse Gump helped set up libraries for the children at the school. In 2010, the school was visited by Mary Pat Christie, the First Lady of New Jersey and wife of Governor Chris Christie. Programs Most children served by the school have severe hearing loss which can hamper their ability to comprehend speech in any environment with substantial background noise. Director Pamela Paskowitz said that the school tries to help particularly young children by teaching them to speak \\"clearly and often\\" and to use devices such as cochlear implants. According to a previous director: The school offers several programs which vary based on the age of the child: #Parent-infant program to help parents of children under age three. #Classroom instruction for children from ages three to six years old which alternates between \\"small group language lessons and large group activities\\". # For older children, teachers of the deaf work with students and classroom teachers at approximately forty New Jersey schools.

In the general election, he lost to incumbent Republican Jane Maroney by 29% to 71%. In 1996, Williams ran in the Democratic primary for the election for Delaware's congressional district, defeating Ernest Ercole. He was defeated by two-term incumbent Republican Mike Castle in the November general election by 70% to 27%. He lost to Castle a second time in the 1998 general election.

It is a part of the Oklahoma Army National Guard. Formed from elements of the disbanded 45th Infantry Division which saw action during World War II and the Korean War, along with the 45th Infantry Brigade Combat Team and 90th Troop Command, the 45th Fires Brigade was activated in 1968 as the 45th Field Artillery Group, later redesignated the 45th Field Artillery Brigade. The unit was again redesignated 45th Fires Brigade in 2008 with the implementation of Army Transformation. Just as the 45th IBCT and the 90th Troop Command, the brigade retained the shoulder sleeve insignia of the 45th Infantry Division, only designing and approving its own SSI in 1997.  Current Structure  The 45th Field Artillery Brigade is a subordinate unit of the Oklahoma Army National Guard, headquartered in Mustang, Oklahoma. The brigade organically commands two battalions, a target acquisition battery, and a signal company. These units are: * 20px45th Field Artillery Brigade (45th FAB), Oklahoma Army National Guard **20px Headquarters Battery, Oklahoma Army National Guard ** 20px 1st Battalion, 158th Field Artillery Regiment (1-158th FAR) (HIMARS) High Mobility Artillery Rocket System, Oklahoma Army National Guard ** 271st Brigade Support Battalion (271st BSB), Oklahoma Army National Guard ** 205th Signal Company, Oklahoma Army National Guard ** Battery B (Target Acquisition), 171st Field Artillery Regiment (B-171st FAR), Oklahoma Army National Guard In addition, there are two affiliated field artillery battalions under administrative control of two maneuver enhancement brigades: * 110th Maneuver Enhancement Brigade (110th MEB), Missouri Army National Guard ** 20px 1st Battalion, 129th Field Artillery Regiment (1-129th FAR) (M777 A2) * 71st Expeditionary Military Intelligence Brigade (71st EMIB), Texas Army National Guard ** 20px 4th Battalion, 133rd Field Artillery Regiment (4-133rd FAR) (HIMARS) High Mobility Artillery Rocket System History The history of the 45th Fires Brigade can be traced back to the days following World War I when LTC William S. Key, I was appointed Captain of Field Artillery in the Oklahoma Army National Guard. He was directed to organize a light artillery battery at Wewoka, Oklahoma. By 1920, Oklahoma had three regiments of artillery, of which, the 158th is the core of today's fires brigade. =45th Infantry Division= On 19 October 1920, the Oklahoma State militia was organized as the 45th Infantry Division of the Oklahoma Army National Guard and organized with troops from Arizona, Colorado, New Mexico, and Oklahoma.McGrath, p. 234. The division was organized and federally recognized as a US Army unit on 3 August 1923 in Oklahoma City, Oklahoma.Wilson, p. 663. Prior to World War II, the division was called on many times to maintain order in times of disaster and to keep peace during periods of political unrest. Oklahoma Governor John C. Walton used division troops to prevent the State Legislature from meeting when they were preparing to impeach him in 1923. Governor William H. Murray called out the guard several times during the depression to close banks, distribute food and once to force the State of Texas to keep open a free bridge over the Red River which Texas intended to collect tolls for, even after federal courts ordered the bridge not be opened. The division would go on to see combat in World War II as one of four national guard divisions active during the war. The division was active for over five years, participating in eight campaigns, four amphibious assaults, for a total of 511 days of combat. Following World War II the division became an all-Oklahoma organization. In 1950, the division was also called into service during the Korean War, participating in four campaigns and fighting for 429 days. =Cold War years= In 1968, the division was disbanded and the 45th Fires Brigade was one of the units formed in its place.Wilson, p. 664. The brigade did not participate in any overseas operations through the 1970s or 1980s, as the size of the active duty force negated the need for National Guard formations to be deployed during the relatively small contingencies of that period. Instead, the brigade was used to train active duty units, and other general peacetime missions within the United States. In 1991, the brigade became affiliated with the 1st Cavalry Division, providing training services for the division soldiers. =Desert Storm= The 158th was a late deploying unit for Operation Desert Shield in 1991. By the time the 1-158th Field Artillery came together in the Saudi desert, the ground offensive of Desert Storm was only days away. The l-158th was assigned to the 75th Field Artillery Brigade, and their purpose was to fire preparatory fires on Iraqi artillery positions and other targets the following day, 21 February. This was also the beginning of the battalion constantly being on the move. This battalion would support seven different higher headquarters throughout the unit's time in-theater: 3d Armored Division; VII Corps Artillery, 210th Field Artillery Brigade in the 2d Armored Cavalry Regiment, the 1st Infantry Division, and assigned in support of the 1st Cavalry Division. As part of VII Corps' repositioning of its units to the west in preparation for the \\"Hail Mary\\" tactic to defeat the Iraqi forces, A Battery, sent its advance party on a 95-mile desert march not knowing that within three days of that move, the battery would be the first Army National Guard unit to fire on the enemy. On 16 February, Battery A engaged six enemy targets with 98 rockets. The next day the battery delivered 71 rockets on four targets and on 20 February, it launched 48 rockets against four more targets. The remainder of the 1-158th FA was unloading its launchers at Dammarn Port, Saudi Arabia. Battery B, and C Battery, soon began hitting enemy targets in preparation for the ground offensive. In total the 1-158 Field Artillery Oklahoma Army National Guard fired 903 rockets and traveled hundreds of kilometers in support of VII Corps operations.

Indonesia was a variety and game show In Indonesia produced by Television and Production Exponents (TAPE) Inc., and last aired by antv Network. It was based on the Philippines' longest-running noon-time variety show, Eat Bulaga!, which made it the first Philippine TV show to be franchised in another country. Its first incarnation, Eat Bulaga! Indonesia, premiered on July 16, 2012 and ended on April 3, 2014, which aired on its original network SCTV. The show returned on its second network, antv from November 17, 2014 to August 8, 2016 with a mix of original and new hosts. History The show returned as The New Eat Bulaga! Indonesia on antv, airing its pilot on November 17, 2014. This version is nothing like the previous version. While Uya Kuya, Astrid Kuya, Farid Aja and Reza Bukan retained their roles as main hosts, the show debuted with a complete new set of hosts (many of them being Indian actors with shows aired by ANTV) as well as a new layout. Due to the strong presence of Indians and Indian Indonesians with ANTV, this version of the show adopted much Indian as well as Indo-Islamic influence. The show also became more drastically differentiated from the original Filipino program. The new version also featured a new opening theme song and performance, though its tune was still based on the original and resembles an older version of the Philippine opening song. Viewers were greeted with \\"Inilah, The New Eat Bulaga! Indonesia\\", meaning \\"this is The New Eat Bulaga! Indonesia\\" in English. The theme was once-more given a minor change, a faster and moren dance-like mix in February 2016. Many of the game segments also debuted with new names, since many of their original Philippine counterparts were discontinued. The show also debuted new game segments in addition to the many changes, hence the adding of \\"The New\\" to the show's name to emphasize the large changes. Viewers also get to watch replays of entire episodes on ANTV's YouTube channel, which also has replays of its other television shows. A unique twist to this version was its celebration of Islamic holidays and feasts, hosting \\"Ramadan\\" editions on the Islamic holy month of the same name. The New Eat Bulaga! Indonesia celebrated its first anniversary with ANTV on November 20, 2015 and was sponsored by Malkist Roma, a popular local crackers brand. The show featured an Indian-influenced celebration, since it featured guest appearances by Indian actresses Paridhi Sharma and Lavina Tandon who have a large fan base in Indonesia. The show ended on June 30, 2016. Schedule The New Eat Bulaga! Indonesia returned to the airwaves in its second incarnation, this time on a new network, antv, its pilot episode airing on November 17, 2014. The New Eat Bulaga!

He was drafted by the NFL's Cardinals in 1940 and played in Chicago for three seasons before leaving to serve in World War II. He signed with the Cleveland Browns in the AAFC after his discharge from the military and played one season for the team, moving to the Buffalo Bills in 1947. After leaving football, Coppage settled in Oklahoma and worked in lumber and banking. He died in 1992. Career Coppage grew up in Hollis, Oklahoma and attended the University of Oklahoma in Norman. He played football as an end for the Oklahoma Sooners for three years starting as a sophomore in 1937.

A power forward, Lang had a lauded collegiate career at the University of North Carolina at Charlotte between 1990‚Äì91 and 1994‚Äì95 prior to playing professionally overseas. He was known as a rugged player who was difficult to contain in the low post offensively while providing a stiff challenge defensively. College As a freshman for the Charlotte 49ers, Lang led all NCAA Division I freshmen in both scoring (19.6) and rebounding (10.6) per game. He was named the Metro Conference Freshman of the Year and named to the All-Metro Freshman Team, and ESPN named him to the All-American First Team for freshmen only. Lang's sophomore season, however, saw him go down in just the second game with an injury, forcing him to medical redshirt to sit out the entire year. He returned in 1992‚Äì93 but averaged a reduced 13.6 points and 7.4 rebounds per game, yet still was named to the All- Metro Second Team. During his junior season, his averages increased to 16.7 points and 10.3 rebounds as he was named to the All-Metro First Team. Numerous media outlets named him as an honorable mention All-American as well. Then, for his senior season in 1994‚Äì95, Lang repeated as a first-team all-conference performer. His 16.4 points, 8.9 rebounds and 1.0 steals and blocks per game made him the Metro Conference Player of the Year, which was coincidentally the final year in the award's existence due to the conference joining with the Great Midwest Conference, forming Conference USA. Lang finished his college career with 1,855 points and 1,047 rebounds. Through 2011‚Äì12, those totals place him fifth and second all-time in school history. His jersey (number 23) has been retired by Charlotte. Professional and later life Lang did not get taken in the 1995 NBA Draft but he did carve out a professional career overseas, including stints in Italy and Switzerland. Today he resides in the Charlotte, North Carolina area, working non-basketball related jobs.

Background and early life Reiss is the son of Malca (n√©e Tick) and David Reiss.Nuovo Magazine: \\"Dani Reiss of Canada Goose - Down to business\\" by Patricia Gajo Winter 2012 His maternal grandfather was Samuel Tick (originally Szmuel Tyk), a Polish JewishNational Post: \\"Faiga Tick Obituary\\" July 20, 2013United States Holocaust Museum: \\"Studio portrait of four Orthodox Jewish boys\\" retrieved April 8, 2017 immigrant who worked as a fabric cutter for other brands before founding Metro Sportswear Limited (the precursor to Canada Goose) in 1957. His father came into the business after marrying Samuel's daughter in the 1970s, rebranded the company as \\"Snow Goose\\", and, after developing a unique down filling machine, refocused the business on the supply of down coats to Ontario police officers and municipal employees. His father served as its CEO from 1982 to 2000. After earning his Bachelor of Arts in English Literature and philosophy from University of Toronto in 1996, Reiss decided to join the family business (then known as Snow Goose) for a few months to make some money to travel. He dreamed of being a writer, and had no intention of staying in the business. However, after attending a tradeshow in Germany where he tested out the Canada Goose brand (in Europe, products were branded as Canada Goose because Snow Goose was already a registered name), his passion for the business was ignited by the realization that Canada Goose was a real brand with real meaning to consumers. Reiss spent his time learning the business by working in every area of the company‚Äôs factory and travelling with the company's sales managers on visits to apparel buyers in Europe. Reiss came to recognize that European customers associated the product with idealized images of Canadian wilderness, which would eventually encourage him to change the company's name from Snow Goose to Canada Goose. Canada Goose company In 2001, at the age of 27, Reiss became president and CEO of Canada Goose. Reiss changed the company with two key decisions - to produce only under the name Canada Goose and to remain \\"Made in Canada\\". To continue manufacturing product in Canada, Reiss had to invest his own capital into the Canada Goose factory, while establishing sewing schools Winnipeg, Toronto, and Montreal. Around that time, when a number of others in the North American apparel industry moved their manufacturing to Asia to increase profit margins, the result was a significant loss to the Canadian apparel-manufacturing infrastructure. Under Reiss‚Äôs leadership, Canada Goose has become known as a \\"Made in Canada\\" champion. He believes that an authentic \\"Made in Canada\\" product could be sustainable if the company adhered to a best-quality philosophy and a strict distribution model that always ensured greater demand than supply. On Earth Day 2020, Dani Reiss and Canada Goose announced the launch of the company's first-ever Sustainable Impact Strategy. The strategy outlines the following commitments: * Carbon Neutrality: Net zero direct and indirect greenhouse gas emissions by 2025. * Reclaimed Fur: In 2022, Canada Goose will introduce reclaimed fur into its supply chain, which includes beginning to manufacture parkas using reclaimed fur and ending the purchasing of new fur. * Responsible Down Standard (RDS): In 2019, in partnership with Textile Exchange, the company completed third-party compliance audits at 100 per cent of its manufacturing facilities and commits to being 100 per cent RDS-certified by 2021. * bluesign¬Æ: Commit to reach 90 per cent of Canada Goose fabrics as bluesign¬Æ approved for responsible and sustainable practices by 2025. * Plastic-Free: Eliminating single-use plastics in all Canada Goose owned or controlled facilities.  Philanthropy Reiss, a current Polar Bears International (PBI) board member, has worked with the organization for over a decade, served as chairman of the board from 2008 ‚Äì 2017, and donated $1 million towards the construction of PBI‚Äôs new Churchill facility in February 2018. PBI is a non-profit organization committed to polar bear conservation, climate change, research and securing a future for polar bears across the arctic. Canada Goose created a PBI collection that includes parkas, lightweight down jackets and accessories for adults and kids. Canada Goose donates $50 of each sale of a PBI jacket, which provides critical funding for polar bears, environmental research and advocacy. Reiss and his team established the Canada Goose Resource Centre Program along with partners First Air and the North West Company in 2009. The Resource Centre Program gives traditional Inuit sewers access to high-quality fabrics, buttons, zippers and other materials free of charge for them to use in making traditional outerwear and other clothing for their families and other community members. To date, the Resource Centres Program has served many remote and northern communities including Pond Inlet, Cape Dorset, Kuujjuaq, Rankin Inlet, Pangnirtung and Iqaluit. This program allows sewers to continue in their traditional ways of sewing for their community with materials and fabrics they typically would not have access to or could not afford. In January 2019, Canada Goose and Dani Reiss unveiled a new collection called Project Atigi. This collection features the designs of traditional parkas from Inuit designers who came from nine communities in Nunavut, Northwest Territories, Quebec, and Newfoundland and Labrador. All of the parkas designed are unique and made of Canada Goose materials. In January 2020, Canada Goose and Dani Reiss launched the second iteration of Project Atigi which included 90 bespoke parkas created by 18 Inuit designers from across all four regions of Inuit Nunangat. Proceeds from the sale of the parkas will go directly back to Inuit communities through Inuit Tapiriit Kanatami (ITK), the national Inuit representational organization that works with the four Inuit regions of Inuit Nunangat. When COVID-19 hit Canada in 2020, Dani Reiss and Canada Goose established the Canada Goose Response Program. Outlined in this program, Canada Goose would leverage its manufacturing facilities in Toronto and Winnipeg to produce scrubs and patient gowns to help address the shortage of personal protective equipment in Canadian hospitals. * In April 2020, Canada Goose announced a manufacturing expansion of the Canada Goose Response Program to reopen all eight of the company's manufacturing facilities to produce personal protective equipment. Under contract with the Canadian government, Canada Goose would produce 60,000 units per week, with plans to deliver a total of 1.5 million units, at cost. * As an international expansion of the Canada Goose Response Program, the company announced in June 2020 that they would deliver 20,000 more general uniforms to distribute amongst all eight Mount Sinai hospitals in New York. Additionally, Kate Upton and professional baseball husband, Justin Verlander, made a charitable donation, alongside the company, to Mount Sinai‚Äôs Institute of Health Equity Research (IHER). In April 2020, Dani Reiss donated $1 million to the Huntsville District Memorial Hospital to help fight against the COVID-19 pandemic. In addition, Canada Goose donated hospital gowns and other protective equipment to the Hospital. Industry involvement/ entrepreneurship Reiss sits on the Board of Directors of Mount Sinai Hospital Foundation and is on the advisory board for Students on Ice. Reiss is a regular speaker on the topic of success, \\"Made in Canada\\" and authentic brand building, and is often quoted by press on the challenges of domestic manufacturing and global expansion. He has recently addressed the Canadian Club of Ottawa, Economic Club of Canada, lectured at the Schulich Business School‚Äôs International MBA Program, The Richard Ivey School of Business and Queen's School of Business. Reiss has also spoken to students at TedX Youth Toronto, and delivered the keynote address at the Ontario Ministry of Economic Development and Innovation conference. Awards and achievements Reiss has received awards including: In 2008, he was in a list of Canada's Top 40 Under 40. In November 2011, Reiss was awarded the Ernst & Young National Entrepreneur of the Year Award. In its 18th year in Canada, the Ernst & Young award winner was selected based on several factors including vision, leadership, financial performance and social responsibility. As the Canadian champion, Reiss was admitted into the Ernst & Young Entrepreneur of the Year Hall of Fame, along with 50 fellow country winners from around the globe at a ceremony in Monaco in June 2012. Reiss was presented with the Queen Elizabeth II Diamond Jubilee Medal by Minister Joe Oliver in May 2012, and in 2013, the Canadian Marketing Association named Reiss marketer of the year. In 2016, he was named a Member of the Order of Canada for \\"building an iconic brand that is a model of entrepreneurial success and for his commitment to the preservation of Canada's North, notably as chair of Polar Bears International.\\" In 2019, Dani was awarded the uOttawa honorary doctorate for Telfer‚Äôs School of Management for his passion, authenticity and global vision at Canada Goose. In 2019, Reiss was named ‚ÄúCEO of the Year‚Äù and ‚ÄúGlobal Visionary of the Year‚Äù by The Globe and Mail. Reiss was awarded as the Gold Winner of the ‚ÄúTop CEO of the Year, The Maverick‚Äù category of the 8th Annual 2020 CEO World Awards.

He was installed as king twice. First time, he was installed by Ruchinath Burhagohain in 1818 CE, after the latter deposed Chandrakanta Singha from the throne. His first reign ended in 1819 CE, during the second Burmese invasion of Assam, when his forces were defeated and the Burmese reinstalled Chandrakanta Singha on the throne. He along with Ruchinath Burhagohain continued their efforts to expel Burmese invaders, by seeking help from British and through armed struggle. After First Anglo-Burmese War, the British East India Company occupied Assam from Burmese invaders. Finding it difficult to administer an unfamiliar region and sensing discontent among the local inhabitants to foreign rule, the British authorities decided to restore Upper Assam to one prince of Ahom Dynasty. Purander Singha was found suitable for this post and therefore, in April 1833 CE, except Sadiya and Matok region, the entire Upper Assam was formally made over to him, on the condition of yearly tribute of 50,000 rupees. Later, in 1838 CE, finding him incompetent and defaulter in payments of revenue, the British formally annexed his kingdom, putting an end to 600 years reign of Ahom Dynasty. When Purandar Singha accepted the position of prince over upper Assam, he didn't realize the difficulties of his new position. Ancestry and family history Purandar Singha was the son of Brajanath Gohain, son of Bijoy Barmura Gohain, grandson of Ratneswar Saru-gohain, and great grandson of Swargadeo Rajeswar Singha. Ratneswar Saru-gohain had joined the ranks of rebels against his uncle Swargadeo Lakshmi Singha during the first phase of Moamoria rebellion. But after the Moamoria rebels achieved success, they treacherously murdered him, by administering poison on his food. Later Lakshmi Singha regained his throne, by defeating the Moamoria rebels. Bijoy Barmura Gohain, son of Ratneswar Saru- gohain also got involved in a conspiracy against the regime of Swargadeo Lakshmi Singha. He was caught and was punished by inflicting mutilation on his ears. He again conspired against the king, only to be caught and suffered mutilation. His young son Brajanath Gohain also suffered mutilation on his ears by royal orders.Bhuyan Dr. S.K. Swargadeo Rajeswar Singha first edition 1975 Publication Board of Assam Guwahati p. 226 During the reign of next monarch Gaurinath Singha, Bijoy Barmura plotted against the king, in association with Hangsa Narayan, the tributary ruler of Darrang. The plot was discovered and Hangsa Narayan was seized and put to death. Bijoy Barmura with his family escaped to Kachari kingdom. In 1803 CE, during the reign of Kamaleswar Singha, Bijoy Barmura joined some fugitive Moamoria rebels in Kachari kingdom and planned an uprising against Ahom kingdom.Bhuyan Dr. S.K.

The Kachari-Moamoria coalition rose against Ahom authority in the present day, Nagaon and Morigaon districts, which resulted in a full- scale war with Ahoms. The Kachari-Moamoria coalition was defeated and many rebel leaders were either killed or captured. Kamaleswar Singha demanded Kachari king Krishna Chandra to hand over Bijoy Bormura Gohain to Ahom authorities, but Bijoy Bormura Gohain escaped with his son Brajanath Gohain to British ruled Bengal. Bijoy Barmura stayed the rest of his life in Silmari in Bengal. In 1809 CE, Brajanath Gohain went to Calcutta, interviewed with the Governor-General and tried to procure military aid to fulfill his ambition to become king, in exchange of acknowledging British supremacy, but in vain.Bhuyan Dr. S.K. Swargadeo Rajeswar Singha first edition 1975 Publication Board of Assam Guwahati p. 226 Birth and early life Purandar Singha was born in 1807 CE, at Silmari, located in British ruled Bengal. His grandfather Bijoy Barmura Gohain and his father Brajanath Gohain was living in Silmari as exiled princes, after their attempts to become king of Ahom kingdom failed. The family faced economic hardships during their exile, and life in Silmari was very hard for them. Purandar Singha also spent his early life amidst economic hardships.Barua Gunaviram Assam Buranji or A History of Assam 4th edition 2008 Publication Board of Assam Guwahati p. 131 Events leading to his accession =Internal turmoil and first Burmese invasion= In 1815 CE, Purnananda Burhagohain, the Prime Minister of Ahom kingdom, sent a deputation to arrest Badan Chandra Borphukan, the Ahom viceroy at Guwahati, who was charged for atrocities committed on the people of Lower Assam, but, being warned in time by his daughter, Pijou Gabharu, who had married one of the Premier's sons, he escaped to Bengal.Bhuyan Dr. S.K.

The Burmese continued their advance pillaging and burning the villages along their line of march. Ruchinath Burhagohain endeavored in vain to induce the reigning Ahom monarch Chandrakanta Singha to retreat to Guwahati, and then, perceiving that the latter intended to sacrifice him, in order to conciliate Badan Chandra and his Burmese allies, fled westwards to Guwahati.Gait E.A.

The Queen-mother Numali Rajmao and other nobles called Ruchinath Burhagohain to return to the capital Jorhat. But Chandrakanta's peace with the Burmese, his support for Badan Chandra and his refusal to go down to Guwahati at the approach of the Burmese army, had raised the suspicion of Ruchinath Burhagohain as being mainly responsible for the attempts made against his father Purnananda Burhagohain followed by the visit of the Burmese troops.Bhuyan Dr. S.K.

Being the father of the monarch, Brajanath Gohain exercised the virtual powers of a sovereign. He appointed himself as Charing Raja and Juvaraj or heir apparent.

With the aid of a British, Mr. Robert Bruce (he is credited for the discovery of tea in Assam), Purandar Singha's army was supplied with guns and firearms. Meanwhile, Chandrakanta Singha tried to free himself from Burmese influence, which resulted in Third Burmese Invasion on Assam, in March, 1821 CE. Being defeated near Jorhat, Chandrakanta Singha retreated to Guwahati, and started gathering troops to fight against Burmese. The Burmese general installed Jogeswar Singha as the king of Ahom kingdom, after getting approval from Burmese monarch Bagyidaw. Meanwhile, Purandar Singha learnt about the breakup of friendship between Chandrakanta Singha and the Burmese and he decided to take advantage of the situation. Considering Chandrakanta Singha‚Äôs position as weak, he sent his men under the leadership of Mr. Robert Bruce, to attack Chandrakanta Singha's forces, located in Guwahati, in May, 1821 CE.

Undaunted by enemy strength, Chandrakanta Singha marched upwards into Upper Assam with approximately 2000 men consisting of Sikhs and Hindustani mercenaries and some local Assamese people recruited around Guwahati.

A History of Assam 2nd edition 1926 Thacker, Spink & Co Calcutta p. 288 Restoration of Ahom rule in Upper Assam under Purandar Singha After British occupation of Assam, many members of Ahom Dynasty, including former Ahom king Chandrakanta Singha appealed to the British Government to restore Ahom rule. Initially, the British choose to ignore these appeals, but as days passed, the British authorities sense the growing discontent to foreign rule among the people. Meanwhile, certain members of former Ahom royal family and nobles conspired to overthrow the British rule from Assam. Though, the conspiracy was detected in time and the conspirators were duly punished, the British authorities were concern over the growing dissatisfaction among the people towards British rule. Therefore, in an attempt to pacify the people, in 1832 A.D., the British Government considers restoring Upper Assam to the former Ahom royal family as a tributary prince.Barbaruah Hiteswar Ahomar-Din or A History of Assam under the Ahoms 1981 p. 338 The two most suitable candidates for the throne were Chandrakanta Singha and Purandar Singha. After some interviews with the candidates and discussions among the British Officers, Purandar Singha was selected for the throne. In his report to British Government, Mr. T. C. Robertson, then Commissioner and Political Agent of Assam, wrote as follows regarding Purandar Singha's qualifications: ‚ÄúI have had several interviews with Purandar Singh at Gauhati, and see no reason, from his outward appearance and manners, to doubt of his fitness for the dignity, for which all unite in preferring him to his only rival Chandrakant. Purandar Singh is a young man, apparently about 25 years of age. His countenance is pleasing, and his manners extremely good. His natural abilities seem respectable and his disposition mild and pacific‚Ä¶Major White and Lieutenants Mathie and Rutherford are all decidedly of opinion that Purandar Singh is the best person fitted to be at the head of the State which it has been decided to create.‚Äù Political Proceedings of the Government of Bengal, dated 4 February 1833, No. 8, pp. 123‚Äì24 Gait E.A. A History of Assam 2nd edition 1926 Thacker, Spink & Co Calcutta pp. 296‚Äì97 Some historians are of the opinion that the selection of Purandar Singha over Chandrakanta Singha as a tributary ruler of Upper Assam was part of British political game. Since Chandrakanta Singha inherited the kingdom from his elder brother, the Ahom king Swargadeo Kamaleswar Singha, therefore the legal basis of Chandrakanta Singha was more firm than Purandar Singha. Purandar Singha lived most of his life in exile with his father; therefore if the British install Purandar Singha to the throne, he would be more grateful and will submit to British rule more readily than his rival candidate Chandrakanta Singha. Second reign (1833‚Äì1838 CE)  In April 1833, Purandar Singha was appointed as a protected prince in charge of Upper Assam, excluding Sadiya and Matak regions, on a stipulated tribute of 50,000 rupees.Bhuyan Dr. S.K.

This flag might be official flag during 2nd term of Purandar Singha (1833-38). =Appointment of officials= At the onset of his second reign, Purandar Singha appointed officials according to age-old Ahom system of governance, but since his kingdom's territory was very much less than the territories of Ahom kingdom, before 1826 CE, he left many official post vacant. Also owing to the depleted conditions of the kingdom's economy, the state treasury could not have borne the burden of giving salaries to these officials. He appointed Mahidhar, the son of Ruchinath Burhagohain, on the post of Burhagohain. He created three mels or estates, which are called ‚ÄúMaju Mel‚Äù, ‚ÄúMahi Mel‚Äù and ‚ÄúSaru Mel‚Äù. He allotted Maju Mel or estate to his nephew, Narnarayan Gohain, Mahi Mel or estate to his cousin Ishwar Gohain, and Suru Mel or estate to his uncle, Brajanath Gohain's younger brother, Indunath Gohain.Barbaruah Hiteswar Ahomar-Din or A History of Assam under the Ahoms 1st edition 1981 Publication Board of Assam Guwahati p. 341 Among his all officials, Maniram Dewan was the most powerful, with some real authority. Even though, Purandar Singha had appointed Burhagohain as his Prime Minister, it was actually Maniram Dewan, who look after all the administration of the state and monitor the collection of revenue.Barbaruah Hiteswar Ahomar-Din or A History of Assam under the Ahoms 1st edition 1981 Publication Board of Assam Guwahati p. 353 =Defaults in the payments of revenue and maladministration= After his accession as the tributary ruler of Upper Assam under British Government, Purandar Singha began well with his accounts of payments of revenue. But within three year, he began to make default in his payments. He begged for a considerable reduction in the amount of revenue, as he explained that the country was badly ravaged by the Burmese invaders, affecting all spheres of life of the people, which includes social and economical. Imposing taxation was also difficult because unlike other parts of India, common people in Assam did not use or very rarely use money for any business transaction or in daily business. Captain Jenkins, the new Commissioner and Political Agent, held an enquiry into Purandar Singh's administration and found it a hot bed of corruption and misfeasance.Bhuyan Dr. S.K. Tunkhungia Buranji or A History of Assam (1681-1826) second edition 1968 Department of Historical and Antiquarian Studies in Assam Guwahati p. 211 His subjects were oppressed and misgoverned and his rule is very distasteful to the bulk of the population. Purandar Singha was himself found guilty of gathering personal fortune rather than concentrating on good governance for his people.Gait E.A. A History of Assam 2nd edition 1926 Thacker, Spink & Co Calcutta p. 308 In 1838, one British officer, McKoch gives descriptions about the conditions of Purandar Singha and his court officials :- ‚ÄúThe present representative of this once powerful dynasty (Svargadeo or Lord of Heaven, as he pleased to call himself) now resides in Jorhat in noisy pomp and tawdry splendor; his resources limited to that of a zamindar; his numerous nobility reduced to beggary or to exist upon bribery and corruption; and his kingly court (for he still maintains his regnal dignity) more resembling the parade of a company of strolling players than anything imposing or sovereign.‚ÄùGait E.A. A History of Assam 2nd edition 1926 Thacker, Spink & Co Calcutta p. 308 Purandar Singha Deposed and End of Ahom Authority in Assam Purandar Singha having thus proved a failure, his kingdom was placed under direct British control, in September 1838 CE. With the deposal of Purandar Singha and the annexation of Upper Assam to the territories of the British East India Company, all vestiges of Ahom authority in Assam came to an end after a reign of approximately 600 years.Bhuyan Dr. S.K.

In October 1838 CE, a pension of 1000 rupees per month was granted to him but he declined to accept it as he hoped for the eventual restitution of his state as a result of his petition to the Governor-General.Bhuyan Dr. S.K. Tunkhungia Buranji or A History of Assam (1681-1826) second edition 1968 Department of Historical and Antiquarian Studies in Assam Guwahati p. 212 The petition of Purandar Singha turned down by Governor-General, after consulting with the British officials serving in Assam. During that time, the British Government officials and many other adventurers dug the Royal Tombs or Maidams of Ahom kings in Charaideo, in search of treasures, as it was widely known that the material properties of the dead king, like swords, furniture, utensils, gold and silver jewellery, and other valuables were also entombed along with the dead king in the Maidam. Purandar Singha, at first protested the desecration of his ancestors‚Äô tombs, but finding it hopeless to appeal, in a bid to preserve the treasure; he himself dug many Royal Tombs and recovered a large booty of treasures.Barbaruah Hiteswar Ahomar-Din or A History of Assam under the Ahoms 1st edition 1981 Publication Board of Assam Guwahati p. 405 Fearing outburst and reactions from other princes of Ahom Dynasty, he spread the news that he had dug the ancestral tombs to recover their bones and other remains, to take them to Ganges, for spiritual and religious purpose. Death Purandar Singha lived the rest of his life in Jorhat along with his family. He died on October 1, 1846 CE,Bhuyan Dr. S.K. Tunkhungia Buranji or A History of Assam (1681-1826) second edition 1968 Department of Historical and Antiquarian Studies in Assam Guwahati p. 212 few days before Durga Puja celebrations. The former Ahom nobles attended his funeral and paid their respect to the departed king. His remains were entombed in a Maidam, constructed in Jorhat. Presently, that place is known as Raja Maidam, located in Jorhat Town.Barbaruah Hiteswar Ahomar-Din or A History of Assam under the Ahoms 1st edition 1981 Publication Board of Assam Guwahati p. 408 Maidam(burial mound) of the last Ahom King Purandar Singha at Rajamaidam, Jorhat District. Family and descendants Purandar Singha had numerous wives; prominent among them were Maharani Chandrakala, Chandrakanti Kunwari and Ambavati Kunwari. Maharani Chandrakala was the Parvatia Queen of Purandar Singha and she was a Manipuri princess. Purandar Singha was succeeded by his son Jubraj Kameswar Singha. In 1847 CE, Kameswar Singha was permitted by the British Government to use the title of Raja. Kameswar Singha died on June 10, 1852 CE, and his remains were entombed near his father's tomb, in Raja Maidam, in Jorhat.Barbaruah Hiteswar Ahomar- Din or A History of Assam under the Ahoms 1st edition 1981 Publication Board of Assam Guwahati p. 408 Kameswar Singha leave behind three widows, Rani Lakhipriya, Padmahari Kunwari and Madhavi Maju Kunwari, as well as a concubine named Rupavati Khatania. Kandarpeswar Singha, Kameswar's son through Lakhipriya, was born in 1840. In 1848 CE, the title of Charing Raja was conferred on Kandarpeswar. During the Indian Rebellion of 1857, Kandarpeswar Singha was suspected of disloyal manoeuvres. He was placed under arrest as well as his agent Maniram Dewan Barbhandar Barua who was then in Calcutta petitioning the Governor-General for the restoration of the Ahom kingdom to Kandarpeswar Singha. As a result of the trial, Kandarpeswar Singha was sent to Alipur and then to Burdwan to be detained there as a state prisoner. Maniram Dewan was executed on February 26, 1858 CE. Kandarpeswar was afterwards released and granted a pension of 500 rupees per month and he died in Guwahati. His two sons, Kumudeswar and Nareswar, through his wife Rani Kamalapriya had died during their father's lifetime, and his daughter Troilokyeswari Aideo survived her father.Bhuyan Dr. S.K.

During his first reign, Purandar Singha and his father Brajanath Gohain, after being defeated by Burmese, fled to Guwahati taking all the valuables from the Royal treasury worth 3.5 million rupees, due to which the next ruler Chandrakanta Singha faced economic hardships in gathering mercenaries and maintaining the army to fight Burmese.Chaliha Sadananda Guwahati: Buranjir Khala-Bamat or A collection of select articles on the antiquity and history of Guwahati and the surrounding tracts 1991 p. 44 During his second reign, as tributary prince under British, it was found that Purandar Singha was busy gathering personal wealth, instead of taking care of administration, which resulted in the growth of corruption among his officials. Some historians also stated his character as stubborn and firm from the fact that he refused to accept any pensions or grants from British Government. His son, Kameswar Singha also refused to accept pension from the British Government.Barbaruah Hiteswar Ahomar-Din or A History of Assam under the Ahoms 1st edition 1981 Publication Board of Assam Guwahati p. 340Barua Gunaviram Assam Buranji or A History of Assam 4th edition 2008 Publication Board of Assam Guwahati p. 131 Some sources said that it was actually Maniram Dewan who advised both father and son, not to accept any pension, as it might weaken their petition to restore their kingdom. After the fall of Ahom kingdom by Burmese invasion and subsequently by British occupation, Purandar Singha got a golden opportunity to restore Ahom rule in Upper Assam, but he ruined the chance by failing to pay the annual tribute of 50,000 rupees, resulted in the annexation of his kingdom by British, putting an end of 600 years of rule by Ahom dynasty.

He made over 60 Football League appearances in the years before the Second World War. Career Booth played initially for Swansea Town but was unable to secure a regular first team place. Booth moved to Bangor City and became a prolific goalscorer for the team. Bob Hewison signed Booth from Bangor City for ¬£350 for Bristol City in November 1936. Booth made his debut for Bristol City at inside right replacing Bob Armstrong in a 3‚Äì1 win over Newport County on 14 November 1936. The match was unusual as Bill Roberts normally a right back was promoted to centre forward and scored a hat-trick for Bristol City. Booth shared the inside right position with Armstrong for the remainder of the season making 19 appearances scoring one goal in 1936‚Äì37 as Bristol City finished in 16th place in the Third Division South. Booth began the 1937‚Äì38 season at inside left before switching inside forwards positions with Joe Brain newly signed from Swansea Town after five matches. Bristol City began the season in mid table but finished strongly to end up as runners up missing out on promotion to Millwall by a single point. City lost only one of their last 14 league matches but Booth played in only two of this sequence of games. Booth made 21 appearances scoring six goals including four goals in the opening four matches. Bristol City played in the Football League Division Three South Cup in 1937‚Äì38 with Booth scoring in the 2‚Äì0 semi final win v Millwall. Booth did not feature in the two legged final, lost 2‚Äì6 on aggregate to Reading, that was held over to the following season. In 1938‚Äì39 Bristol City finished eighth in the Third Division South and Booth did not play until November when he scored three goals in his first four matches at inside left. He established a regular place at inside left in January 1939 taking the opportunity by scoring nine goals in his first eight matches including three instances of two goals in a game in 2‚Äì0 wins v Bournemouth and at Newport County and a double in a 3‚Äì1 win versus Clapton Orient. Booth made 23 appearances scoring 15 goals in 1938‚Äì39. Booth made a further two appearances in the truncated 1939‚Äì40 season.

Built and managed by the U.S. Bureau of Reclamation, it is used for flood control, irrigation, and recreation. Webster State Park is located on its shore. History Construction of Webster Dam and Reservoir was approved as part of the Pick-Sloan Missouri Basin Program. Following the Great Flood of 1951, the U.S. Bureau of Reclamation determined the project could provide additional flood control and irrigation support to the region. Contractors started construction in March 1953, but a combination of funding problems and adverse weather caused multiple delays over the following years. The project's namesake, the small community of Webster, laid within the reservoir's intended basin and had to be relocated roughly to the southeast. Water storage in the reservoir began May 3, 1956, and the Webster project became formally operational September 1, 1956. Area residents successfully organized Webster Irrigation District No. 4 and obtained a water right in December 1956. Construction of downstream irrigation infrastructure, including a diversion dam near Woodston, Kansas and the Osborne Canal, began in July 1957 and finished in April 1961. Geography Webster Reservoir is located in northwestern Kansas on the western edge of the Smoky Hills region of the Great Plains. It is located entirely within Rooks County. The reservoir is impounded at its eastern end by Webster Dam located at (39.4083423, -99.4245476) at an elevation of . The South Fork Solomon River is both the reservoir's primary inflow and outflow. U.S. Route 24 runs generally east-west north of the reservoir. Kansas Highway 258 runs generally north-south along the top of Webster Dam. There is one unincorporated settlement at Webster Reservoir: Webster, Kansas, the reservoir's namesake, located just southeast of the dam. Hydrography The surface area, surface elevation, and water volume of the reservoir fluctuate based on inflow and local climatic conditions. In terms of capacity, the Bureau of Reclamation vertically divides the reservoir into a set of pools based on volume and water level, and it considers the reservoir full when filled to the capacity of its active conservation pool. When full, Webster Reservoir has a surface area of , a surface elevation of , and a volume of . When filled to maximum capacity, it has a surface area of , a surface elevation of , and a volume of . Infrastructure Webster Dam is an earth-fill embankment dam with a structural height of and a length of . At its crest, the dam has an elevation of . Management The U.S. Bureau of Reclamation operates and maintains Webster Dam and Reservoir. The Kansas Department of Wildlife, Parks and Tourism (KDWP) manages of land around the reservoir and upstream along the South Fork Solomon River as the Webster Wildlife Area. Parks and recreation The KDWP manages Webster State Park located on the shore of the reservoir. Occupying a total of , the park is divided into two areas: the Oldtown Area on the north shore and the Goose Flat Area on the south shore. Both areas include boat ramps and camping facilities. The Oldtown Area also includes an amphitheater, swimming beaches, playgrounds, and a hiking trail. Webster Reservoir is open for sport fishing. Hunting is permitted on the public land around the reservoir although it is restricted in the Wildlife Area. Wildlife Fish species resident in Webster Reservoir include bluegill, channel and flathead catfish, crappie, largemouth and smallmouth bass, rainbow trout, walleye, white bass, and wiper. Game animals living around the reservoir include deer, ducks, pheasants, quail, and wild turkeys. Bald eagles are also present in the area.

Early life The third son of Francis Homfray of Stourton Castle, joint owner with his younger brothers of the Penydarren Ironworks. On the death of his father, he was made co-owner and joint Managing Director of the ironworks with his brother Samuel Homfray, M.P., of Coworth Park, Berkshire. In 1787, he married Mary, the daughter of John Richards of Llandaff, and after this for many years resided at Llandaff House. Ebbw Vale Ironworks In 1789, Walter Watkins was the owner of a forge at the Clydach Ironworks in Glangrwney, Clydach Vale near Crickhowell, which lacked an adequate supply of pig iron. In agreement with two business partners, his son-in-law Charles Cracroft and Jeremiah Homfray, the three leased land at Pen y cae farm in the parish of Aberystruth from John Miles. Situated on the northern tip of the South Wales coalfield, with iron ore obtainable from patch working, and located next to the Ebbw fawr river, they had easy access to the basic iron making materials: coal and iron ore locally mined, plus water and power from the river. Limestone was to be transported by mule train from Llanelly Hill in Blaenavon. The partnership erected a single blast furnace and casting shop against the hillside, which created an output of 25 tons of pig iron per week. Called \\"Pen y cae\\" after the original river by the locals, the partners Anglicanised the rivers name to the Ebbw Vale Furnace Company, hence naming both the works and the developing township. In 1793, Homfray bought out his partners with help from the Bristol-based Quaker family Harford Partridge & Co. He had continued his associated with Penydarren, but after an argument with his co-owning brother Samuel, in 1796 gave up his shares after legal action for an agreed annuity of ¬£2,500 for life. To pay his legal bills from the dispute with his brother, Jeremiah sold the Ebbw Vale ironworks to the Harford family. They subsequently employed him as the salaried superintendent of the works, which he undertook until 1799. Subsequent career In 1800, he began to develop the business scheme format in which he would become best known: speculating by taking mineral leases on plots of land; making tests drillings to prove the riches below, often with engineering partner Birch; and then seeking development partners or selling onwards for a profit. Using this form, in 1800 he leased initial lands at Abernant in the Aberdare Valley, and then further leases of mineral rights at additional land in Abernant, Cwmbach, and Rhigos. These were then all sold as a package to the Tappendens. Monies from this sale allowed him to buy into the Hirwaun Ironworks, but he soon quit this project to go back to mineral lease speculation. High Sheriff of Glamorgan By 1813, he had accumulated holdings that included: ¬£2,500 annuity from Penydarren; ¬£120 annuity from the Abernant Ironworks; numerous mineral leases in most of the South Wales valleys; and various farm leases in preparation for test drilling for minerals. In 1810 he been appointed High Sheriff of Glamorgan for a year, and his resultant extensive entertainment expenditure plus a large family placed extreme stress on his finances. Bankruptcy and later life In November 1813, Sir Jeremiah Homfray \\"of Cwm Rhondda, coal-merchant, dealer, and chapman\\" was declared bankrupt. Ordered to sell his house and its contents, the family left for Boulogne, France to avoid paying all of his creditors and enable them to live on his reduced income. After the death of his wife in 1830, Homfrey died and was buried in Boulogne, France, in 1833. His son John Homfray then returned to South Wales, and bought Penllyn Castle.

It was launched on June 21, 2010. Merrill Edge was created to merge Bank of America Online Investing (Quick & Reilly) and Merrill Lynch's research, investment tools, and call center counsel. When it was established, Merrill Edge had 500,000 Bank of America customers. The firm focuses on investors with up to $250,000 in investable assets. In 2015, the service held $118 billion from two million customers and employed 2,500 advisers working in bank branches and call centers. History Launched on June 21, 2010, Merrill Edge is a \\"a no-frills brokerage unit\\" of parent company Bank of America's retail banking division. Created after Merrill Lynch became a subsidiary of Bank of America in 2008, it contains the Merrill Lynch name and its employees are included in Merrill Lynch's number of employees. It merged Bank of America Online Investing (Quick & Reilly) and Merrill Lynch's research, investment tools, and call center counsel. At its inception, Merrill Edge had 500,000 customers from Bank of America's current clients. Bank of America launched the product to compete with Charles Schwab Corporation and Fidelity Investments for the numerous fledgling investors unprepared for comprehensive advice. Bank of America aimed to build brand loyalty among these younger investors who generally have strong technical skills and appreciate a higher degree of openness and personal oversight of their accounts. It is intended for well-educated clients who want to invest between $100,000 and $250,000. In 2015, the five-year-old Merrill Edge had $118 billion in 2 million customers' investable assets. It accumulated the assets through three main avenues: existing Bank of America customers (which accounted for around a third of the assets held), Merrill Lynch referrals (which accounted for a marginally higher proportion of the assets), and marketing (which accounted for the rest). Bank of America added videoconferencing kiosks to their bank branches in the Los Angeles metropolitan area and the Washington metropolitan area to promote Merrill Edge and to allow customers to receive counsel from employees based in Arizona, Florida, and New Jersey. Bank of America marketed Merrill Edge on their locations' windows and automated teller machines. The service allows customers three options for doing trades: making the trades themselves, handing over for every order a $6.95 fee, and paying a fee of 1% of the capital for a separately managed account. In 2015, Merrill Edge had 2,500 advisers working in bank branches and call centers. Roughly 1,500 of the advisers worked in the bank branches. The Wall Street Journal reported in 2015 that Bank of America intends to increase by twofold Merrill Edge's banking branch employee number. According to Reuters, the service's \\"financial solution advisers\\" are \\"licensed broker-dealers and bankers who are paid a salary\\", whereas full- service brokers receive commissions. Aron Levine, the head of Preferred Banking and Merrill Edge, manages the bank branch advisers. In May 2018, Merrill Lynch along with Merrill Edge launched ESG model portfolios. Referrals Merrill Lynch brokers were told to refer customers with less than $250,000 in investments to Merrill Edge. The intent was for the brokers to focus on wealthier investors and for Merrill Edge to reciprocate by sending customers with more than $250,000 in investments to Merrill Lynch. In 2015, the Merrill Lynch broker incentive system changed to give brokers no money for managing accounts less than $250,000. In 2014, Merrill Edge referred 30,000 customers to Merrill Lynch and U.S. Trust. Converted referrals gave Merrill Lynch an additional $4 billion to manage, which when apportioned among Merrill Lynch's 14,000 advisers is roughly $285,700 and two referrals per adviser. When referred to Merrill Lynch, Merrill Edge's customers sometimes do not migrate their accounts because of the higher costs for trades. Products In 2012, Merrill Edge released Face Retirement, a product that age progresses a submitted photo of a person. The aim of the tool is to convince people to save for retirement earlier because a study has shown that younger people who think of themselves being older save more. In a 2015 interview with The Wall Street Journal, Aron Levine, head of Merrill Edge, said the company was considering an \\"automated advice service\\". Dozens of Bank of America workers worked on a prototype of the product, which is planned for release in 2016. Merrill Edge will begin offering to customers robo-advisors that employ algorithms populated with dozens of components. Bank of America customers who invest less than $250,000 usually do not receive counsel from Merrill Edge employees, so the robo-advisors would enable them to receive advice.

He is best known for his song \\"Babylon\\" in 2010. In 2012 Congorock toured with Barbadian R&B; singer Rihanna on her 777 Tour, at around about the same time Congorock remixed the song \\"Diamonds\\" which made Congorock heard to Rihanna. The song \\"Sirius\\" with Alle Benassi was included on the soundtrack to the 2012 film Chronicle by Josh Trank. Congorock is managed by Three Six Zero Group. Musical career In 2007 when moving to Los Angeles in the United States he began working with The Bloody Beetroots' Bob Rifo (also from Italy). The two began working together and eventually released their debut single at the same time, as a collaboration between the two. The song was called \\"Rombo\\" and featured on The Bloody Beetroots debut EP of the same name. The Rombo EP featured 5 songs. Congorock once stated in an interview on \\"The Bloody Beetroots Gazette\\" that he was Crookers #1 Fan, he was also influenced by the Basement Jaxx album Rooty. In 2010 Rampino joined with Sir Bob Cornelius Rifo, Steve Aoki and Scott Cogo to form the dance-punk band Rifoki. They released one EP named Sperm Donor in winter 2010. The song \\"Zombie Attack\\" featuring vocals from punk band Refused along with Bob Rifo's own vocals. \\"Zombie Attack\\" was successful enough to be included on the 2010 edition of I Love Techno mixed by Aoki. Also it was included on the Dim Mak compilation Dim Mak Hardcore (Punk) Vault. Rifoki is heavily influenced by rock and metal but it has a dance beat. Rampino plays guitars in the band, Rifo provides vocals and mixdowns along with mixdowns and DJing by Aoki and Cogo. On the Travis Barker song \\"Misfits\\" with Steve Aoki from his album Give the Drummer Some the collaboration between Barker and Aoki counts them both as featured artists. But on the writing credits it states it is written by Rocco Rampino, Sir Bob Cornelius Rifo, Steve Aoki, Scott Cogo and Travis Barker. This makes the song produced by Rifoki as Sir Bob provides vocals and Congorock plays guitars while Steve Aoki and Scott Cogo DJ the track with Travis Barker's drumming. =Solo career= Congorock eventually released his own EP, Runark, on 17 March 2009. It featured five songs: \\"Runark\\", \\"Runark (Joker of the Scene Remix)\\", \\"Exodus\\", \\"Hybro\\" and \\"Runark (His Majesty Andre Remix)\\". After Runark, Congorock collaborated with fellow Italian dance-punk duo Blatta & Inesha, they produced Stepoff!/People. Also in 2008; Congorock collaborated with fellow Italian dance-punk duo Crookers to produce the song \\"Sbombers\\" (sometimes written as Sbomberz, S-Bombers or S Bombers). He remixed the song \\"Bite Your Lip\\" by Blatta & Inesha and another song \\"Bubblicious\\" by electronic artist Rex the Dog. On 20 April 2010 Congorock released one of his most successful singles to date, \\"Babylon\\", featuring an original mix, a dub version and a Lexxapella version. \\"Babylon\\" became successful enough to get onto the Ministry of Sound Annual 2011 compilation, which was released in 2010. It was also put onto another Ministry of Sound compilation, this time it was the winter edition of the \\"Addicted To Bass\\" series. After the success of \\"Babylon\\", Congorock went on to remix the Swedish House Mafia song One. After the remix of \\"One\\", \\"Babylon\\" started to receive its own remixes on 7 September 2010. Some of the remixing artists included Proxy, Steve Angello (of Swedish House Mafia) and CJ Bolland. Congorock's next project was a remix of the Mark Ronson song \\"Somebody to Love Me\\". Congorock also went on to remix the Benny Benassi song \\"Electroman\\" and \\"Cinema\\", the Congorock remix was on the same single as the remix by Skrillex which was nominated as best remix at the 2011 Grammy Awards. On 11 November 2011 Congorock teamed up with Benny Benassi's cousin and co-worker Alle Benassi to produce the song \\"Sirius\\". The song would later go on to appear on the soundtrack to the 2012 film Chronicle directed by Josh Trank. Congorock released another single shortly after, this was \\"Ivory\\" which was released on 28 November 2011. \\"Ivory\\" became successful and would have remixes later on 8 May 2012. After \\"Ivory\\", Congorock remixed The Bloody Beetroots song \\"Church of Noise\\" which featured Dennis Lyxz√©n and Bob Rifo on vocals. On 20 March Congorock released Monolith/Agarta. \\"Monolith\\" was included on the Benny Benassi mixed compilation Cavo Paradiso 2012. Congorock also released \\"Liu Kang's Theme\\" which was a single from Mortal Kombat: Songs Inspired by the Warriors. After this Congorock released an \\"Ivory Remixes EP\\", the remixing artists included Laidback Luke, The Bloody Beetroots, Mumbai Science and NT89. He then collaborated with dance project Stereo Massive and Jamaican rapper Sean Paul to create the song \\"Bless Di Nation\\". He then remixed the song \\"We Run the Night\\" by Havana Brown and Pitbull. He started working with Barbadian R&B; singer Rihanna on her 777 Tour, he also remixed the song \\"Diamonds\\". His most recent project is the remix of the Clockwork song \\"Titan\\", he decided the song was good enough already and he wanted to keep the bass drop so he made a Safari Edit instead of an actual remix. It included some drum samples and didn't edit the tempo. He collaborated with the Swedish/American house duo AN21 & Max Vangeli on the song \\"Lost\\" (credited as 'AN21 & Max Vangeli vs Congorock'). It was included on their album People of the Night released through SIZE Records. After this he has remixed the songs \\"Cowboy\\" by Zeds Dead featuring Omar LinX and \\"Pogo\\" by Laidback Luke featuring Majestic. Upon the fall on 2013 Congorock made the song \\"Minerals\\" on Ultra Records along with electro house producer Nom De Strip. The song was released on 8 December 2013. The musical style is significantly different from other previous Congorock releases, the song has far less percussion instruments. The song \\"Seth\\" was released on 23 December 2013. It was released on Chris Lake's record label Rising Music, the song included many Indian and Egyptian instruments and percussions. The musical style was similar to that of Nom De Strip of whom Congorock previously collaborated. \\"Seth\\" is an Egyptian God, so the song's sound and vibe were based on Egyptian elements. Since then Congorock has collaborated with EDM trio Daddy's Groove on \\"Synthemilk\\" and with DJ Clockwork on \\"Infinite Mana\\". Both were released on Ultra Music. In 2015 Congorock released \\"Nok Nok\\", a collaboration with fellow electro house producer Mindshake, and another single \\"Black Sun\\" with Daddy's Groove. =Remix albums= Congorock released remix albums (or EP's) for both the songs \\"Babylon\\". The remixing artists on the EP include Steve Angello (of Swedish House Mafia), CJ Bolland, and Proxy. The original mix and Lexxapella version are also both on this EP. The cover is a seven sided star which is questioned to be satanic, but is, in fact, a play on words as the ancient goddess Babalon (from the Thelema system) has a heptagram which is used as the \\"Seal of Babalon\\". The heptagram is more visible on the remix album but it does actually appear on the original single but is distorted by the dragon picture. There are also remixes for the song \\"Ivory\\". The remixing artists are Laidback Luke, The Bloody Beetroots, Mumbai Science and NT89. On 8 January 2013, there was remixes released for \\"Bless Di Nation\\" featuring Stereo Massive and Sean Paul, there are seven tracks on the EP. Remixing artists include Firebeatz, Clockwork, Valentino Khan, GTA, Torro Torro and Ookay. Logo In early 2008 for the song \\"Rombo\\" with The Bloody Beetroots the Congorock logo was not included on the cover art for the EP, but by the time of the song \\"Sbombers\\" with Crookers the logo was included. At that time it was designed to be similar to an arcade game style, it mounted up in the middle. In 2009 when he released his own EP \\"Runark\\" it ascended and then descended on the 'rock' part of the word. On \\"Stepoff!/People\\" the Congorock and Blatta & Inesha logos were not stylized and were both written in plain text. When the song \\"Babylon\\" was released the logo was dented in the middle and numerous spikes emerged from the corners, two eyes were also in the middle of the second O, the logo and heptagram are more visible on the \\"Babylon Remixes\\" album. In 2011 by the release of \\"Ivory\\" the logo took an African theme, the O's were slanted; this is how the logo remained until the recent release of the song \\"Bless Di Nation\\". The Congorock logo is written in plain white text on \\"Bless Di Nation\\", but Sean Paul and Stereo Massive are also written the same way. Since the release of \\"Bless Di Nation\\" the logo has not taken a specific style, on the artwork of the following releases the typography used would differ every time. On the majority of the releases the Congorock logo wasn't styled in any way; with the exception of \\"Synthemilk\\" which used the established logo from 2011. No more releases since Synthemilk have used the logo again. Musical style At first Congorock's style was mainly dance-punk and electro, his style then changed to moombahton when he released \\"Babylon\\". His style varied to electro house afterwards but still included African percussion instruments. Ivory and Sirius were heavy on electro house, whereas the percussions seemed to be less dominant when he remixed Zedd's \\"Spectrum\\", the sound changed to a more house sound, this has remained on songs such as \\"Bless Di Nation\\", but percussion was then used. Congorock has not used such instruments on his recent remixes. On recent songs such as \\"Minerals\\" and \\"Seth\\" has been more electronic sounds backed by some percussion instruments but not as predominant as were previously featured on songs such as \\"Babylon\\" and \\"Monolith\\". On the Congorock remix of the Laidback Luke song \\"Pogo\\" featuring British grime rapper MC Majestic there is a heavy hardcore bass sound, similar to that in moombahton and hard dance. The recent song \\"Synthemilk\\" with Daddy's Groove is mainly electro house but some snare drums are audible. The following song \\"Infiniate Mana\\" with DJ Clockwork is of a hard house style; of which Clockwork is known for. In 2015 Congorock did not differ heavily in musical style, his tracks would continue to have an electro house BPM, similar synths and percussion's were used, but the \\"Congo\\" influence once seen in Congorock's style had seemed to mostly fade away. No EDM subgenres (such as Moombahton and Dutch house) were produced anymore. The releases \\"Nok Nok\\" and \\"Black Sun\\" were both collaborations and included a mass amount of the collaborating artists style within the track. However the \\"Congo\\" percussion's were clearly audible as the bass line for \\"Nok Nok\\".

This election marked one of the most stunning turnovers in local history, with four incumbent aldermen being defeated by political newcomers and Ward 3 Alderman Brian Hinkley being soundly defeated in his bid for the mayoralty against incumbent Mayor Bob Morrow.Jim Poling. \\"Voters performed selective surgery at ballot box\\", Hamilton Spectator, Wednesday, November 13, 1991. Regional Chairman Election Mayoral Election In late October, an article ran in the Hamilton Spectator critiquing the mayor for what was perceived as political self-aggrandizing while noting that his 1988‚Äì1991 term was marked by successes for the city. In the piece, Morrow noted that he felt his strongest competition would come from Ward 3 Alderman Brian Hinkley, a New Democrat with an extensive record at city hall.Ken Peters. \\"Ribbon cutting belies backroom boosterism\\", Hamilton Spectator, Monday, October 21, 1991, Metro, B1/B2. In early debates, most notably one hosted by Hamilton's Junior Chamber of Commerce, Hinkley was an aggressive opponent of Morrow's leadership style, accusing the mayor of \\"over-promising and under-delivering to the community.\\"Ken Peters. \\"First shots fired in municipal campaign battles\\", Hamilton Spectator, Tuesday, October 22, 1991, B1. Morrow attacked Hinkley for his ties to the New Democrats and his stance on the Red Hill Valley Parkway. Hinkley focused his campaign on the lack of real choice offered to Hamiltonian voters in past elections, even running with the slogan, \\"This time you have a real choice.\\"Ken Peters. \\"Candidate would be a 'working' mayor\\", Hamilton Spectator, Tuesday, October 22, 1991, Metro, B1. Widely critiqued in local media for leading what was known as the \\"Gang of Four\\" New Democratic caucus on council, Hinkley gained a reputation as a strong worker with community-based issues, relating well with constituents and ensuring that Hamilton's marginalized people had a voice at the decision making table. For his part in the race, Michael Baldasaro attempted to repeat his 1988 success, garnering over 7,500 votes against Morrow. Baldasaro announced he would be creating political trading cards for his campaign, though there was no follow-up as to the status of the project. Though he was contesting the mayoral election, a disciple of his Church of the Universe sought election in Ward 6, dividing Baldasro and campaign manager Walter Tucker's attention.Ken Peters. \\"Pot-puffing candidate could be a spoiler\\", Hamilton Spectator, Wednesday, October 23, 1991, Metro, B1. Political newcomer Bill Jones as, at the time, a 30-year-old employee of Dofasco, was less than enthusiastic about his chances, telling the Spectator he did not expect to win, rather make a statement about the state of Hamilton's politics at the time. Jones was not affiliated with any political party, and had not sought elected office before entering the race for mayor. An advocate of more direct democracy, Jones wanted to cut the mayor's salary and put constituent needs ahead of political goals. When asked why he did not seek the open aldermanic seat in Ward 3 where he lived, Jones said that he felt the mayor would have more say.Ken Peters. \\"Steelworker banking on blue-collar image\\", Hamilton Spectator, Thursday, October 24, 1991, Metro, B1.

It is the only known member of its genus. It is a popular aquarium fish. Description The ornate rainbowfish is a small, slender and rather elongated species of rainbowfish. It has two dorsal fins that are only narrowly separated, and the first dorsal fin is considerably smaller than the second. There are 3 to 5 thin, soft spines in the first dorsal fin while the second dorsal fin has 11‚Äì15 segmented rays. This species is highly variable in colour over its range. The body is semi-transparent, and they have two rows of black scales along the middle of their flanks. They have iridescent scales above the lateral line and just below the dorsal fin, and these can be either red or a metallic light blue. The dorsal, anal and caudal fins are normally blue, although are sometimes red, and have black edges. The semi-transparent body may have hues of blue, pink or red with the dark edges of the scales creating a network-like pattern and the two mid-lateral dark stripes described above. They have neon blue iridescent patches on their backs and on the nape. An example of the geographic variation in colour is that a golden-yellow morph is found in the Key Hole Lakes system on Stradbroke Island, while another population on that island had distinctive black stripes on the flanks which created an overall dark colouration. The males of this species grows to a length of Standard Length, the females to . Distribution The ornate rainbowfish is found in subtropical freshwaters in southern Queensland and northern New South Wales. Its range is coastal areas to the east of the Great Dividing Range from near Maryborough to Coffs Harbour. The species distribution extends to sandy islands of southern Queensland including Bribie, Fraser, Moreton and North Stradbroke Islands. On the mainland its distribution is continuous in the southern part of its range but there is a disjunct population in the Byfield area which is separated from the southern population by . Habitat and biology Ornate rainbowfish inhabit freshwater creeks, streams, ponds and dune lakes in the coastal dune habitat locally known as wallum. Their typical habitat is sandy coastal areas where they are found in sluggish, acid waters stained with tannins from vegetation falling into the water where there is woody debris in the water, grassy banks, and thick submerged and emergent vegetation. In these habitats the ornate rainbowfish prefers to be in cover among submerged woody debris, in grassy banks and reeds; and within waterlily roots. It has also been recorded in clear streams with a slow current and little or no vegetation in gallery forests. This species can tolerate very soft waters and is known to live in water as acidic as orange juice. This species congregates in small schools, especially where the habitat is clear, slow, shady streams over sands. These may be mixed schools with Nannoperca oxleyana and Pseudomugil mellis. This omnivorous species feeds mainly from the surface, and its diet consists of crustaceans, aquatic and terrestrial insects, pollen, algae and organic detritus. It is sexually dimorphic; the males are more brightly-coloured than the females with an elongated second ray in the second dorsal fin and an elongated anal fin. When breeding, the males develop a red nuptial stripe which runs from the snout to the second dorsal fin. The males are territorial and defend their territories from other males. Over a period of several days, the females lay eggs which stick to aquatic plants by an adhesive thread on the outside of each egg. The larvae hatch after a week to ten days. In the aquarium they reach sexual maturity between 9‚Äì12 months old and may have a lifespan of up to 4 years. The spawning season runs from November to January. Conservation The ornate rainbowfish is divided into four genetically distinct populations: the northern mainland population which occurs from Byfield south to Tin Can Bay and Fraser Island in Queensland; the Searys Creek population in the area of Rainbow Beach; a population which occurs from the Noosa River in Queensland south to Brunswick River which includes the subpopulations on Moreton, Bribie and Stradbroke Islands; and a fourth in northern New South Wales south of the Brunswick River. These populations are also fragmented within their own geographic areas, and they are threatened by the invasive Eastern mosquitofish Gambusia holbrooki. Other threats include land clearance, habitat degradation and urbanisation. This species conservation status has not been evaluated by the IUCN. The distribution of the ornate rainbowfish has contracted as a result of urban and rural development, this contraction being exacerbated by the subsequent alterations to hydrology and to the water quality. These factors continue to have negative impacts on populations of this species in a number of localities. Extensive sampling of rivers and streams in mainland south-east Queensland under the auspices of Wildlife Preservation Society of Queensland in the years leading up to 2014 discovered relatively few individual ornate rainbowfish. Due to ecology and geographic distribution of this species, each time a subpopulation is lost it is likely a unique genetic lineage may be being lost too. However, new subpopulations were still being discovered. Taxonomy and etymology The ornate rainbowfish was described by Charles Tate Regan in 1914 from types collected on Moreton Island. The generic name is a compound noun consisting of the Greek for \\"slender\\", rhadinos, and for spine, centron, a reference to the slender and flexible finrays in the dorsal fin. The specific name ornatus is Latin and means \\"decorated\\". Rhadinocentrus ornatus is the only species in the genus Rhadinocentrus. The ornate rainbowfish is very closely associated with the warm and peaty wallum wetland habitats that its range almost exactly corresponds to that habitat type. Each permanent coastal stream within its range appears to have fish with different colouration or patterning. These subpopulations have evolved in isolation over the last ten millennia as the rising sea levels have cut each population off from those in neighbouring coastal streams. As an aquarium fish Rhadinocentrus ornatus is a popular aquarium fish in Australia, having been popular among aquarists who keep the native fish of Australia for many decades, although it appears to be rarely available outside of Australia.

M√©ndez's work mostly focused on engraving for illustrations and other print work generally connected to his political and social activism. His most influential work was connected to organizations such as the Liga de Escritores y Artistas Revolucionarios and the Taller de Gr√°fica Popular creating propaganda related to the ideals of the Mexican Revolution and against the rise of Fascism in the 1930s. Despite his importance in 20th- century artistic and political circles, M√©ndez was a relatively obscure figure during his life, and remains so afterwards. The reasons for this generally relate to the fact that he believed in working collaboratively and anonymously for the good of society rather than for monetary gain and because the socialist and communist themes of his work fell out of favor with later generations. Despite this, he has received some posthumous recognition with Mexican scholarship considering him to be the successor to graphics artist Jos√© Guadalupe Posada. Life In general there is little written about the artist's personal life as he kept this separate from his career. In addition, there are few published photographs of the artist. M√©ndez was born on June 30, 1902, in Mexico City. His background was poor as one of eight children born to a father who was a shoemaker and a mother who was a farm worker of Nahua indigenous background from the State of Mexico. His father's side of the family was politically active. His paternal grandfather died fighting the French Intervention in Mexico. His father worked against the Porfirio D√≠az regime on the late 19th and early 20th century. His father and uncles worked as vendors in a mining town called El Oro until the political strongmen of the area forced them to leave, burning down their store. However, both his parents had died before M√©ndez was two years old. During his childhood he lived at his father's house, his grandmother's house and his Aunt Manuela's house, but was primarily raised by his aunt. M√©ndez says that he was told that he was ill- tempered and picked fights, especially with his brothers. As a child, he was the family gofer, as well a chaperone for his older sisters, which allowed him to see his neighbors struggling to make a living. Later he used these experiences in his art. He would also be strongly influenced by the Mexican Revolution, as the Decena Tr√°gica happening when he was only ten years old. His interest in drawing began in primary school. He competed with another boy in his class as to who could draw better, with the topic being battleships. He also drew portraits of Venustiano Carranza both at school and at home, which was the topic of his first piece of artwork to be sold. Directly out of primary school, he entered the Academy of San Carlos in Mexico City. His teachers included Saturninio Herr√°n, Germ√°n Gedovius, Ignacio Rosas, Francisco de la Torre and Leandro Izaguirre. After three years at the academy, he left to attend the new Escuela de Pintura al Aire Libre opened by Alfredo Ramos Martinez in the Chimalistac area in the south of Mexico City. One complaint he had about both schools was that he was never permitted to paint movement, only stationary objects and landscapes without people or animals. He learned to draw movement illustrating periodicals, which he did to earn money to live on. He developed strong political leanings which influenced not only his art but other aspects of his life. They led to friendships with artists and writers such as with Manuel Maples Arce, Germ√°n Cueto, Arqueles Vela, Ferm√≠n Revueltas S√°nchez, Ram√≥n Alva del Canal, Germ√°n List Arzubide and others, forming a group called Los Estridentistas. It also gave him the opportunity to live in work in Xalapa, Veracruz from 1925 to 1927, which was a center of this movement. He stated in an interview with Elena Poniatowska what it was very Bohemian at the time and during this time his politics became more radical, focusing on the ideal of the Mexican Revolution, especially Emiliano Zapata. This coincided with the state government under General Jara, but when he fell out of power, M√©ndez moved back to Mexico City and joined the Mexican Communist Party . His time here and other parts of rural Mexico gave him an appreciation of the country's handcraft and folk art tradition, making him a collector during his life. Much of his life and work was dedicated to promoting leftist political causes, remaining faithful to the political beliefs of his youth in post-Revolution Mexico to a large degree. In 1930, he founded the Lucha Intellectual Proletaria and traveled to the United States to give presentations. In 1939, he received a Guggenheim Fellowship and moved to New York where he continued to associate with workers‚Äô groups. One of these beliefs was that artists should work for the people and therefore, his financial situation was always modest. His role in the political activities of many artists and writers of his time was large but he tended to claim little individual credit and to stay in the background. In 1940s, he was under arrest for a few days after David Alfaro Siqueiros and his group assaulted Leon Trotsky‚Äôs house in Coyoac√°n, kidnapping and killing his secretary. The reason for this was that the attackers left ‚Äúevidence‚Äù to frame the Taller de Gr√°fica Popular. However, M√©ndez was released with no charges. In 1946, he left the Mexican Communist Party, founding the Partido Popular in 1947. He and was a candidate for district representative in Mexico City with this party in the 1953. In 1958, he left the Partido Popular and supported Adolfo L√≥pez Mateos for president. His political efforts went international starting in the 1940s traveling to the USSR in 1953. After World War II, he focused on issues related to world peace. These efforts gained him the International Peace Prize from the World Council of Peace in Vienna in 1952. M√©ndez continued to work in both art and politics until February 1969 when he fell ill and died while working on a book dedicated to Mexican handcrafts and folk art. He left behind one son, Pablo M√©ndez. Career and graphic design M√©ndez's career mixed political activism, painting, art education and book design but is best known for his engraving work, creating over 700 during his lifetime. This engraving work started early for book and magazine illustration. In the 1920s, he began with two publications called Irradiador and Horizonte as part of his involvement with a political and artistic movement called Stridentism . In 1929, he began teaching under the Cultural Missions programs of the Mexican Secretariat of Public Education in Jalisco and the State of Mexico which included contributing to the El Sembrador and El Maestro Rural magazines. Both were aimed at farm communities and served as a sources of materials for teachers, so the use of graphics along with text was considered fundamental because of high illiteracy. In 1942, he published En el nombre de Cristo a series of seven lithographs about barbarism attributed to the Cristeros and the assassination of teachers. M√©ndez's change in political activity often led to a change in the publication he contributed to. For example, in 1946 he left the Mexican Communist Party and joined the Grupo Insurgente Jos√© Carlos Mari√°tegui, initiating collaboration with its official publication called El Insurgente. His first major body of work was created as a founding member of the Liga de Escritores y Artistas Revolucionarios (LEAR) begun in 1933. The group produced works and exhibited together as well as published its own magazine called Frente a Frente. During this period, M√©ndez's work became militant; believing that only art created to promote the interests of the working class had value. This coincided with much of Mexico's politics at the time under L√°zaro C√°rdenas. M√©ndez was able to change style of his prints to account for the materials being used and for his intended audience. However, his work is characterized by a distillation of the images into their essential components for impact. These images included pre-Hispanic, Renaissance and Baroque art of both Europe and Mexico as well as nineteenth century Mexican art and Mexican muralism. He generally focused on secular, rather than religious images as well as popular themes taking after the work of Jos√© Guadalupe Posada. While his work is mostly realistic, it has incorporated imaginative elements from Cubism, Italian Futurism, Russian Constructivism, German Expressionism and Surrealism. One influence generally missing from his work is Russian-style Social realism despite his socialist and communist politics. =Taller de Gr√°fica Popular= However, by 1937, M√©ndez had left LEAR, disappointed with the group's lack of activity. He founded a new group that year called the Taller de Gr√°fica Popular along with Pablo O'Higgins, Alfredo Zalce, Luis Arenal, Ignacio Aguirre, Isidora Ocampo and others. Like LEAR, its function was political solidly to the left but anti-Trotsky and allied with Silvestre Revueltas, David Alfaro Siqueiros, Lombardo Toledano and others. It was a collective work center producing paintings and engravings, creating realistic but simple designs with its more abundant engraving work. They considered artistic development inseparable from political development, mostly working with cultural and political institutions of similar views. It was most active during World War II, producing propaganda against Adolf Hitler and his allies along with that against capitalism and the U.S. M√©ndez was central to the Taller, taking part in all its activities, supervising its production and doing most of the relations work with other organizations, such as unions and art galleries. Despite his importance, by 1959, political differences with the more ardent Communists of the Taller marginalized him and he formally resigned in 1961. =Exhibitions= M√©ndez had limited exhibitions during his career. His first major exhibition was in 1930, when he traveled to Los Angeles as a collaborative effort with Carlos M√©rida. In 1945, he had an individual exhibition at the Art Institute of Chicago, followed by one in 1946 at the Instituto Nacional de Bellas Artes y Literatura. =Publications= M√©ndez's greatest volume of work was produced in the latter 1940s, when he worked compulsively and sold it for very low prices. At this time many American museums and private individuals from the U.S., Mexico and Europe purchased his prints. This has resulted in his work scattered among various collections including those of Carlos Monsiv√°is and the Graphic Arts Institute of Oaxaca, and of various institutions in Chicago, New York, Prague, Moscow and Warsaw, mostly in graphic arts museums. =Murals= M√©ndez worked on two notable murals during his career. In 1946, he created one mural with Pablo O'Higgins called La materidad y la asistencia social located at the Cl√≠nica No. 1 of the Mexican Social Security Institute. He created an engraving mural of Jos√© Guadalupe Posada in 1956. =Political art= His political graphics work waned after 1950 as political art was becoming devalued and his work less collected. However, he had begun to create engravings for the Mexican cinema, with a series for the film R√≠o Escondido by Emilio Fern√°ndez, then others such as Pueblerina (1948), Un d√≠a en la vida (1949), El rebozo de Soledad (1949), Memorias de un mexicano (1950), La rebeli√≥n de los colgados (1953) and La rosa blanca (1959). For the film Macario by Roberto Gavald√≥n, he designed the images of God, death and the Devil. =Fondo Editorial de la Pl√°stica Mexicana= In 1958/1959 M√©ndez left the Taller de la Gr√°fica Popular due to ideological differences and founded a new publishing concern called the Fondo Editorial de la Pl√°stica Mexicana along with Manuel √Ålvarez Bravo, Carlos Pellicer, Rafael Carrillo Azpeitia and Ricardo J. Zevada. The first book published by the organization was La pintura mural de la Revoluci√≥n Mexicana, followed by Los maestros europeo de la Galer√≠a de San Carlos de M√©xico and Jos√© Guadalupe Posada, ilustrador de la vida mexicana. It became a major art book publishing company producing several high-quality books about Mexican art while he directed it. When he died, he was working on a book about Mexican handcrafts and folk art. The last major organization that M√©ndez founded during his lifetime as the Academia de Artes de M√©xico in 1968. Legacy M√©ndez was part of a generation of artists that emerged in the 1920s and played an important role in the culture and politics of Mexico after the Mexican Revolution. However, he has been a relatively obscure figure since during his career for two reasons. One was that he remained faithful to the idea that artists should work collaboratively and anonymously so he did not seek fame like others from his generation did. A second reason is that his socialist ideas, his association with the USSR and Joseph Stalin make him seem less relevant to the generations that followed him. During his lifetime, his only formal recognitions included one of his books, Incidentes mel√≥dicos del mundo irracional, receiving a local prize in 1944, the first Premio Nacional de Grabado in Mexico City in 1946 and the International Prize of Peace as a member of the Taller de la Gr√°fica Popular in 1952. In 1962, the Museo Nacional de Arte Moderno exhibited a retrospective of his work. He was also honored at the Instituto Nacional de Bellas Artes the same year. Since his death, he has received some recognition. Mexican academic research generally ranks him as high as other artists of the 20th century such as Diego Rivera and Jos√© Clemente Orozco, but little documentation of his life exists. In 1971, David Alfaro Siqueiros included a portrait of M√©ndez along with another engraving great Jos√© Guadalupe Posada at his Polyforum Cultural Siqueiros in Mexico City. Another early homage was an exhibition of his work at the Palacio de Bellas Artes in the 1970s. In 2002, on the 100th anniversary of his birth, writer Carlos Monsivais sponsored a conference on M√©ndez's work at the Museo Nacional de Arte (MUNAL). The same museum held a retrospective of his work in 2003. The Taller de la Gr√°fic Popular also organized an exhibition in honor of the 100th anniversary of his birth. In 2012, the Museo de Artes Gr√°ficas in Saltillo held a retrospective of his work. However, there remains no museum dedicated to his work and the only formal catalog was created by the Instituto Nacional de Bellas Artes in 1977. Despite his obscurity, he is generally regarded as one of Mexico's most important graphic artists and one of the most important artists of the first half of the 20th century. Mexican academia also considers him to be the heir of Jos√© Guadalupe Posada, who he admired greatly.

Navigators is open to all genders between ages 4 and 18. Navigators is based on ideas of consensus and allows for multi-age interactions where children can mentor each other. It is open to all regardless of sexual orientation or religious belief. The mission of the Navigators is: History In 2003, Navigators USA was founded by a group of volunteers serving children in need in East Harlem, New York. They wanted to offer a Scouting experience for boys and girls that was non- discriminatory and secular. They felt there was a need for an alternative organization that approached Scouting from a different perspective than the established organizations. Robin Bossert started the Navigators after facing a moral dilemma. The Boy Scouts of America, besides not allowing girls or gay youth, also required that boys believe in a supreme being. Due to these exclusionary practices, Bossert created the alternative Scouting group that would become the Navigators USA. In the fall of 2010 a 188-page Navigators guidebook was completed and the new group became public. Bossert credits the guidebook for an increase in current interest. Not only does the guidebook teach outdoor skills it also has all the information to start Navigators. In 2011, incumbent Mayor of New York City Michael Bloomberg stated at a fund- raiser at Christie's that \\"by belonging to the Navigators, boys and girls get the guidance and adult-supervised adventure that only Scouting can offer‚Äîin an atmosphere free of any stigma about sexual orientation. And as a proud Eagle Scout who has publicly told the Boy Scouts to change their wrong-headed anti- gay policy, I say 'Amen' to that!\\" The first Navigators Chapter in the United Kingdom started in January 2014 in Kingskerswell, Devon. With subsequent groups now also opened up in Cornwall, Devon, Hereford, Kent and Yorkshire and many more either as entire new groups or transferring over from mainstream Scouting Associations.Navigators UK In 2017, Navigators USA won a $9,500 grant for the completion of their Badge Book.

The ETP combined college-level classroom instruction with laboratories involving highly complex electronic systems that were classified Secret, resulting in a level of training reported to have been the most intense and difficult ever given to enlisted servicemen. A highly regarded Naval officer noted that the ETP graduates were in the top three to five percent of the Navy's wartime personnel, officers as well as enlisted men. Background As America entered WWII, there was a crisis concerning the availability of men qualified to maintain the huge amount of complex electronic equipment being procured for Navy's ships, aircraft, submarines, and shore stations. The Navy had over 200,000 personnel, but only a few hundred were radio technicians, most having obtained their qualification through self-study and on-the job training. Further, only a few had any knowledge of radar, the technology that would be extremely important in the war. The Naval Research Laboratory (NRL) was established in 1923 at Bellevue, District of Columbia. At the urging of Albert H. Taylor, head of the NRL Radio Division, an affiliated electronics training operation was added on the campus in 1924. Organizationally under the Training Division of the Bureau of Navigation (BuNav), the Radio Materiel School (RMS) was the Navy's first school in this rapidly developing technology. The Navy's use of radio started in the early 1900s, but equipment using vacuum tubes ‚Äì and thus the electronics era ‚Äì came into being around World War I. During its first decade, the RMS gave two six-month classes per year with about 50 men in each; the graduation rate averaged around 70 percent. Admission involved passing a difficult examination. The instructors were senior Petty officers or Warrant officers. Lectures on up-to-date topics were often given by scientists and engineers from the NRL. As more electronic equipment was added to the Navy, the RMS increased in size and the curriculum was divided into two parts. A primary element of three months covered the mathematics and basic theory, and a five-month Secondary element included some further theory but centered on laboratory work in hardware. Radar was added to the curriculum in 1940, upgrading the instruction to Secret-level Classified information. Chief Radio Electrician Nelson M. Cooke was responsible for the primary element, and Lieutenant Commander Wallace J. Miller was the Officer-in-Charge of the overall RMS. In preparing for war, the BuNav directed that the RMS-Bellevue operation be replicated at a site in the vicinity of San Francisco, California. Miller was responsible for planning the implementation and recommended this to be on Treasure Island in the San Francisco Bay; development of RMS-Treasure Island began at the end of October 1941. This new RMS would accommodate up to 800 personnel in training. In mid-1941, the Bureau of Aeronautics (BuAer), in cooperation with the BuNav, began development of the Aviation RMS (ARMS) to train technicians for airborne equipment maintenance. Located on the campus of the United States Naval Academy in Annapolis, Maryland, this would accommodate up to 500 students. Sidney R. Stock, previously head of a college program in aviation and radio technology was recruited as a Lieutenant Commander to organize the ARMS. Before it had graduated any students, planning began for transferring the ARMS to a more secure location, Ward Island, near Corpus Christi, Texas. The annual output of operations at RMS-Bellevue, RMS-Treasure Island, and ARMS would be a few thousand, but the BuNav estimated that the wartime requirement would be in the tens of thousands. Further, the depth of capability of graduates from the existing instruction was also inadequate. Electronics would have a major role in the next war ‚Äì which was now inevitable ‚Äì but equipment, if not maintained, would be worthless. The NRL and the newly formed Radiation Laboratory, as well as a number of industries, were developing electronic systems that were far above the average maintenance capabilities of existing Navy technicians. This was especially true after late 1940, when Great Britain shared its electronic secrets (including the cavity magnetron) during the Tizard Mission. These shortcomings were a crisis that required an immediate solution. A new approach to electronic training In November 1941, the BuNav set up an ad hoc committee to examine the changing requirements for electronic maintenance personnel and to propose a plan for meeting these requirements. Time was of the essence ‚Äì war was imminent. The committee participants were primarily persons who were already fully knowledgeable of the situation. These included N. M. Cooke from RMS-Bellevue, W. J. Miller from RMS-Treasure Island and Bellevue, and S. R. Stock from the Aviation RMS. There were other practitioners as well as training specialists from the BuNav. On December 8 ‚Äì the day after the attack on Pearl Harbor ‚Äì William C. Eddy, a medically retired (deafness) Lieutenant, joined the committee and quickly became its leader. An authority in the emerging field of television, Eddy had earlier started an electronics school for submariners. A major topic of discussion was the type of technician(s) needed. As the hardware became more and more complex, the maintenance technicians needed broad as well as in-depth knowledge. Navy technicians would also be required to make rapid repairs on combat-critical equipment in locations where assistance from the outside ‚Äì such as technical representatives of industries ‚Äì would not be available. Modular design, where a failure might be corrected by changing out a module, was not yet in use; thus, maintenance required detailed circuit tracing and knowledge of the circuit theory. It was agreed that the ideal situation would be to recruit persons with an electrical engineering (EE) or similar education and put them through the existing five-month advanced segment of the RMS to learn Navy hardware. This approach, however, was not practical; persons with this background were not only very limited in number but also in high demand by industry and the military. The Navy had sent a few men to a recently opened Royal Air Force (RAF) electronics school in a base at Clinton, Canada. This school was somewhat similar to the RMS and had been examined by Stock in planning the ARMS. A major difference was that the primary portion of the RAF school was given by a number of technical colleges throughout Canada. As the committee discussed possibilities of using a similar approach in an upgraded RMS, Eddy suggested that since the first two years of an EE curriculum covered essentially all of the basic topics, a shortened version of this curriculum might be used to produce the desired aforementioned EEs. In a few days, a plan for training the desired technicians evolved. The central elements of this plan were the following: *Like the existing RMS, the training program would have a primary school three months in length followed by a five-month secondary school. *Admission would be through a to-be-developed classification examination for identifying persons with the capability and willingness to pursue the advanced, highly concentrated study. *Primary school would be given by engineering colleges and cover the major topics normally included in the first two years of an EE curricula. *Secondary school would center on Navy electronic hardware, but would include more operational theory and selected advanced topics from upper-level college engineering studies. Conducted at highly secure Navy facilities, instruction would be given by Navy and Marine senior enlisted personnel and Warrant Officers. *To attract the desired students, men passing the classification examine could enter the Navy as Seamen First Class (bypassing the first two levels) and would go through Boot Camp in special companies. *New Petty-officer ratings of Radio Technician (RT) and Aviation Radio Technician (ART) would be opened, with promotion, depending on performance, at various points in the training. Eddy, then director of experimental television station W9XBK in Chicago, volunteered to provide both the space and instructional staff for a prototype primary school. He also volunteered to lead the development of the classification examination ‚Äì thereafter popularly called the Eddy Test. Eddy had returned to Chicago and obtained concurrence from the station owner, Balaban and Katz; they not only approved but also made the space and staff available at no cost to the Navy. The RMS-Bellevue and RMS-Treasure Island would continue in their existing locations and serve as secondary schools for shipboard and land-based electronics. Their existing Primary segment would be phased out as the new primary schools became fully operational. The Aviation RMS, which was just opening and preparing to move to Ward Island, Texas, would serve as the secondary school for airborne electronics. The plan was submitted to BuNav, and was approved by Captain Louis E. Denfeld on 7 January 1942; Denfeld had been appointed only five days earlier to head up all Navy training. The program was initiated on 12 January with the opening of the prototype primary school at the top floor of the State-Lake Theater building in downtown Chicago. Elements of the ETP Other than the designation ‚ÄúRadio (or Electronics) Technician Training,‚Äù no official name appears on records for the overall program; however, Electronics Training Program (ETP) was the commonly used name. Official records sometimes show different names for the two levels of schools: Elementary Electricity & Radio Materiel (EE&RM;) rather than Primary, and Advanced Radio Materiel (ARM) rather than Secondary. Since there was little ‚Äúelementary‚Äù content in the EE&RM; curriculum, these initials were usually taken to mean Electrical Engineering & Radio Materiel. As the local aspects of the ETM unfolded, the effort was designated Naval Training Schools- Radio Chicago, an official Navy unit commanded by Eddy. In a little more than two years after returning to active duty, Eddy was promoted to the rank of captain. =Radio Chicago= When fully operational, Radio Chicago had three major functions: conducting a prototype primary school, grading and maintaining records of Eddy Tests, and handling four Pre-Radio Schools in the Chicago area. It began with offices on the top floor of the State-Lake Theater Building at 190 North State Street, Chicago, then expanded to also occupy all four floors of a nearby building at 64 North State Street. Other functions included operating a teacher training school, building visual aids for classrooms, providing first-level medical services for the thousands of Chicago students and staff, and handling a reception and entertainment center where well-known musician Alvino Rey conducted the Radio Chicago Orchestra. Prototype primary school In the approved plan, Eddy would offer a developmental-prototype primary school with classrooms and laboratories in the experimental television facilities at 190 North State Street. Archibald H. Brolly, chief engineer of W9XBK and graduate of the University of California, Harvard, and MIT, led in developing the initial curriculum and served as the lead instructor. The first class was mainly composed of experienced electrician mates from the fleet and ham radio operators who had recently enlisted as petty-officer radiomen. A main purpose of the prototype school was to ensure that the curriculum in college-operated schools was appropriate preparation for Navy-operated secondary schools. It was intended that the prototype school would be unnecessary after graduating a few classes, but the importance of this activity became such that it continued for the life of the ETP. Initially, all of the instructors were from the W9XBK engineering staff; later, Navy and Marine instructors were added. Eddy Test The Eddy Test was certainly the most widely recognized element of the ETP. Many resumes and biographies of men who were in the WWII Navy make reference to having passed or failed the Eddy Test. This was the commonly used name for the Radio Technician Selection Test (RTST, NavPers 16578), the first version of which was prepared under Eddy's leadership in January 1942. In an article, published after the war in the journal American Psychologist, the following justification was noted for the difficulty of the test: > In such an extensive training program as that for radio technicians which > demands a high degree of concentration and ability, the Navy could ill > afford to spend several months training men who, because of lack of ability, > were unable to complete the training. The Eddy Test was given to men in high schools, colleges, and recruiting centers. It was also given to men entering the Navy or already in the fleet when they scored high on the Otis Higher Examination.The Otis Higher Examination (sometimes called the Otis Test or Otis Measure of Brightness) was taken by essentially all persons entering the U.S. Navy during WWII, and was used in assessing basic capabilities for attending training programs. There was a firm pass-fail criteria for grading the Eddy Test, and a second chance was not allowed; therefore, it was necessary to have a central point for both grading and recording the test results. This was done by a team of WAVES at Radio Chicago. The content of the Eddy Test was tightly controlled ‚Äì no public available copies are known to exist. An estimated 500,000 or more persons took the test during WWII. Pre-Radio School As soon as the prototype primary school began, and later carrying into the primary schools at engineering colleges, it was realized that many of the students being admitted did not have the necessary capabilities or willingness for training of this nature. In late 1942, BuPers* directed that a one-month Pre-Radio School be added to the ETP. Through this, weeding in addition to the Eddy Test would result, and special preparation could also be received. (*) The Bureau of Navigation (BuNav) was renamed Bureau of Naval Personnel (BuPers ‚Äì later BUPERS) in May 1942. An initial Pre-Radio School was temporarily set up at the Chicago Naval Reserve Armory. During early 1943, as the need for this activity increased, the initial school was moved to nearby Michigan City, Indiana, and three facilities were leased from the Chicago Board of Education. For two years, the following Pre-Radio Schools were operated by Radio Chicago: *Wilbur Wright Junior College, Chicago *Theodore Herzl Junior College, Chicago *Hugh Manley High School, Chicago *Naval Reserve Armory, Michigan City, Indiana Each of these Pre-Radio Schools had up to 1000 students at any given time. One study found that the average person completing Pre-Radio had 1.5 years of prior college and scored in the top two percent of intelligence quotient in the Nation. In a four-week curriculum, Pre-Radio included a lightning-speed review of high school mathematics (through second-level algebra), physics (mainly electricity and magnetism), and elementary chemistry. Eddy, Brolly, and other instructors at the prototype primary school wrote a book to assist students in this effort. Each entering student was issued a Cooke Slide Rule, and these were used from the first day.Radio Slide Rule, designed by Nelson M. Cooke for the RMS and sold commercially by Keuffel and Esser. Much attention was given to electrical components, their standards, and graphic symbols. There was also hands-on work with electrical instruments and in shop practices. Lack of speed and accuracy in using the slide rule, instruments, and shop tools was often the downfall of otherwise capable students. Instructors in the Pre-Radio Schools were Navy Petty Officers or Marine Sergeants, many who were former high-school teachers. Classroom lectures, laboratory work, and organized problem sessions were conducted 13 hours or more every weekday. A comprehensive examination was given on Saturday mornings, and a failing grade on a topic could result in dismissal; repeating a week was normally not allowed. The intensity led to many voluntary dropouts. Overall, the graduation rate from Pre-Radio Schools was around 40 percent. =Primary school= As the ETP was being planned by the ad hoc committee, a primary school patterned after the Primary Segment at NRL-Bellevue was considered; Cooke, who had been a key figure in the NRL activity, was the major proponent of this option. Other committee members felt that students for the secondary school should be recruited from persons who had already completed a degree, or at least had two years of study in electrical engineering, and could bypass the Primary altogether. A compromise was reached by Eddy's proposing a primary school taught in electrical engineering schools and compressing the major topics of the first two years of a normal curriculum into three months. Eddy would lead a prototype primary school (previously described as a part or Radio Chicago) that would ensure the curriculum in college-operated schools to be appropriate preparation for Navy-operated secondary school. The top-performing Navy graduates of primary school usually received a promotion to petty-officer 3rd class radio technician. College- operated primary school Colleges and universities with electrical engineering programs were invited by BuNav to a meeting on contracting for the primary schools. The mid-January meeting was held in New Orleans; specifications were given, and those interested were given one week to submit full proposals. After very speedy evaluations and visits to the campuses, contracts, over Captain Denfeld's signature, were awarded to six schools: *Bliss Electrical School (see History, Montgomery College) *Grove City College (see History) *Oklahoma A&M; College (see History, Oklahoma State University) *the Agricultural & Mechanical College of Texas (see History, Texas A&M; University) *Utah State College of Agriculture (see History, Utah State University) *University of Houston (see History) Primary school was started at all six schools during March 1942. An article in the November 1942 issue of QST gives a description, including pictures, of the primary school at each of these institutions. Bliss Electrical School was the only privately owned, for- profit institute in this group. Founded in 1893, it was absorbed by Montgomery College in 1950. The contracts called for starting every month a new class of 100 students for three months of instruction. The schools would provide the instructors, classrooms, laboratories, dormitories, food services, and health and recreational facilities. Textbooks, classroom supplies, and an engineering slide rule (usually a K&E; Log-Log Duplex Decitrig) were also supplied. (The slide rule in its holder strapped on the belt was a standard part of students‚Äô uniform of the day.) The contracts required the schools to provide all of this under a flat-rate per student-month. A complement of about 10 Navy and Marine officers and enlisted men, under an officer-in-charge (usually a lieutenant or lieutenant commander), handled the administration and military activities. Two members of the original ad hoc committee received such assignments: William Grogan, raised in rank to lieutenant commander, went to Grove City, and Sidney Stock returned to Utah State. At other schools, the officer-in-charge was often a faculty member with a reserve commission who had returned to active duty. A senior faculty member from each school was assigned to have overall instructional responsibility. A basic list of topics to be covered was prescribed, but it was up to the schools to develop this into a three-month instructional program. Mandatory topics included the following: advanced d-c and a-c circuit theory, electrical motors and generators, vacuum-tube characteristics, power supplies, amplifiers, oscillators, modulation techniques, filters and wave-shaping, receiver circuits, transmitter circuits, transmission lines and antennas, and basic electromagnetic propagation theory.Attachment to contracts signed by Captain Louis E. Denfeld, dated Feb. 2, 1942, between the U.S. Navy Bureau of Navigation and six colleges for conducting EE&RM; schools Mathematical topics (mainly trigonometry and elementary calculus) were taken up when necessary for developing theoretical equations. Each student built a superheterodyne receiver, and fault-finding was taught using systematic signal-tracing. Eight hours per weekday were devoted to lectures and laboratories, and there were at least four hours of homework or supervised study in the evenings; athletics and some drill were fitted in wherever possible. Saturday mornings were devoted to examinations on the topics of the previous week. The repeat of a week was not allowed except under extenuating circumstances. Before the addition of Pre-Radio School, the graduation rate was unacceptably low; later, it averaged about 80 percent. In 1943, the incoming class size was increased to 110, and a new class started every two weeks. Collectively, the primary schools were then graduating about 1,000 men per month. As the war continued, men trained in the ETP secondary schools were being rotated out of the fleet and overseas bases. Some of these, particularly those with prior teaching experience, were assigned at colleges to augment the regular faculties. These men brought a new perspective to the instructional program, giving the students a picture of things to come. They officially reported to the Officer-in-Charge, but, as teachers, were under the civilian Director of Instruction. Navy-operated primary school Both RMS-Bellevue and RMS-Treasure Island temporarily operated primary schools, but these were phased out for enlargements of the secondary school ‚Äì at Treasure Island in June 1942, and at Bellevue in December 1943. The Airborne secondary school at Ward Island opened in July 1942, and then went into a series of expansions. By the end of 1943, these secondary schools were essentially full and the BuPers ordered the opening of a fourth secondary school, the largest of them all, at Navy Pier in Chicago. The college-operated primary schools could no longer meet the secondary school needs; therefore, additional primary schools under Navy operation were begun in late 1943. These were set up as full Navy bases. A reservoir of military personnel trained in the ETP was now available, so all of the instruction was by Petty Officers or Marine Sergeants. In addition to the primary school at RMS-Bellevue, and the one briefly operated at RMS-Treasure Island, Navy-operated primary schools were established at five locations: *College of the Ozarks ‚Äì a small liberal arts school in Clarksville, Arkansas *Del Monte Hotel ‚Äì a huge complex in Monterey, California *Naval Training Center, Gulfport, Mississippi *Naval Training Center, Great Lakes, Illinois *Ford Motor's River Rouge plant in Dearborn, Michigan. The Navy leased the facilities of the College of the Ozarks (now University of the Ozarks) in January 1944, moving to there the primary school previously at RMS-Bellevue. The Ozarks school operated to May 1945, giving training to an estimated total of 3,000 students. The Del Monte Hotel (now the location of the Naval Postgraduate School) was leased in February 1943 for conducting a large Pre-Flight Training School. A year later, this was changed to an ETP primary school, which continued in operation until June 1947, serving about 6,000 students, the most of any of the primary schools. In 1942, the Navy opened a large base at Gulfport, Mississippi, primarily for servicing the Naval Construction Battalion (Seabees). In March 1944, the base was converted to the U.S. Naval Training Center, Gulfport; training courses for several ratings were provided, including an ETP primary school. This primary school continued until March 1946, handling an estimated 2,500 men. Naval Station Great Lakes opened in 1911, and continuously since then has been the largest training base in the Navy. An ETP primary school was opened in early 1945. Most trainees then took Boot Camp at Great Lakes, went to Chicago for Pre-Radio, returned to Great Lakes for Primary, then went back to Chicago's Navy Pier for Secondary. An estimated 1,200 men at a time were in the ETP at Great Lakes for the next year. The River Rouge Complex of Ford Motor Company was the world's most famous industrial plant. As WWII approached, Ford offered its training capabilities to the Navy, and in January 1941, the Naval Service Training School at the Rouge Complex was opened. From then until it closed in May 1946, 22,000 men had been trained in a number of different areas. In early 1945, BuPers added a Pre-Radio and primary school at the Training Complex. This had not been fully activated before the end of the war, and, after graduating only a few classes, was closed in May 1946. =Secondary school= The secondary school in the ETP was an outgrowth of the Secondary segment of the RMS-Bellevue. The ETP secondary school initially retained the same five- month length and with the same basic curriculum, but the topics were presented at a higher level, taking into account the better preparation of the entering students. The schools were located as follows: *Advanced Radio Materiel, Naval Research Laboratory, Bellevue, D.C. *Advanced Radio Materiel, Treasure Island, San Francisco Bay, California *Advanced Radio Materiel, Navy Pier, Chicago, Illinois *Naval Air Technical Training Center, Ward Island, Texas. The three Advanced Radio Materiel (ARM) secondary schools were devoted to shipboard and shore-based electronic equipment, while the NATTC School was devoted to electronic equipment carried on airplanes and anti-submarine blimps. Much of the equipment studied was classified as Secret; therefore, physical security was a major factor in selecting school locations, and the instructional compounds were all under 24-hour guard by armed Marines. All U.S. students were required to be cleared for classified information; similarly, foreign students were cleared through respective State Departments under bilateral security agreements. In classroom and laboratory sessions, students were required to take notes, but these were placed in security cabinets at the close of the study day. Instructional topics were given in week-long sessions, with 8-hour study days averaging about equal time between lectures and laboratories. During evening study, most students developed a notebook on the fundamental, unclassified information. An examination was given each Saturday morning; these examinations were prepared and graded by a separate staff. A repeat of one week (more under extenuating circumstances) was allowed. With the filtering of pre-radio and primary, only very capable students made it into secondary school. If they had not been earlier promoted when finishing primary school, students were allowed to stand an examination for Petty- officer 3rd class Radio Technician after satisfactorily completing several months in secondary school. The graduate rate of secondary school was high, likely between 90 and 95 percent. Top-performing Navy graduates were promoted to Petty-officer 2nd or even 1st class Radio Technician; this rating was changed to Electronics Technician Mate (ETM) or Aviation Electronics Technician Mate (AETM) in 1945. It has been noted that about 25 percent of the ETP graduates during the war were promoted to the rank of Warrant or Commissioned Officer. Advanced Radio Materiel While mainly intended for Navy enlisted men, the ARM schools also had students from the Marine Corps and Coast Guard, a few civilians (mainly NRL employees), some military men from Great Britain and its Commonwealth Nations, and, occasionally, a company of Navy commissioned officers, including WAVES. When commissioned officers were in a course taught by an enlisted man, the Officer-in-Charge initiated the instruction by stating that the instructor had the authority of a superior officer. The basic curriculum of the ARM secondary school was carefully coordinated for uniformity, but some differences existed in the specific hardware studied at the three bases. The eight-hour school day consisted of about equal time in classrooms and laboratories, with lectures dominating in the beginning months and becoming more ‚Äúhands-on‚Äù later. BuPers convened a conference on the ETP in December 1943, at which time the secondary school was increased from 5 months to 24 weeks with new topics added (especially sonar). (This same conference defined Pre-Radio to be 4 weeks and Primary to be 12 weeks.) The ARM secondary school began with a brief review of electronic components, circuits, and basic laboratory instruments. As the courses evolved, they eventually included the following topics: high-frequency and ultra-high-frequency receiver and transmitter principles; coaxial cable, waveguides, antenna arrays, and beam forming; synchros and plan position indicators; radio direction-finding; pulse-generation and wave-shaping methods; basic radar theory; microwave theory and cavity magnetrons; radar jamming and countermeasures; identification friend or foe techniques; long- range navigation and hyperbolic navigation techniques; and sonar theory and underwater acoustics. Laboratories included the use of all types of electronic test equipment. Operational measurements and repair methods involved HF and VHF communication receivers and transmitters, air-search and fire-control radars, low-frequency LORAN receivers and transmitters, and sonar systems. Considerable time, particularly in the later months, was devoted to trouble- shooting. =ARM Bellevue= The RMS facilities on the NRL campus had been considerably expanded in the years immediately preceding the war; by early 1941, the entering class had increased to 135 men. After the start of the war and the initiation of the ETP, a new class began every two months. In August 1942, Wallace Miller was increased in rank to commander, and made officer-in- charge. At the same time, Nelson Cooke was commissioned a Lieutenant (jg) and named officer-in-charge of the remaining primary school. When the primary school at Bellevue was transferred to the College of the Ozarks in January 1944, Cooke was increased in rank to Lieutenant (later Lieutenant Commander) and named the executive officer of ARM Bellevue. The student complement increased to about 1,200 men, mainly Navy but with about 15 percent Marines. The course length eventually increased to 28 weeks with a new class every two weeks, resulting in a peak in 1945 of close to 2,400 men attending. At the end of 1946, ARM Bellevue closed with the training being taken up at Great Lakes; this marked the end of the Radio Materiel School that had operated for 22 years. Since the start of WWII and the ETP, the school had graduated an estimated 8,000 men. =ARM Treasure Island= In October 1941, BuNav authorized a school to be established on Treasure Island, the site of the 1939‚Äì1940 Golden Gate International Exposition. The curriculum basically replicated that existing at RMS-Bellevue, but with a much larger student body. When the ETP was formed the following January, this became the ARM Treasure Island, and for a brief period included a primary school. Commander Harry F. Breckel was the first commanding officer (he was promoted to the rank of Captain in early 1944). The first class of 566 students was about 25 percent Hams, entering as Radioman Petty Officer Second Class. Special placement examinations divided the class into different levels, allowing the first graduation in only a few months; many of the early graduates immediately became instructors. The radar laboratories were on close by, highly secure Yerba Buena Island, and ARM Treasure Island had the lead in developing sonar lectures and laboratories. This school graduated about 10,000 technicians under the wartime curriculum, the last in June 1946. It remained a peacetime Navy advanced electronics ‚ÄúC‚Äù School until 1996. =ARM Navy Pier= Originally opened in 1916 as a shipping and recreational facility, Navy Pier in Chicago extended 3,300 feet into Lake Michigan. In August 1941, Navy Pier was taken over and converted to a major Naval Training School. It was renovated to accommodate a large number of service personnel, primarily for mechanical ratings. Near the end of 1943, BuPers directed that most of this be converted to a fourth secondary school. After extensive renovations, including building 100 new classrooms, the first class began in early June 1944. Captain Edwin A. Wolleson was the commanding officer, and Commander Charles C. Caveny served as the educational officer. Two new classes started weekly, each with up to 120 students; this gave a complement of near 6,000 men, making it the largest school in the ETP. ARM Navy Pier closed in mid-1946. An estimated 18,000 men completed secondary school at Navy Pier, a significant portion of whom came to the school directly from the fleet, rather than through primary school. NATTC Ward Island When the ETP was being developed, the BuAer agreed that the Aviation RMS just getting underway in Annapolis, Maryland, would be moved to a more secure and larger facility. Ward Island, a small, uninhabited island a short distance from the newly opened Naval Air Station Corpus Christi, was selected. In a crash effort, the facilities were ready for the first class at the beginning of July 1942. Commander (later Captain) George K. Stoddard had been brought from retirement to oversee the Ward Island development, and then remained as the commanding officer. Lieutenant Commander Stock, who had started the school in Annapolis, served as the initial superintendent of training. In September, the school was designated the Naval Air Technical Training Center Ward Island (NATTC Ward Island), serving as the aviation secondary school in the ETP. Initially, Navy enlisted graduates received a petty-officer rating of aviation radio technician (ART); this was changed to aviation electronics technician mate (AETM) in 1945. Within a short time after opening, a new class of 200 trainees arrived every two weeks. Initially 20 weeks in length, the course increased to 24 weeks in early 1943, then to 28 weeks and a new class each week by mid-1944. In July 1943, cognizance of this school was moved from the BuAer to BuPers. The official name of the school was changed to Airborne Electronics Maintenance in May 1944.A course for supply officers was started during 1943, and a similar course for WAVES followed. In addition to Navy and Marine enlisted men, there were students from the U.S. Coast Guard, the Royal Air Force, the Canadian Royal Air Force, and some from Australia and Brazil. The number of students peaked during 1944 at about 3,100.Stoddard, op. cit. The curriculum at Ward Island had many of the same topics at the three ARM secondary schools, but with a number of notable differences. The Navy's airborne equipment was physically much smaller than shipboard and land-based electronics, and had to use the power generated by the carrying vehicle. Also, it was often designed to be operated by either the aircraft pilot or a crew member who had other primary duties; thus, it was necessarily easier to adjust ‚Äì often including automatic tuning; therefore, lecture instruction included topics to support these requirements. Most airborne radios operated in VHF bands, and the associated antennas and their placement were important topics. Microwave radar, which required less physical space than its VHF predecessor, soon became the dominant feature in airborne applications; this required considerable attention be given to dish antennas and their mechanical drives. Sonar was not included, but there was more attention given to recognition (IFF), direction-finding, and LORAN radio-navigation systems. There were also special courses on subjects such as the Norden bombsight, the magnetic anomaly detector (MAD), and the Target Drone Denny (TDD-1). One of the laboratories was in a hangar that contained several aircraft for ground-testing of electronic equipment. NATTC Ward Island also had a small fleet of aircraft of various types that operated from nearby NAS Corpus Christi; every student was required to have flight time in operating the on-board equipment. During the war years, an estimated 10,000 persons received ETP training at NATTC Ward Island. In addition, a similar number were involved in refresher and special courses, and in training of non-U.S. military personnel. Related schools Several other advanced schools for electronic maintenance were operated by the Navy during WWII. For graduates of the ARM secondary schools who volunteered for submarine service, there was advanced maintenance training in radar, sonar, and other electronic equipment at the Submarine School, Submarine Base, New London, Connecticut. The New London school also had courses for Officers; this training activity was initially started by Lieutenant William C. Eddy in the early 1930s. For upgrading technicians already in fleet service, there were radar schools at the Naval Air Station, San Diego, California, and the Naval Operating Base, Norfolk, Virginia. The San Diego school was the Airborne Radar School, Fleet Air West Coast. Two schools were at Norfolk: the Radar Materiel School on the Main Base, and the Fleet Service School at nearby Virginia Beach, Virginia. At Pearl Harbor Naval Base, there was a Fleet Service School that gave a three-month radar maintenance course. The Radar School for Navy Officers was at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT). For persons holding an electrical engineering degree, this school gave two months of classroom instruction, followed by three months of laboratory work on hardware. For other non-EE persons, there was a five-month Pre-Radar School at Harvard University; this had a curriculum very similar to the ETP Pre-Radar and primary schools. The first published book on radar was prepared by the staff of the MIT Radar School. ETP Closure Shortly after the victory in Europe on 8 May 1945 (V-E Day), the remaining college-based primary schools were closed, as well as the Navy-Operated school at the College of the Ozarks. With the surrender of Japan on 2 September 1945 (V-J Day), the entire ETP began a transition to peacetime, regular Navy operation. By the end of the year, Radio Chicago was closed; this included the State-Street primary school and all of Pre-Radio Schools (review topics and the slide-rule were added to the curriculum of the remaining primary schools). The primary school at Gulfport closed in March 1946, and the base was decommissioned. Del Monte, the last stand-alone primary school, continued until June 1947. In June 1946, ARM Navy Pier was also transferred to Great Lakes, and ARM Bellevue followed at the end of the year. These were combined and eventually evolved into an Electronics Technician ‚ÄúA‚Äù School. ARM Treasure Island, fed by students from Great Lakes and, for a while, from Del Monte, continued as a secondary school; this later evolved into an Advanced Electronics ‚ÄúC‚Äù School. In mid-1946, NAATC Ward Island added its own primary school; then in October 1947, all of the activities were transferred to NATTC Memphis (actually at Millington, Tennessee) and Ward Island was decommissioned. Captain Eddy received a Legion of Merit in December 1945, recognizing his contributions in the ‚Äúrecruiting, selection, and training of radio technicians.‚Äù In the citation, it is noted that through 1945, some 30,000 technicians completed the full Electronic Training Program. The Eddy Test (RTST 16578) continued to be used by the Navy for several years in the selection of trainees for electronics schools. In 1951, the Bureau of Naval Personnel contracted with Columbia University to develop a new Electronic Technician Selection Test (ETST). This was specified to be ‚Äúsomewhat less difficult than the RTST, with a maximum discrimination at or near the seventy-fifth percentage of the general high school population.‚Äù Notes Footnotes References        * Further reading  This includes short descriptions of electronic maintenance training in several other countries.
